perhaps, in feeling

you are more like who

a new type of
keratin-based tissue.

85
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,752
It looks like spikes

86
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:14,787
Does that sound right?

87
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,057
I would not know.

88
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:24,529

00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:34,906
with certainty
what these changes mean.

94
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,608
But if I had to guess,

95
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,978
Id say your fear responses
are being repressed.

TYLER:
Its Section 31s position

104
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,915
that if the entity
were calling the Red Angel

105
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:17,582
is in fact generating
these signals,

106
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,720
its also capable
of time incursions.

107
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:23,588
And should be
considered dangerous.

108
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:25,524
So far, these signals
have led the

109

111
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,860
Or two catastrophic events.

112
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:30,762
Does the Angel merely appear
at these crisis points,

113
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,865
or is it creating them?

114
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,766
We have to consider
both options.

115
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,468
So lets consider.

116
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,072
The Red Angel appeared on Earth
and transported people

117
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,641
to Terralysium
only moments before

118
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,909
they would have died
in a nuclear blast.

119
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:45,644
It also guided Spock
to rescue me when I was

120
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:47,480
a child on Vulcan.

121
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:47,480

from Spocks time
in the psychiatric unit.

123
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:52,819
Look, can either of you
say for sure

124
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:54,887
this thing didnt cause
his nervous breakdown?

125
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,656
Spock made no mention
of the Red Angel

126
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,624
when he asked for leave
from the

128
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,892
But Agent Tylers
correct, Captain.

129
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,627
With so few data points,
it is impossible

130
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:06,499
to draw conclusions based
on its nature and motivations.

131

We need more
information.

132
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,468
What we need is Spock.

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,978
Spock might have gone?

138
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,848
Someplace we might not

00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,250
The USS

166
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,250
<i>Archimedes</i>

167
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,250
made
first contact with them

168
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:14,253
after receiving
a transmission from Kaminar.

169
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,187
But once communication
was established,

170
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:17,756
the Baul High Council
proved hostile.

171
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:19,158
TYLER:
So why did the Baul send

172
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,993
a transmission
in the first place?

173
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,161
They...

174
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:24,163
did not.

175
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,933
That transmission was from me.

176
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,336
<i>I coopted
the Bauls technology</i>

177
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,739
<i>in order to send a message,
with the hope</i>

178
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,642
that someone, somewhere,
would receive it.

179
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,844
And that someone
was Captain Georgiou.

180
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,080
<i>SARU:
She was a lieutenant then,</i>

181
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,950
<i>serving on the</i>

182
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,950
Archimedes.

183
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:45,817
<i>Were it not for her,
I would have been unable</i>

184
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,054
<i>to flee Kaminar
or be granted asylum.</i>

185
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:53,359
I promised never to return.

186
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,361
That was the price of knowledge.

187
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:58,331
PIKE:
And now,
of the billions of planets

188
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,332
in our galaxy, the
signal just happens

189
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:04,169
to show up above the homeworld
of my first officer.

190
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:07,306
What are the odds?

191
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:07,306
It certainly isnt random.

192
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,308
<i>Discoverys</i>

193
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,308
taken a serious
interest in the Red Angel.

194
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:11,844
Could be
its returning the favor.

195
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,778
TYLER:
Thats a leap.
Commander Saru,

196
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:16,081
are there angels
of any sort in Kelpien culture?

197
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,317
Kelpiens believe only
in the Great Balance,

198
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:21,253
which, if upset, would devastate

199
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,090
the fragile ecosystem
of our planet.

200
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:29,361
And we are taught that the Baul
are the keepers of this balance.

201
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:32,197
Do the Kelpiens worship
the Baul?

202
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,201
It is their superior technology,
of which Kelpiens live in awe,

203
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,037
that allows the Baul mastery
over my people.

204
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,105
They hide behind it.

205
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,075
No Kelpien has even seen
a Baul in living memory.

206
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,943
BURNHAM:
It is the same technology

207
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:47,078
they use to keep
Starfleet at arms length.

208
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,248
So we shouldnt expect
a warm welcome.

209
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,116
The Baul are, by nature,
isolationist.

210
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,985
And theyre committed
to preserving

211
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,354
the status quo on Kaminar.

212
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,354
TYLER:
Well, they must have seen

213
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,323
the signal, too.

214
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,323
Maybe they wouldnt mind an
offer to share information.

215
00:10:58,356 --> 00:10:59,557
Depending on
how theyre approached.

216
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:02,394
Well, lets knock on the front
door and see if they answer.

217
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:05,264
And then what? Just ask nicely?

218
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:09,100
Well, as unexpected guests,
it never hurts to be polite.

219
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,441
(indistinct chatter)

220
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:18,144
MAN:
Prepare to disengage
warp power.

221
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,779
DETMER:
Sir, stopping out of
warp above Kaminar.

222
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,888
The signal disappeared

223
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,355
before we arrived.

224
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,923
What else is new?

225
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:34,293
Mr. Bryce, hail the Baul
on all channels.

226
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,296
Commander Burnham, run planetary
and full-spectrum scans

227
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:39,164
on anything resembling
our elusive angel.

228
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:41,299
And any power source capable
of generating these signals.

229
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:43,068
The Baul are not
responding, sir.

230
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:45,171
Thats not entirely true, sir.

231
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:47,505
Theyre scanning
our weapons systems.

232
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:49,908
Just our weapons systems.

233
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,845
So much for knocking
on the front door.

234
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,845
PIKE: Maybe the Baul just

235
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,480
havent learned the importance
of a good first impression.

236
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,048
Burnham?

237
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,048
I see no indication
the Red Angel was here.

238
00:11:57,082 --> 00:12:00,186
Or any immediate danger
to the planet.

239
00:11:57,082 --> 00:12:00,186
Then why are we here? Anybody?

240
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,187
Youre assuming the signals
only appear for a reason.

241
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,190
Yes, Mr. Tyler, thats
exactly what Im assuming.

242
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:06,826
Why wont the Baul respond?

243
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:06,826
SARU:
Perhaps,

244
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,928
as I have said, it is
because they are oppressors.

245
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:12,264
And even had the Baul
answered our hails,

246
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,799
why would you trust those
who have enslaved my people

247
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,402
for centuries
with fear and lies?

248
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:20,105
PIKE:
Your insights
are invaluable,

249
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,807
Mr. Saru.

250
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,408
But the signal appeared here.

251
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,344
And maybe the Red Angel, too.

252
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:27,379
If you have any idea how I could
make inquiries without...

253
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,380
There is a Kelpien priest
in every village.

254
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:31,549
Priests not only serve
as intermediaries

255
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,385
between us and the Baul,
but they also connect

256
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:37,255
all of our extended
communities together.

257
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:38,923
So if the Red Angel
appeared on Kaminar,

258
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:41,159
then a priest might be able
to tell us about it.

259
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:43,229
Wouldnt that be a violation
of General Order 1?

260
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:43,229
BURNHAM: Though the Kelpiens

261
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:45,197
arent warp capable, theyve
seen warp-capable technology

262
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,365
through the Baul,

263
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,834
and they know about spaceflight.

264
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,070
First contact with the Kelpiens
by Starfleet

265
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:52,571
is a judgment call,

266
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,572
but our mission
to investigate these signals

267
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:56,075
would seem to require it.

268
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:57,375
We can stretch
General Order 1,

269
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:58,911
but lets try not to break it
in the process.

270
00:12:58,943 --> 00:12:59,912
Burnham,

271
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,113
as a xenoanthropologist,

272
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,347
I think youre
uniquely qualified

273
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,082
to talk
to a village priest.

274
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:05,451
SARU:
Sir,

275
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,485
I am the logical choice.

276
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,187
I offer my experience.

277
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,623
To disregard it
is to disregard the suffering

278
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:12,625
of generations of Kelpiens.

279
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,527
PIKE:
Given all that suffering,

280
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,528
youre the most
complicated choice.

281
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,365
Do you doubt my ability
to carry out the mission?

282
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,566
PIKE:
Of course not.

283
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,033
But at present, we lack
a full understanding

284
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,869
of the biological...

285
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,404
and behavioral changes
youre undergoing.

286
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:30,275
I can assure you, Captain,
I am still very much myself.

287
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:32,110
I can only imagine the pressure
you might feel to share

288
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,279
the truth with your people
about

289
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,279
<i>Vaharai.</i>

290
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:35,581
Are you suggesting
that I might be incapable

291
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,149
of following Starfleet
regulations?

292
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:39,418
Or that I would
disobey your orders?

293
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,323
Captain.

294
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,461
Kelpiens have no knowledge
of Starfleet

295
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,163
or any other
inhabited worlds.

296
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,932
Even though General Order 1
allows contact,

297
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,036
my arrival could come as
a complete shock to them.

298
00:13:57,068 --> 00:14:01,273
Commander Saru would be
invaluable to have by my side.

299
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,609
All right.

300
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:07,046
But Ill remind you both, were
here to gather information

301
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:08,913
about the signals
and the Red Angel,

302
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:12,384
not start a war between
the Kelpiens and the Baul.

303
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,288
Mr. Saru?

304
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:21,659
My duty, first and foremost,
is to

305
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:21,659
<i>Discoverys</i>

306
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:21,659
mission, sir.

307
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:23,428
I never doubt that.

308
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,932
Start in your
own village.

309
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,333
Maybe theyll be
glad to see you.

310
00:14:35,006 --> 00:14:36,609
CULBER:
So, uh,

311
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,945
what did the scan say?

312
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,514
Read em yourself.

313
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:48,220
All normal.

314
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,488
Youre you.

315
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,322
POLLARD:
Yes and no.

316
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:53,658
Brain patterns and neural
impulses are identical,

317
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,027
but this body

318
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,495
was entirely reconstituted
from your DNA.

319
00:14:57,528 --> 00:15:01,634
Its brand-new down to the
last molecule. You are,

320
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,702
for lack of a better word,
pristine.

321
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:13,044
My scar, its gone.

322
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:14,245
STAMETS:
It is?

323
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,514
I hadnt noticed that.

324
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,514
What scar?

325
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,650
Oh, the scar
he chose to keep.

326
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:20,184
You never told her
the story?

327
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:24,657
He was hiking the cliffs
of Cabo Rojo, alone.

328
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,225
I was 16...

329
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,494
STAMETS:
And apparently indestructible.

330
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,062
The path he
was on gave way,

331
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,697
and he fell 30 meters.

332
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,765
15, actually.

333
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:35,466
Well, enough to puncture
your shoulder.

334
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,201
He wouldve bled out, too,

335
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:39,138
if it werent for a
certain Dr. Kashkooli,

336
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,005
who was half a
kilometer behind him.

337
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,609
She risked her own life
to climb down and help him.

338
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,610
She stitched his wound up
with a fishing line.

339
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,379
Gave him a very

340
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,380
sexy scar

341
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:51,417
and inspired him to go
to medical school

342
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,519
and become the man he is today.

343
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:58,657
It is weird not
seeing it on you.

344
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,460
So, um...

345
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:05,431
...i-if my senses feel
a little off, its...

346
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,633
Its because your new nervous
system is still adjusting.

347
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,135
Id like to continue
monitoring you, but I believe

348
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:14,072
youre ready to resume
your normal life soon.

349
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,620
(animals chittering)

350
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:37,696
That pylon.

351
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,432
It isnt Kelpien,
is it?

352
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:43,201
No.

353
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:47,673
The Baul have erected one
in each village to observe us.

354
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,542
It has earned them a fitting
name among my people:

355
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,445
the Watchful Eye.

356
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,849
This pylon is connected
to an incredibly vast network.

357
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:59,751
Must have taken
the Baul generations

358
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:02,153
to integrate their
technology and ideology

359
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,855
into Kelpien society.

360
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,092
Our two species have become
so intertwined that,

361
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,094
outside their
technology,

362
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:11,529
it is difficult to
discern what is purely us

363
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,199
and what is distinctly them.

364
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:16,701
Where is everyone?

365
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:19,505
The days work is done.

366
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,740
It will soon be nightfall.

367
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:24,777
Kelpiens rarely venture
out in the dark.

368
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,180
(sighs)

369
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:30,348
I led this life once.

370
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,352
If I didnt know
your people were oppressed,

371
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:35,653
Id think Kaminar
was a paradise.

372
00:17:35,686 --> 00:17:37,522
Well, in many ways, it is.

373
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,259
We live in harmony
with each other,

374
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,427
in a world without
hunger or poverty.

375
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,530
The only violence we
know is the culling,

376
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,333
which Kelpiens have
been misled to accept

377
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:51,403
as a mercy
by the Baul.

378
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:56,375
And our priests
sustain that belief.

379
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:59,144
Didnt you say
your father was a priest?

380
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:01,547
Yes, he was
a collaborator,

381
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:05,150
albeit an
unwitting one,

382
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:08,319
enforcing the grip
the Baul had on my people.

383
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:16,394
Saru...

384
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:21,599
For 18 years,

385
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,536
I dreamt of returning
to my village.

386
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:28,272
It has not changed at all.

387
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:31,375
But I see it...

388
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,412
quite differently now.

389
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,419
(beeping)

390
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:44,690
(whirring)

391
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,800
These are the same flowers
from your quarters.

392
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,769
Fredalia, yes.

393
00:18:57,802 --> 00:19:00,404
They do not grow quite
so well on a starship.

394
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,570
Brother?

395
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,205
Siranna!

396
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,910
Saru!

397
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:40,546
Youre alive.

398
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:42,980
Oh, but how?

399
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,583
We thought
you were dead.

400
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:46,317
Taken by the Watchful Eye
for questions

401
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,486
you should not
have asked.

402
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,654
Oh...

403
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,758
Where have you been
all this time?

404
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,729
Siranna, 18 years ago,

405
00:19:57,762 --> 00:20:00,365
I thought I could find
my future in the stars,

406
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:04,036
and I did. Uh...

407
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:11,876
(gasps)
I was welcomed

408
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,512
by an interstellar service
called Starfleet,

409
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,849
committed to peace and the
exploration of our galaxy.

410
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,452
An organization far more
powerful than the Baul.

411
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,324
I found a new life.

412
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,499
What are you?

413
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:38,436
Im human. My name is Michael.

414
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,640
I come from a planet
called Earth,

415
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,843
and I work with your brother
on the starship

416
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,843
<i>Discovery.</i>

417
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:49,748
How is it that we can
understand one another?

418
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,983
This device.

419
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,353
Its able to translate
over a thousand languages.

420
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:57,823
You mean to say there are
a thousand life-forms out there?

421
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:01,593
Oh, not just a thousand--
hundreds of thousands.

422
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,855
So different and yet...

423
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:38,763
The galaxy?

424
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,464
Space travel?

425
00:21:45,836 --> 00:21:48,773
Do humans from Earth drink tea?

426
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,009
(chuckles)

427
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:05,457
Oh, how I have missed
the fredalia tea of home.

428
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,993
We were blessed with
a bountiful harvest this year.

429
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,430
Oh, you sound
just like Father.

430
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:14,865
Where is he?

431
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,604
Father reached his

432
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,604
<i>Vaharai
and joined the Great Balance</i>

433
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:24,041
not long after you... left us.

434
00:22:25,676 --> 00:22:29,146
How could you?

435
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,416
And never even let us know
that you were still alive?

436
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,885
I thought it would be safer
for you to believe I was dead.

437
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,923
Safer?

438
00:22:37,955 --> 00:22:40,759
We believed you had outraged
the Watchful Eye.

439
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,894
We spent years in agony,
fearing retribution.

440
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,565
I dreamed of our
reunion, brother.

441
00:22:46,597 --> 00:22:49,101
I could not be
more sorry, Siranna.

442
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,502
This is a longer conversation.

443
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:55,941
But I sense that is not
the reason you are here.

444
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,677
I...

445
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:11,522
Were looking for an entity

446
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,659
that we call
the Red Angel.

447
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:21,165
We have reason to believe that
it appeared here on Kaminar.

448
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:24,169
Is it another life-form?

449
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:27,071
We do not yet know what it is,
only that it appears

450
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,775
in conjunction with a red burst
of light in the sky

451
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:32,911
and in places
of crisis.

452
00:23:32,943 --> 00:23:36,515
The fiery sign... I saw it.

453
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:41,586
Have you seen or heard anything
that might be this Red Angel?

454
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:43,188
Maybe from
the priests

455
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,757
in the other
villages?

456
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,261
This is why you have returned?

457
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:55,933
I should have known
you did not come back for me.

458
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,903
Siranna,
I ask you to...

459
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:00,905
You ran away because you were

460
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,974
not brave enough to face the
Balance as the rest of us do.

461
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,777
(rumbling)

462
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,980
(deep bellowing)

463
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:17,087
Whats happening?

464
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,589
The Baul.

465
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,592
They must have observed
your return.

466
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,760
Once again you disturb
the Great Balance

467
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,695
and put our village in danger.

468
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,998
You must leave now!

469
00:24:27,031 --> 00:24:28,500
We wont be safe
until youre gone.

470
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:34,239
Siranna, this might be the last
time we ever see each other.

471
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:37,142
Return to the stars, Saru.
There is no place for you here.

472
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,682
(deep bellowing)

473
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,923
SARU:
Theyre coming.

474
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,926
<i>Discovery,</i>

475
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,926
beam us back.

476
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,800
(deep bellowing)

477
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:13,878
(panting)

478
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,650
(computer chimes)

479
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:19,984
COMPUTER:
Yellow alert.

480
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,819
Commander Saru,
Commander Burnham,

481
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,788
please report to the bridge.

482
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:25,824
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

483
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:33,632
Whatever you did,
the Baul are hailing us now.

484
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:36,300
Im going to guess its not
to invite us to a welcome party.

485
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,636
BRYCE:
Communication channel
established.

486
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,038
Its audio-only.

487
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,073
Mr. Saru, I think
it would be best

488
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:43,807
if you stay out
of this conversation.

489
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,744
This is Captain Christopher Pike
of the USS

490
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,744
<i>Discovery...</i>

491
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:50,615
BAUL:
You have taken
what belongs to us.

492
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,951
What have we taken, exactly?

493
00:25:52,983 --> 00:25:55,185
A Kelpien.

494
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,189
Starfleet promised

495
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:02,760
that it would not meddle in the
internal affairs of our planet.

496
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,864
Were investigating the signal
that appeared over your planet,

497
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:07,766
which Im sure
you noticed.

498
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:09,800
These signals are typically
followed by the arrival

499
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,069
of an entity we call
the Red Angel.

500
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,704
Are you familiar
with it?

501
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:21,011
The Red Angel may pose a threat
to Kaminars Great Balance.

502
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,948
Our mutual interest
lies only

503
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,281
in keeping the peace,
which we all...

504
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:28,752
No one is safer
than under the Watchful Eye.

505
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,221
Return the Kelpien to us,

506
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,692
and we will allow you
to leave without harm.

507
00:26:33,724 --> 00:26:35,125
I am not yours to be returned!

508

Mr. Saru.

00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,429
I am brother

510
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:40,265

a life of oppression.

511
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,900
I am son of Aradar,

Yes, bio-signs were archived
by the Sphere.

654
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,657
Um, actually, I can use those
current readings of the Baul

00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,592
to distinguish their bio-signs

threaten them?

Well, if we, uh,
go back 2,300 years, uh,

00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,614
theres a significant portion

00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,063
the Great Balance

If we isolate

the corresponding sound wave

789
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,527

790
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,195

What if history repeats itself?

793
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:12,702
We cant be responsible for the
extinction of the Baul species.

794
00:41:12,735 --> 00:41:15,271
But the Baul are still vastly
technologically superior.

795
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,208
It would take the
Kelpiens generations

796
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,242
to become a serious threat.

797
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:21,244
Generations during which
the Baul could face

But we will prove to them
that we can move beyond it.

802
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:34,257
We will not perpetuate
the cycle.

803
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,693
We will create

805
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:40,731
Captain, I cannot prove it,

806
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:44,300

00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,835

00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,617
That should do the trick.

816
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,286
Commander Saru,
Im sending you the modified

817
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:04,788
Sphere transmissions now.

818
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,603
Once I do this,

819
00:42:20,637 --> 00:42:23,806
all Kelpiens, including
you, will begin

820
00:42:20,637 --> 00:42:23,806
<i>Vaharai.</i>

821
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,043
Everything will change.

822
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:31,114
Im afraid itll be
much more painful,

823
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,751
like being torn
apart from within.

824
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:35,152
Just promise me, brother,

825
00:42:35,184 --> 00:42:37,621
that this will not be
the end of our people.

826
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:41,625
No. It will be a new beginning.

827
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,197
Then let it begin.

828
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:57,708
(grunts)

829
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,876
(energy surging)

830
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:02,679
(high-pitched whining)

831
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,614
(pained cries)

832
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:09,753
(screaming)

833
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,893
Bio-sign readings
indicate that

834
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,893
<i>Vaharai</i>

835
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,295
has initiated in 63%
of Kelpiens and rising.

836
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:21,331
(screaming)

837
00:43:25,802 --> 00:43:28,172
(gasping)

838
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:31,041
Im sorry.
It will be over soon.

839
00:43:31,074 --> 00:43:32,443
(pained gasp)

840
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,344
(rumbling)

841
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,184
Sir, Im detecting
massive activity

842
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:42,452
beneath the surface of the lake.

843
00:43:42,485 --> 00:43:44,021
On screen.

844
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:46,422
Theres a structure
rising above the water.

845
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:48,192
At least 50 kilometers
in diameter.

846
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:57,266
(thunderous rumbling)

847
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,702
(alarm beeping)

848
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,764
A Baul stronghold.

849
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,097
Protected by a powerful
force field.

850
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:29,132
That might be where
theyre holding

851
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,199
Commander Saru and Siranna
captive.

852
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:32,835
Red alert. Rhys, target
that structures shields.

853
00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:34,838
If we destroy them,
maybe we can get a lock on Saru

854
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:36,072
and his sisters location.

855
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:41,045
(breathing normalizing)

856
00:44:44,313 --> 00:44:46,349
You have survived.

857
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,018
(deep bellowing)

858
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,157
(whirring)

859
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:58,929
We have angered the Baul.

860
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:06,335
(alarm sounding)

861
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:09,440
Owosekun, tell me
what Im looking at.

862
00:45:09,472 --> 00:45:11,041
That Baul structure is
activating pylons

863
00:45:11,074 --> 00:45:12,309
across the planet,

864
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,210
with an energy buildup
capable of destroying

865
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,846
every Kelpien village.

866
00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:17,514
Rather than let
them evolve,

867
00:45:17,547 --> 00:45:18,981
the Baul are
committing genocide?

868
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:21,452
Bryce, hail these bastards.

869
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,286
Rhys, forget the stronghold.
Get a target lock

870
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,554
on those pylons.

871
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,456
Theyre not responding, sir.

872
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,456
Open a channel.

873
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:30,893
This is Captain Pike.
I will not allow you

874
00:45:30,927 --> 00:45:33,297
to wipe out an entire race.

875
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:35,431
Your fear of the Kelpiens
has blinded you

876
00:45:35,465 --> 00:45:37,568
to a peaceful solution.

877
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,001
Starfleet can help you
negotiate a new balance

878
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,436
between your two species,

879
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,472
protecting everyone
on your world.

880
00:45:42,505 --> 00:45:44,842
However, if you choose

881
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:47,043
to murder the entire
Kelpien population...

882
00:45:48,411 --> 00:45:51,581
...you will become our enemies.

883
00:45:51,614 --> 00:45:53,851
Choose wisely.

884
00:45:56,452 --> 00:46:00,923
Sir, theyve activated
all 4,056 pylons

885
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,092
in every Kelpien village.

886
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,092
Lieutenant Rhys?

887
00:46:03,126 --> 00:46:04,894
There are too many pylons
to target at once, sir.

888
00:46:04,927 --> 00:46:06,463
Lets get started.

889
00:46:06,496 --> 00:46:07,797
Arm photon torpedoes.

890
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,534
On my order.

891
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,440
(whirring)

892
00:46:16,472 --> 00:46:18,608
The Baul mean to kill us all!

893
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:20,244
<i>Discovery</i>

894
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:20,244
will stop them.

895
00:46:23,112 --> 00:46:24,114
No, no!

896
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:52,141
(powering down)

897
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,250
Sir, sensor readings
indicate

898
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:01,552
a massive spike in
electromagnetic radiation

899
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,387
in the Baul structure.

900
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,989
The pulse has deactivated
all the pylons across Kaminar.

901
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:06,989
Rhys, hold your fire.

902
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:08,358
What the hell
is happening?

903
00:47:08,391 --> 00:47:10,126
The Baul weapons and shields
have all been disabled,

904
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:11,661
but I cant get a reading
on what caused it.

905
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:13,664
DETMER:
The technology required
to generate

906
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,097
electric and magnetic fields
that wide...

907
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,467
This should be impossible.

908
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,115
(both breathing heavily)

909
00:47:42,992 --> 00:47:45,494
That is what you came to find.

910
00:47:48,097 --> 00:47:50,367
A savior.

911
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,637
(chittering)

912
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,673
(indistinct chatter)

913
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:28,572
Siranna, what has happened?

914
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,742
How have we
survived

915
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,742
<i>Vaharai?</i>

916
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:35,344
The truth has survived.

917
00:48:35,378 --> 00:48:38,382
It is time for a true balance
to be restored.

918
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,452
(indistinct chatter)

919
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,728
You do not have to
be afraid anymore.

920
00:49:06,342 --> 00:49:08,110
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, all personnel...

921
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:10,780
(continues indistinctly)

922
00:49:10,813 --> 00:49:12,416
(door whooshes open)

923
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,719
(door whooshes shut)

924
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,460
Whats this?

925
00:49:23,492 --> 00:49:25,661
Commander Sarus report,

926
00:49:25,695 --> 00:49:27,431
shared in the spirit
of cooperation.

927
00:49:27,463 --> 00:49:30,266
Thanks to Commander Sarus
enhanced eyesight,

928
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,670
he was able to get a better look
at the Red Angel.

929
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:36,806
"The entity appears
to be a humanoid

930
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,043
"wearing a
mechanized suit,

931
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:41,744
"exhibiting technology
far beyond

932
00:49:41,777 --> 00:49:44,047
present Federation
capabilities."

933
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:47,818
So, its

934
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:47,818
<i>someone.</i>

935
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,686
And whether human
or alien,

936
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,755
it has extremely
advanced technology.

937
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:56,059
Someone who is manipulating
the fates of entire species.

938
00:49:56,092 --> 00:49:58,494
Control,

939
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,063
which models Section 31s
threat assessments,

940
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,431
is probably rightfully
alarmed by...

941
00:50:02,465 --> 00:50:04,201
what is it? A...

942
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:08,070
a time-traveling being
pursuing its own agenda?

943
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:14,110
When we forced the Baul
to decentralize their power

944
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,380
across the entire planet,

945
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,349
the Red Angel took advantage
of their temporary exposure

946
00:50:19,382 --> 00:50:22,219
and used its advanced technology

947
00:50:22,251 --> 00:50:23,853
to save the Kelpiens
from genocide.

948
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:25,454
And what happens
when that technology

949
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:26,822
is turned against us?

950
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:31,762
Section 31...

951
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:35,097
and Controls
threat-assessment models...

952
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,500
seem a bit paranoid.

953
00:50:38,768 --> 00:50:40,737
Youre aware were
no longer at war?

954
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:43,739
And we dont want to
end up in one again.

955
00:50:43,773 --> 00:50:46,543
This last war, sir, took a toll

956
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:48,878
on those who fought it.

957
00:50:48,911 --> 00:50:52,114
Some of us are still torn apart.

958
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,804
SARU:
I felt the same way

959
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,840
the first time I saw it,

960
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:21,378
looking down on our
planet, our home.

961
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,512
Well, you took home
with you.

962
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,849
Well, seeds of it, yes.

963
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:31,487
This little garden was
all I had for so many years.

964
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,590
But I realized

965
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:37,360
there was so much
more out there.

966
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:43,632
You could come with me, Siranna,

967
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:45,168
if you wanted to see it.

968
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,871
Just for a while.

969
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,273
No.

970
00:51:51,307 --> 00:51:54,210
I must stay for my people.

971
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,480
There is a long road ahead,

972
00:51:56,512 --> 00:51:58,715
Our minds must truly be free

973
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:01,318
before Kelpien and Baul
accept each other.

974
00:52:02,351 --> 00:52:03,686
(clicks tongue)

975
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:05,889
But I am happy, brother.

976
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:10,226
I know you did not
leave Kaminar in fear,

977
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,963
but in hope.

978
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:15,431
And you brought that hope
back with you.

979
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,733
You and your Red Angel.

980
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,896
You are welcome
to return home

981
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:48,597
whenever you would like,
brother.

982
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,735
I will, sister.

983
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:06,715
(gasps)

984
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,385
(sighs)

985
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,969
Thank you, Michael.

986
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,840
Im reminded.
Do you know Aeschylus?

987
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,577
An ancient Greek tragedian,

988
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,978
born circa 525 BC.

989
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:38,815
"He who learns must suffer.

990
00:53:38,847 --> 00:53:41,784
And even in our sleep..."

991
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,788
"Pain that cannot forget

992
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,525
falls drop by drop
upon the heart."

993
00:53:55,097 --> 00:54:01,003
Knowing that my sister
has a chance to evolve,

994
00:54:01,036 --> 00:54:03,940
to live a full life,

995
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:07,043
it makes me feel I
can endure anything.

996
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:12,081
I am sure, given
the opportunity,

997
00:54:12,114 --> 00:54:15,452
you would do the same
for your own brother.

998
00:54:18,387 --> 00:54:19,989
If I could find him.

999
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:27,664
But seeing you with Siranna

1000
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:29,833
has made one thing
very clear to me.

1001
00:54:29,865 --> 00:54:32,768
And that is?

1002
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:35,572
I need to go home as well.

1003
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,072
To Vulcan.

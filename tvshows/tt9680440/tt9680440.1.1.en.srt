1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,040
This whole world...

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,080
this universe...

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,600
it's actually segregated
into three universes.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,840
Right on top are "the Heavens."

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,280
That's where the Gods reside.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,360
In the middle is "the Earth"

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,520
where the humans live.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,720
At the very bottom is...

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,720
"the Paatal Lok (Netherworld)."

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,000
The one that belongs to the insects -
the creepy crawlies.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,000
It's all there in our scriptures, but...

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,080
I read it on WhatsApp.

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Come on, man.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,120
They haven't even announced
the test results yet.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,840
If I pass, I'll have to prepare
for the interview anyway.

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,280
God forbid...

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,800
what if you don't?

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,640
Well, then I got to prepare
for the next year's test.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,760
Buddy, no book's ever
going to teach you...

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,760
what I'm telling you about.

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,280
Yes, sir!

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,560
The three universes.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,720
Our station...

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,880
Outer Jamuna Paar,
that's the fucking netherworld.

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,960
Which cockroach got murdered here...

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,360
which bug's bike got nicked...

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,760
which flea is giving
his wife a black eye...

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,880
no one really gives a fuck.

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,520
No matter how good your investigation is,
no promotion for solving a case like this.

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,760
So I should then be praying for
a Lutyens' Delhi posting.

31
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,920
Ashoka Road, Aurangzeb Road?

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,600
That's where heaven is, right?

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,000
Well... that it is.

34
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,160
But what happens in
heaven stays in heaven.

35
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,600
No word ever gets out.

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,280
Nothing for a poor cop then to
investigate, or get promoted.

37
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,040
-Shakurpuri JJ Colony.
-Right?

38
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,360
A complaint just came
in from Shakurpuri JJ colony.

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,960
The nearest PCR van to respond.

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,720
Preet Vihar, Vasant Vihar...

41
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,880
Mehrauli, Noida...

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
Now, that's Earth.

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,240
But every once in a while,
the crawlies from Netherworld

44
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,600
crawl out into the open.

45
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,360
And bite at their precious souls.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
And when that happens, there's a scandal.

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,040
Aarushi scandal,

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Nithari scandal.

49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,400
And that's the only kind
of investigation that will get

50
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,600
a cop promoted in this town.

51
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,520
Sir, I'm not sure I agree.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,120
Really?

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,880
When did you join the force?

54
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,840
It hasn't been that long, sir.

55
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,280
Been about three months.

56
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Three months.

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,800
I have spent fifteen years
in this netherworld, kid.

58
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,720
You got to believe me.

59
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,520
-This is just your routine, isn't it?
-It was me who called.

60
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,040
Just look at the way he is going at her.
Happens everyday.

61
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,400
I will drink!

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,960
-I will, got it?
-How dare you, dog!

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,480
Why don't you just die?
Just go and die somewhere.

64
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,840
Leave me!

65
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Hey, come here!

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,240
Sit!

67
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,800
You bloody buffoon.

68
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,200
Motherfucker!
How dare you touch my man?

69
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,720
Your ugly body is going to rot and stink.

70
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,880
You'll have roaches
coming out of your ass.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,840
Get Master ji on the phone.

72
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,760
It's been three fucking days.

73
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,560
Just let me speak to Master ji.

74
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,200
Order.

75
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,840
Cancel.

76
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,320
But...

77
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,440
Let's go.

78
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,640
Sir...

79
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,760
We forgot to add that
canceled order to the final bill.

80
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Exactly, it was canceled.
So why add to the bill?

81
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,520
But you ordered it!

82
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,920
I never ate it though, did I?

83
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,240
You'll have to talk to the manager.

84
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,800
Go fuck yourself.

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,400
Bloody cheapskate.

86
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,440
Step on it.

87
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,680
Faster.

88
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
Lose them, motherfucker!

89
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,080
Come on, they're getting away.

90
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,680
Quick, quick!

91
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,040
Don't let them get away.

92
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,720
Where the fuck are you guys?

93
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,360
Overtake them, now!

94
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,240
Block him.

95
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
Back away, fucker!

96
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Turn around.

97
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,520
Now what's going on over there?

98
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,040
Get the camera. Quick.

99
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Dahiya.

100
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,840
Media... media!

101
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Cover them.

102
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,200
Open the boot, motherfucker!

103
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,320
Out of the car, now!

104
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,960
-Nab him!
-Come on, out!

105
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
Come on!

106
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,200
Hey, wait!

107
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,840
Stop right there, motherfucker!

108
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,680
Easy, asshole. The car's brand new.

109
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,880
Catch him!

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,360
Guns on hold.

111
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,200
Quiet!

112
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,560
Move back, move back.
It's the Delhi Police.

113
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,360
Move back!

114
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,880
Handle them!

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,240
Reports coming of a big incident
on the Yamuna Bridge.

116
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,880
PCR vans to respond.

117
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,240
Step back!

118
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,720
Move back.

119
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,240
-Hey... move aside.
-Move back.

120
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
-Delhi Police.
-Inspector Hathi Ram Chaudhary.

121
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,720
Outer Jamuna Paar Police Station.

122
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,160
This area is under our jurisdiction.

123
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,160
Come.

124
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,480
Hold on for a moment, sir.

125
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,360
-DCP Bhagat, from the headquarters.
-Jai Hind, sir.

126
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,520
Inspector Hathi Ram Chaudhary,
Outer Jamuna Paar Police Station.

127
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,600
-Get the crowd under control, Chaudhary.
-Sure, sir.

128
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,160
And book these four under
your police station.

129
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,960
Sir, what are the charges?

130
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,280
Conspiracy to murder.

131
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,280
Please, move your cameras!

132
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,840
-Step back!
-You can't do this, sir.

133
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
Kabir M.

134
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,760
What's M?
I need the full name.

135
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,640
M. That's it, sir.

136
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,280
You from down South?

137
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,720
Sounds like a South-Indian name.

138
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,520
Strip!

139
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,720
Bhati, search him.

140
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,840
Stand up.

141
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,280
I said, stand up.

142
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,160
Now, strip.

143
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Name?

144
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,080
I don't have all day.

145
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,320
Motherfucker!

146
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,600
Tell me your name, asshole.

147
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,120
Tokas!
What's wrong with you, man?

148
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,440
Don't you know the media
and the bosses are around?

149
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,160
Just doing my job, sir!

150
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,720
These fuckers won't give their names.

151
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,200
Step aside.

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,080
You, stand up.

153
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,400
Hands in the air.

154
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Take down the details.

155
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,520
His mother called from Meerut.

156
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,360
Take your clothes off.

157
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,400
-So, the mother goes--
-Ma'am, I've done nothing wrong.

158
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,160
I work at that mall, Shoppers' Zone.

159
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,720
Just hitched a ride with these guys.

160
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,920
So the mother goes,
"Your Police Station is on TV.

161
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,800
Why don't you come out
and wave at me?"

162
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,160
Can you even believe it?

163
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,680
Yes.

164
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,920
Well, her knees are better off...

165
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,920
Hold on.

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,760
I said strip, strip you bitch.
Take this off.

167
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,120
But the damned thing
gave her ulcers down there...

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,760
Those pills generate a lot of heat.

169
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,600
We recently got the house painted.

170
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,440
So, what else is on TV?

171
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,000
And this right here is the yellow phone.

172
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,960
And now see it go flying

173
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
right into the dark depths
of the Yamuna river.

174
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,040
Right in front of the
eyes of the Delhi Police.

175
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,360
But the big question
is what was in this phone

176
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,720
that the accused was trying to hide?

177
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,240
Talk about bad timing!

178
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,000
Sir, I can do this.

179
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,800
Chaudhary, step outside.

180
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,080
Sir.

181
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,280
Who's going to lead the investigation?

182
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,640
Sir, Vikas Bahl.

183
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,800
He's on leave right now.
But should be back in a week.

184
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,040
Can't delay the
investigation by a week.

185
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,880
Chaudhary made the arrest.
Let him handle it.

186
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,120
Sir, Chaudhary doesn't have it in him.

187
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,600
It's a big case.

188
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,040
And he has got no track
record of investigations.

189
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,400
It's an open and shut case.

190
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,360
We caught them red-handed,
for God's sake.

191
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,840
All he has to do is
just follow the rule book.

192
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,720
-Dahiya!
-Yes, sir.

193
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,400
-Brief Chaudhary.
-Okay, sir.

194
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,080
Well...

195
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,320
Sir, where did the tip
come from?

196
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,080
An anonymous call from a
public phone in Munirka.

197
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,520
And what exactly was the tip?

198
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,840
Nothing much.

199
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,720
Just that these four staying at Hotel
Uptown were planning a murder.

200
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,280
Hotel Uptown.

201
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,440
But how did the tipper know
of their plan to murder?

202
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,360
Maybe he was from their gang.

203
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,240
Or someone overheard something
at the hotel.

204
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,760
We're hoping you'll figure
out the rest.

205
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,560
Sure, sir. But doesn't the
Intelligence department

206
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,320
normally pass on such tips
to the local station?

207
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,680
-Sir!
-Yes.

208
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,280
Sir, Chaudhary thinks we broke the
protocol by arresting them ourselves.

209
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,040
-No, sir. I just--
-He's right.

210
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,400
You are absolutely right.

211
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,120
But there wasn't enough time.

212
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,680
The tipper said the kill
was to happen today.

213
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,520
There was no time to bring
you guys in.

214
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,320
But the bastards sniffed
something and fled...

215
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,800
till we caught them on the bridge.

216
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,720
Any info on who the target was?

217
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,040
As you can see,

218
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,280
Singh Saab is being more than fair
with his revised offer.

219
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,800
I guess I'll have to repeat
what I said in the last meeting.

220
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,320
I am not resigning.

221
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,720
I've given four years
to this damn channel.

222
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,160
Built it from scratch.

223
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,520
And if he thinks he
can just throw me out--

224
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,080
Sir, it's nothing personal.

225
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,400
Singh Saab is just going by the--

226
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,160
Your Singh Saab can go fuck himself.

227
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,480
Can you give us
a few minutes, Rajeev?

228
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,320
I'll send some fresh
coffee in the conference room.

229
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,280
-Okay?
-Alright.

230
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,360
It's not just about the ratings, Sanjeev.

231
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,080
Singh knows something else too.

232
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,280
That you've been looking for dirt on
their Delhi - Sonipat Expressway deal.

233
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,760
Singh is not the guy
you mess with, Sanjeev.

234
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,680
Just as we were speaking about the
freedom of Press in this country,

235
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,400
we have some startling
breaking news just coming in from Delhi.

236
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,120
Four people have been arrested

237
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,280
and it seems a prominent
journalist is under the attack.

238
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,880
We'll take you straight to the
Outer Jamuna Paar police station in Delhi

239
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,000
where we have Kaveri on the ground there
covering this piece of startling news...

240
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
Sir, you really need to see this.

241
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,120
After a dramatic chase, a team of
Delhi Police Intelligence

242
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,160
managed to catch all the four accused

243
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,960
who are now locked up
in this very police station.

244
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,280
The police refuses
to disclose further

245
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,920
but our sources in the police
department have revealed

246
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,720
that the target of this failed
assassination attempt

247
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,080
could have been journalist
Sanjeev Mehra.

248
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,160
Of course, at this point of
time, it is unconfirmed information

249
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,360
and we're trying our
best to get this verified

250
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,400
by the higher authorities
in Delhi police.

251
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,040
But from the look of it,
this seems like another attack

252
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,800
on the Freedom of
Press in this country.

253
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,000
Hello?

254
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,680
Sanjeev...

255
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,280
it's the Police Commissioner.

256
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,600
Sanjeev!

257
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,880
Hello, sir.
This is Jai Malik, his colleague.

258
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
Where is his slate?

259
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,240
The bastard won't speak.

260
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
We didn't get his full
set of fingerprints either.

261
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,520
Come on, give us a show.

262
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,560
They say even the dead sing here.

263
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,240
Just wait till the court appearance, mate.

264
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,480
You too shall sing like a canary.

265
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,880
What is his name?

266
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,080
Wasn't telling us his own name.

267
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,800
He's the smart ass of the lot.

268
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,520
Why did you throw
the phone in the water?

269
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,800
What phone?

270
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,880
It's on TV, motherfucker!

271
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,800
They show just about
anything on TV, sir.

272
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,040
See what I mean, sir?

273
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,280
Sir, the evidence listing is done.

274
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,640
We found some dollars on the girl,
along with this phone.

275
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,560
Who is the artist here?

276
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,280
It's Kabir M.

277
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,200
He also had this strange
medical certificate on him.

278
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,400
Looks like a circumcision certificate.

279
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,680
Wasn't he the one driving the car?

280
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,760
Yes, sir.
I think it's stolen.

281
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,040
The number plate and
chassis details don't match.

282
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,680
We're running a check on it.

283
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,560
Check their records.
Let's see what the system throws up,

284
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,640
especially on this one.

285
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,080
I don't think I can go on air tonight.

286
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,320
And we can't run this.

287
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,720
The Police haven't confirmed anything.

288
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,080
What did the Commissioner
say on the phone?

289
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,200
He'll get back to us when
he has something concrete.

290
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,880
If we run this now,

291
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,080
and it turns out to be false,
we're going to look like amateurs.

292
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,680
I know.

293
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,520
But it's the top story
tonight on every other channel.

294
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,240
We don't want to miss out on it.

295
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,520
Last I checked I was the one making
editorial decisions around here.

296
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,640
Of course.

297
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Ask Gayatri to take over 9 PM.

298
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,800
And tell her we're
not running this story.

299
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,720
Been a rough day.

300
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,320
Come, I'll drop you home.

301
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,800
Move aside.

302
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Make way, please.

303
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,080
Move out.

304
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,800
-Don't blame us if you get hit.
-Please move.

305
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,920
They'll blame us afterwards. Move!

306
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,200
Hello?

307
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,680
Yes, Dolly. I told you I am fine.

308
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,560
Yes, yes.

309
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,680
Please, move.

310
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,640
Step out of the way!

311
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,240
Yeah, I'm coming home.

312
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,400
On my way. Yeah, bye.

313
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,560
What the fuck!

314
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
Who are these people?

315
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,880
They are us.

316
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,800
So, who do you think
can be behind this?

317
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,680
Singh Saab?

318
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,560
That's taking it too far, Sanjeev.

319
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,080
But didn't you say he's
not the guy you mess with?

320
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,080
Maybe, it's Dashrath Kumar.

321
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,320
I doubt.

322
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,280
It's been three years since.

323
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,560
Snakes and politicians...

324
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,480
they never forget.

325
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,280
After all, you had ruined
his political career.

326
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,000
Do you not remember?

327
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,960
What do you think, sir?

328
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,360
Is it Dashrath Kumar who
sent these four guys?

329
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,640
Well, there's definitely
a big daddy behind them.

330
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,520
Else why'd they try
and get rid of that phone?

331
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,240
Sir, didn't you think
the Intelligence guys

332
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,880
were a bit reluctant
in giving out the details?

333
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,200
We didn't really get
much from them!

334
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,520
Look, these guys down
at the headquarters...

335
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,200
they think us worthy of
only traffic arrangements.

336
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,840
Not for any serious police work.

337
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,160
So they filter out the
information for us.

338
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,400
Need to know basis.

339
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
Right.

340
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,600
Who is it now?

341
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,920
-Hello?
-Sir, this is Shefali from Times.

342
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,880
Who's that?

343
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,600
Wanted to get your comment
on the Sanjeev Mehra case.

344
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,800
Oh, damn!

345
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,520
Ma'am, the investigation is still on.

346
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,440
It's still a work in progress.

347
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,640
And currently we can
only give information on...

348
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,240
Hello!

349
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,000
-Need to know basis.
-Sir...

350
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
Yes, Mom. What's up?

351
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,600
Sanjeev's absolutely fine.

352
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,960
Yes, I am good too.

353
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
Yes, Mom, all's well.

354
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,320
No, I am not stressed at all.

355
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,880
It's all good.

356
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,000
Honestly.

357
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,520
Listen, Mom. It's nothing.

358
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,960
Hello?

359
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,160
Yes, just hold on for a second.

360
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,200
Just wait, Mom.

361
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,240
Savitri.

362
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,840
There you are, my baby!

363
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,240
Ma'am, are you talking
to your husband?

364
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,560
Ma'am, how did you feel when you
learnt of the attack on him?

365
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,000
What will be the first thing you say
to him when he gets home?

366
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,960
Shit.

367
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,000
Just what I feared.

368
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,560
You can go.

369
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,840
I'll sneak in from the back door.

370
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,400
Are you sure?

371
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,440
Be careful.

372
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,280
Yeah, Dolly.

373
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,800
Sanjeev, I am very scared.

374
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,000
Where are you?
I need you.

375
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,800
I am on my way, Dolly.
I am right here.

376
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
Did you take your pills?

377
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,600
I can't breathe, Sanjeev.

378
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,360
I just can't breathe.

379
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,240
They are there everywhere
outside the house.

380
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,840
I couldn't even step
out to feed Savitri.

381
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,320
Dolly, what do you want me to do?

382
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,200
Just come home, Sanjeev.

383
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,320
Please just come home.

384
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,360
Come home and tell me we'll be fine.

385
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,000
Just hold me, please.
Just do something.

386
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,240
Come fast, please!

387
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,360
For God's sake, Dolly...

388
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,200
You know I almost got killed today.

389
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,960
For once, can it not be
about you and your anxiety?

390
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,080
Why are you saying all this?

391
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,040
Why are you saying all this, Sanjeev?

392
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,360
I was worried sick since morning.

393
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,840
Everything I do, I do it for you.

394
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,560
Sanjeev--

395
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,120
Hello?

396
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,760
So a penguin walks into a bar,

397
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,400
and he goes up to the bartender and says

398
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,600
"I am looking for my brother.
Have you seen him?"

399
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,240
And the bartender goes
"I don't know. What does he look like?"

400
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,480
You know because penguins,
they all look the same.

401
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,120
Sara, right?

402
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,280
Sara Mathews. 6 p.m. Feature.

403
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,320
Looks like you haven't
heard the breaking news tonight.

404
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,640
Of course I did.

405
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,720
I just figured that if you
wanted to talk about it,

406
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,200
then you wouldn't be sitting
alone in a bar right now.

407
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,640
You know I was...

408
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,240
I was in my last term at Cornell,

409
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,440
when you did that
Dashrath Kumar story.

410
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,800
And the sheer audacity of it...

411
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,800
The next day you went
right up to him,

412
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,400
with cameras in his face
to break this story of the sting.

413
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,000
And just what does he have
say to admit his guilt?

414
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,800
One word.

415
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,720
"Motherfucker!"

416
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,040
That's when I decided that I'm...

417
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,440
I'm gonna come back to
India and work for you.

418
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,080
We used to be heroes, you know.

419
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,440
People like us.

420
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,920
And then something about
this country changed.

421
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,840
And now we get trolled, and killed...

422
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,600
fired.

423
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,120
Sir, we're closing.

424
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
See...

425
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,640
we even get thrown out of bars.

426
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,400
Move away, you stink.

427
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,800
Not the first time I've heard that.

428
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,760
Not the first time you're
walking in drunk, either.

429
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,000
Thank you for killing the mood.

430
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,400
I wanted to tell you something.

431
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,320
Switch off this bloody disco
before sleeping at least!

432
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,360
Don't you dare touch my Gods.

433
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,880
Wait, I'll heat it up.

434
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,920
Now, who asked you to get up?

435
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,680
Should've thought of it
before getting all romantic.

436
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,960
Now that you're up...

437
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,440
can you give me a massage?

438
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,400
My head is throbbing.

439
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,920
So, what was it that you
wanted to tell me?

440
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,360
An investigation has come my way.

441
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,760
I'll be reporting straight to the
headquarters, to the DCP.

442
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,680
You should've seen Virk's face--

443
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,560
So you got promoted finally?

444
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,240
Why don't you ever pay attention, woman?

445
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,320
It's not a promotion.
But it's a big case.

446
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,840
The first one in ages.

447
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,160
If I crack it, I can probably still
make something of myself.

448
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,160
-Oh!
-Why did you stop?

449
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,080
How did Sanjeev Mehra's
name leak to the media?

450
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,360
It was sensitive information, right?

451
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,200
Only your team knew about it,
apart from Intelligence.

452
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,880
Ansari and I were
still in the briefing

453
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,040
when the news had leaked out.

454
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,040
Bhagat is pissed.

455
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,400
We could've done without all the
attention the case is going to get now.

456
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,160
Jai Hind, sir.

457
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,880
What's the update, Chaudhary?

458
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,760
Sir...

459
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,040
I've no idea how Sanjeev Mehra's
name got leaked to the media...

460
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,720
Screw all that.
What's the update on the case?

461
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,560
Sir, that Tope Singh seems
like the leader of the pack.

462
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,800
We're trying to get their
records out in the meantime.

463
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,760
I am sending two officers
for Mehra's security.

464
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,040
You take them along when
you go to brief Mehra.

465
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,640
Yes, sir.

466
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,720
Sir... how much do we
give out to him at this stage?

467
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,880
Need to know basis, Chaudhary.

468
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,880
Yes of course, sir.

469
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
Why the fuck haven't
we found that phone yet?

470
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,520
Look for it.

471
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
Only thing that will calm
these assholes down.

472
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,040
Yes, sir.

473
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,640
-I am sorry.
-It's okay, honey. I am fine.

474
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,200
Hathi Ram Chaudhary, sir.

475
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,840
Outer Jamuna Paar Police Station.

476
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,120
Sanjeev Mehra.

477
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,640
Everyone knows who you are, sir.

478
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,440
Ma'am said you weren't
home last night.

479
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,040
Yeah, there were all these
reporters outside the house.

480
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,600
So I checked myself into a hotel.

481
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,440
You will have to be a little
careful for some time, sir.

482
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,440
Take these guys along
wherever you go.

483
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,080
And there'll be another
team for the night shift.

484
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,120
Is there anyone you suspect?

485
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,040
Any old enemies?

486
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,000
A powerful man you exposed
in the past. Feathers you ruffled...

487
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,800
Part of the job.

488
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,760
Are you having an affair?

489
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,200
Routine questions, sir.

490
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,960
Just trying to get the
obvious out of the way.

491
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,680
Nope, nothing like that.

492
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,680
You got anything on those four?

493
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,640
Early days, sir.

494
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,640
You might have to drop by the police
station for identification.

495
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,160
I'll take your leave then.

496
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,280
Sir, we're still trying to
get his name out.

497
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,160
Vishal Tyagi.

498
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,320
Tope Singh.

499
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,440
Kabir M.

500
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,680
Mary Lyngdoh.

501
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,040
And Vishal Tyagi.

502
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,880
Fourteen day police remand approved.

503
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,000
Sir.

504
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,160
Sir, I'm calling from Delhi Police,
the Outer Jamuna Paar police station.

505
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,120
We've a stolen car
from Muzaffarnagar RTO.

506
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,520
Four arrests. Can you run their
records through your system?

507
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,160
Their names read...

508
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,160
Good you came early.

509
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,640
There's pasta for dinner.

510
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,800
Kill me already.

511
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,520
Where is Siddharth?

512
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,960
Siddharth.

513
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,600
Siddharth.

514
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,760
Can you explain?

515
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,360
When were you planning
to tell us you flunked?

516
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,800
And this...

517
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,120
How come my signature
is on the report card?

518
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
I don't want to go to that school.

519
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,160
So which school do
you want to go to?

520
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,960
Happy Valley.
All my friends go there.

521
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,600
For they are a bunch of useless lot.

522
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,160
Do you even know what it takes
to get admitted to your school?

523
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,600
Any idea how much I begged
my bosses to put in a word?

524
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,680
Too bad!

525
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,680
-Don't you dare!
-What's wrong with you two?

526
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,600
Always ready to butt heads.

527
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,680
Then why don't you
knock some sense into him?

528
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,160
Did you even know his
mid-term results were out?

529
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,640
Always ready to lecture!

530
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,000
Siddhu!

531
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,440
Siddhu!

532
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,880
What now?

533
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,320
Sir, can you come down
to the station?

534
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,320
Why?

535
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,640
We got their criminal records out.

536
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,440
That Vishal Tyagi is
Hathoda (Hammer) Tyagi.

537
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,840
The most wanted gangster
in Chitrakoot, UP.

538
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,640
Never been arrested.

539
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,680
Cases?

540
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,520
Kidnapping, ransom, extortion...

541
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,960
and forty five murders.

I called you nine times.

How am I supposed to get in touch
if he would not answer his phone?

00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,480
-I didn't hear the phone. Sorry.
-Okay...

00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,840
As soon as I saw him I thought:
"He could be the one". You know?

358
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,960
And the first thing I did
was tell him

359
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,640
some day my neurons will start dying.

360
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,400
Some day I won't be able
to control my emotions.

361
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,120
Won't be able to control
my arms and legs.

Won't even be able to eat.

363

I told him there's no point

364
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,400
in even having
a relationship with me.

365
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,840
Because I have a defective gene

366
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,800
and one day I'll have Huntington's.

Maybe she's right,
but I feel like this way

370

when I start to lose myself.

a major issue
for everyone in this group.

375

I saved this family, Emma.

386
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,640
And the bottom line is that
we don't continue to broker cocaine,

387
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,040
this company ceases to exist.

388
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,440
That's not true,
we have 4.000 containers

389
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,720
on 45 ships all over the world,
shipping legitimate goods.

390
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,760
We're not drug dealers.
We're shipping brokers.

391
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,720
And those 4.000 containers
make less money in a year

392
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,280
than one shipment of cocaine
makes in 21 days.

If you don't understand the basic
principles of our business,

00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,160
maybe I've wasted
too much time on you, Emma.

Hey Chris, give me that.

You know why we're not going

Because what we do
keeps the world's economy aflow.

he always knows what's going on.

427

It's worse to just keep
him in the dark.

428
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,200
He gets upset really easily,
it's not good for him.

429

He's okay. If you treat him like
he's sick, he'll feel like he's sick.

00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:59,160
Well, he's gonna be sick.
Very soon he's gonna be sick.

You're the lucky one, Emma.

Don't ever forget that.

440
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,440
I don't want him in the family
business. You gotta promise me.

441

Promise me.

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,160
Yeah, I promise you.

You know what they're gonna say?

They're gonna say: you're finished.
You're just "basura".

Garbage. Nada.

448
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,200
That doesn't apply to us.

449
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,920
We move in an alternative economy
where there's always money.

450

No, no. We are the engine
of the global economy.

Take us out of the equation

and the whole whitewash facade just
tumbles in on their fucking heads.

We like your style.

-Thank you.
-How you do things.

456
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,760
But our deal was for 70.

This token transfers
31 million dollars.

458
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,440
Down payment.

459
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,440
As soon as the product
leaves Mexican waters.

460
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:23,120
We'll just have to keep sustaining
the world's capitalist system.

461
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,280
(Speaking Spanish):
And the other one?

462
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:30,880
The rest will be transferred when
the shipment arrives at Gioia Tauro.

463
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,800
It's a big load.
What if it doesn't get there?

464
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,880
Then we all take a loss.

465
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,840
Bigger risk than usual.

466
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,560
Bigger the risk,
greater the profit.

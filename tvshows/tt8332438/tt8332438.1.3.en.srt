2
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,600
What happened?

3
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,280
What the fuck do we do now, Manuel?
The whole Army will be on our ass!

4
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,878
God has already shown me the way.

5
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,400
And what is this fucking way?

6
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,078
Why don't you wait for me upstairs?

7
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,960
- I'll be right up with a drink.
- Yeah.

8
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,480
How old is she?

9
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,840
You're all over the news, asshole.

10
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,360
The shipment left safe and sound.

11
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,358
I did my job.

12
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,038
- What do you want?
- A meeting with the Leyras.

13
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,480
You're too hot to go near them now.

14
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,920
It's not a question.

15
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,798
What's all this?

16
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,040
You think I give a shit about her?

17
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,478
Kill her.

18
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,200
Kill her, motherfucker. Go on!

19
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,198
I think you're misunderstanding
our presence here.

20
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,360
You're a dead man, asshole.
You and all your shitbag men. Get it?

21
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,518
How do you think we got in?

22
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,000
By politely asking your goons
if we could have a chat with you?

23
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,920
Mexico trained us to be the best.
And we are.

24
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,480
That's why I want to suggest

25
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,640
you make life easier
for your bosses, the Leyras...

26
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,958
or make it more difficult for them.

27
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,638
Why don't you cut the bullshit

28
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,838
and tell me what the fuck
you're doing in my house?

29
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,160
I already told you, a meeting.

30
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,320
Or else?

31
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,080
Or else...

32
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,678
I'll boil you alive.

33
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,080
Starting with your feet.

34
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,840
And when they're cooked,
I'll cut them off

35
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,078
and I'll keep you alive
so you can eat them...

36
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,440
right down to the toenails.

37
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
What do you say?

38
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,638
Hello, Chief. Who are these guys?

39
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,758
They came to see the boss.

40
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,520
Open up, motherfucker.

41
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,240
Open up.

42
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,158
God has told me that
our future lies in your organization.

43
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,358
You can tell your God

44
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,758
that a bunch
of ex-soldiers don't do me any good.

45
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,800
We don't see things
from the same perspective, sir.

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
What perspective
are you talking about, Manuel?

47
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,478
You aren't taking advantage
of your dominance in the marketplace.

48
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,560
You keep selling wholesale
when you could be selling retail.

49
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,518
So you're suggesting
to pay the dealers on every street?

50
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,158
That's impossible.

51
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,038
You don't have to pay them,
you just have to control them.

52
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,078
And that's our expertise.

53
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,920
And you need all these men for this?

54
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,758
Who is the least skilled?

55
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,478
We're all skilled.

56
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,480
I didn't ask that. The least skilled...

57
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,240
One, two, three...

58
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,758
I'll pick four.

59
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,600
The fifth... we'll kill him.

60
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,558
Well, I say... we'll kill this one.

61
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,958
This little shit, okay?

62
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,360
But I don't know, you decide.

63
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,238
What?
We need men who obey.

64
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,918
- You need loyal men.
- Loyal to us, asshole!

65
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Come on.

66
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,158
- Easy!
- Shoot, asshole, shoot!

67
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,158
I'll wipe out everyone
you've ever known!

68
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,800
Jacinto...

69
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,798
We came here to work.

70
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,760
All of us.

71
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,400
God wants it this way.

72
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,440
Let's talk, Manuel.

73
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,078
There's no way we can take the ship
to Gioia Tauro.

74
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,318
Our best bet is to do
what the Mexican said.

75
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,558
Trans-ship in the port of Dakar,
get a clean boat and finish that way.

76
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,760
Until then, we shut down AIS and
INMARSAT and we stay out of sight.

77
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,718
Okay.

78
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,038
Chart a course for Senegal.

79
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,278
Sounders. I want full speed,
all the way there.

80
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,920
- Add whatever watches you need.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,360
I was boarded by pirates once.

82
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,120
It was many years ago,
when your father still liked to sail.

83
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,838
Six of them boarded,
held us at gunpoint.

84
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,880
Your father was a tougher man
than anyone had ever met, but...

85
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,480
when you have a rifle
between the eyes...

86
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,080
There is no such thing
as a hero at sea.

87
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,158
Mister Lynwood, can I help you?

88
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,278
I just want to see it in action.

89
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,720
- You need ear protection.
- I know.

90
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,878
I was just in the aux engine room.

91
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,918
And I noticed
there was oil everywhere.

92
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,718
And I went over to the cylinders.

93
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,838
And they were loose,
they were pouring oil.

94
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,958
I'm sure somebody just
missed it on the maintenance check.

95
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,478
No, every single one of the filters
was loose.

96
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,638
If we hit rough waters,
started up those engines

97
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,798
there'd be a fire in ten minutes.

98
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,478
I know what I am talking about,
you know that.

99
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,678
I grew up on your boats.

100
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,438
I tend not to assume malice
when stupidity's on the table.

101
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,040
They didn't just loosen themselves.

102
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,118
Don't worry. I've been working
with those guys for many years.

103
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,440
Your father knows them.

104
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,000
All of them.

105
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,198
Luzvimino, right?

106
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,560
- You work in the oil room?
- Yes, sir.

107
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,998
Nice boat, isn't it?

108
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,238
We thought about going
with a two-stroke,

109
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,718
but after looking at the start-up cost
we decided to go with this one.

110
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,160
Do you need something, Mr Lynwood?

111
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,280
Why are you trying
to start an engine fire?

112
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,718
What do you mean?

113
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,078
I have you on tape unscrewing the oil
cylinders on one of the aux engines.

114
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,918
I don't know
what you're talking about.

115
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
Don't fuck with me!

116
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,040
I need you to tell me
what the fuck is going on.

117
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,320
Why are you trying
to burn down my ship?

118
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,438
He told me to do it, I'm sorry, pal.
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

119
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,278
Who told you?

120
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,680
Who the fuck told you?

121
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,720
The Chief engineer.

122
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,038
Have you talked
to anyone about this?

123
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,118
No, I came straight to you,
but we need to call Emma.

124
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,478
No, no, no!
It's too dangerous.

125
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,078
Anything with the transmitter
stays off until we unload.

126
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,160
- I need to tell her what's going on.
- You don't need to tell her anything.

127
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,558
Fuck.

128
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,238
Fuck! No!

129
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,560
Fuck!

130
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,920
Fuck!

131
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,720
You need a ride home.

132
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,080
How long have you been doing this work?

133
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,520
Since I was 20.

134
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,198
I love the sea.

135
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,840
You can see the Strait of Messina
from my window.

136
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,560
I hate the sea.

137
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,758
I hate these new mega ships
that sail on their own,

138
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,198
the Filipino crews paid peanuts

139
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,000
who don't even know what the sea is.

140
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,358
It wasn't like that before.

141
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,960
When I started, it was all different.

142
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,640
Turn right, here.

143
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,478
Why don't you quit?

144
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,200
- What else could I do?
- Enjoy life.

145
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,478
We can get you 100,000 dollars
the day after tomorrow.

146
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,680
And a million euros when it's done,
wherever you want.

147
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,078
What do you want?

148
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,640
We want to be sure the shipment
never gets to Gioia Tauro.

149
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,200
- How?
- I don't care how.

150
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,120
What matters is that no one
ever knows it was you or us.

151
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,678
Edward Lynwood was my friend.

152
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,880
Now he's dead.

153
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,520
Right?

154
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,238
What's your brother's wife doing here?

155
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,838
Where's Nicola?

156
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,918
- He was supposed to meet us.
- Your brother didn't come home.

157
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,518
He's been missing since yesterday,
he's not answering his phone.

158
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,600
He had to see a guy,
but I don't know who.

159
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,600
Come with Uncle.

160
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,200
It's your fuckin' grandfather.

161
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
What a lovely <i>parmigiana!</i>

162
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,280
- The American's back.
- Where is he?

163
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,440
Where is he?

164
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,758
Look how you've grown!

165
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,598
My knees reach your shoulders.

166
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,278
Tell me how much you missed Daddy.

167
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,678
This much.

168
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,798
- Do you know how much I missed you?
- No.

169
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,760
This much!

170
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,880
Go with Mommy.

171
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,718
Don't worry, we'll fix this.

172
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,758
You've always fixed everything.
Remember that.

173
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,398
Daddy, wanna come play with my truck?

174
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,280
Yes, you go to the living room,
I'll be right there.

175
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,400
Your grandfather wants you.

176
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,640
He wants to speak to you.

177
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,040
I'll see you tonight.

178
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,920
Yes, will you put your son to bed?

179
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,520
Get my jacket.

180
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,480
Hi, Stefano.
Sit down.

181
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,800
You must be hungry.

182
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,800
Eat something.

183
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,280
How come
you didn't tell me about America?

184
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,760
You had the cops on your ass
and your contact was dead.

185
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,878
So you tried to take the shipment away
from Emma Lynwood?

186
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,478
I went to offer my condolences,
and get to know them.

187
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,040
The boy let the girl boss him around.

188
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,878
You put important stuff in her hands.

189
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,200
In my opinion they're a couple
of fools with no experience.

190
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,518
Edward's daughter...

191
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,040
I saw her baptized
thirty years ago in America.

192
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,240
I know more than you.

193
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,160
I made a mistake
thinking I was doing right, Grandpa.

194
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,838
- Welcome, Don Minu.
- Benedetto.

195
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,720
Good to see you.

196
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,320
Thank you.

197
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,640
She's ready, Dad.

198
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,360
Here.

199
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,680
Come here!

200
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,440
What's wrong?

201
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,078
Come here!

202
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,880
Hold her still.

203
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,758
What happened to the courier

204
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,920
has put all the families on edge.

205
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,958
The shipment is in transit.

206
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,158
And they haven't asked us
for an extra cent.

207
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,160
The shipment will arrive,
everyone can put their mind at ease.

208
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,600
And if it doesn't arrive?

209
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,718
Then my enemies win

210
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,840
and I die with all those
who are still loyal to me.

211
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,638
This will be few.

212
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,080
Very few.

213
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,678
Don Minu...

214
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,958
I've been wanting to talk
to you for a long time.

215
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,600
Then talk.

216
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,960
My son...

217
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,880
took care of a rival.

218
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,200
And now the guy's mother
is asking around.

219
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,800
If we don't tell her what happened,
she'll go to the cops.

220
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,558
Does she know her son is dead?

221
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,438
Yes.

222
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,558
And that your son killed him?

223
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,160
Yes, she knows.

224
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,358
She wants to bury him.

225
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,278
With all due respect, Don Minu...
we know what we have to do.

226
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,398
That woman has to be buried
together with her son.

227
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,120
If you'll allow it,
I'll do the job personally.

228
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,560
Women and children
are never to be touched.

229
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,918
Tell people

230
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,718
that when they hear about her son,

231
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,278
they ignore her

232
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,840
and turn away.

233
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,400
Do you mind if I use the bathroom?

234
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,120
Please.

235
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,000
Where are you?

236
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,600
Page 39.

237
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,118
Italo, it's Lucia. I spoke to Stefano.

238
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,120
They are at Bellantone's house.

239
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,878
Thank you, everybody.
We have to go now.

240
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,038
- You're always welcome, Don Minu.
- Grandpa, it's getting late.

241
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,200
I'm sure Don Benedetto's happy
to put you up for the night.

242
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,278
I've got a place for you, out back.

243
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,398
There's everything you need.

244
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,320
Thanks a lot, Benedetto.

245
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,438
But I need to take my grandson
somewhere else.

246
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,520
Say goodbye, Stefano.

247
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,240
I might come back later
tonight, Benedetto.

248
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,920
Give it to me.

249
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,918
- What?
- Give it to me,

250
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,600
don't make me ask again.

251
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,880
You know why the last war started?

252
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,920
They attacked you.
And my father fought back.

253
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,520
That's what they say.

254
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,920
But that's not true.

255
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,880
Your father and Gianni Curtiga
attacked first.

256
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,878
They began this war
to gain control of our organization.

257
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,040
My father would never have done that.

258
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,518
Your father and Curtiga's father

259
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:31,158
went to the house of a guy who
had been a friend until the day before.

260
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,678
They killed his wife
and his 7-year-old daughter.

261
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,718
These are just rumors.

262
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,240
I had no choice, Stefano.

263
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,958
My father was a gentleman.

264
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,800
It was the only way to end the war.

265
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,720
He was your son.

266
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,320
He was your blood!

267
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,158
It broke my heart...

268
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,160
but I had to do it
for the good of all the families.

269
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,080
At least now you know the truth.

270
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,360
Don't touch my wife or my son.

271
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,758
Nicola?

272
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,160
Keep moving.

273
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,918
Wait! Nicola!

274
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,118
Let me go!

275
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,400
Stay here. Don't move.

276
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,638
Stefano, come here! You left me alone!

277
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,640
You piece of shit!

278
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,640
You left me alone!

279
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,318
- You left me all alone!
- I can't come, Nicola!

280
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,238
- Stefano, come here!
- I can't.

281
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,120
I can't...

282
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,600
Sorry, Nicola.

283
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,520
The last thing I wanted
in my life was a war.

284
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,240
But now you're bringing it to me.

285
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,760
I'll win this war, Stefano.

286
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,520
After your father died,
I went into hiding.

287
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,840
You were the one
I missed more than anyone.

288
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,920
You were the age your son is now.

289
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,960
Stefano...

290
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,680
I don't want to do to you
what I once did to your father.

291
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,120
You have to choose, Stefano.

292
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,360
Choose which side to take.

293
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,280
You won't get another chance.

294
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,240
Try to move beyond hatred, Stefano.

295
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,320
Who is it?

296
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,960
Franco!

297
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,600
This way.

298
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,400
Go, go!

299
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,520
Go!

300
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,240
Stefano!

301
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,120
- They know everything.
- What happened?

302
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,118
He killed Nicola right before my eyes!

303
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,798
- Where the fuck's he heading?
- We need to go after him.

304
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,040
Lift him up or he'll bleed out!
Let's go!

304
00:55:50,305 --> 00:56:50,915

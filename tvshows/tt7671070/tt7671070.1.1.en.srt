1
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,978
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

2
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:16,269
I've never seen anyone
put their IQ on a CV before.

3
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,269
How many of these have you had?

4
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:25,395
Nine. Four in New York,
four here, and a Skype.

5
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:27,770
Why are you here, then?

6
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:32,353
Well, it's not a very
political answer, but...

7
00:00:32,436 --> 00:00:34,395
I think mediocrity
is too well-hidden

8
00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:36,269
by parents
who hire private tutors.

9
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,770
I am here on my own.

10
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:43,186
I want to be able
to explain myself clearly,

11
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:46,019
um, and have people
be receptive to my ideas.

12
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:48,311
Is that how you get
your validation?

13
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:49,728
People listening to you?

14
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:52,353
As opposed to, uh...?

15
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:54,311
Every successful business

16
00:00:54,395 --> 00:00:56,478
is full of people
who've spent money

17
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:58,561
nurturing unremarkable talent.

18
00:00:58,645 --> 00:01:00,120
Why did you read Geography?

19
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:03,353
Geography had the least amount
of applicants the year before.

20
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:06,687
You know, it's a marginal game
about marginal gains.

21
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,728
Nothing wrong
with the back door.

22
00:01:08,812 --> 00:01:12,061
I played third fiddle to two
figures in my mother's life,

23
00:01:12,144 --> 00:01:15,144
Jesus Christ
and Margaret Thatcher.

24
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:16,603
And where do you stand on them?

25
00:01:16,687 --> 00:01:20,728
One's the reason we're all here,
and the other's a carpenter.

26
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:24,603
I think this is the closest
thing to a meritocracy there is.

27
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:27,520
And I only ever want
to be judged

28
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:28,978
on the strength of my abilities.

29
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:30,978
And paid for it.

30
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:33,311
I guess.

31
00:01:33,395 --> 00:01:36,395
I didn't realize
that we recruited

32
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,269
from SUNY Binghamton.

33
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:40,728
It's a nontarget.

34
00:01:40,812 --> 00:01:42,645
Can you tell us a joke?

35
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,269
Uh, ye... yeah.

36
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:48,812
Uh, it's a bit for work,
um, or whatever.

37
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:50,728
You know how many mountains
I'd have to move

38
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:52,645
to get you to London for good?

39

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,478
You don't look sure
how to navigate that.

41
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:36,322
<i>Would this year's
graduate class please assemble</i>

42
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:40,770
<i>in the second-floor auditorium
for your week-three induction.</i>

43
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:42,687
You ready to be indoctrinated?

44
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:44,728
See you down there.

45
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:48,561
Sure I can't get you anything?

46
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:51,770
Uh, yeah, Robert,

47
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:53,204
I've been meaning to ask,
actually.

48
00:02:53,228 --> 00:02:55,144
Um, did someone
very close to you die?

49
00:02:55,228 --> 00:02:56,579
It's a very dark suit.

50
00:02:56,603 --> 00:02:59,144
I'm sorry for your loss,
but have you left the, uh,

51
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:01,478
label on your sleeve
there as well? Wow!

52
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:02,603
Yeah, it's new.

53
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:04,412
Yeah, you look like
regional nightclub security.

54
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:05,937
Stag do security.

55
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,061
Actually, let me just...

56
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:08,687
- Oh!
- Let me just do that for you,

57
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,496
before you embarrass yourself
in front of your peers.

58
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,103
You see, what you've done there
is actually erect a billboard

59
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:15,728
- to how gauche you are.
- Yeah, nice one.

60
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:19,061
Uh, Robert wears Ted Baker,
ladies and gentlemen!

61
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:20,228
- Whoo!
- Just so you know!

62
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:22,353
- I think you look great.
- Thanks.

63
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,812
The Undertaker, Attitude Era!

64
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:36,978
<i>Doors opening.</i>

65
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,770
Hi.

66
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:48,687
Um, I think we met
at the drinks?

67
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,436
I don't think that was me.

68
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:53,436
Okay.

69
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:57,645
It's cool. Free bar.

70
00:03:57,728 --> 00:03:59,395
I'm Yasmin from FX sales.

71
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:01,019
I think we work on
the same floor.

72
00:04:01,103 --> 00:04:02,687
Harper, CPS team.

73
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:09,228
He works on my team.
He's a whole snacc.

74
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:11,978
If you're into that kinda thing,
I guess.

75
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:14,103
Welcome, graduates.

76
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:20,103
Young people are our capital.

77
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:22,311
Graduates are our capital.

78
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,228
And while it's my pleasure
to congratulate you

79
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:26,436
on this placement,

80
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,061
the work to stay here
starts now.

81
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,353
Which senior vouches for you,

82
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:33,770
the impression that you make
on clients,

83
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:35,812
will all be evaluated.

84
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:38,061
In six months' time,
on RIF day...

85
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,103
That's Reduction in Force...
You'll be standing in this room,

86
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:43,103
telling all of us...

87
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:46,603
why you should be hired
permanently to your desk.

88
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:47,937
Pierpoint is the world's

89
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,353
preeminent
financial services institution.

90
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:53,937
We expect you to behave
like you have a stake in it.

91
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:58,269
Act like an owner.
Enrich your clients, enrich us,

92
00:04:58,353 --> 00:04:59,687
enrich yourselves.

93
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,978
So, look at the guy
or gal next to you.

94
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:06,186
Really look. Do you think
you're better than them?

95
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:07,937
Maybe you are.

96
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:10,561
But half of you won't be here
in six months.

97
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:13,853
Just make yourselves
indispensable.

98
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:20,436
Extra dirty
chai with a scoop of whey.

99
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:23,311
Skinny latte.

100
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:24,829
...whatever he tells you to do.

101
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:26,520
Is there anything
you want looking at?

102
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:30,311
We were on his catamaran,

103
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:32,395
and then the guide
caught some grouper

104
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,436
and fried it
on the side of the boat.

105
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,812
Yeah, it was beautiful.

106
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:41,645
Hey, ask Rishi for the level
of one year, one year, euro swap

107
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:43,186
in 500k DV01.

108
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:44,829
They don't call me
promiscuous...

109
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:46,520
- Rishi.
- Today, please.

110
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,061
Rishi?

111
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:50,478
- Can you send...
- Relax.

112
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:52,395
It's not an auction house.

113
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,770
I've just sent out my runs.
They're on your Bloomie.

114
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:56,770
You can sit down now.

115
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:02,603
I was talking
to Felim at Fenmarsh.

116
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:05,478
He's impressed with that US tail
risk work you did for him.

117
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:07,019
He sent me an email
to say thanks.

118
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,621
Sorry, I didn't want
to clog your inbox.

119
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:11,019
Don't apologize. Just remember
to talk your book here,

120
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:12,353
or people will miss it.

121
00:06:12,436 --> 00:06:14,895
We want to get you printing
business as soon as possible.

122
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:21,436
Oh, Harper. Harper.

123
00:06:22,186 --> 00:06:24,103
- Hi.
- Hey.

124
00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:25,687
Sorry, just catch my breath.

125
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,645
- Sure.
- Cycled in.

126
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:29,687
- Hmm.
- Uh...

127
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,853
Yes, uh, I still don't have
your university transcript.

128
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:36,353
I'm really sorry.
I will get on it.

129
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:38,978
Hmm. You said that last week.

130
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:45,311
Oh, Harper Stern, you're an
international candidate, right?

131
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:48,520
I'm still missing
your transcript.

132
00:06:48,603 --> 00:06:50,895
I'm still waiting
on my college to send a copy.

133
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,812
They are notoriously slow.

134
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,415
We're moving out of
that gray area now,

135
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:57,204
where it's becoming a bit
of a problem for us,

136
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:00,103
and therefore a problem for you.

137
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,061
Sorry.
You may continue your quest.

138
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:04,478
- Ah.
- For the loo.

139
00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:06,186
Thank you.

140
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,978
- Harper.
- Hey.

141
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:22,228
Have you been home?

142
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,269
You're just, like,
never in your room,

143
00:07:24,353 --> 00:07:28,144
and you're wearing an...
identical outfit to yesterday?

144
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:30,770
Uh, well, I'm logging
those nocturnal hours.

145
00:07:30,853 --> 00:07:32,728
Trying to make
a good impression, you know?

146
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,645
Don't try to figure out

147
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,937
how much you get paid
by the hour in IBD,

148
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:41,144
because I will guarantee you
it is less than minimum wage.

149
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:44,978
Well, the way I see it,
I'm in the ivory tower upstairs,

150
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:48,561
you're down here on the floor
with the peasants.

151
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:54,103
Nice.

152
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:12,687
Well, for a minute, I thought
you were actually gonna talk.

153
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,978
You know, you've been here
for three weeks,

154
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:18,770
and you've barely said a word
to me.

155
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:21,061
I'm sorry.
I've just been underwater

156
00:08:21,144 --> 00:08:22,937
backing up Eric's accounts.

157
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,561
I know we both work for Eric,

158
00:08:24,645 --> 00:08:26,061
but I'm your line manager.

159
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:29,228
Has he asked you
to meet clients?

160
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:33,186
No. For sure not, no.

161
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:34,520
Well, I've got this dinner

162
00:08:34,603 --> 00:08:36,645
tomorrow night
with Mallon Mercer.

163
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:38,895
Nicole Craig. It's a bit
of a one-way relationship,

164
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:41,103
but substantial to the firm.

165
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,645
It's a chance to increase
your visibility as a grad.

166
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:45,645
Do you want to tag along?

167
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:47,770
Yeah. Yes.

168
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:49,353
I'll look into her mandate.

169
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:50,770
Don't overthink it.

170
00:09:09,812 --> 00:09:12,520
Are you that thirsty?

171
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:16,353
Well, you know, if you got
a 30 quid meal allowance,

172
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:18,395
like, why would you not
use all of it?

173
00:09:18,478 --> 00:09:19,770
That's very naff.

174
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,186
How's your model?

175
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:25,937
I'll finish it in the morning.

176
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,228
Send it over my way,
I've got capacity.

177
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:31,895
How do you have capacity?

178
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:35,144
- Brutal finance guy, innit?
- I don't know what that is.

179
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:36,978
You bouncing?

180
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:41,269
Hey, man. Hey. It's only 10:15.

181
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:44,978
No one here is actually
gonna tell you this,

182
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:46,770
but you need
to put in face time.

183
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,061
Actually, I don't.

184
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:50,436
Staying up all night doesn't
enhance my work.

185
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,853
Mate. Mate!

186
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:22,871
<i>- Let me see your room.</i>
- My room?

187
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:24,561
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Yeah, check it.

188
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:26,269
It's Pierpoint's
temp accommodation

189
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,728
- for out-of-towners.
<i>- Mm-hmm. Okay, okay, okay.</i>

190
00:11:30,603 --> 00:11:32,103
<i>Looks crazy.</i>

191
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:34,353
<i>How easy is it to get
them Ivy League niggas</i>

192
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:35,520
<i>to come home with you?</i>

193
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:37,019
I'm just here to work.

194
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:40,853
- It's only with you
that everything becomes sexual.

195
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:42,645
<i>So the only reason
you're calling me</i>

196
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:44,436
<i>is that you want
a fake transcript?</i>

197
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:47,311
<i>You must need it pretty bad.</i>

198
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:49,978
<i>You sure that's all you need?</i>

199
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,978
Why? What else would I want?

200
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:56,561
<i>What are you offering?</i>

201
00:11:56,645 --> 00:11:58,478
Did you get a job yet, Todd?

202
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:01,103
<i>Nah, I did some unpaid shit.</i>

203
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:04,812
<i>It's hard to make money
off your passion.</i>

204
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:07,395
<i>You know,
unless your passion's... money.</i>

205
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:08,561
Fuck you.

206
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,895
<i>Okay,
but if I can make your bank</i>

207
00:12:10,978 --> 00:12:13,478
<i>think you graduated,
what's that worth to you?</i>

208
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:16,728
What, you didn't get
to fuck tonight? Is that it?

209
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:42,478
<i>Ass up. What that ass do?</i>

210
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:15,478
You don't listen to what
Daddy says. He's going to...

211
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,019
Just ignore it.

212
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:18,746
This morning meeting's
about to start, mate.

213
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,478
If... if what Daddy said
actually affected you,

214
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:25,186
then you wouldn't still be
on the phone now.

215
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:28,061
- Why have you changed the WACC?
- The DCF was coming out too low.

216
00:13:28,144 --> 00:13:30,371
Well, how does it compare
to the transaction comps?

217
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:32,812
These pre-profit unicorns
trade on crazy multiples.

218
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,144
Eight times, nine times.

219
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:36,812
Less a liquidity discount,
we'd be just over the DCF.

220
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,061
All right, fantastic.

221
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,353
What's that?

222
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:41,728
That's my model.

223
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:43,412
Why are you
doing the model?
Gus is doing the model.

224
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:44,871
I had capacity.
I just wanted to get ahead.

225
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:46,353
Hari, I told you to do
the pitchbook,

226
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:47,978
so do
the fucking pitchbook, okay?

227
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,812
HungerFix want to optimize
delivery speed,

228
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,395
so they're looking at mid-caps
with best-in-class GPS tech.

229
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:54,478
Clear comps.
Deliveroo, Uber Eats...

230
00:13:54,561 --> 00:13:56,269
I've found something
with good sat-nav IP.

231
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:58,037
- They're quite small...
- Don't fucking fish!

232
00:13:58,061 --> 00:13:59,478
Stick to the formatting.

233
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:01,978
And for fuck sake, make sure
the font's Helvetica 12

234
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:03,144
or the MD will freak.

235
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:04,995
And I might have to take one
of you into the pitch.

236
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:07,103
I'll lead, but it'll be good
for your visibility.

237
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,978
- Why are you doing my model?
- Mate, it's the team's work.

238
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:18,019
No, it's my work.

239
00:14:18,103 --> 00:14:20,520
It's not my fault you feel
the need to keep score.

240
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:21,728
I don't.

241
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:27,144
So, I'm guessing last night
was Boisdale?

242
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:32,019
Boisdale. Five Hertford,
and then, inevitably, Annabel's.

243
00:14:32,103 --> 00:14:33,853
The triumvirate.

244
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:36,019
Like the embrace
of an old friend.

245
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:41,019
Right. Okay, um...
So, I've published a piece

246
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:43,687
looking back
at the decade post-crisis.

247
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,770
Three stages. Housing,
2007 to 2009...

248
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:51,645
How are we supposed to monetize
what's in the rear-view mirror?

249
00:14:51,728 --> 00:14:52,937
Well, um...

250
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:55,269
Any new buy recommendations?

251
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,228
Still overweight
with a preference for the US.

252
00:14:57,311 --> 00:15:00,478
Even with margins and
valuations at all-time highs?

253
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:03,812
Why bother publishing if
there are no material changes?

254
00:15:07,395 --> 00:15:10,687
Well, I suppose Kaspar can pay
for my personality.

255
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,019
Well, you can read my note
out loud to him if you'd like.

256
00:15:13,103 --> 00:15:15,645
It's not exactly
commercial, is it?

257
00:15:15,728 --> 00:15:18,395
Once again,
the research team excel

258
00:15:18,478 --> 00:15:20,812
in wasting salespeople's time.

259
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:23,645
Oh, another walkout.

260
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:30,728
So, it's one cob
with bacon, no Stilton,

261
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:33,269
and the other one without...
No, no, no, wait. Sorry.

262
00:15:33,353 --> 00:15:37,603
The first one I need with bacon.
Um, thank you. And, uh... Oh.

263
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,228
Sorry, I specifically said,
"No dressing."

264
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:04,019
Keeping the cattle fed
and watered?

265
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:12,311
My first proper dinner
was with Philippe Jabre.

266
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:15,269
You know, from hedge funds?
He's famous.

267
00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:18,436
Dozen of us at Nobu,
pre-08 Nobu.

268
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,978
I had gastroenteritis.

269
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:22,228
Threw up at the table.

270
00:16:23,728 --> 00:16:26,228
Jabre said it was the first
interesting thing

271
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:28,478
to come out of my mouth
all night.

272
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:29,895
That's only half true.

273
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:35,645
But he still called.

274
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,812
I still printed his business.

275
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:39,478
That's the bar.

276
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:41,978
Don't let Daria tell you
it's just dinner.

277
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:43,561
I'll work on a pitch.

278
00:16:44,645 --> 00:16:46,120
Which grad do you have to bully

279
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:48,436
to get a fucking sanger?

280
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,353
Felim, how was Capri?

281
00:16:56,228 --> 00:16:58,937
- You need to get out of here.
- Why?

282
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,853
You've only left the building
once in the last 48 hours.

283
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,395
It's automatically red flagged
by your ID card.

284
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:06,358
I don't want to know
where you've been sleeping,

285
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:09,269
but optically, I need you
to walk out of the office,

286
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:12,978
tap your card out, do whatever,
then come back.

287
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:16,353
- No more red flag.
- Okay. Sorry.

288
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,687
You're not in trouble.

289
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,788
I appreciate how you're meeting
the needs of the business.

290
00:17:19,812 --> 00:17:21,770
Oh... Thanks.

291
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:23,520
Get rid of
the fucking water, yeah?

292
00:17:23,603 --> 00:17:25,269
And don't take the piss.

293
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:31,687
Go grab a pint.

294
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,728
I might come find you
when the work's done.

295
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,186
No rest for the wicked.

296
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,120
<i>Women of power</i>

297
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:04,895
<i>seem to like to withhold
sunlight from women coming up.</i>

298
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:07,978
<i>It's not cool.
We can't be doing that.</i>

299
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:09,186
<i>The success...</i>

300
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:18,019
You're a bit of a masochist.

301
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:20,895
- Excuse me?
- Negging Clement in the meeting.

302
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:22,561
I spent months writing something

303
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:25,853
for the fucking salesmen
to parrot over the phone,

304
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:28,353
and Clement doesn't even have
the humility to listen

305
00:18:28,436 --> 00:18:29,770
for five fucking minutes.

306
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:31,436
Yeah,
but his war stories though.

307
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,019
He's a fucking dinosaur.

308
00:18:34,103 --> 00:18:37,228
It took two years for him to say
"good morning" to me.

309
00:18:37,311 --> 00:18:38,853
He's never going
to speak to you.

310
00:18:38,937 --> 00:18:41,436
Yeah, all right, mate. Whatever.

311
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,269
I'm just saying, don't think

312
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:45,770
that a guy like that's
gonna protect you on RIF.

313
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:48,603
Clement, he's... he's got Kaspar,
that's one fucking account,

314
00:18:48,687 --> 00:18:50,687
and yeah, it's... it's big,

315
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,436
but the only way to guarantee
you survive is to say,

316
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,895
"I am an originator.
I won new business."

317
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,228
I remember
I was with, um, Adrian.

318
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:12,603
Come on, what did this place
used to be called?

319
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:15,311
It's, uh, come on,
it used to have

320
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:18,478
some really awful
single syllable name

321
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:20,895
like "Stunt,"
or something like that.

322
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:22,895
Looked like
a fucking building site.

323
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:29,561
So, um, does she have a...
Does she have an "ON" button?

324
00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:44,144
Uh, I was looking into

325
00:19:44,228 --> 00:19:46,895
- the business you did with...
- Right. Uh, priorities.

326
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,687
Shall we get some wine

327
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,937
that doesn't taste
like paint thinner?

328
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:54,603
- Abso-fucking-lutely.
- Yeah.

329
00:19:54,687 --> 00:19:56,561
Okay, what do we have?

330
00:20:01,978 --> 00:20:03,520
Do you, uh, do you know Gus?

331
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:07,103
Uh, yeah, yeah, I live with him.
I lived with him at uni.

332
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:10,687
Oh, uh, we... we sort of
lost touch while he was there.

333
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,228
I went to school with him.
With all those guys.

334
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,829
Surprised it took you that long
to mention Eton.

335
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:18,311
Two years above.
"House Captain," he said.

336
00:20:19,895 --> 00:20:21,770
I know a lot about you two.

337
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:26,228
Yeah.

338
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,603
Catch you later.

339
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:34,704
Saying
"Everything's gonna be okay"
over and over

340
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:37,353
doesn't stop your house
burning down around you,
does it?

341
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,311
Eventually we shall be
eating our pets.

342
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:43,144
Well, if that's your philosophy,
you could trade it.

343
00:20:43,228 --> 00:20:46,061
Hmm, extremely reasonable
at twice the price.

344
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,728
I'm... I'm being sarcastic.
It's is reassuringly expensive.

345
00:20:49,812 --> 00:20:52,144
Buy an option on the US ten year
at four percent.

346
00:20:52,228 --> 00:20:53,895
Yields haven't been there

347
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:55,645
since before you were born.

348
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:57,853
Actually,
since the early aughts.

349
00:20:57,937 --> 00:20:59,520
Were you even sentient then?

350
00:20:59,603 --> 00:21:02,019
Sorry, Nicole,
graduates don't normally pitch.

351
00:21:02,103 --> 00:21:04,353
Fuck that, let her talk.

352
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:06,395
With the president
bulldozing the reputation

353
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:08,353
of the US overseas, you know,

354
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:10,019
for me, it follows that...

355
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:13,019
the administration will totally
kill the rep of treasuries.

356
00:21:13,103 --> 00:21:15,436
And pissing in China's mouth
isn't gonna help.

357
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,645
Exactly. Personally?

358
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:18,603
I just think we're due
an enormous selloff.

359
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:20,447
We're low key throwing ourselves
in cold wars

360
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,228
with all
of our trading partners.

361
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:25,269
China are the biggest
global holder of US paper.

362
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:28,853
If they start dumping, yields
will soar past four percent.

363
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:31,395
If you think the house
is burning down,

364
00:21:31,478 --> 00:21:33,186
this is how you monetize it.

365
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:38,311
Bearish people
lose money in this market.

366
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:40,269
Yeah, but the world's
pregnant with tail risk.

367
00:21:40,353 --> 00:21:43,228
Right, and this is a play
for the end.

368
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:45,478
Who wants another drink, anyone?

369
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:48,770
My PT hates it
when I'm hungover.

370
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:52,269
We are gonna have to love you
and leave you, I'm afraid.

371
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,603
- As hard as that is.
- Right, well, I won't get up.

372
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:57,478
Fine for you to piss off to bed,

373
00:21:57,561 --> 00:21:59,812
but I'll let Harper
finish her thoughts, yeah?

374
00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:00,895
Right.

375
00:22:03,561 --> 00:22:04,603
Nicole.

376
00:22:06,353 --> 00:22:08,228
Harper. Pick up the bill.

377
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,770
Mikey, you should be fresh
in the morning.

378
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,645
Yeah,
I'll be the responsible one.

379
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:19,269
Uh, here is my card.

380
00:22:19,353 --> 00:22:20,520
Thank you.

381
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:25,395
So, I can write up an email...

382
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:27,436
I don't think
you're a saleswoman.

383
00:22:30,061 --> 00:22:31,228
That's a compliment.

384
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:35,269
Salespeople sell... certainty.

385
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:37,728
Ah, lovely.

386
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,269
What a life.

387
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:48,978
Got us an Uber.

388
00:22:52,061 --> 00:22:54,186
There's two times surge.

389
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:56,019
You pay twice as much to go home

390
00:22:56,103 --> 00:22:58,103
and have half the fun.

391
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:01,269
Wipe your fucking nose.

392
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:04,728
It only takes two pints,
doesn't it?

393
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:10,311
All the Outreach guys together,
of course.

394
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:13,853
- It's a scheme for...
- Diversity hires, I know.

395
00:23:13,937 --> 00:23:15,561
Gus thinks he's above all that.

396
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,978
- I resent your friendship.
- Good. You're staying out.

397
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:20,895
Yeah, I'm not sure I can be seen
fraternizing with you two.

398
00:23:20,978 --> 00:23:23,228
I'm sober as a judge.

399
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:26,103
- Get in the car, man. Go home.
- Don't push me.

400
00:23:29,478 --> 00:23:31,436
Try not to throw up in there.

401
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,436
Yeah, mate, Pierpoint.

402
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,186
Take him home, please.
Destination's in.

403
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:57,520
I can write up that option idea
for you in the morning.

404
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:01,978
If you want.

405
00:24:14,395 --> 00:24:15,478
Okay.

406
00:24:16,937 --> 00:24:19,812
Can I come a bit closer?

407
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:27,520
I'm so tired.

408
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:17,687
He can drop you anywhere.

409
00:25:34,186 --> 00:25:35,269
Sou... Southwark.

410
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,269
It's not my house.

411
00:25:58,353 --> 00:26:00,812
It's not my house!

412
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:02,853
My house doesn't have balconies.

413
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,103
It's what you put
in the system, mate.

414
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:10,520
No, no, no.
No, no, no. I'm... I'm fine.

415
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:11,683
Dude, if I leave you alone,

416
00:26:11,728 --> 00:26:13,520
you're gonna choke
on your own vomit.

417
00:26:16,812 --> 00:26:20,311
- Ten minutes, ten minutes.
- Yeah, okay.

418
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:24,144
<i>How's IBD? You're out early.</i>

419
00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:26,061
Uh...

420
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:28,269
Yeah, I don't know, I think...

421
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,853
I think
they treat me differently.

422
00:26:30,937 --> 00:26:34,603
Like I went to state school,
and...

423
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:37,770
they... they... they even
talk to me differently.

424
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:40,853
This guy on my desk, Gus,

425
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:44,687
I feel like he makes it
his personal business...

426
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,061
trying to make me feel like
I'm unworthy of it or something.

427
00:26:49,645 --> 00:26:52,561
He sounds like
a fucking asshole.

428
00:26:57,978 --> 00:27:00,978
This weird thing happened
at dinner with this woman.

429
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,228
A client.

430
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:06,561
That's good. You're doing
dinners with clients already.

431
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:09,144
Yeah. Daria, my line manager,

432
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:11,937
just invited me out of the blue.

433
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:13,937
It went really well.

434
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:16,561
And the... the client,
she gave me a ride home,

435
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:17,812
and...

436
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:19,853
she sort of...

437
00:27:21,228 --> 00:27:22,645
touched me...

438
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:28,061
and she's a woman, you know?

439
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:30,561
But I don't know,
it was still kind of...

440
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:34,353
weird.

441
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:36,812
I thought she bit on an idea,

442
00:27:36,895 --> 00:27:39,978
but she won't want
to deal with me now.

443
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:43,728
There's no way that it could get
back to Pierpoint, right?

444
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:46,395
Hari?

445
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:38,478
Does anybody know
what day of the week it is?

446
00:28:38,561 --> 00:28:39,812
Rishi, you'll love this...

447
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:42,144
So, how did the rest
of the dinner go last night?

448
00:28:43,728 --> 00:28:45,019
Yeah, it was fun.

449
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:46,853
You know, I've never actually
seen someone

450
00:28:46,937 --> 00:28:49,520
successfully hold
Nicole's attention.

451
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:52,061
She's a notoriously
hard nut to crack.

452
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:53,770
Have you followed up?

453
00:28:53,853 --> 00:28:55,978
I'm not really sure
I'm comfortable

454
00:28:56,061 --> 00:28:57,186
calling clients yet.

455
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,144
- I'll send an email.
- Cool.

456
00:29:04,186 --> 00:29:05,436
You rested?

457
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,353
HungerFix have changed the time.
They're in at nine tomorrow,

458
00:29:08,436 --> 00:29:10,061
and their COO is autistic.

459
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:11,728
No, I'm not being snide,
she has autism.

460
00:29:11,812 --> 00:29:14,186
And levelling with you,
she's also a bit of a cunt.

461
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:15,770
Those things are unrelated.

462
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:17,978
Speed and clarity.
Gus, how's the model?

463
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:19,621
I'll be done turning comments
by tonight.

464
00:29:19,645 --> 00:29:22,228
We need to get the book
to the printers by 6:00 a.m.

465
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:24,687
Don't stay up all night,
but tell me that's doable.

466
00:29:26,937 --> 00:29:28,478
I like you two a lot.

467
00:29:35,228 --> 00:29:36,895
Hi. Robert?

468
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,395
Uh, I've noticed that, uh, rates
and FX and all the other teams

469
00:29:42,478 --> 00:29:45,311
start their meeting pre-open.
When does the CPS one start?

470
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:48,937
Um, oh, it...
It changes day to day.

471
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:52,103
Eric's not usually in it,
so it's Clement's call.

472
00:29:52,186 --> 00:29:55,103
Well, um, I'd like it to run
from seven from now on,

473
00:29:55,186 --> 00:29:56,269
starting tomorrow.

474
00:29:56,353 --> 00:29:58,353
Can you just
round everyone up for me?

475
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:05,561
Seven on the dot. Hmm?

476
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:13,645
Seven? If I was a father,

477
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,978
that would seriously fuck
with my morning.

478
00:30:19,478 --> 00:30:21,770
Anyone up for
an after work bevvie?

479
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,311
Thursday night sharpener?

480
00:30:23,395 --> 00:30:25,162
- What, a few looseners?
- Yeah, you fancy it?

481
00:30:25,186 --> 00:30:26,626
- What, to take the edge off?
- Yeah.

482
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:29,436
No, mate. And get a new suit.
You look like fucking Neo.

483
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,853
I am doing anything else.

484
00:30:37,478 --> 00:30:39,061
Surely I can drag you out?

485
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:43,395
By my braids?

486
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,395
Maybe next time.

487
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:56,269
I guess we're the only people
that like to have fun
around here.

488
00:31:56,645 --> 00:31:57,687
Is that packet?

489
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:00,186
K. We're going vegan tonight.

490
00:32:01,812 --> 00:32:03,687
See, I gotta be up really early.

491
00:32:04,812 --> 00:32:06,186
Only if we go to bed.

492
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:12,937
Whoo!

493
00:35:31,436 --> 00:35:32,520
You're sound.

494
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:36,269
There was dinner,
and then a party

495
00:35:36,353 --> 00:35:37,937
for those people
who had the energy.

496
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:42,019
Well, I have never seen
so many lusted-after people

497
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:46,103
who were so utterly charmless,
and sexless.

498
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,353
They were without charm and sex.

499
00:35:49,436 --> 00:35:51,853
Clement, we've heard this one.

500
00:35:51,937 --> 00:35:53,436
I wanna hear the rest.

501
00:35:55,061 --> 00:35:56,353
Excuse me?

502
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:00,353
Um...

503
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:02,561
Sorry, um...

504
00:36:04,687 --> 00:36:06,228
Sorry, m... my head's a blur.

505
00:36:07,895 --> 00:36:10,478
You know, when two big nights
catch up with you?

506
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:14,687
Uh-huh. And, uh,
who were you entertaining?

507
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:15,853
Which client?

508
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:19,520
Um, sorry...

509
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,061
Get us a new phone?

510
00:36:52,436 --> 00:36:55,561
Hari? You're in the meeting
with me. Well done.

511
00:36:56,436 --> 00:36:58,019
Gus, I hope you don't mind?

512
00:36:58,103 --> 00:36:59,269
Well deserved.

513
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:03,728
One-nil to you.

514
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,186
Yeah, but you're not listening
to me. It's just one page.

515
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:10,061
I fucked up the font
on that one page.

516
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,978
Can you just reprint it?

517
00:37:15,978 --> 00:37:17,698
The meeting's at 9:00 a.m.
You don't have...

518
00:37:20,144 --> 00:37:21,645
Helvetica 12.

519
00:37:25,103 --> 00:37:27,436
It looks fucking amateur!

520
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:19,436
Never seen a grown man
drop his trouser at a urinal?

521
00:38:21,978 --> 00:38:26,520
I saw a guy do it during
the Kobe earthquake, '95.

522
00:38:27,687 --> 00:38:30,228
He had an arse like
an eight-year-old boy.

523
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,329
You know,
people seem to have forgotten

524
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,978
the more you enjoy sales,
the more money you make.

525
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:39,812
But if you're gonna
stay out all night,

526
00:38:39,895 --> 00:38:42,019
iron the box lines
out of your shirt.

527
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:56,561
You're not here
to fix the lights.

528
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,311
Daria said the Mallon Mercer
meet went well.

529
00:39:05,395 --> 00:39:07,520
- Monetize that shit.
- She sent an email.

530
00:39:07,603 --> 00:39:08,923
We don't hide behind emails.

531
00:39:08,978 --> 00:39:11,687
Get on the phone
and ask for the fucking order.

532
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:14,937
Rish! Will you shine my shoes?

533
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,728
Fuck yourself, mate.

534
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,603
Yeah, I really don't know.

535
00:40:09,395 --> 00:40:11,478
Come this way. Through there.

536
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:26,645
Hari's death is
an unexpected tragedy.

537
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:28,061
The next 24 hours

538
00:40:28,144 --> 00:40:31,144
and the way we respond to this
are defining.

539
00:40:32,103 --> 00:40:33,436
Do not speak to the press.

540
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,770
I'd rather you didn't speak
to anyone outside of the office.

541
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,311
For now,

542
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,978
this is about respect.

543
00:40:41,061 --> 00:40:43,978
There will be an inquiry
into the circumstances.

544
00:41:03,103 --> 00:41:04,853
Colin, you big wanker.

545
00:41:06,478 --> 00:41:08,395
I think it makes sense
to close your eyes

546
00:41:08,478 --> 00:41:09,645
and let it happen.

547
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:11,645
Market seems maxed out
by policy,

548
00:41:11,728 --> 00:41:14,019
but genuinely thinking
of correction, she's...

549
00:41:15,645 --> 00:41:17,561
I... I agree, I agree.

550
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:20,019
They're called scale tension
because they're pulling up.

551
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:35,520
Uh, HungerFix's flight
got cancelled.

552
00:41:35,603 --> 00:41:37,061
They're in on Monday.

553
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,645
Do you...

554
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:17,603
want to talk about, you know?

555
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:50,812
Turn it up, mate.

556
00:44:05,436 --> 00:44:06,770
What the fuck are you doing?

557
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:09,204
If I'm sounding frustrated,
it's 'cause I am frustrated!

558
00:44:09,228 --> 00:44:12,978
Apparently, he just
fucking died. Like, collapsed.

559
00:44:13,061 --> 00:44:15,978
- It's fucking scary.
- Lesson is,

560
00:44:16,061 --> 00:44:18,228
don't hire people
who really need the job.

561
00:44:18,311 --> 00:44:19,645
What does that mean?

562
00:44:19,728 --> 00:44:22,186
I mean, certain types
of people feel the need

563
00:44:22,269 --> 00:44:24,812
to overcompensate,
because they feel inadequate.

564
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:28,228
- It's also bad for us.
- How do you mean?

565
00:44:28,311 --> 00:44:29,978
Take the girl
with the nose ring.

566
00:44:30,061 --> 00:44:33,144
Isn't it impossible to compete
with this girl's narrative?

567
00:44:33,228 --> 00:44:34,937
I mean,
everything's aligned for her.

568
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:36,395
You know nothing about her.

569
00:44:36,478 --> 00:44:38,478
Well, I know
she went to a shit uni,

570
00:44:38,561 --> 00:44:39,728
and I know she's black.

571
00:44:39,812 --> 00:44:42,395
And I know those things
are mutually exclusive, sure,

572
00:44:42,478 --> 00:44:45,269
but together... tick, tick.

573
00:44:45,353 --> 00:44:49,019
- You are fucking vile.
- Oh, come on.

574
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,978
It's just... realistic.

575
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:07,395
I'm so sorry, uh...

576
00:45:09,436 --> 00:45:11,603
I was the less cunty one.

577
00:45:11,687 --> 00:45:13,395
It's fine.

578
00:45:21,645 --> 00:45:23,269
It's not
the correct trade anyway.

579
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:26,269
When do I ever have you
on the wrong side of anything?

580
00:45:26,353 --> 00:45:29,603
I know. Tragic.
All right, catch you later.

581
00:45:52,269 --> 00:45:53,561
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Nicole, hi,

582
00:45:53,645 --> 00:45:55,186
it's Harper from Pierpoint.

583
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:56,645
That option idea
we talked about?

584
00:45:56,728 --> 00:45:58,353
<i>It was a fun night.</i>

585
00:46:00,103 --> 00:46:02,520
<i>Let's go for it in half a yard.</i>

586
00:46:02,603 --> 00:46:05,186
Rishi? Rishi?

587
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:07,770
Rishi, I said
your fucking name, dude.

588
00:46:07,853 --> 00:46:10,228
Can you price that option idea
we talked about, half yard?

589
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:12,144
No way. It's wingier
than the fucking lottery.

590
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,204
And how the hell have you
got someone to buy an option

591
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:15,788
on treasury yields
hitting four percent?

592
00:46:15,812 --> 00:46:17,663
I told her that eventually
the US is going to war

593
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:20,687
in the South China Sea.
When they do, this pays out.

594
00:46:22,978 --> 00:46:25,978
All right.
Can do it in half her amount.

595
00:46:26,061 --> 00:46:27,186
Nicole, can we do half?

596
00:46:27,269 --> 00:46:28,937
<i>No.
You want to write my business,</i>

597
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,311
<i>you fill me on my first order.</i>

598
00:46:30,395 --> 00:46:32,561
<i>- In full.</i>
- Two secs.

599
00:46:32,645 --> 00:46:34,728
- Need it in full, can you help?
- No fucking way.

600
00:46:34,812 --> 00:46:36,079
I can't price it
without losing money.

601
00:46:36,103 --> 00:46:38,162
- That's half a billion.
- The client will not hear "no,"

602
00:46:38,186 --> 00:46:39,728
and I'm not interested
in that either.

603
00:46:41,311 --> 00:46:43,311
Offer is five beeps.

604
00:46:43,395 --> 00:46:45,315
- Offer is five basis points.
<i>- Too high.</i>

605
00:46:45,353 --> 00:46:46,812
<i>I'll pay four cents
in up to 250.</i>

606
00:46:46,895 --> 00:46:49,215
<i>- Work the balance with you.</i>
- Can't do five. Four, please.

607
00:46:49,269 --> 00:46:51,645
If they're paying for your idea,
make them fucking pay.

608
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:52,812
Four cents.

609
00:46:59,561 --> 00:47:00,687
Four cents.

610
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,269
Because I'm excellent,
four cents.

611
00:47:06,269 --> 00:47:07,561
Do I just say, "Done"?

612
00:47:07,645 --> 00:47:10,603
- "Half a yard done, four cents."
- Half a yard done, four cents.

613
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:13,204
<i>Let's see where this takes us.</i>

614
00:47:20,687 --> 00:47:23,269
Do not forget how this feels
right now.

615
00:47:23,353 --> 00:47:25,603
You are a world killer.

616
00:47:25,687 --> 00:47:28,353
- Now I see you.
- Thank you.

617
00:47:28,436 --> 00:47:30,186
Why is there a ring
in your nose?

618
00:47:30,269 --> 00:47:31,603
What are you, cattle?

619
00:47:56,937 --> 00:47:58,687
Welcome to the Shangri-La Hotel.

620
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:01,353
Can I get a room for the night?
Just the night.

621
00:48:01,436 --> 00:48:02,645
Somewhere else.

622
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:06,937
We have the Southwark Suite.

623
00:48:08,937 --> 00:48:10,103
Let's do it.

624
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,496
<i>I've carried
the culture of the firm,</i>

625
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,770
<i>led with integrity
and thought like an owner.</i>

626
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:35,395
<i>It's in my blood.</i>

627
00:50:35,895 --> 00:50:37,228
<i>I'm a Pierpoint person.</i>

628
00:50:39,144 --> 00:50:41,186
<i>There are many aspects
of this job</i>

629
00:50:41,269 --> 00:50:43,436
<i>that you'll learn by osmosis.</i>

630
00:50:44,311 --> 00:50:45,395
<i>He makes me feel...</i>

631
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:47,269
Special?

632
00:50:47,937 --> 00:50:50,770
<i>Are you're still the lunch girl?</i>

633
00:50:52,603 --> 00:50:54,323
<i>It's just not a cultural fit.</i>

634
00:50:54,603 --> 00:50:55,995
Well, maybe I'll talk
about my perspective

635
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,103
on the cultural fit.

636
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,144
<i>The Guardian have run an article</i>
this morning.

637
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:04,895
<i>The rats are leaving the ship.</i>

638
00:51:06,144 --> 00:51:08,687
This is still very much
a belly to belly business.

639
00:51:10,228 --> 00:51:11,621
<i>It's cute
that you're living together,</i>

640
00:51:11,645 --> 00:51:13,311
<i>but keep it professional
at work.</i>

641
00:51:14,561 --> 00:51:16,079
<i>We're asking graduates
whether they neglected</i>

642
00:51:16,103 --> 00:51:18,019
<i>to mention anything
on their applications.</i>

643
00:51:19,812 --> 00:51:21,332
You didn't leave anything out,
did you?

644
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:24,978
<i>You are looking more and more
like Pierpoint people.</i>

645
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,770
What would you do if they
just let you go next week?

646
00:51:30,395 --> 00:51:32,436
I'd think of all
the wasted opportunities.

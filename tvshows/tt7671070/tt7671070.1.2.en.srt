1
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,036
<i>Why are you here, then?</i>

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,398
<i>I think this is
the closest thing</i>

3
00:00:09,422 --> 00:00:10,462
<i>to a meritocracy there is.</i>

4
00:00:10,798 --> 00:00:13,714
<i>I only ever want to be judged
on the strength of my abilities.</i>

5
00:00:13,923 --> 00:00:15,130
And paid for it.

6
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:18,339
<i>Welcome, graduates.</i>

7
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:21,506
<i>While it's my pleasure
to congratulate you</i>

8
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:22,631
<i>on this placement,</i>

9
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:25,089
<i>the work to stay here
starts now.</i>

10
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:27,923
<i>He works on my team.</i>

11
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:29,255
<i>He's a whole snack.</i>

12
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:31,255
If you're into that kind
of a thing, I guess.

13
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:33,746
<i>Do you... do you know Gus?</i>

14
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:34,923
Yeah, I live with him.

15
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:37,130
<i>I know a lot about you two.</i>

16
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,506
<i>Have you been home?</i>

17
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:41,547
<i>I'm longing
those nocturnal hours.</i>

18
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:44,255
<i>Trying to make
a good impression, you know?</i>

19
00:00:49,547 --> 00:00:51,673
<i>Do not forget
how this feels right now.</i>

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

21
00:01:17,464 --> 00:01:19,673
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

22
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:23,339
<i>Shove that cock
in my little asshole, please.</i>

23
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:26,839
<i>Yes! Come on. Come inside me.</i>

24
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:28,923
<i>Yes.</i>

25
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:33,673
<i>My pussy... In my pussy... Yeah.</i>

26
00:01:40,798 --> 00:01:42,649
Come on. Move, move, move.
Go on, right to the end.

27
00:01:42,673 --> 00:01:44,339
That's right. Good.

28
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:48,255
Move, move, move. Good.

29
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:50,130
Good work. Keep going.

30
00:01:55,673 --> 00:01:57,839
Big push. Right to the end. Go.

31
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:59,422
Perfect technique.

32
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,547
Maybe I should wear you to work.

33
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:48,964
I actually had to pay for these.

34
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:51,714
Thank you.

35
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:54,339
I did your Asia recap.
It's on your email.

36
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:56,464
I came in early
and listened live.

37
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:58,047
That's good initiative, that.

38
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:03,297
It'd be good to get off the desk
sometime, have a debrief.

39
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:05,839
Coffee, beer, whatever.
Talk about your progress,

40
00:03:05,923 --> 00:03:07,673
how to position yourself
before RIF.

41
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:11,047
- I'm evaluated on it, so...
- Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great.

42
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,881
Tomorrow? Oh, fuck no,
we have that grad dinner.

43
00:03:13,964 --> 00:03:15,339
Maybe Friday?

44
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:17,297
Yeah. Yeah.

45
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:18,714
Um, in the day would be good.

46
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:19,923
Uh, 'cause I have plans

47
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:21,297
with my boyfriend
in the evening.

48
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:28,881
I know you didn't mean that
like that, did you?

49
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:31,130
Uh...

50
00:03:39,214 --> 00:03:40,714
So, I know for a fact

51
00:03:40,798 --> 00:03:42,714
a lot of people are active
on the street.

52
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:45,047
I wanna know why
the flows aren't coming our way.

53
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,714
Well, 80 percent of my guys
are away.

54
00:03:46,798 --> 00:03:50,047
- Mykonos or Ibiza?
- Did the girls enjoy Disneyland?

55
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,547
Cost me three G's
for my daughters to find out

56
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:54,798
Goofy's a Moroccan kid
with a tiny head.

57
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,547
Hell is the line
at Space Mountain.

58
00:03:56,631 --> 00:03:57,981
Especially if you're behind
a Make-A-Wish.

59
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:01,255
All right, let's, uh,
let's convince some people

60
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:03,714
to part with their money
in the hope that they make more.

61
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:05,547
Yes, chef.

62
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:08,023
Does he
always change on the floor?
It's an MD power thing.

63
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,547
What's the deal with Fenmarsh?

64
00:04:09,631 --> 00:04:10,798
I haven't heard from Felim.

65
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:13,047
Called twice daily,
couldn't get past the junior.

66
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,547
- Did you say you worked for me?
- Yes.

67
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,255
Okay. Call every hour.

68
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:22,005
I got a meeting.

69
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,589
Oh, that's my broker laugh.

70
00:04:27,673 --> 00:04:29,214
I only do it for you.

71
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:31,839
Because I find you so funny,
of course.

72
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:33,506
Well, look,
if it's not my client laugh,

73
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:35,631
then it's probably
my genuine laugh, yeah.

74
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:38,464
You'll never know
which is which.

75
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:39,839
Speak soon.

76
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:44,547
He really didn't want
to go away.

77
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:46,756
This Felim thing's
got him spooked.

78
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,422
What do you think's going on?

79
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:50,005
I don't know.

80
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,464
But it doesn't bode well
for Eric's exclusivity thing.

81
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:57,631
Eric insists all his clients
only speak to him streetwide.

82
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,714
And Felim accounts
for over half the desk profits.

83
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:04,065
Look, if anyone
comes over my fucking hoot again

84
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:05,214
instead of messaging me,

85
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:07,506
I will personally bocat
their mothers!

86
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:09,607
I think
I'm gonna try and do an Ironman

87
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:13,130
or the Marathon des Sables.
With no training, obviously.

88
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,047
The guy gave me a freebie, so...

89
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:22,506
No, I just wanted to...

90
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:26,089
Yeah.

91
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:28,673
Could I put you on hold
for two seconds, please?

92
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:35,881
Where would you put yourself
on that continuum?

93
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:38,297
What is this?

94
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:43,547
So, if a nurse is here...

95
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:47,047
where are you?

96
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:49,899
Wages on the Y axis...

97
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:52,089
...heel height on the X.

98
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:41,631
You've got very good
privacy settings.

99
00:06:41,714 --> 00:06:45,047
- Very good.
- What are you hiding?

100
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,839
I... I was wearing a low-cut top
in a profile pic

101
00:06:47,923 --> 00:06:49,714
when I was, like, 14.

102
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:51,673
Yeah, our DMs are a cesspit.

103
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,506
Bobbi went dark
for, like, three months.

104
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:55,089
It felt like three lifetimes.

105
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:56,631
Guys online violate
their standards

106
00:06:56,714 --> 00:06:58,631
quicker than
they can lower them.

107
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:00,297
That's hilarious.

108
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:02,214
You're funny. She's funny.

109
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,005
Thank you.

110
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,923
You look like you pay
the rent on time.

111
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:08,422
Yeah. I work in finance.

112
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:10,881
It's not as interesting
as what you guys do.

113
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,881
We're just... living.

114
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:15,631
Oh, we love that
you're a working woman, though.

115
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:18,172
Is that why
you made me come at lunch?

116
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,005
Anyway, we're sort of
past the point

117
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:23,798
where we want to be waking up
to random guys in the kitchen.

118
00:07:23,881 --> 00:07:27,339
That's a shame. I was
sort of looking forward to a...

119
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:29,631
stream of uncut dicks.

120
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:36,047
I love your place.

121
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:39,422
It's so... white.

122
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:43,798
- We're exorcising demons.
- It's our new favorite color.

123
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,422
Mine too.

124
00:07:50,964 --> 00:07:52,964
Felim's junior is a brick wall.

125
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:54,923
How many questions
did you ask him

126
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:56,422
before you asked for his boss?

127
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:59,005
There are too many saleswomen
here trying to be salesmen.

128
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:02,381
I mean, how many people do you
think call Felim's junior a day?

129
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:04,089
I dunno, seven?

130
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:07,464
Why seven?

131
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:09,307
It's the first number
that came into my head.

132
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:12,130
And the amount of apartments
I've seen this week.

133
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:14,214
And how many women call him?

134
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:19,214
And how many women
actually engage him?

135
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:24,464
You see, then you belong
to a nice, exclusive subset.

136
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:28,881
And you know, it's not
betraying your sex by...

137
00:08:28,964 --> 00:08:31,547
I mean, it's not regressive
to be a conversationalist.

138
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:33,214
You convince them
you're a friend,

139
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:34,964
and they'll forget
what they are.

140
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,047
- Which is...?
- A counterparty.

141
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,923
What the fuck have you done
to that stock, Phil?

142
00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:44,005
What do I mean? I mean
you rigged it five percent...

143
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:47,214
Start of every call, flip it,

144
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:50,547
and don't talk business
until it runs out.

145
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:56,506
<i>- This is unbelievable.
- This is beautiful.</i>

146
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:59,339
- Dig in, please.
- Wow. Thank you so much.

147
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:01,506
This is fucking grown-up.
I... I need to do

148
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:04,047
the honorable thing here
and lower the tone.

149
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,981
- Gentleman's cutlery.
- Put it away.

150
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,631
That can't be good
for your palette.

151
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,297
Uh, I can eat on K.

152
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:12,047
And I pay
your boyfriend's wages.

153
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,589
The company pays my wages.

154
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:17,714
What? So we are calling
my little venture

155
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:19,214
- a company, are we?
- Yeah.

156
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:21,547
I mean, it is fair to say
that I single-handedly

157
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:23,798
revolutionized
student journalism, so...

158
00:09:25,673 --> 00:09:27,756
Yasmin, how did you
have the time?

159
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,464
Oh, honestly, it's nothing.

160
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:31,923
- I did most of it this morning.
- Hmm.

161
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:35,214
When, uh,
when did you do it all?

162
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:38,881
Uh, this... This morning.

163
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:42,589
Oh... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, that was super rude.

164
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:46,923
Oh.

165
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:48,482
Mom, it's Seb's birthday.

166
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:50,089
I need to hang this.

167
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,005
Wow. Let me grab that.

168
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,315
Is that Yasmin?

169
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:06,798
Happy birthday, Sebastian.

170
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:09,589
Thank you.

171
00:10:09,673 --> 00:10:12,339
I hear you've moved yourself
into my basement.

172
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:13,964
Uh, yeah.

173
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,673
Very touched that you're using
one of your non-dom days on me.

174
00:10:17,756 --> 00:10:19,339
Can I... Can I get you a drink?

175
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:21,005
Oh.

176
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:25,923
Of course.

177
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:28,464
Beautiful house,
Mrs. Kara-Hanani.

178
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,964
Why do people like this game?

179
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,631
It dispenses joy
and misery at random.

180
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:38,047
- Hmm.
- Mimics life.

181
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,172
Great.

182
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:46,089
I've got this performatively
left-wing mate

183
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:48,798
who's high up at <i>The Guardian,</i>
and he is saying

184
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,214
that they're gonna run
a warts-and-all exposé

185
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:52,714
on Pierpoint.

186
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:55,047
- Really?
- Yeah.

187
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,714
About Hari?

188
00:10:57,381 --> 00:10:58,422
And more.

189
00:10:58,506 --> 00:10:59,714
Fucking wanker!

190
00:10:59,798 --> 00:11:01,339
- Here we go!
- Come on!

191
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:03,339
- Oh, yes, chef!
- Absolutely not!

192
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:06,130
That's, like, four each.
I need to see another apartment.

193
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:08,756
My advice,
turn up drunk. Easier.

194
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,756
I hate you, Robert Spearing.

195
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,297
Cheers, mate.

196
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,172
I've been thinking
about asking to transfer

197
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:17,297
to sales and trading.

198
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:20,839
Salespeople are
the lowest of the low.

199
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:25,339
You are different,
because you think for yourself.

200
00:11:25,422 --> 00:11:29,422
I mean, look, okay...
too intellectual.

201
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,756
See, now you look like
a salesman.

202
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,547
Okay. But I can't see, so...

203
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:38,005
I have seen you in contacts.

204
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:40,255
- Chin-chin!
- Chin-chin!

205
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,464
Do you like the room?

206
00:11:57,631 --> 00:11:59,297
- It's a bit...
- Fucking tiny.

207
00:12:01,464 --> 00:12:05,464
Everything is... en suite.

208
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:10,297
Hey... did you vote for Trump?

209
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:17,881
So, what do you do?

210
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:20,464
I...

211
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:23,881
- am in sales.
- Oh.

212
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:26,130
For a bank... Pierpoint.

213
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,798
Isn't that where that guy died?

214
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,130
How do you sleep at night?

215
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:43,673
- What does that mean?
- I mean... You know...

216
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:45,964
No, I don't.
You're gonna have to tell me.

217
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:47,130
Bankers.

218
00:12:47,214 --> 00:12:50,381
That level of self-interest
is just toxic, isn't it?

219
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:56,422
That's... kind of reductive.

220
00:12:56,506 --> 00:13:00,798
But isn't it a bit gauche
to judge success with money?

221
00:13:02,673 --> 00:13:04,381
Not if you've never had any.

222
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:17,756
I can't believe
you would even countenance

223
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,756
wasting your intelligence
on the trading floor.

224
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,089
Fuck off! It was a joke!

225
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:24,506
This looks like a place
a salesman would live.

226
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:26,798
It's got a certain
rustic charm to it.

227
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:29,089
- Rustic charm, you say?
- Yeah, it does.

228
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:31,214
- Does it?
- Either of you want a bevvie?

229
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,381
No, I'm good, I didn't...

230
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:38,422
Um...

231
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:42,214
- Uh, where's the toilet?
- It's just down on your left.

232
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:45,047
On the left, okay. Um...

233
00:13:46,255 --> 00:13:47,422
Just, uh...

234
00:13:53,005 --> 00:13:54,881
When the fuck
did that start up again?

235
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:57,381
Nothing's started...
Can we not talk about it now?

236
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,422
All right.

237
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:07,714
Is that Yasmin Kara-Hanani?

238
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:16,172
Yeah. Doesn't look like
she slums it, mate.

239
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,881
You know, why are women
so much more interesting to men,

240
00:14:19,964 --> 00:14:21,631
than men are to women?

241
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:28,422
Yasmin was the perfect,
perfect child.

242
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:31,589
And she wet her bed
until she was nine.

243
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:33,464
Ah, I have
a weak bladder myself.

244
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,422
But, other than that,
she was perfect.

245
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:39,631
She was adorable.

246
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:43,047
So, we've just found
the next big voice

247
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,381
in contemporary
British literature.

248
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:49,422
She's 19, absolutely gorgeous.

249
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:53,172
The best part of publishing
is discovering new talent.

250
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:56,839
Do you have any advice
for an aspiring writer?

251
00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:59,839
Mmm. Marry rich?

252
00:14:59,923 --> 00:15:02,381
Or... live at home.

253
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,464
Mmm, so, how many jobs
have you had

254
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:10,214
since you left Bristol?
I'm losing count.

255
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:11,631
Um...

256
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,547
Well, I was waiting
for something I loved.

257
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:15,714
Correct answer.

258
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:18,297
And, uh, you're still
the lunch girl?

259
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,714
You have no experience of this,

260
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:26,923
so how would you know?

261
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,440
Okay,
that's not the world anymore.

262
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:34,744
And can you please
speak English?

263
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:37,381
I know how the world works.

264
00:15:49,005 --> 00:15:52,297
Has the, um... dynamic changed
since Alice moved in?

265
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:54,255
Yeah.

266
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:57,839
And it's, um, it's nice,
living in two places.

267
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:02,214
I like having her around
all the time.

268
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:07,798
We have a lot less sex.

269
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:10,130
Well, I guess that's a casualty.

270
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:12,422
Oh, I listened to that, um,

271
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:15,005
podcast she recommended
on clean eating.

272
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:17,881
Thought it was excellent.

273
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:19,297
Followed none of the advice.

274
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:22,130
Wait, sorry, um,
when did you speak to her?

275
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,631
Met her at a dinner party.

276
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:27,422
- Whose?
- Eugene's.

277
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:28,964
We have mutual friends.

278
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:30,714
Uh, and what did you talk about?

279
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:32,839
Podcasts.

280
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:36,923
Okay.

281
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,047
Oh, God. I remember this...

282
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:50,047
Millionaire, 25. Cabinet, 35.

283
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,589
Party leader, 45.
Prime minister, 55.

284
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:59,339
You know, Heseltine wrote his
on the back of an envelope.

285
00:16:59,422 --> 00:17:01,062
You planned your life

286
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:03,255
in a copy
of <i>Vanity fucking Fair.</i>

287
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:04,839
Yeah.

288
00:17:07,547 --> 00:17:10,172
Your ambitions obviously
shifted focus...

289
00:17:12,255 --> 00:17:13,506
...just a little bit.

290
00:17:14,923 --> 00:17:16,673
Or is that you are just...

291
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:20,005
...following my lead.

292
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,255
You are always so hard for me.

293
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:06,297
Kiss me properly.

294
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:19,798
Uh...

295
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:24,130
I'm feeling a bit bilious...

296
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,547
Hey... I don't want to do that.

297
00:18:56,214 --> 00:18:57,464
Do what?

298
00:18:57,547 --> 00:18:59,381
- Uh...
- Hey.

299
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:03,381
I'm sorry.

300
00:19:20,214 --> 00:19:21,756
Look, you're...

301
00:19:22,923 --> 00:19:24,547
you're obviously stressed.

302
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:28,381
If this job
isn't making you happy...

303
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:31,339
I'm just saying that
you're super talented

304
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:33,547
and you could
do a million things.

305
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,506
<i>Interest rates have fluctuated</i>

306
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:41,130
<i>from the highs of the early '90s</i>

307
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,089
<i>to the current all-time lows.</i>

308

<i>that is linked

310
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:53,005
A lot of eccentrics.
Maybe I'm the weirdo.

311
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:55,881
Not sure what I'm gonna do.

312
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,899
Thanks
for your transcript, finally.

313
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,881
But...

314
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:02,172
I have a few more questions.

315
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:04,714
We wanted to...

316
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:07,839
ask you about...

317
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:11,673
any interactions
you might have had with Hari?

318
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:13,172
Um...

319
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:17,005
We hung out a few times.

320
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:20,589
Mm-hmm. Did he seem stressed?

321
00:21:20,673 --> 00:21:23,005
He worked really hard.

322
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:24,798
But you know,
his side of the business...

323
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:26,255
that nocturnal culture...

324
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:28,047
Oh, we're taking steps
to address that.

325
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:33,798
Did you...
see him take anything?

326
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:35,506
How do you mean?

327
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:38,381
Did he seem like he was under
the influence of anything?

328
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:43,381
Uh... study drugs? Adderall?
Modafinil?

329
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:48,297
- I wouldn't say so.
- He seemed, as you said,

330
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:53,714
stressed, agitated, unfocused,
so you couldn't rule it out?

331
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:58,547
I couldn't definitively
say yes or no.

332
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:03,589
I mean... do you want me to?

333
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:06,714
People are saying
he had a heart thing.

334
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,673
Hmm.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

335
00:22:09,756 --> 00:22:12,089
But we were unaware
of his condition.

336
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:15,756
We think a prescription pill
habit may have exacerbated it.

337
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,565
We're asking graduates
whether they neglected

338
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:19,964
to mention anything
on their applications.

339
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,756
You didn't leave anything out,
did you?

340
00:22:22,422 --> 00:22:24,547
Medical or otherwise?

341
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:29,422
No.

342
00:22:30,964 --> 00:22:32,547
I think they're still
figuring out

343
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:35,464
a splashy response.
Press-friendly.

344
00:22:35,547 --> 00:22:37,422
And what does that mean for us?

345
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:42,047
Means someone's going
to be held accountable.

346
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,339
I re-ran the model.
I don't think we thoroughly

347
00:22:44,422 --> 00:22:47,172
went through
the net debt adjustments.

348
00:22:47,255 --> 00:22:49,756
HungerFix pushed Goldman
up to primary bookrunner.

349
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:52,297
They don't want us anywhere near
the top of the tombstone.

350
00:22:52,381 --> 00:22:53,381
It's fucking bad PR.

351
00:22:53,422 --> 00:22:55,422
Sorry,
what do you mean, "tombstone"?

352
00:22:56,589 --> 00:22:59,089
You get a little trophy
when you complete a deal.

353
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:00,881
Tombstone.

354
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:06,422
Nobody is questioning
your drive,

355
00:23:06,506 --> 00:23:10,756
but for me, please,
come in later, leave earlier,

356
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,005
decompress.

357
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:14,547
I cannot be seen
to be mismanaging you.

358
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:16,381
Have you spoken
to the counselor?

359
00:23:16,464 --> 00:23:17,506
No.

360
00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:19,214
Even if you feel
you don't need to,

361
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,339
I need you to. Do you understand
what I'm saying?

362
00:23:21,422 --> 00:23:22,464
It's good optics.

363
00:23:24,297 --> 00:23:27,339
It wasn't a waste of time.
He helped me...

364
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:30,673
re-evaluate.

365
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:44,422
So the first Cobb
is with bacon, no Stilton,

366
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,005
and the second one
is without bacon.

367
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:47,565
Yeah,
that's what I've given you.

368
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:50,756
Sorry, I specifically said
no dressing on any of them.

369
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:53,089
We're just gonna have to
start again, sorry. And...

370
00:23:57,673 --> 00:23:59,172
<i>Muy bien, gracias.</i>

371
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:03,422
Ugh, God.

372
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:05,315
I can't believe I didn't know
you were at Pierpoint.

373
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:06,506
- Well done.
- Thank you.

374
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:09,673
Although it must be a weird time
to be there, right now.

375
00:24:10,506 --> 00:24:11,839
Oh, but how's Brevan Howard?

376
00:24:11,923 --> 00:24:13,464
How long have you
been there now?

377
00:24:13,547 --> 00:24:16,964
- Seven years... in Tibet.
- Oh.

378
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:22,172
No, no, no. It's a good thing.

379
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:24,214
- I have their blessing.
- Oh.

380
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,798
Can't really talk about it much
at the moment.

381
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:30,923
- So, what are you working in?
- Oh, Foreign Exchange.

382
00:24:31,923 --> 00:24:32,964
That's great!

383
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:35,214
We're in the same
part of the business.

384
00:24:35,714 --> 00:24:36,714
Thanks.

385
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:40,923
Welcome to the Wild West.

386
00:24:46,756 --> 00:24:50,339
<i>Gracias. Mucho gracias.</i>

387
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:53,631
I just think, you know,
if I had biceps like that...

388
00:24:53,714 --> 00:24:57,130
...with the vein running
down it, that... that bulge.

389
00:24:57,214 --> 00:24:58,732
- You know, like...
- Zac Efron.

390
00:24:58,756 --> 00:25:01,089
- Yeah, the Zac Efron.
- The Zefron.

391
00:25:01,172 --> 00:25:03,148
Yeah, I know I should be
thinking about other things,

392
00:25:03,172 --> 00:25:06,297
like the suicide rate
among men my age or whatever,

393
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:08,172
but is that really realistic?

394
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:11,297
I just think the veiny bicep...

395
00:25:11,381 --> 00:25:13,714
You think Pierpoint's Irish,

396
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:15,673
you should go out
with Morgan Stanley guys,

397
00:25:15,756 --> 00:25:17,422
it's like the fucking Irish Mob.

398
00:25:17,506 --> 00:25:19,214
- Hey.
- Hi.

399
00:25:19,297 --> 00:25:23,631
Um... you going to that, um,
grad dinner tonight?

400
00:25:23,714 --> 00:25:26,673
Yeah. Well, it's mandatory,
isn't it?

401
00:25:26,756 --> 00:25:27,839
Right.

402
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:31,005
Can I help with something?

403
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:34,589
Yeah. Do you have access
to the FX ClientTracker?

404
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:37,923
I don't... We, um, we
just don't have a full list

405
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:39,589
of shared FX and CPS clients.

406
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:42,756
I'm not sure I can share it
with you.

407
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,649
Yeah. Don't worry,
I don't need full access.

408
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:47,422
I just, um... one of my clients
is double-booked

409
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:50,005
with one of your guys.
And, um, you know how it is.

410
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:51,881
I just want to iron out
the kink.

411
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:56,464
Sure, yeah, um...
what's your client's name?

412
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,631
Uh...

413
00:26:00,631 --> 00:26:03,089
Oh shit, he's not there.

414
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:05,547
My bad. See you at the dinner.

415
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:06,631
Okay.

416
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:09,130
Thank you.

417
00:26:17,255 --> 00:26:20,339
- Where's my change?
- Oh, sorry.

418
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:27,005
Amateur.

419
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:28,609
You should be making
money out of this.

420
00:26:28,673 --> 00:26:30,130
Call it a salad yield.

421
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,047
And...

422
00:26:33,714 --> 00:26:37,005
I won't out you now,
but remember you owe me.

423
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:39,631
- What do you mean?
- I asked for croutons.

424
00:26:40,673 --> 00:26:43,714
You never asked for croutons.

425
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:46,589
Tash! Croutons. Do I eat them?

426
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:49,464
I'm passionate about croutons.

427
00:26:49,547 --> 00:26:52,089
Remember,
all the best friendships

428
00:26:52,172 --> 00:26:55,172
- start with a conspiracy.
- Okay, Kenny.

429
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:00,839
Best part of the day,
Yasmin's trade idea.

430
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:03,130
Be ready
to have your mind detonated.

431
00:27:03,214 --> 00:27:04,940
- Oh, wait, just...
- This is for your growth, okay?

432
00:27:04,964 --> 00:27:07,506
You're part of this desk,
so you're part of its rituals.

433
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,255
Pull up a pew.

434
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:13,839
And imagine I burst
into flames when I'm bored.

435
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,422
- Go!
- Um...

436
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:16,940
Okay, I thought
we could short cable...

437
00:27:16,964 --> 00:27:17,964
What's cable?

438
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:19,381
Um, it's dollar-sterling.

439
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:21,184
Oh, so you're gonna
talk about Europe, then?

440
00:27:21,255 --> 00:27:22,673
What's your target and stop?

441
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:24,381
Uh, 1.25 to 1.35.

442
00:27:24,464 --> 00:27:26,464
So a symmetric bet
from 1-spot-3-0?

443
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:28,464
Why not just flip a coin?
Put it all on black.

444
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,148
The art here is to look like
you're not doing that.

445
00:27:30,172 --> 00:27:31,940
Yeah, I just thought with
everything that's going on

446
00:27:31,964 --> 00:27:33,732
- with Europe at the moment,
that we could...
- Well, that's fucking specific.

447
00:27:33,756 --> 00:27:35,547
Yasmin, that is uninspired.

448
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:37,589
Inspire her.

449
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:41,464
I could put a hundred grads
in front of me,

450
00:27:41,547 --> 00:27:43,631
95 would pitch me that.

451
00:27:43,714 --> 00:27:44,923
You're dead on RIF.

452
00:27:47,172 --> 00:27:50,089
Now, what did we prove?

453
00:27:50,964 --> 00:27:52,714
Did I ask for croutons?

454
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,798
You must have done.

455
00:27:57,589 --> 00:28:00,381
Well remembered.
You can get up now.

456
00:28:14,631 --> 00:28:15,881
How was lunch?

457
00:28:18,172 --> 00:28:19,255
Tasteless.

458
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:21,172
Did you get my message?

459
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:23,422
Felim's in the building
this afternoon.

460
00:28:24,714 --> 00:28:26,714
Is he meeting FX research?

461
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:29,047
Um, Hilary Wyndham?

462
00:28:31,631 --> 00:28:34,422
Why the fuck is he meeting
another salesman?

463
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:36,047
If Felim wants to trade FX,

464
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,964
he knows he can do it
through this desk.

465
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:41,005
- What time is he in?
- Four.

466
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,673
You around at 3:50?

467
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:49,798
Yeah.

468
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:52,089
Why?

469
00:28:52,172 --> 00:28:54,673
There are many
aspects of this job

470
00:28:54,756 --> 00:28:57,547
that you'll learn by osmosis,

471
00:28:57,631 --> 00:29:00,589
but horse-whispering
a fucked-off client...

472
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:03,756
that's an art.

473
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:10,839
I'm giving you face time with
the guy who gets us all paid.

474
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:13,839
Go on. Take a swing.

475
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:18,172
Okay, 3:50. Thank you.

476
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:19,506
Mm-hmm.

477
00:29:23,756 --> 00:29:26,047
Felim, I knew you'd be
ten minutes early

478
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,381
- for your meeting.
- Eric.

479
00:29:28,464 --> 00:29:30,923
I wanted to introduce you
to one of our brightest grads.

480
00:29:31,005 --> 00:29:32,130
Harper Stern.

481
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:34,005
Pleasure.

482
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:35,929
We actually already emailed.
I sent you that...

483
00:29:36,005 --> 00:29:38,255
US tail risk stuff.

484
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:40,047
Oh, that was you?
That was excellent.

485
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,172
Thank you.

486
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:43,547
Please.

487
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:46,798
Look, uh...

488
00:29:47,923 --> 00:29:50,297
Eric, I'm not sure this is...

489
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:52,297
the right way to go about
whatever it is

490
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:53,964
you're trying to achieve.

491
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:56,089
Engineering this,
bringing this young lady

492
00:29:56,172 --> 00:29:57,547
into the room as...

493
00:29:57,631 --> 00:29:59,214
I don't know what, a prop?

494
00:30:04,464 --> 00:30:06,144
I would've thought
that if our relationship

495
00:30:06,214 --> 00:30:09,047
had gone south,
you'd have the grace to call.

496
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,839
Instead of me finding out
over lunch

497
00:30:10,923 --> 00:30:12,297
with one of your PMs.

498
00:30:12,381 --> 00:30:13,798
I told him in confidence.

499
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:16,464
Well, he told me in confidence.

500
00:30:19,214 --> 00:30:22,881
Look, I'm hoping we're not
ruining a friendship...

501
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,130
over miscommunication.

502
00:30:26,214 --> 00:30:28,005
Would we call it a friendship?

503
00:30:29,881 --> 00:30:32,964
What? Why are you saying that?

504
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:35,631
I don't know, Eric,
maybe you think it's acceptable

505
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:37,923
to call your wife that
in front of her own friends,

506
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:40,798
but my wife did not
appreciate it.

507
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,673
Ca...

508
00:30:42,756 --> 00:30:45,172
Do you even
remember what you said?

509
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:47,381
Because I'd prefer
not to repeat it.

510
00:30:49,255 --> 00:30:51,589
I look for character
in my friends, Eric.

511
00:30:51,673 --> 00:30:54,381
I look for character
in my salesmen, or saleswomen.

512
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,297
Wai... wai...
What's really going on here?

513
00:30:58,422 --> 00:31:00,923
Why... why are you talking
to me like...

514
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:03,214
like we're in
the Great American Novel?

515
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:04,547
My "character"?

516
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:06,089
You know my character.

517
00:31:09,464 --> 00:31:12,839
I know you're meeting
Wyndham in FX, so you...

518
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:15,130
you obviously don't want
to relinquish

519
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:16,798
the Pierpoint offering.

520
00:31:16,881 --> 00:31:19,839
Citi, MS, GS
don't have our talent.

521
00:31:19,923 --> 00:31:23,172
And... Wyndham?

522
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:27,214
I mean, he... he's into soccer.

523
00:31:27,297 --> 00:31:28,881
You wanna spend
the first two minutes

524
00:31:28,964 --> 00:31:31,172
of every transaction
pretending to like it?

525
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:36,297
Here...
Here's where I'm serious.

526
00:31:37,422 --> 00:31:39,714
When you're writing
your next investor letter,

527
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:42,631
do you really wanna be
meditating on the fact

528
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:46,547
that you missed
a percentage point of returns

529
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:48,130
because of your wife?

530
00:31:51,005 --> 00:31:52,005
Right?

531
00:31:52,964 --> 00:31:55,089
You call me
when you need persuading.

532
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:58,130
You call me
when you need reassuring.

533
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,214
That's a friendship.

534
00:32:01,297 --> 00:32:04,172
Why waste your time
building that intimacy again?

535
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:08,005
Next... next time our wives
want dinner...

536
00:32:09,005 --> 00:32:12,005
I'm gonna say I have a bug.

537
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,255
Oh, Hilary?

538
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:16,005
Good to see you. We're vacating.

539
00:32:17,172 --> 00:32:18,422
You catch the Spurs last night?

540
00:32:18,506 --> 00:32:21,798
Oh yes, yes. They ran riot.

541
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:23,547
Sure did. Enjoy your meeting.

542
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:26,089
Yeah, I inherited
two suboptimal things

543
00:32:26,172 --> 00:32:27,172
from my father,

544
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:29,673
his Spurs season ticket
and flat feet.

545
00:32:34,172 --> 00:32:35,673
Why didn't you speak up?

546
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,172
Sorry. I... I didn't know
that you wanted me to.

547
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:44,673
I don't need quiet and nice
on my desk.

548
00:32:48,673 --> 00:32:51,130
- This... this stays
between us. Clear?

549
00:32:51,214 --> 00:32:53,047
- Mm-hmm.
- See you at dinner.

550
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:20,881
So, we just wanted
to get everyone together

551
00:33:20,964 --> 00:33:24,005
because it has been
a difficult few weeks.

552
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,464
For our institution,
for all of us,

553
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:28,923
pastoral care is as high
on the agenda

554
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:30,047
as it's ever been.

555
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,422
We wanted to show you
how much we appreciate

556
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:34,464
your resilience and focus,

557
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:37,089
from myself and all your bosses
here tonight.

558
00:33:37,172 --> 00:33:39,631
They'll be the ones
shepherding you through to RIF

559
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:42,923
and, ultimately, help you
to become permanent hires.

560
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:47,881
You are looking more and more
like Pierpoint people.

561
00:33:48,214 --> 00:33:49,255
Enjoy.

562
00:33:54,756 --> 00:33:57,172
So, I hear the girl
on Eric's desk

563
00:33:57,255 --> 00:33:59,255
is already doing suppers,
and I was just wondering,

564
00:33:59,297 --> 00:34:02,089
you know, do you think
I'll ever master the salad run,

565
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:04,172
or, like...

566
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:07,005
Jackie did it. Kenny did it.
I did it. You do it.

567
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:10,589
It is the great equalizer.
And it all counts on RIF.

568
00:34:11,297 --> 00:34:13,130
What have you learned so far?

569
00:34:14,506 --> 00:34:17,381
That, um,
that men eat salads as penance.

570
00:34:17,464 --> 00:34:20,673
Oh! Yeah.

571
00:34:20,756 --> 00:34:22,464
Mate, if it was me,
I'd be pissed.

572
00:34:22,547 --> 00:34:23,940
- Why?
- She's missed his birthday,

573
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:25,547
she's like sold
her entire personality

574
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:28,214
- to Meryl Streep.
- So what? Who cares?

575
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:31,756
If your girlfriend missed
your birthday, right? For work?

576
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,130
What are you, seven?
It's Anne Hathaway.

577
00:34:34,214 --> 00:34:36,631
Adrian Grenier
is a fucking adult.

578
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:39,047
Honestly, Adrian Grenier
is a grown-ass man.

579
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,881
- Thank you! She's woke.
- You sound so white!

580
00:34:41,964 --> 00:34:46,005
- Yeah and ancient.
- I am ancient. And I am white.

581
00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:48,756
And I do kiss
my dogs on the mouth.

582
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,673
You know,
I thought you were some...

583
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,756
- straight-laced Oxford boy.
- Yeah?

584
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:55,964
Mm-hmm.

585
00:34:58,255 --> 00:34:59,506
Who says I'm not?

586
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,381
So, my flatmate...

587
00:35:34,464 --> 00:35:37,547
Gus, he told me
you lived opposite Hari.

588
00:35:37,631 --> 00:35:40,089
You're friends
with that asshole Gus?

589
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:42,047
Have you met him?

590
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,255
No, but from what Hari
said about him,

591
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,130
he seems like an entitled prick.

592
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:50,673
Yeah...

593
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:53,923
- but you don't know him.
- Hmm.

594
00:35:59,631 --> 00:36:02,923
Are those prescription glasses?

595
00:36:05,047 --> 00:36:07,631
Have you ever seen a porno,
where, like, a...

596
00:36:07,714 --> 00:36:10,339
porn star plays a nerd?

597
00:36:10,422 --> 00:36:13,422
Yo, can you stop flirting
so I can do a strike, please?

598
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,464
Oh, ice.

599
00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:19,172
Hey, Greg.

600
00:36:25,005 --> 00:36:27,172
I'm fine. Uh, I would like to
pilot the scheme

601
00:36:27,255 --> 00:36:28,756
that I did at my old place here.

602
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:31,190
- I... Yeah, I heard about that.
- Did you hear
about the couriering?

603
00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:33,047
I heard...
I heard brilliant things.

604
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,839
- I heard about that.
- Korean... Korean breast milk...

605
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:37,130
- Hello.
- Sara.

606
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:39,130
- Hi.
- Could I ask you something?

607
00:36:39,214 --> 00:36:42,339
Yes. Yes, you can.
Sorry, excuse me.

608
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:43,839
Do you... do you wanna
go over here?

609
00:36:43,923 --> 00:36:45,043
- Yeah, yeah.
- Go, go ahead.

610
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:47,506
How's the atmosphere been
in IBD?

611
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:49,964
Yeah, it's been fine. Um...

612
00:36:51,255 --> 00:36:53,381
Lucinda mentioned
there were going to be

613
00:36:53,464 --> 00:36:54,756
some changes in the team?

614
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,214
Oh. Well, this isn't the place
for that discussion.

615
00:36:57,297 --> 00:36:58,398
There'll be a meeting on Monday.

616
00:36:58,422 --> 00:37:00,214
Are there going to be cuts?

617
00:37:00,297 --> 00:37:02,381
There's going to be
a restructuring.

618
00:37:02,464 --> 00:37:03,673
It's just a reshuffle.

619
00:37:03,756 --> 00:37:06,547
Your team's being subsumed
into the other sector teams.

620
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:08,589
You're effectively
disbanding the team

621
00:37:08,673 --> 00:37:11,631
with the "culture problem"
to stop it looking systemic?

622
00:37:12,714 --> 00:37:15,839
Well, firstly,
that's very cynical.

623
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:18,714
And I take this suggestion
as an insult to me personally.

624
00:37:18,798 --> 00:37:21,297
I mean, we have a duty
of care to remove you

625
00:37:21,381 --> 00:37:22,861
from whatever
may have been traumatic.

626
00:37:22,923 --> 00:37:24,607
Okay, but how are you gonna
stop people thinking

627
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:27,506
working three nights in a row
is some kind of, well...

628
00:37:28,506 --> 00:37:30,130
a badge of honor?

629
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:34,756
Sorry.

630
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,106
-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I said that, I just...
-Okay, all right.

631
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,756
- Is there anything else?
- What does that mean for us?

632
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,756
For me, Lucinda?

633
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,798
There's a VP spot
in Oil and Gas for Lucinda.

634
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:46,005
What about me?

635
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:47,422
We appreciate your talent.

636
00:37:47,506 --> 00:37:49,273
We're keen to re-house you
where there's headcount.

637
00:37:49,297 --> 00:37:51,047
- Where?
- CPS desk.

638
00:37:53,547 --> 00:37:55,839
I don't want
to sound, um, entitled.

639
00:37:55,923 --> 00:37:57,881
I applied for IBD,

640
00:37:57,964 --> 00:38:01,172
and I really don't want to work
on the trading floor.

641
00:38:02,673 --> 00:38:05,005
Hey, I appreciate
what you've been through,

642
00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:08,089
but I would think twice about
speaking to me like this again

643
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:10,047
because I do not
respond well to it.

644
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,172
Okay?

645
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,089
- You definitely did!
- That was you!

646
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:26,297
She's a fucking
intellectual lightweight.

647
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:28,221
Runs marathons
instead of having a personality.

648
00:38:28,297 --> 00:38:29,547
Go fund my fuck off.

649
00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:30,964
She'll be gone
within six months.

650
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:32,839
So, what are we gossiping about?

651
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,923
I am just drinking you two
under the table.

652
00:38:38,005 --> 00:38:40,089
I'm having
a private conversation.

653
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,756
Okay. Sorry.
I thought I heard my name.

654
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,422
Yasmin,
this might sound deeply strange,

655
00:38:47,506 --> 00:38:48,732
but we weren't talking
about you.

656
00:38:48,756 --> 00:38:50,273
Okay, I thought
you were looking over at me.

657
00:38:50,297 --> 00:38:52,297
I'm not fucking looking
at you either.

658
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:54,172
Shock fucking horror.

659
00:38:54,255 --> 00:38:57,547
Nobody gives a fuck about
what I think about you,

660
00:38:57,631 --> 00:38:59,631
or... or what you think about me.

661
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:01,506
Nobody gives a fuck.

662
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,815
See, the problem
with this industry,

663
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:05,756
they keep hiring
these fucking princesses.

664
00:39:07,255 --> 00:39:10,339
Which silly cunt was it
that interviewed you?

665
00:39:10,422 --> 00:39:13,964
Actually...
I think I was the cunt.

666
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:17,172
That cunt was me!

667
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,172
Whoops!

668
00:39:19,255 --> 00:39:20,881
Hey, buddy.

669
00:39:20,964 --> 00:39:22,506
Don't talk to her like that.

670
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:24,005
Mind your own fucking business.

671
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:25,673
No! Don't talk to her like that.

672
00:39:25,756 --> 00:39:27,714
Fuck off! Yeah?

673
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:34,589
Yes? What?

674
00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:38,047
Kenny. Go home.

675
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:40,923
Fuck off, Eric. Don't start.

676
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:42,130
Go home.

677
00:39:45,464 --> 00:39:46,756
Goodnight, all.

678
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:48,673
What the fuck
are you looking at?

679
00:39:52,297 --> 00:39:54,297
- You okay?
- Thanks.

680
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,798
Thank you.

681
00:40:16,964 --> 00:40:19,464
Do the guys on your desk
always treat you like that?

682
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:23,839
Is your team not like that?

683
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,964
Eric's great.

684
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:32,005
Yeah, I mean,
at least he gives you agency.

685
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:44,005
No one's gonna give you agency.

686
00:40:45,297 --> 00:40:46,506
You have to take it.

687
00:40:48,631 --> 00:40:49,673
And try not to think about

688
00:40:49,756 --> 00:40:52,172
all the different ways
that you can be wrong.

689
00:40:53,547 --> 00:40:54,631
They don't.

690
00:40:58,172 --> 00:40:59,214
Shall we?

691
00:41:00,631 --> 00:41:01,631
Yeah.

692
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:17,631
I still haven't seen
a British cock.

693
00:41:17,714 --> 00:41:19,172
Oh, my God.

694
00:41:19,255 --> 00:41:21,089
I... I know that
it's normal here,

695
00:41:21,172 --> 00:41:23,047
but the polo neck look,

696
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,214
it looks like
they're wearing winter wear.

697
00:41:25,297 --> 00:41:27,839
- Oh!
- Mm-hmm.

698
00:41:27,923 --> 00:41:29,714
At least I have
a double bed here.

699
00:41:29,798 --> 00:41:31,756
I slept in a single
my whole life.

700
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,464
What, even at home?

701
00:41:33,547 --> 00:41:35,381
Oh my God, that's barbaric.

702
00:41:35,464 --> 00:41:38,839
Yeah, I shared
with my twin brother, JD.

703
00:41:38,923 --> 00:41:40,756
Don't worry,
we had our own beds.

704
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:44,214
And we barely even fucked.

705
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:47,214
What does he do?

706
00:41:50,714 --> 00:41:53,214
Harper? What does he do?

707
00:41:55,214 --> 00:41:57,839
He was kind of a superstar.

708
00:41:57,923 --> 00:42:00,547
He had a scholarship,
he was about to go on tour,

709
00:42:00,631 --> 00:42:03,798
and he woke up every day
at 4:00 a.m. to train.

710
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:05,047
Tennis.

711
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:08,923
He really didn't think that
athletes were born, you know?

712
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,881
- And what happened?
- He, um...

713
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,339
he said that
he was going away for a while.

714
00:42:16,422 --> 00:42:20,798
He took a coat and a bag,
and he left. Never came back.

715
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:23,255
When did this happen?

716
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:26,339
About four years ago.

717
00:42:26,422 --> 00:42:28,631
That would really fuck me up.

718
00:42:31,047 --> 00:42:33,839
He's an adult. He can live
with his fucking decisions.

719
00:42:35,714 --> 00:42:37,547
Well, if you ever need
a place to stay,

720
00:42:37,631 --> 00:42:40,130
I have a spare room
with a double bed.

721
00:42:40,214 --> 00:42:43,297
Are you... are you, like,
looking to sublet?

722
00:42:43,381 --> 00:42:47,047
Well, I mean, yep, we can...
We can figure something out.

723
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,964
Really? I would love that.

724
00:42:54,923 --> 00:42:57,422
Oh, my Lord.

725
00:42:59,464 --> 00:43:00,464
Who, me?

726
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,589
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

727
00:43:06,673 --> 00:43:09,714
My friend has something
she wants to say to you.

728
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:12,547
- Okay!
- Wait, wait, wait. What, what?

729
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,339
No, no, no, no, no, no! Oh!

730
00:43:15,422 --> 00:43:17,214
White men can dance.
Let me show you.

731
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:18,964
White men can't jump, dickhead.

732
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:22,089
- All right!
- I hate this. Thank you.

733
00:43:22,172 --> 00:43:23,756
But I can jump!

734
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,798
Wyndy, you're an MD.
Spend some fucking money.

735
00:43:26,881 --> 00:43:28,732
- Come on, mate.
- I'm already booked.

736
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:30,464
He said it's on Eric's account.

737
00:43:30,547 --> 00:43:34,673
Oh! Well, then we're definitely
fucking getting in it, then.

738
00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:39,130
Oy!

739
00:43:40,506 --> 00:43:43,381
- Can I bunk in?
- We're going west.

740
00:43:43,464 --> 00:43:46,881
Jackie, someone with my accent
must really scare you.

741
00:43:46,964 --> 00:43:48,464
You're Finsbury Park,
aren't you?

742
00:43:48,547 --> 00:43:50,172
- Yeah.
- Is Finsbury Park west?

743
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:51,975
- It'll do.
- Another troubles joke.

744
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:53,589
It's that time of night.

745
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:58,589
The player that's played
in the Merseyside,

746
00:43:58,673 --> 00:44:04,923
Old Firm, North London,
and Manchester derbies?

747
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:09,422
Uh...

748
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:12,047
Beckham?

749
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:17,464
Oh, Greg. Oh Greg, Jesus.

750
00:44:17,547 --> 00:44:20,047
- Excuse us, drive. Can you stop?
- Uh...

751
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,381
No, I meant Victoria Beckham.

752
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:33,857
It's Kolo Touré, by the way.

753
00:44:33,881 --> 00:44:35,255
Oh, good man!

754
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:20,130
You left early. You okay?

755
00:45:25,381 --> 00:45:27,798
They're shutting down
my fucking team.

756
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,130
Oh.

757
00:45:37,255 --> 00:45:38,964
Do you want me to suck you off?

758
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:56,255
- Hey.
- Hey.

759
00:46:23,631 --> 00:46:26,047
You used to love
going down on me.

760
00:46:30,422 --> 00:46:31,714
Yeah, I still do.

761
00:46:38,172 --> 00:46:39,297
Eat me then.

762
00:47:23,422 --> 00:47:24,547
Oh?

763
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:28,047
I think she slums.

764
00:47:36,464 --> 00:47:37,464
What'd she say?

765
00:47:39,297 --> 00:47:40,464
What'd she say? Let me see.

766
00:47:40,547 --> 00:47:42,047
Let me see!

767
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,714
- It's none of your business.
- Hey!

768
00:47:46,673 --> 00:47:47,798
It's just for me.

769
00:49:03,673 --> 00:49:04,981
I still keep getting
that feeling whenever I wake up.

770
00:49:05,005 --> 00:49:08,506
Like,
I can't believe that I am here.

771
00:49:12,297 --> 00:49:14,881
<i>Yo, I'm on the ninth stage
of the journey.</i>

772
00:49:17,005 --> 00:49:19,839
<i>The hero faces
the greatest challenge yet.</i>

773
00:49:22,047 --> 00:49:25,005
I cannot believe Eric lets
her speak in their meetings.

774
00:49:28,047 --> 00:49:29,714
<i>The hero experiences death...</i>

775
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,547
<i>This isn't a social club.</i>

776
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:34,756
<i>- ...and re-birth.</i>
- Ahem.

777
00:49:35,547 --> 00:49:37,067
<i>You're gonna pitch me
this again,</i>

778
00:49:37,214 --> 00:49:39,214
and it's gonna be
the version I asked for.

779
00:49:39,756 --> 00:49:41,381
<i>In front of the entire team?</i>

780
00:49:41,464 --> 00:49:43,673
In front of the entire team.

781
00:49:48,714 --> 00:49:51,214
I'm paraphrasing.
It's pretty cool, right?

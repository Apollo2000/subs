They always have
some gorgeous guy

316
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,291
who died in his early twenties by,
you know,

317
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,959
suicide, car crash, whatever.

318
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,834
And every year,
they just wheel him out for the likes.

Just size up on the bet.

Harper,
what's the ETA on the pack?

336

Not long. Getting there.

Um,

339
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,976
but I think it could be
commercial for the desk.

340
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,184
Okay, but I need to review it
before the meeting tomorrow.

341
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,792
Can you get it to me
before the end of the day?

342
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,542
If you can't, just say. I mean,
we'll... we'll work it out.

343
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,917
Yeah, hundred percent.

344
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,834
Great,

No, he just, um...

461

Uh, he wants me to pitch an
idea in the meeting tomorrow.

- (LAUGHS) - I went as a kid,
and...

471
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,583
Am I being paranoid,

472
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:04,792
or did Harper's trade idea
sound like a veiled swipe

473
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,542

- taking equity out of his flat.

hanging out with us?

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,583
There is no way,
no way, she likes him.

480
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,834
- She does. - Really?

481
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:26,917
Have you asked her?

482
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,519
'Cause he just
followed me to the toilet

487
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,750
I cannot believe Eric lets
her speak in their meetings.

488
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:42,166
Right,
you invited her to live here,

489
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,250
so you can't start doing that.

490
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,875
All I'm saying is we should
probably make her feel...

491
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:49,417
comfortable 'cause
this is obviously

492
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,792
a bit of a culture shock.

493

Let's wrap it up.

00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:39,709
I've actually worked
on a special product

that we could be making
some noise with today.

So,
I'm pitching a hedge on the housing market.

540
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:55,583
Uh, okay,
any analogy with the mid-noughties cycle,

541
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:58,000
subprime, it wouldn't work.

542
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,125
Less overbuilding,

543
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:01,008
less borrowing against
existing home values...

544
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:03,041
Well, don't you think the...

545
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:05,792
Homebuilder stocks
are looking a little toppy?

546
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,166
That's not our house view.

547
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,709
HARPER: The house
view's consensual.

548
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,959
Counter-consensus
is where we live.

549
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,250
Keep talking.

550
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:16,125
Initially,
I was thinking some puts on the S&P,

551
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,709
maybe linked to a call on gold.

552
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:19,667
But maybe something
more housing specific.

553
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,875
With the labor market
going gangbusters like it is?

554
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,208
It really doesn't make sense.

555
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,792
Let her... let her finish.

556
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:28,667
So...

557
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,250
The product I have
the traders looking at

558
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:35,333
includes a put option on
the Homebuilders index

559
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:37,583
and a call option on gold.

560
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,709
And a sweet kicker,

561
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:42,166
credit default swaps on the Homebuilders,
too.

562
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:43,917
It's the ultimate hedge

563
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,417
in a tidy suite for
client convenience

564
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,834
at margins big enough to
pay us while they own it.

565
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:54,333
The spreads are gonna be wide
enough to drive a bus through.

566

That's our bread and butter.

you know I'm all ears for new ideas,

them on Aubrey's time.

Okay?

651
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,166
So, as I was saying,
I've been talking to some of the analysts,

652
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,500
and I think we should discuss

You were in there forty minutes.

So... So why am I
sending you into meetings?

Respectfully, Eric,
I brought her into the meeting.

00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,166
Aubrey's been my
client for three years.

665
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,458
I know his needs.

666
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:33,458
With what he pays,
his needs are subordinate to mine.

Again, respectfully,
I have to disagree.

Harper had the balls to work
on something that was cogent

00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:44,875
and commercial enough
to be put in front of clients.

670
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:47,750
We reward her.
That's the system.

671
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:50,333
And if you'd asked me about it,
I could've provided you

The analysts think that

some risk in that view.

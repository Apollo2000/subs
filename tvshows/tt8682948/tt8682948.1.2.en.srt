1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,049
Gypsy, Dee Dee, you guys okay?

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,636
Gypsy's different.

3
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:07,347
She's got the epilepsy,

4
00:00:07,348 --> 00:00:09,685
paraplegia, a heart murmur.

5
00:00:09,686 --> 00:00:11,954
She can barely take anything by mouth.

6
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:16,365
I was just wondering
if Gypsy wants a makeover.

7
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:19,037
Here, wash all that
stuff off of your face.

8
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:21,124
Girls wear makeup, Mom.

9
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,173
You're not like other girls.

10
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:25,578
Gypsy! No!

11
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:27,888
- Dee Dee, what's wrong?
- She's allergic.

12
00:00:27,889 --> 00:00:30,644
I gotta get her to the emergency room.

13
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:32,982
Your daughter does
not have a sugar allergy.

14
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:35,319
Well, something's wrong with her.

15
00:00:39,663 --> 00:00:41,358
Get in bed.

16
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,797
- Ugh.
- We found Mrs. Blanchard.

17
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:47,804
What about Gypsy? Where is Gypsy?

20
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,551
So what are you gonna do now?

21
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:09,511
Put out an AMBER alert on Gypsy?

22
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:12,310
It's not like she could
have just ran off.

23
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:15,232
She's really sick, I mean...
I mean, she needs her meds.

24
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:18,113
- "Sick" how?
- Epilepsy.

25
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:19,950
- Stomach tube...
- Muscular dystrophy.

26
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:21,579
Wait, I thought it was cerebral palsy?

27
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,248
No, no, she has, like, a spinal injury.

28
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,086
No, it was chromosomal.
She was born with it.

29
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:26,714
Okay, guys, if we could go one at a time,

30
00:01:26,715 --> 00:01:28,639
that'd be helpful.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,392
She had too many problems.
We must have lost track.

32
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:36,784
All right, go ahead and just let that sit

33
00:01:36,809 --> 00:01:37,986
for a minute or two,

34
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:40,659
just to make sure that everything
really soaks in there,

35
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,288
and your lips are nice
and soft and moisturized.

36
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:46,504
All right, so the next thing you're
gonna wanna do is use a lip pencil.

37
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,883
I have a really nice moisturizer.
It's a Softlips.

38
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:52,766
This one I like in particular
because it has sunscreen in it.

39
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:56,273
So, just go ahead and start
filling in your entire lip.

40
00:01:56,274 --> 00:01:58,528
So, I like to start from the middle...

41
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:00,699
And I just make my way up.

42
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,995
Not so bad, just takes
a little bit of practice.

43
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:05,917
But I wanted to use these because
they just look so princess-y.

44
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,046
If you wanna go for, like, the full brow,

45
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:10,134
and it'll suit your face, then go for it.

46
00:02:10,135 --> 00:02:14,184
Her brows are really
strong, so, you know.

47
00:02:14,185 --> 00:02:17,649
- You need fake eyelashes.
- Lots to love trio...

48
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,402
If you want to impress your man,

49
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:21,281
your crush, your boyfriend...

50
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:23,703
Very white and just
very sparkly-shimmery.

51
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:26,959
The light-skinned
girls, they usually use,

52
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,218
like, a dark brown,
but the darker-skinned girls

53
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,305
can usually use, like, a black.

54
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:35,811
If you're lonely and single,
just do as I say.

55
00:02:35,812 --> 00:02:37,898
Before you know it, you'll have
someone paying your bills.

56
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:39,568
That looks good. I'm excited.

57
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:52,176
Ow. Ow.

58
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:54,431
A nice, like, highlight.

59
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:28,625
Yes!

60
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:31,296
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

61
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:34,887
Oh, thank you.

62
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:38,101
Thank you, Lord. Gypsy!

63
00:03:40,357 --> 00:03:42,944
Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy!

64
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:44,698
Oh...

65
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,286
Oh, I scared you awake, didn't I?

66
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:49,750
It's okay, Mom.

67
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,973
Let me see.

68
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:02,476
What is it?

69
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:07,911
"Springfield Gives"?

70
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:09,330
Oh.

71
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:12,755
They help the special kids like you.

72
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:16,846
I'm their "Child of the Year"?

73
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:20,269
Yes! Oh.

74
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,400
But I'm not surprised after
that nomination I sent in.

75
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:24,945
I worked so hard on it.

76
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:27,951
I worked hard on it
every morning for a week

77
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:30,039
so they would know how special you are.

78
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,876
Oh, and there's gonna be a celebration

79
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:33,567
right here in Springfield.

80
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:34,715
Think of it.

81
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:37,888
People coming from all over to see us,

82
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:39,108
to see you...

83
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:42,981
There are gonna be other
people my age there, right?

84
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,693
I can dress up in my...

85
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:46,697
my princess dress and make friends.

86
00:04:46,698 --> 00:04:48,033
Oh...

87
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:51,122
Oh, of course
there'll be all kinds of kids.

88
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:53,001
You've always been my princess,

89
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,174
but now you'll be everybody's.

90
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:58,345
Are you okay, hun?

91
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:00,517
Mm-hmm, I'm fine. I just...

92
00:05:00,518 --> 00:05:02,729
Oh, Gypsy Rose.

93
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,150
Gypsy Rose, open up.

94
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,369
Open. Wider.

95
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,545
Lord.

96
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:16,757
Oh, how long has it been hurting?

97
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:18,176
A little while.

98
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:20,139
I just thought maybe if I brushed harder,

99
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,888
it would go away, or...

100
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,109
Well, your teeth can't be
going bad all on their own.

101
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,188
There's gotta be some kind
of underlying... condition.

102
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:34,793
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

103
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:37,214
Oh, is your throat hurting

104
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:39,072
first thing in the morning?

105
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:43,034
And you got a burning in
your chest and in your tummy?

106
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:45,370
I know what this is.

107
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:51,334
Oh...

108
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:59,175
- Hi, good to see you again.
- Hi.

109
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:00,762
Hi, Gypsy. How are you?

110
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:02,766
I'm good. Thank you.

111
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:05,730
- Oh, you're back.
- Oh, yeah, we're back.

112
00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:11,867
Uh-oh.

113
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:15,123
Now, hang on just one minute.

114
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,253
I don't know what they told you

115
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:19,090
at the store, young lady,

116
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:22,806
but that model is not
gonna turn into a prince

117
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:25,060
no matter how many times you kiss it.

118
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:27,524
Oh, Dr. Harley, you're too much.

119
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:30,989
Say hello...

120
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,538
So, what are my favorite
patients doing here?

121
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:36,625
Oh, it's Gypsy.

122
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,879
Her teeth are like Swiss cheese.

123
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,094
Now, here. See?

124
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:44,933
Has had reflux issues
since she was a baby.

125
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:47,564
She got the feeding tube put in in 2002.

126
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:50,402
Then they prescribed
15 milliliters of Zantac,

127
00:06:50,403 --> 00:06:53,951
but now Gypsy's
complaining of a sore throat,

128
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:55,580
and her stomach is burning,

129
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,917
and I just know that that acid is back

130
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,420
- and it's ruining her teeth.
- Okay, okay.

131
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,759
Okay, I give up...

132
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,180
How about, why don't I bring

133
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:07,227
a gastroenterologist down here, huh,

134
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:08,939
for a checkup right now.

135
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,110
- Oh, you're such a dear.
- Yeah? Save you a step?

136
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:13,364
- Thank you.
- Ah, it's no trouble at all.

137
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:16,872
There is a new specialist here

138
00:07:16,873 --> 00:07:19,376
that apparently everyone is raving about.

139
00:07:19,377 --> 00:07:20,713
Ooh.

140
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:22,592
So I am gonna get her down here for you.

141
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:26,015
Her name is... oh, Dr. Chandra.

142
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:28,521
DR. - So, very fancy.

143
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:30,642
All right, I'm gonna give her a call.

144
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:36,035
Gypsy, your regular dentist

145
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:38,248
should have caught this a long time ago.

146
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,751
That's what I been saying.

147
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:41,129
I been trying to make an appointment,

148
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,759
but you know how it is
with government health care.

149
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,015
I swear, they'd rather you die
on the side of the road.

150
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:49,436
And you're scared of dentists,
aren't you, hun?

151
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:51,900
Okay, Mom,
I would make a new appointment,

152
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:53,904
and I would tell them that it's urgent.

153
00:07:53,905 --> 00:07:56,535
And I would get in there
as soon as I can.

154
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:58,037
Thank you, I have,

155
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:00,835
but we're really here about
her underlying condition...

156
00:08:00,836 --> 00:08:02,254
- Um...
- Acid reflux.

157
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:04,759
Well, I... I mean,
it could explain the decay,

158
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,513
especially without salivary glands,

159
00:08:06,514 --> 00:08:08,433
but, um...

160
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:10,688
Gypsy, do you take any food orally?

161
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:13,276
Oh, barely anything,
just enough to get a taste.

162
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:15,447
- Maybe 20%?
- 20%?

163
00:08:15,448 --> 00:08:17,409
Well, she can swallow,

164
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,873
but then you pay the price

165
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,879
with those tummy aches and such.

166
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,512
But she never has candy.
She's allergic to sugar.

167
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,145
Okay, let me check out a few things.

168
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:32,607
Do you mind if I touch your neck?

169
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:34,485
Okay.

170
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:36,615
All right, just swallow.

171
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,622
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Again.

172
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,093
Mm-hmm, again.

173
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,977
Okay, that's good.

174
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:53,439
I'm not a doctor, but, uh...

175
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,320
but I think she has a hiatal hernia...

176
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:59,244
When did you say she had
her salivary glands removed?

177
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:03,026
Well, let me check...

178
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,885
Is he cuddly?

179
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:15,067
Just a ballpark, Mom.

180
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:20,160
Is that Gypsy's full medical records?

181
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:21,580
Could I just take a quick look at them?

182
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,291
I'm sorry, the records that you want

183
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:25,086
were all lost during Katrina.

184
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:27,175
Ah, I see.

185
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,848
All right, well, the good news is that

186
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:32,685
feeding tubes don't have to be permanent.

187
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:35,190
- They don't?
- Oh, enough is enough.

188
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,818
First things first.

189
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:39,490
We got a dental emergency here.

190
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,410
Gypsy, I gotta get you home, honey,

191
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:45,002
so I can get on the phone
and find you a new dentist.

192
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:53,603
Waste of time.

193
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:57,527
All right, honey.

194
00:09:57,528 --> 00:10:00,659
Gotta be in so much pain, poor thing.

195
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:03,957
Wait.

196
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:08,214
This might help with the reflux.

197
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,724
Oh, if it wasn't screwed on.

198
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:15,395
I swear. Have a nice day.

199
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:17,225
Let me help you with the door.

200
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:21,896
Bye.

201
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:32,012
So, Gypsy and Dee Dee Blanchard.

202
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:34,308
Sounds like you've
known them for a while.

203
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:37,565
Oh, only about a year or so.

204
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:40,863
Um, but they're like royalty here.

205
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:43,660
Have you been able to obtain, uh,

206
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:45,790
a complete medical history for Gypsy?

207
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,377
Well, you know how
Katrina affected hospitals...

208
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:50,508
Right, no, no. Of course, of course.

209
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,219
What I meant was,

210
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,391
have you been able to confirm

211
00:10:55,392 --> 00:10:57,688
the girl's medical history?

212
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,162
Which part?

213
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:04,147
Any of it.

214
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:31,548
What if

215
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:34,177
Dr. Chandra was right, Mom?

216
00:11:34,972 --> 00:11:37,894
Maybe I don't need my tube anymore.

217
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:40,524
Oh, Gypsybug.

218
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:44,824
Sometimes, people like to paint

219
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:47,454
a rosy color on things

220
00:11:47,455 --> 00:11:50,360
when the truth really isn't very pretty.

221
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:53,174
You let your mama do the talking

222
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:54,864
when it comes to doctors.

223
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:02,109
Be back in a jiffy.

224
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,924
What a pretty uniform.

225
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:26,437
Just doesn't make any sense.

226
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,870
I mean, who would want to kill Dee Dee?

227
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:30,123
Didn't you tell me once how

228
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,712
Dee Dee's been in trouble with the law?

229
00:12:32,713 --> 00:12:36,176
And, I mean, what about her ex?

230
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:38,700
Ain't she always saying
how he was after her?

231
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:42,314
Yeah, but Dee Dee said a lot of things.

232
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:46,196
I mean, we all know Dee Dee could be

233
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,960
- a pain in the ass sometimes.
- Oh, for God's sakes, Mom.

234
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:51,750
I'm just saying,
how does a woman like that

235
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:54,007
end up on somebody's hit list?

236
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:57,343
What if she wasn't?

237
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,097
What do you mean?

238
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:03,766
I... I don't know.

239
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:06,352
What if whoever did it was

240
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:10,705
after Gypsy, not Dee Dee?

241
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:13,459
You know something?

242
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:17,739
I don't know.

243
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:17,373
Mm.

244
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,062
No, I'm not.

245
00:15:28,063 --> 00:15:30,817
You're just bad at this game.
Leave me alone.

246
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:35,786
No, I'm not!

247
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:39,125
No, I'm not! Just leave me alone.

248
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:41,254
Mom, he's cheating on the game.

249
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:43,092
- No, I'm not!
- Yes, you are.

250
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:56,689
Oh, shit.

251
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:59,667
Oh, hello.

252
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,004
We made these for you...

253
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:05,720
Gypsy was hoping to have
a little girl time with Lacey,

254
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:08,350
if y'all ain't too busy.

255
00:16:08,351 --> 00:16:10,187
Uh, well, the boys are on PlayStation.

256
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:11,607
Lacey's with her friends.

257
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:14,582
I was just coming out
to the porch to escape.

258
00:16:16,117 --> 00:16:17,502
Oh.

259
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:20,292
Oh.

260
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:23,715
Oh, what the hell.

261
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,301
Maybe Gypsy will be a positive role model

262
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:26,762
on them girls, huh?

263
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:28,558
Follow the music.

264
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,394
Okay.

265
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:32,038
Oh.

266
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,814
Mom, I told you we'd be out in two...

267
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:54,568
oh, hey, Gypsy.

268
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:56,739
Hi, Lacey.

269
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:01,707
Come in.

270
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:08,763
Hey.

271
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:11,142
Oh, my gosh, did you get a puppy?

272
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:12,436
Mm-hmm, yeah.

273
00:17:12,437 --> 00:17:14,482
He ran right across Farm Road
in front of me.

274
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:16,236
Mom's pretty pissed that
I brought him home,

275
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:17,864
but whatever.

276
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:20,286
- He's cute, isn't he?
- So cute.

277
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:21,649
Hi.

278
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,460
Oh, Gypsy's cool.

279
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:27,091
What's up?

280
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:29,053
Oh, stay still.

281
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:30,682
Sorry. Does it hurt?

282
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,435
No...

283
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:34,147
It doesn't hurt that bad.

284
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:36,902
Oh, I just hate needles.

285
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:40,619
Is it a moon?

286
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,290
It's gonna be a dolphin.

287
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,585
Yeah?

288
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:46,964
- Oceans are so important.
- Mm.

289
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,843
Oh, yeah. I think so, too.

290
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:51,097
I wanna be a marine biologist someday.

291
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:54,020
So, Gypsy, do you, like, go to school?

292
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:57,318
Um, oh, I'm homeschooled.

293
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,990
- My mom's a really good teacher.
- That's cool.

294
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,869
Yeah, wish I was fucking homeschooled.

295
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,372
Here, you wanna hit this?

296
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,960
Why? You do nothing.

297
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,488
- You sit at home.
- I wanna be stuck here.

298
00:18:10,763 --> 00:18:12,883
No.

299
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:15,647
Oh, fuck, are your teeth okay?

300
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:18,861
Oh, God, those don't look so good.

301
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:21,199
Oh, shit.

302
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,245
It's okay, Gypsy. It's okay.

303
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:25,249
- I'm sorry.
- You're being a dumb-ass, for real.

304
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,002
- Sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

305
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:28,548
It's fine. It's not your fault.

306
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,384
No, it is, like...

307
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:34,685
I've been sneaking out of bed at night

308
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:37,148
to go and eat sweet stuff,

309
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,237
and now my teeth are messed up, and...

310
00:18:40,238 --> 00:18:43,745
I'm scared because my mom
will be so mad at me

311
00:18:43,746 --> 00:18:46,067
if she figures it out,
you know what I mean?

312
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,508
I do a lot worse than that
when I sneak out, right?

313
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:51,969
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait.

314
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,890
Aren't you, like, allergic to sugar?

315
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:55,076
Yeah.

316
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:57,647
I used to be allergic to walnuts.

317
00:18:57,648 --> 00:18:59,651
Now I eat them just fine.

318
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:02,031
I must just be growing out of it, yeah.

319
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:05,914
Oh, yeah, well, I mean, dentists suck,

320
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:07,501
but we've all been there.

321
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:08,628
Look out, though.

322
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:10,380
Making out with braces takes practice.

323
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:12,844
Just be brave.

324
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:14,765
A pretty smile is worth all the pain.

325
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:17,646
Just like this tattoo.

326
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,878
Hi, uh, this is Doctor Lakshmi Chandra.

327
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:32,592
I'm calling from the Blessed
Heart Children's Hospital.

328
00:19:32,593 --> 00:19:34,262
I'm actually just calling
to see if I can speak

329
00:19:34,263 --> 00:19:36,684
to any physicians who may have treated

330
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:39,606
a patient who I believe
visited your hospital.

331
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:41,317
Thank you, yes.

332
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:44,323
Yes, yes, uh, I was the one
who requested those records.

333
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:46,327
Could you just tell me...

334
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:49,710
just complete a couple
of details that, um...

335
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:51,296
that were left out last time?

336
00:19:51,297 --> 00:19:52,924
Could you tell me about the leukemia?

337
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,511
And I don't know if I asked you,

338
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:56,640
but did she have her
feeding tube at that time?

339
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:59,395
Gypsy Rose Blanchard.

340
00:19:59,396 --> 00:20:01,399
The whole... okay.

341
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,361
G-Y-P-S-Y...

342
00:20:03,362 --> 00:20:05,825
And the mother requested that, too?

343
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:07,787
I'm... I'm sorry,
can you just repeat that?

344
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:10,543
How many times? Hello, Doctor, sor...

345
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,381
Doctor? Hello?

346
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:17,724
Uh, hi, this is Doctor Lakshmi Chandra.

347
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,636
Children and Family Services.
How can I help you?

348
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,352
That looks stupid, Mom.

349
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:02,897
Not as stupid as she might,

350
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:04,191
but things are definitely stupid.

351
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:05,778
Oh.

352
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:09,201
Excuse me. No, we're not.

353
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,582
Oh, Gypsy, I forgot to give you

354
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:15,006
one of your medications
in your meal this morning.

355
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:19,848
Okay.

356
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:23,188
Okay, here. Okay.

357
00:21:23,189 --> 00:21:26,195
- Wait, Mom, who's at the door?
- Okay.

358
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,412
Okay.

359
00:21:31,413 --> 00:21:33,834
Here, open.

360
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,838
- Now.
- No.

361
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:37,279
Under your tongue.

362
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:41,224
Oh.

363
00:21:41,225 --> 00:21:43,394
Okay. One more.

364
00:21:43,395 --> 00:21:45,387
Open.

365
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:48,499
Now, Gypsy.

366
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,369
Stay.

367
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,541
Wait, Mom.

368
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:55,670
I'll be right back.

369
00:22:02,058 --> 00:22:04,145
Oh.

370
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:05,565
Oh, I'm sorry.

371
00:22:05,566 --> 00:22:07,610
We had the volume turned up
on the television.

372
00:22:07,611 --> 00:22:09,238
- Claudinea Blanchard?
- Oh, yes.

373
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:10,490
Everyone calls me Dee Dee.

374
00:22:10,491 --> 00:22:11,994
I'm Allison Granger

375
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:13,581
with the Children's Division
of Missouri Social Services.

376
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,250
The law requires me to inform you

377
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,171
that a report has been filed
by a member of your community

378
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:19,258
concerning the safety
of your daughter, Gypsy.

379
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:20,595
What?

380
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:23,057
Oh, who would do that?

381
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:24,476
May I come in?

382
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:26,370
Oh, yes.

383
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,582
Oh, I can't imagine who
would be worried about Gypsy.

384
00:22:36,711 --> 00:22:38,964
Oh, can I offer you anything?

385
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:40,676
I just made a pitcher of sweet tea.

386
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:42,429
No, thank you.
Do you own this home, ma'am?

387
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,266
Oh, yes, yes.

388
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:46,521
Habitat for Humanity built it for us

389
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:49,318
after we lost our home in Katrina.

390
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,487
Lost everything...

391
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:52,700
Can you show me around, Ms. Blanchard?

392
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:55,331
Oh, yes. Uh, this way.

393
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:03,449
Well, I can understand...

394
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:05,768
why...

395
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:08,398
people misunderstand Gypsy's conditions.

396
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:10,360
She's in pain most days.

397
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:12,824
She's got epilepsy, MS.

398
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:16,038
She almost choked to death
on her own saliva once.

399
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:19,003
The hospital is really
our home away from home.

400
00:23:19,004 --> 00:23:21,090
Poor thing. She's been through so much.

401
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:22,635
Do you have kids?

402
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:27,144
Oh. Oh, oh, I'm so sorry.

403
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:29,273
I usually keep the room cleaner.

404
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,068
I have to keep everything off the floor,

405
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:32,905
what with Gypsy's wheelchair and all.

406
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:34,325
It's just the two of you?

407
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:36,412
Oh, yes, but she has
her own room, though.

408
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:39,209
Once in a while she wants
to sleep with her mama.

409
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,757
Snug as bugs...

410
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:46,516
- Where is Gypsy?
- Oh, she's in the restroom.

411
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:48,562
Bless her. It takes a while.

412
00:23:48,563 --> 00:23:50,543
I can bring her out to you.

413
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:00,881
Okay.

414
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:04,468
Yeah...

415
00:24:04,469 --> 00:24:07,140
Gypsy's a little slower
than children her age.

416
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:09,598
She's got the mind of a seven-year-old.

417
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:12,693
You can ask her anything you want...

418
00:24:15,032 --> 00:24:17,494
Gypsy, baby?

419
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:20,919
This is Allison.
She's come to pay you a visit.

420
00:24:23,382 --> 00:24:25,719
Thank you.

421
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,431
You can feel free
to wait in the next room.

422
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,742
Excuse me?

423
00:24:29,562 --> 00:24:31,815
Some of the questions can
be hard for a child to answer

424
00:24:31,816 --> 00:24:33,192
in the presence of a caretaker.

425
00:24:33,193 --> 00:24:36,490
Oh, of course, but Gypsy is ill,

426
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:39,497
and if she has a seizure,
I need to be nearby.

427
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:46,135
- In the doorway's fine.
- Okay.

428
00:24:47,013 --> 00:24:48,971
I'll be right back.

429
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:57,032
Hi, Gypsy.

430
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:59,036
I'm Allison.

431
00:24:59,037 --> 00:25:01,207
May I sit next to you?

432
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,860
Sure.

433
00:25:06,092 --> 00:25:08,304
I see here you're 15 years old.

434
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:13,482
How long have you lived here
with your mom?

435
00:25:14,818 --> 00:25:16,540
Um...

436
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,825
a year?

437
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:20,411
And would you say

438
00:25:20,412 --> 00:25:21,998
the two of you usually get along,

439
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:24,546
or are there some days that you don't?

440
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:26,841
What do you mean?

441
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:28,386
Well...

442
00:25:28,387 --> 00:25:30,891
does your mom ever get angry with you?

443
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:36,653
Sometimes, yeah.

444
00:25:36,654 --> 00:25:38,562
And what happens then?

445
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,877
She takes away my plushy toys.

446
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:48,802
But then she always gives them back.

447
00:25:50,724 --> 00:25:51,975
I see.

448
00:25:51,976 --> 00:25:53,770
Does your mom ever make you do something

449
00:25:53,771 --> 00:25:55,148
you don't wanna do?

450
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:58,071
Something that makes you unhappy?

451
00:25:59,449 --> 00:26:04,082
Mostly we like the same things.

452
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,631
Okay.

453
00:26:06,338 --> 00:26:08,174
Gypsy, honey...

454
00:26:09,553 --> 00:26:11,766
Do you ever feel scared?

455
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:15,432
When do you feel scared?

456
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:18,727
When I...

457
00:26:19,322 --> 00:26:21,577
have bad dreams.

458
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:25,416
But then when I wake up

459
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,379
my mom is always there,

460
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,637
so I'm not scared anymore.

461
00:26:32,683 --> 00:26:36,245
Um, just one more question,
then, for you, Ms. Blanchard.

462
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:39,821
The name listed on your address
and the name

463
00:26:39,822 --> 00:26:41,448
on your Social Security Card don't match.

464
00:26:41,449 --> 00:26:44,246
Both the first and last names
are spelled differently.

465
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:46,088
Oh, it's wrong.

466
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:48,379
- "Wrong."
- Yes, they're wrong.

467
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,049
I don't know if it was the divorce

468
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,345
or everyone losing everyone's paperwork

469
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:54,600
after Katrina, but the... the place

470
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:56,646
that keeps those records is wrong.

471
00:26:56,647 --> 00:27:00,529
I've been calling and calling
trying to get it changed.

472
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,159
Oh, you work for the government.

473
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,581
Oh, maybe you could help.

474
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,626
Oh, I'd be so grateful.

475
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:10,173
If I could just have
your number and your email?

476
00:27:10,174 --> 00:27:13,220
Then I could reach out to you
any time I have a question.

477
00:27:13,221 --> 00:27:14,766
I'm sorry, Ms. Blanchard,

478
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,270
that's a whole different part
of the system.

479
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:20,027
Uh, I think I've seen
all I need to today.

480
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,207
Did you want this up louder, honey?

481
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,502
Okay.

482
00:27:28,503 --> 00:27:30,964
Okay.

483
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:33,093
Enjoy your movie.

484
00:27:34,723 --> 00:27:36,058
Okay.

485
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,981
Thank you for your time.

486
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:47,455
I just don't understand

487
00:27:47,456 --> 00:27:50,170
who would call in that report.

488
00:27:50,486 --> 00:27:52,550
Have a good day.

489
00:29:31,164 --> 00:29:33,250
If that dog fucks up one more thing

490
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:35,547
I'm taking him to the pound...
where you should have took him.

491
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:37,133
Leave me alone, for fuck's sake!

492
00:29:37,134 --> 00:29:38,511
While you're cleaning up after him,

493
00:29:38,512 --> 00:29:40,181
you can clean up after yourself, too.

494
00:29:40,182 --> 00:29:42,186
Clean your own house! You're one to talk!

495
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:54,502
Who would call them on me?

496
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:58,008
What kind of a person would try
to take a child from her mama?

497
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:00,889
A child who needs care all the time?

498
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,393
Of course, they didn't find anything.

499
00:30:03,394 --> 00:30:05,189
Because there was nothing to find.

500
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:08,403
Well, someone thought
there was, and I wonder who.

501
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:10,115
Dee Dee.

502
00:30:10,116 --> 00:30:11,536
I know I give you a hard time,

503
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:13,998
but I give everybody a hard time.

504
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:17,297
Look, everybody knows
you take good care of Gypsy.

505
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:21,388
I'm sorry.

506
00:30:21,389 --> 00:30:23,392
It's just Gypsy is so happy here.

507
00:30:23,393 --> 00:30:25,271
I don't want us to have to move again.

508
00:30:25,272 --> 00:30:27,149
Why would you have to move?

509
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:30,198
It's just so much to handle.

510
00:30:31,242 --> 00:30:34,414
All of it, all the time, all at once.

511
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,794
Coming from different directions.

512
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:38,673
Like any minute it...

513
00:30:38,674 --> 00:30:40,761
it could all just fall apart.

514
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:43,450
Tell me about it.

515
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:46,606
Lacey's driving me
out of my fucking mind.

516
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:48,693
Oh.

517
00:30:48,694 --> 00:30:50,655
They don't see it.

518
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:53,118
All that we do for them.

519
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,833
It's our cross to bear.

520
00:30:57,377 --> 00:30:59,005
Whoever called CPS

521
00:30:59,006 --> 00:31:01,134
is just some nosey bitch
from the Price Cutter

522
00:31:01,135 --> 00:31:04,015
sticking her nosey face
where it don't belong.

523
00:31:04,016 --> 00:31:05,847
Forget about it.

524
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,460
- Hi, have you seen my mom?
- She's right outside.

525
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,297
- Okay, thank you, bye.
- Bye.

526
00:31:27,647 --> 00:31:29,900
- Gypsy Blanchard?
- Oh.

527
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:33,074
Showtime for you and Mr. Bluebeard.

528
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:38,793
Almost done, sweet pea.

529
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:41,047
- She hates needles.
- Oh, it's okay.

530
00:31:41,048 --> 00:31:42,634
It's okay.

531
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:45,345
It's like a tattoo.

532
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:47,309
Pretty soon you'll have

533
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,896
that beautiful smile back again.

534
00:31:48,897 --> 00:31:50,315
You know what they say:

535
00:31:50,316 --> 00:31:52,194
The teeth are the eyes of the mouth.

536
00:31:54,576 --> 00:31:56,036
Let's give her a little something

537
00:31:56,037 --> 00:31:58,206
- to make her feel better.
- Yes, Doctor.

538
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,461
You're okay.

539
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,758
- Deep breath.
- All right.

540
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:05,513
Now, Mom, you may want
to wait in the lobby.

541
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:06,932
Could be a little while given the number

542
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:08,827
of extractions that we have to do.

543
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:10,940
Mom?

544
00:32:10,941 --> 00:32:12,527
Extractions?

545
00:32:12,528 --> 00:32:14,531
Mom?

546
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:15,950
- No, no, please.
- Honey bee...

547
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:17,286
I don't wanna do this!

548
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:19,415
It'll all be over soon.

549
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:20,919
It's okay, honey.

550
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,258
Just relax and lay back.
It'll be better soon.

551
00:34:33,225 --> 00:34:35,229
No...

552
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:38,779
No...

553
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,332
It's all right,
sweetheart, it's all right.

554
00:35:09,381 --> 00:35:12,804
You'll get new teeth soon, baby.

555
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:15,183
It just takes time.

556
00:35:21,238 --> 00:35:23,075
Oh, honey.

557
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:27,125
Like a little bird.

558
00:35:30,549 --> 00:35:32,697
Hmm?

559
00:35:33,304 --> 00:35:35,348
Oh...

560
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:39,191
Oh, no.

561
00:35:41,905 --> 00:35:45,745
It's all right, sweetheart.

562
00:35:45,746 --> 00:35:48,208
It's all right.

563
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:49,714
Aw.

564
00:35:50,631 --> 00:35:53,635
You want more bubbles, hm?

565
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,637
Okay.

566
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,976
It's all right, mama's here.

567
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:03,436
It's all right.

568
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:06,773
All right.

569
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,960

577
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,186
It's coming, you know.

578
00:36:40,187 --> 00:36:42,357
Child of the Year.

579
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:44,278
We gotta think about
what we're gonna wear.

580
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:46,282
We gotta buy something
to put in your hair.

581
00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:48,690
I was thinking of wearing mine up.

Dentist said it could be a few weeks.

585
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,891
Your gums are still swollen.

586
00:37:03,944 --> 00:37:05,781
Gypsy.

587
00:37:08,035 --> 00:37:09,878
My teeth...

588
00:37:10,498 --> 00:37:12,250
My face.

589
00:37:12,251 --> 00:37:14,171
Aww...

590
00:37:15,717 --> 00:37:18,764
It's nothing
a little foundation can't help.

591
00:37:18,765 --> 00:37:21,228
Besides, you're always pretty.

592
00:37:24,735 --> 00:37:26,603
Gypsy!

593
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,953
I know what "pretty" looks like, Mom.

594
00:37:29,954 --> 00:37:33,251
What has gotten into you?
It's not like you.

595
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,589
You always look on the bright side.

596
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,593
I got you this award.

597
00:37:37,594 --> 00:37:40,725
Out of all the kids
in the world, they chose you.

598
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:43,271
- I don't wanna go.
- Gypsy!

599
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:45,735
You are going to this event.

600
00:37:46,988 --> 00:37:48,783
Are we clear?

601
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:52,540
Hello?

602
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:54,043
Ms. Blanchard?

603
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:55,963
It's Dr. Chandra calling
from Blessed Heart.

604
00:37:55,964 --> 00:37:57,550
I'm... I'm just calling to follow up

605
00:37:57,551 --> 00:37:59,928
and, uh, see how Gypsy was doing.

606
00:38:00,515 --> 00:38:04,104
Oh, Dr. Chandra, how sweet of you.

607
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:05,733
Well, you'll be happy to know

608
00:38:05,734 --> 00:38:08,572
that Gypsy just had
all her dental work done.

609
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:11,410
We're focused on her recovery right now.

610
00:38:11,411 --> 00:38:13,707
She has been through so much.

611
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,460
Of course, I know.

612
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:17,130
And so have you.

613
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:20,846
You know, you have a very sick
little girl, um, Ms. Blanchard,

614
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:22,600
and you're dealing with so much.

615
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:24,353
And actually, that's...
that's really why I called.

616
00:38:24,354 --> 00:38:26,440
I am calling to see

617
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:29,332
if I can take anything
off your shoulders.

618
00:38:30,324 --> 00:38:32,787
Well, I can't imagine that.

619
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:36,127
For instance, uh,
changing her feeding tube.

620
00:38:36,128 --> 00:38:39,259
Dr. Harley tells me you like
to have a physician do it.

621
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,596
Well...

622
00:38:41,597 --> 00:38:43,725
I do sometimes come in for that,

623
00:38:43,726 --> 00:38:46,063
but I can do it here, though.

624
00:38:46,064 --> 00:38:48,359
Oh, I... well, I would be more than happy

625
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,696
to take care of it for you.

626
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:51,867
And... and while, uh, we're at it

627
00:38:51,868 --> 00:38:54,581
I can, um, discuss with you

628
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,545
the underlying, uh, causes

629
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:59,799
for the acid reflux.

630
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,429
Uh, we can discuss treatment options.

631
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:05,310
Um, I... I can recommend

632
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:08,065
specialists to you that...
that could really weigh in

633
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:10,069
and help us solve it.

634
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:13,660
I... I just really want
to make, uh, it as easy for you

635
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:16,332
to deal with all of Gypsy's issues.

636
00:39:21,468 --> 00:39:24,557
Oh, well, that's very kind of you.

637
00:39:24,558 --> 00:39:25,972
I know.

638
00:39:26,436 --> 00:39:28,105
We moms...

639
00:39:28,106 --> 00:39:30,193
We have to look out
for each other, right?

640
00:39:30,194 --> 00:39:33,324
I'm gonna have my, uh, nurse
set up an appointment,

641
00:39:33,325 --> 00:39:35,579
and I will see you two very soon.

642
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,775
Thank you.

643
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:40,339
Oh.

644
00:39:51,236 --> 00:39:54,659
Can't rush it if you want it done right.

645
00:39:57,206 --> 00:39:58,625
Oh.

646
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:00,838
Oh...

647
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:02,217
Oh.

648
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:04,344
Okay.

649
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:29,394
Oh, you look so pretty, Gypsy Rose.

650
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:42,003
And that's what so many people get wrong

651
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:44,341
about philanthropy.

652
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:45,969
It's not just for billionaires

653
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,432
to feel better about themselves.

654
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:50,061
Anytime you reach out...

655
00:40:50,062 --> 00:40:51,438
Okay.

656
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:53,234
Do we still have a few minutes?

657
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:55,531
- Uh, yeah.
- Okay.

658
00:40:55,532 --> 00:40:57,993
You know how I always tell you

659
00:40:57,994 --> 00:41:01,291
that everything will always work out?

660
00:41:07,346 --> 00:41:09,600
Each and every one of them.

661
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:13,204
Go on.

662
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:21,916
Oh, Gypsy Rose!

663
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:23,753
You're beautiful!

664
00:41:23,754 --> 00:41:25,423
Oh, my goodness.

665
00:41:25,424 --> 00:41:27,636
Do we have an award
for "mother of the year" too?

666
00:41:27,637 --> 00:41:29,849
Oh.

667
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,480
- Thank you, Mom.
- Mm.

668
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:35,652
But...

669
00:41:35,653 --> 00:41:39,034
why didn't you give these to me before?

670
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:41,163
Well, they just come this morning.

671
00:41:41,164 --> 00:41:42,583
Fresh from the dentist.

672
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:46,173
And we were so rushed I almost forgot.

673
00:41:46,174 --> 00:41:48,177
And this way, by gosh,

674
00:41:48,178 --> 00:41:51,433
it's like Cinderella
at the stroke of midnight.

675
00:41:51,434 --> 00:41:54,147
Does the glass slipper fit?

676
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:00,326
Oh...

677
00:42:00,327 --> 00:42:01,746
Okay, ladies, it's time.

678
00:42:01,747 --> 00:42:04,627
Oh, okay. Oh.

679
00:42:04,628 --> 00:42:07,676
It's a smile that will melt your heart.

680
00:42:11,182 --> 00:42:13,060
It's hard to imagine

681
00:42:13,061 --> 00:42:14,939
anyone more deserving

682
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,530
of the 2009 Child of the Year Award

683
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:21,493
than Gypsy Rose Blanchard.

684
00:42:32,601 --> 00:42:36,524
And that award comes
with a gift from the community.

685
00:42:36,525 --> 00:42:38,862
To help her devoted mother, Dee Dee,

686
00:42:38,863 --> 00:42:40,699
and with Gypsy's medical needs.

687
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,786
Oh.

688
00:42:46,545 --> 00:42:48,798
Oh, oh.

689
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:51,178
Thank you.

690
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:57,190
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

691
00:42:57,191 --> 00:42:59,403
Thank you all.

692
00:43:00,907 --> 00:43:02,993
Gypsy's feeling a little shy,

693
00:43:02,994 --> 00:43:06,501
so I'll just say
a few words on her behalf.

694
00:43:06,901 --> 00:43:10,383
I heard what you said before,
about helping people...

695
00:43:10,384 --> 00:43:12,261
saving them.

696
00:43:12,262 --> 00:43:14,892
How anyone can do that.

697
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,606
But I don't think that's true.

698
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:20,152
I think it takes
a special kind of person.

699
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,246
Raising a child like Gypsy,

700
00:43:25,247 --> 00:43:28,589
people wanna turn you
into that kind of person.

701
00:43:29,881 --> 00:43:31,592
They hear what we been through

702
00:43:31,593 --> 00:43:33,763
and they say, "Oh, Dee Dee,

703
00:43:33,764 --> 00:43:36,729
you saved that little girl's life.

704
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:40,737
But I'm not special.

705
00:43:42,114 --> 00:43:45,286
I never saved Gypsy.

706
00:43:45,287 --> 00:43:47,775
Gypsy saved me.

707
00:43:50,673 --> 00:43:53,823
I was born to be your mama.

708
00:43:54,346 --> 00:43:58,020
I carried you into this world,

709
00:43:58,021 --> 00:44:01,193
but you've been carrying me ever since.

Dr. Forest, dial 118, please.

723
00:45:21,187 --> 00:45:25,235
Well, well. Hello, Gypsy and Dee Dee.

724
00:45:25,236 --> 00:45:26,572
How are you doing?

725
00:45:26,573 --> 00:45:28,042
Come on back. You ready?

726
00:45:28,661 --> 00:45:30,329
Actually, Ms. Blanchard,

727
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:33,293
I forgot to get you to fill out
a few medical release forms,

728
00:45:33,294 --> 00:45:36,634
and I need a copy
of your new insurance card.

729
00:45:36,635 --> 00:45:39,515
Well, we won't get started
without you anyway, Mom, so...

730
00:45:39,516 --> 00:45:42,896
Yeah, if you could just
come with me for just a second.

731
00:45:42,897 --> 00:45:44,482
Oh, I'll be right behind you.

732
00:45:44,483 --> 00:45:45,819
- Okay.
- All right?

733
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,154
- It won't take a sec.
- Yeah.

734
00:45:47,155 --> 00:45:49,076
Okay, let's go quick.

735
00:45:50,705 --> 00:45:52,164
Wait, what happened

736
00:45:52,165 --> 00:45:53,500
to Riley the frog?

737
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,047
Um, well, I get
a new stuffed animal to hold

738
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:57,759
every time we go to the doctor.

739
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,763
Oh.

740
00:45:59,764 --> 00:46:02,644
Um, and I heard
your dental work was a success.

741
00:46:02,645 --> 00:46:03,896
Can I take a... ee.

742
00:46:03,897 --> 00:46:05,775
Oh, my goodness.

743
00:46:05,776 --> 00:46:07,571
Your teeth look excellent.

744
00:46:07,572 --> 00:46:09,533
Are you able to eat more
as a result of it?

745
00:46:09,534 --> 00:46:11,662
Um, I still mostly use my tube.

746
00:46:11,663 --> 00:46:13,040
Oh, yeah?

747
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:14,793
Well, if that's what you're,
um, comfortable with.

748
00:46:14,794 --> 00:46:16,463
That... that makes sense.

749
00:46:16,464 --> 00:46:18,760
My mom says it's the best that I can do.

750
00:46:18,761 --> 00:46:19,970
Mm.

751
00:46:19,971 --> 00:46:22,349
But I hope that one day

752
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,312
I can not maybe have to use

753
00:46:24,313 --> 00:46:25,899
the tube anymore, like you said.

754
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,033
Gypsy, maybe that day isn't too far away.

755
00:46:31,536 --> 00:46:34,666
And remind me, what foods can you eat?

756
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,169
Um, only soft foods.

757
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,881
And no sugar, 'cause I'm allergic.

758
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:39,635
So if I have sugar I could die.

759
00:46:39,636 --> 00:46:42,891
Mm, okay. And how do you know that?

760
00:46:42,892 --> 00:46:46,356
W... well, my mom did all the tests.

761
00:46:46,357 --> 00:46:47,567
Okay.

762
00:46:47,568 --> 00:46:49,487
Gypsy, I have some
really good news for you.

763
00:46:49,488 --> 00:46:51,575
I spoke to a doctor

764
00:46:51,576 --> 00:46:53,120
who had treated you earlier this year

765
00:46:53,121 --> 00:46:56,544
in one of your ER visits,
and he's not too sure

766
00:46:56,545 --> 00:46:58,255
that you're allergic to sugar.

767
00:46:58,256 --> 00:47:01,554
And frankly, I'm not too sure, either.

768
00:47:01,555 --> 00:47:03,599
In fact...

769
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,520
I'll make you a bet.

770
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:08,066
I will bet you...

771
00:47:08,067 --> 00:47:11,115
a can of Coke that you're not allergic.

772
00:47:12,827 --> 00:47:14,482
There you go.

773
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,026
Here.

774
00:47:18,129 --> 00:47:19,548
Just take a sip.

775
00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:21,594
And... and don't be scared,

776
00:47:21,595 --> 00:47:23,973
because if you drink it
and you are allergic,

777
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,017
I'm right here.

778
00:47:25,018 --> 00:47:26,520
I'll take care of you right away.

779
00:47:26,521 --> 00:47:29,192
And if you drink it
and you are not allergic,

780
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:31,822
well, that just means
you can... you can go crazy

781
00:47:31,823 --> 00:47:34,953
and have as much sugar
as you want from now on.

782
00:47:34,954 --> 00:47:37,374
And maybe we will discover

783
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:41,384
that there are other things
that you can do, too.

784
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,644
My mom is my best friend.

785
00:47:52,531 --> 00:47:55,160
All she wants to do is keep me safe.

786
00:47:55,161 --> 00:47:57,749
I believe you, sweetheart.
I know that, I do.

787
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,836
And it's really clear

788
00:47:59,837 --> 00:48:03,531
that she loves you very much, right?

789
00:48:04,137 --> 00:48:06,684
But sometimes, um...

790
00:48:09,481 --> 00:48:11,401
Even parents can get confused.

791
00:48:11,402 --> 00:48:13,531
And sometimes even parents need help.

792
00:48:13,532 --> 00:48:15,827
And maybe this is the help that...

793
00:48:15,828 --> 00:48:17,333
that both of you need.

794
00:48:18,332 --> 00:48:21,924
Go ahead. Just take one sip.

795
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:25,638
And I promise, I will do the rest.

796
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,486
My mom needs me.

797
00:48:46,221 --> 00:48:47,724
Mom.

798
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:50,437
Mom, I was waiting for you!

799
00:48:50,438 --> 00:48:52,567
Mm-hmm.

800
00:48:52,568 --> 00:48:53,653
Good.

801
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:56,950
We're all ready.

802
00:49:04,634 --> 00:49:07,054
There we go. Just breathe normally.

803
00:49:07,055 --> 00:49:09,768
Okay.

804
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:11,522
Okay, all right.

805
00:49:11,523 --> 00:49:13,109
Good job.

806
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:26,927
All right.

807
00:49:51,435 --> 00:49:54,024
What a fucking nightmare.

808
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:10,222
All this is for one kid?

809
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:21,369
How you doing? Are you hanging in there?

810
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:24,166
There's just some stuff
I keep thinking about.

811
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:25,418
Yeah? Like what?

812
00:50:25,419 --> 00:50:27,422
Oh, Gypsy.

813
00:50:27,423 --> 00:50:29,594
I mean, you know how they'd talk

814
00:50:29,595 --> 00:50:32,057
all that fairytale fantasy stuff?

815
00:50:32,058 --> 00:50:34,270
You can't tell what's real or not.

816
00:50:34,271 --> 00:50:37,560
And she told something,
and I'm just wondering...

817
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:41,409
Lacey, what are you talking about?

818
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:50,094
Detective Flores, here they are.

819
00:50:51,764 --> 00:50:54,351
You have something you wanna tell us?

820
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:56,898
Tell them what you told me, Lace.

821
00:50:56,899 --> 00:50:59,194
Um, I don't know...

822
00:50:59,195 --> 00:51:02,492
I don't know if this
would be helpful, but, um...

823
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:06,710
Gypsy used to kind of
confide in me sometimes, and...

824
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,427
One thing she told me, like, years ago

825
00:51:11,428 --> 00:51:15,811
was that she, um, had
a secret Facebook account.

826
00:51:15,812 --> 00:51:18,651
And I think she might have
used it to make...

827
00:51:18,652 --> 00:51:21,281
Uh, friends.

828
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,829
"Friends"?

829
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:27,710
Yeah, like... men.

830
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:29,570
Romantically.

831
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:32,512
I don't know, sometimes
it was hard to tell

832
00:51:32,513 --> 00:51:35,141
what was her imagination
and... and what wasn't,

833
00:51:35,142 --> 00:51:37,187
but I think...

834
00:51:37,188 --> 00:51:40,026
Gypsy might have a... a boyfriend.

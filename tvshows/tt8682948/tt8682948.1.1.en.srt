00:00:11,481 --> 00:00:13,192
911. What's the emergency?

3
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:15,781
Hi, um, it's our neighbors.

4
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,660
I think something's wrong.

5
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:19,606
Can you send someone over, please?

6
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:20,892
What's going on?

7
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:22,920
Me and my mom are outside right now.

8
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,717
Their car is here, but nobody's
answering the door.

9
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:27,554
Dee?

10
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:28,974
Is that why you're worried, ma'am?

11
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:30,727
No one's answering the door?

12
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:33,190
Gypsy, Dee Dee, you guys okay?

13
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:34,860
Well, no.

14
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:36,405
This morning, I looked at their Facebook,

15
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:37,908
and on their page...

16
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:39,369
Dee Dee!

17
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,543
I don't... there was
some real scary posts on it.

18
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:44,797
And I'm just really worried about them,

19
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:46,634
and I just need somebody here.

20
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:49,264
Ma'am, what did the Facebook posts say?

21
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:51,769
It said, "That bitch is dead."

22
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:54,232
Dee Dee!

23
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:55,694
And then, um...

24
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:57,238
Dee Dee!

25
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,908
"I fucking slashed that pig

26
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:01,664
"and raped her sweet, innocent daughter.

27
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:04,211
Her scream was so fucking loud, L.O.L."

28
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:07,801
Okay, we're gonna send
someone over right away.

29
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:11,263
Mom?

30
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:13,307
Mom!

31
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,819
You can't just go in there!

32
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,074
Mel, be careful.

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,559
Mom, they're here.

35
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:37,276
Dee Dee?

36
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:40,731
Mom?

37
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:51,678
_

38
00:01:52,182 --> 00:01:54,812
How does it feel to be in this house?

39
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:58,611
Well, Gypsy and I have always
loved fairy tales.

40
00:01:58,612 --> 00:02:00,991
But, you know,

41
00:02:00,992 --> 00:02:02,953
I really didn't believe in happy endings

42
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:05,542
in the real world... not until now.

43
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:08,798
It's almost like we're in a Disney movie.

44
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:11,114
We love Disney movies.

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,725
Have you seen "Enchanted"?

46
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:16,062
That princess in the real world?

47
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:17,858
No, no, I didn't.

48
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:19,528
Oh, God.

49
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:22,785
I got off track. What was the question?

50
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:25,039
How did it feel, Dee Dee,
when you found out

51
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,335
that Habitat for Humanity
was gonna build this house

52
00:02:27,336 --> 00:02:29,339
just for you and Gypsy?

53
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,345
Getting this house has been
a dream come true.

54
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,019
I don't like to dwell on the past,

55
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,608
but when we were homeless
after Katrina...

56
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:40,529
If it wasn't for her,

57
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,979
I tell you...

58
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:43,827
I don't know what I would have done.

59
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:47,458
That girl, she is stronger
than she looks.

60
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,880
I'm lucky to be her mom.

61
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:52,239
I was born to be her mom.

62
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:55,266
And are you excited to be here

63
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:56,644
and make new friends, Gypsy?

64
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:58,537
- Oh, yes...
- You bet she is.

65
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:01,612
It would be great
if we could hear from Gypsy

66
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:02,739
on how she's feeling.

67
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,158
Oh, of course.

68
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,244
Hon?

69
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:07,290
Are you excited to be here,

70
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,713
to make new friends?

71
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:12,551
Well...

72
00:03:13,177 --> 00:03:16,767
um, my mom already is my best friend.

73
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:18,189
But the funny thing is,

74
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,192
a few years ago, she had gave me

75
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:23,363
this little glass house.

76
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:25,952
And she said, "One day...

77
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:28,081
this will be yours."

78
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,694
And now it finally is!

79
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:32,953
That was great.

80
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:34,193
My producers are gonna love this.

81
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:35,930
Oh, that's good to hear.

82
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:37,433
I get nervous about these things.

83
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:39,786
Are you kidding? You guys were awesome.

84
00:03:43,906 --> 00:03:45,500
Was I good?

85
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:50,042
You were perfect.

86
00:04:26,658 --> 00:04:28,126
Hmm.

87
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,173
There we go.

88
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,218
Nice getting it all off.

89
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:40,267
I wonder what it would look like

90
00:04:40,268 --> 00:04:41,729
if it grew in.

91
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,903
Probably be a rat's nest like mine.

92
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:49,481
Okay.

93
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:52,166
Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

94
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,172
who's the fairest one of all?

95
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:57,572
- You are!
- No, you are.

96
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:03,106
What's eating at you, huh?

97
00:05:04,526 --> 00:05:06,821
I just hope that we get
to stay this time.

98
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:08,917
Oh, we will.

99
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:15,673
Yep, that's what you said in Slidell.

100
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,558
Yeah, okay, I was wrong that time.

101
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:24,141
This is different.

102
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,569
You know why?

103
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,146
This house don't belong
to the government.

104
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:32,122
They gave it to us.

105
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:35,420
They even put my name
on a piece of paper.

106
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,799
You know what that means?

107
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,741
That it's ours? Yours and mine?

108
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:44,228
Ooh.

109
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:47,027
Just in time for your medicine.

110
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:52,411
We're gonna live in this house together

111
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:54,671
for the rest of our lives.

112
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,550
And there are no hurricanes in Missouri.

113
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:19,423
Did you look
at the sky tonight, sweet girl?

114
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:21,782
And what did you see?

115
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:25,604
I saw all the stars hanging up there.

116
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,903
You remember that night
all those years ago?

117
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:33,703
The way the Spanish moss
was whispered in the trees...

118
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,502
I thought it was a couple of ghosts.

119
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:40,007
And I told you to look at the stars

120
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:42,093
and not those ghosts.

121
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:45,267
Because the stars are angels

122
00:06:45,268 --> 00:06:47,689
and the angels protect us.

123
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,018
And you are my angel.

124
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:53,491
And you protect me, and I protect you.

125
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:11,820
Okay.

126
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:19,085
Power up.

127
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:21,007
Good night, hon.

128
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,301
Good night.

129
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:49,145
Ooh...

130
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:53,403
Oh, no.

131
00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:56,751
Yes.

132
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,199
Sleepy baby.

133
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:38,076
Why are you cheating? Mom, he's cheating!

134
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:39,955
- Mom, I'm not!
- Yes, you are!

135
00:08:39,956 --> 00:08:41,583
Hey, Trey, Darren.

136
00:08:41,584 --> 00:08:42,947
Take it outside or in your room.

137
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:44,135
No...

138
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:48,388
Mom? Mom, let's go.

139
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:50,100
Lace, I was working until midnight.

140
00:08:50,101 --> 00:08:51,687
- I got a fucking headache.
- Really?

141
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:53,190
Is that why you have a headache?

142
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,611
Just 'cause you saw those people on TV

143
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:56,613
don't make 'em special.

144
00:08:56,614 --> 00:08:58,324
I'm just curious.

145
00:08:58,325 --> 00:08:59,661
I mean, the least we can do

146
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:01,623
is help the new people settle in.

147
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,752
If you go around going out of your way

148
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:05,380
trying to be kind to everybody,

149
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:07,322
people are gonna take advantage of you.

150
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:10,473
Fine, I'll go be neighborly on my own.

151
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:11,727
Enjoy the couch.

152
00:09:11,728 --> 00:09:13,078
I will.

153
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:15,580
Mother of the year.

154
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:29,054
Oh.

155
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:33,061
Mom, who is it?

156
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,452
Oh, hello. You must be our new neighbor.

157
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:44,109
Yeah. We live across the street.

158
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,171
I'm Lacey.

159
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:48,446
It's nice to meet you.

160
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:50,554
Well, come. Come on in.

161
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,642
Come.

162
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:57,568
Oh, hey! You must be Gypsy.

163
00:09:57,569 --> 00:09:58,915
Hi.

164
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:01,577
- Cool hat.
- Oh, thank you.

165
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:03,747
It's so good to meet you.

166
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:06,210
Wow, you're a charmer, huh?

167
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:09,884
Um, I did see y'all on TV, actually.

168
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:11,680
Uh, that's sort of why I came over.

169
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:14,393
Um, I'm doing this volunteer thing

170
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:16,355
at Springfield Memorial,

171
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:18,234
and sometimes we like to do

172
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:20,405
the little girls' makeup
over there, cheer 'em up.

173
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:21,533
It's fun.

174
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:23,369
And, um, I was just wondering

175
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,543
if Gypsy maybe wants a makeover?

176
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,254
I need the practice, to be honest.

177
00:10:28,255 --> 00:10:29,674
- Well, um...
- Yes, please, Mom.

178
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:31,178
Please? Please, please, please?

179
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:34,768
Well, uh, I do have
a couple more boxes to unpack.

180
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,353
Just a little touch, okay?

181
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:38,860
Oh, yeah.

182
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:43,284
Man, you are being so good.

183
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:45,497
You are sitting so still.

184
00:10:45,498 --> 00:10:47,297
Do you like wearing makeup?

185
00:10:47,878 --> 00:10:50,633
Well, my mom lets me wear it
to conventions.

186
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:52,343
Cool.

187
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,939
Your necklace is so pretty.

188
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,901
Thanks.

189
00:10:59,902 --> 00:11:02,072
My boyfriend gave it to me.

190
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:03,659
You have a boyfriend?

191
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,663
Mm-hmm, I do.

192
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,750
Um, are you in love?

193
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,169
Uh...

194
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,883
I mean, he's kind of a dumb-ass, but...

195
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:13,595
I don't know,
I'll probably, like, marry him

196
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:15,223
or something one day.

197
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:20,860
Now, open your eyes wide

198
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:23,364
and look like, right here.

199
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:25,912
- Okay.
- Hmm.

200
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:29,293
So...

201
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:31,298
these convention things,

202
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:33,426
do you dress up as

203
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,181
Xena the Warrior Princess or something?

204
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:38,311
No.

205
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:39,689
No.

206
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,402
Um, well, I'm mostly a Disney person.

207
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:43,822
I-I love Disney,

208
00:11:43,823 --> 00:11:46,160
so I-I-I go as Cinderella sometimes.

209
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:49,082
But, um, next time I really want to go

210
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,588
as Ariel from "The Little Mermaid."

211
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:53,885
Oh, right, 'cause Ariel gets her legs.

212
00:11:56,807 --> 00:11:58,918
Um, didn't... I'm sorry.

213
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,564
No, no, no, it's okay.

214
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:02,359
Um, when I was little, I could walk.

215
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,737
You could?

216
00:12:03,738 --> 00:12:05,115
Well, that's what my mom says.

217
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:07,243
Um, and that my dad

218
00:12:07,244 --> 00:12:09,958
made fun of the way I walked,
or something?

219
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,503
I don't... I don't really think

220
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:13,548
he liked having a kid who was crippled.

221
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:15,886
But I don't remember that.

222
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:17,554
I was too little.

223
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:21,099
I had a bad dad, too.

224
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:30,733
They're missing out.

225
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:34,904
That smells good.

226
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:38,098
That looks really pretty.

227
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,970
Beautiful.

228
00:12:42,816 --> 00:12:44,247
Okay.

229
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,252
Take a look.

230
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:59,387
- Lacey?
- Yeah?

231
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:02,228
Can we be friends?

232
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:04,357
Heck, yeah, we can.

233
00:13:04,358 --> 00:13:07,406
I think it was, like, fate
that you moved here.

234
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,359
Hey, Mama.

235
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:15,004
Yeah.

236
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:16,883
Yeah, I know, I know.

237
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:20,825
- All right.
- Bye.

238
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,828
Bye.

239
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:04,235
- Did you have a nice visit?
- Yeah.

240
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:06,900
I think her mom was wondering
where she was, though.

241
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:09,572
It's funny she come over
and her mama didn't.

242
00:14:09,573 --> 00:14:12,201
You know what? Maybe I should
take a cake or something over.

243
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:14,247
Start off on the right foot.

244
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:15,918
That's a good idea.

245
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:17,462
Mom, Lacey said...

246
00:14:17,463 --> 00:14:19,717
Didn't I say you were gonna make friends?

247
00:14:19,718 --> 00:14:21,136
Yes.

248
00:14:21,137 --> 00:14:23,683
I worry about making friends, too.

249
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:26,271
It's so important
to make a good impression

250
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:29,310
on the folks around here
so they accept us.

251
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:31,658
We may not have family,

252
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:33,745
but there are good people everywhere.

253
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:35,164
We just have to find them.

254
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,026
- Hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

255
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:54,335
Mom?

256
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:04,139
Here, wash all that stuff
off of your face.

257
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,226
But she just did my makeup.

258
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:07,395
Hey...

259
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:09,900
you are far too young

260
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:12,854
for all of that paint, pretty girl.

261
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:15,565
It's too grown-up for you.

262
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:17,971
Now scrub.

263
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:21,456
Scrub.

264
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,145
Girls wear makeup, Mom.

265
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:30,350
You're not like other girls.

266
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:35,660
Aw, sweet pea.

267
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:39,752
I know sometimes you want
to be like everybody else.

268
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:41,672
But you know what?

269
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:44,887
I like you special.

270
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:51,191
- I know.
- Okay.

271
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:54,949
Hey, put a smile on that clean face.

272
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,552
Oh.

273
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,985
Aw, that's my baby.

274
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:03,571
Mm.

275
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:21,627
Ooh.

276
00:16:29,644 --> 00:16:31,438
Mom, that's Lacey!

277
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:33,442
We should go say hi!

278
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:35,186
We should say hi.

279
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,590
- Hey, Lacey!
- Oh, hey, Gypsy!

280
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:46,162
Hi!

281
00:16:46,163 --> 00:16:47,804
Oh, this is my boyfriend, Luke.

282
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:48,957
- Hello.
- He's the one

283
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,267
who gave me this necklace.

284
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:51,729
Don't forget the rims!

285
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,273
Yoo-hoo, hello!

286
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:54,693
Hi, Luke. Nice to meet you.

287
00:16:54,694 --> 00:16:56,656
- Hello.
- Hi.

288
00:16:56,657 --> 00:16:59,369
- You must be Dee Dee.
- Oh, yes, I'm Gypsy's mom.

289
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,705
You must be Lacey's.

290
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:02,584
She might be mine.

291
00:17:02,585 --> 00:17:03,878
No, but she's wonderful.

292
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:06,509
No, she ain't. She talks back.

293
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,136
That's why she's here washing a car

294
00:17:08,137 --> 00:17:09,390
and not at the high school
with her friends.

295
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:11,497
You're keeping me
from a charity fund-raiser.

296
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,397
Family first.

297
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:16,153
Well, you look awful young to be her mom.

298
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:18,855
That's a lie if I ever heard one.

299
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:21,872
Uh, no, no, I mean it.

300
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:23,250
I'm Shelley.

301
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,377
Hello.

302
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:25,964
Don't be scared of Mel.

303
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:27,718
She seem like she bite, but she don't.

304
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:28,928
Well, there was that one time.

305
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:32,268
Come on up.

306
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:34,036
Oh, thank you.

307
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:37,486
"Sub-man-dig old-yeller-what?"

308
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:39,282
Oh, I know it's a hard one.

309
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:40,952
Submandibular gland surgery.

310
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:43,206
That's when she had
her salivary glands removed

311
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:45,419
'cause she was choking herself.

312
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,131
She's got the epilepsy,

313
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,637
paraplegia, a heart murmur.

314
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:51,306
She can barely take anything by mouth

315
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:53,310
and, well, she's anemic.

316
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:55,982
Mm. When my kids got
colds at the same time,

317
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:58,863
I was like, "Lord, take 'em, please.

318
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:00,659
Find them a good family."

319
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,119
How the heck do you manage?

320
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,647
Oh, I sleep with one eye open, I suppose.

321
00:18:05,648 --> 00:18:07,111
Me too.

322
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:09,718
Can't watch them forever, though, right?

323
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,304
Mel's a great mom,

324
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:13,685
especially if you believe in tough love.

325
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:16,064
I just don't believe in spoiling them.

326
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:17,776
You got to teach them
to fend for themselves

327
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:19,237
as soon as they can walk.

328
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:21,324
Oh, Mel...

329
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:24,039
Everything is different with my Gypsy.

330
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:26,964
Of course.

331
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:29,717
She ain't well.

332
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:31,261
She can't fend for herself.

333
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:32,663
She'll never be able to.

334
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:35,895
I have to do everything for her.

335
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:38,066
That must be a burden to carry.

336
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:39,862
Oh, it is.

337
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:42,283
Thank God I'm good at it, though.

338
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:43,745
Lord knows her daddy wasn't.

339
00:18:43,746 --> 00:18:46,416
I am the only one she has.

340
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,629
If I wasn't around...

341
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,134
Who knows where she'd be?

342
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:54,659
- Hmm.
- She seems lucky to have you.

343
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:57,578
Anyway, welcome to the neighborhood.

344
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:00,444
Pretty much what you see
is what you get, I guess.

345
00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:02,406
Nice knowing ya.

346
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,285
Yeah, yeah, just get the top.

347
00:19:04,286 --> 00:19:06,289
Just get... no, no, no!

348
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,584
- Put me down!
- Hey, watch it!

349
00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:09,045
Ah, stop it!

350
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:11,299
So dirty.

351
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,636
Knock it off!

352
00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:14,345
Yeah, just get the top.

353
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:22,061
You want some?

354
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:25,995
Wait, what? Say that again.

355
00:19:25,996 --> 00:19:27,206
We all know us a few...

356
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,043
Oh, no! She can't have that!

357
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,839
- She can't have a Coke?
- No, she's allergic!

358
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,218
Sugar! A sip, maybe, but a whole Coke...

359
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:34,428
she could go into shock!

360
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:36,057
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

361
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:38,771
Oh, I have an EpiPen.
How much did she have?

362
00:19:38,772 --> 00:19:40,942
Oh, she didn't have any.

363
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:46,620
We've already gone to the ER
six times this year.

364
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:49,626
And as fun as that is,
I'd hate to make it seven

365
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:52,006
before the end of summer.

366
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:53,551
Sorry about that.

367
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:55,470
- Oh...
- That's okay. Bye, Lacey.

368
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:56,929
You couldn't have known.

369
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,098
Bye, Gypsy...

370
00:20:00,474 --> 00:20:03,236
Now, why do we carry this around with us?

371
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:05,157
In case I have a reaction.

372
00:20:05,158 --> 00:20:06,731
Yeah.

373
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,877
And how much sugar is in a can of Coke?

374
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:12,254
A lot.

375
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:13,883
Mm-hmm.

376
00:20:13,884 --> 00:20:16,972
And what would happen
if you had all of that?

377
00:20:16,973 --> 00:20:20,145
I know, but what if
I just had one or two sips?

378
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:21,941
Just a little sugar.

379
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:23,611
Baby...

380
00:20:23,612 --> 00:20:28,204
do you know what
a severe reaction looks like?

381
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:34,425
First, you start coughing and hacking.

382
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:36,762
And then your whole body gets itchy,

383
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:39,639
like you're covered
with spiders or something.

384
00:20:40,604 --> 00:20:45,019
And then your face blows up
like a balloon.

385
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:48,689
It gets all red and puffy.

386
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:51,457
And then your throat starts closing up,

387
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,715
and before you know it, my baby's gone.

388
00:20:54,716 --> 00:20:57,386
I won't... I won't do it again.

389
00:20:57,387 --> 00:21:00,727
- I won't leave you, I promise.
- Okay, okay.

390
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:02,605
- I'm sorry.
- I believe you.

391
00:21:02,606 --> 00:21:05,737
- I believe you. I believe you.
- I'm sorry.

392
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:09,452
Oh, you're such a good girl
to me, Gypsy Rose.

393
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,713
Oh, we take care of each other, don't we?

394
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:17,176
Yeah.

395
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:19,931
Oh, today's been hard.

396
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:23,271
But tomorrow...

397
00:21:24,355 --> 00:21:28,073
Why don't we do something
that'll cheer us both up, hmm?

398
00:21:28,074 --> 00:21:30,189
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

399
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,126
Mm.

400
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:02,391
I like the pink one.

401
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:08,236
Oh.

402
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:18,591
- Mom.
- No.

403
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:19,801
No?

404
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:21,555
No, you're not getting a laptop.

405
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:24,019
- You can use mine with me there.
- No, Mom, not a laptop.

406
00:22:25,814 --> 00:22:28,038
Can I have that necklace?

407
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:30,363
That blue one?

408
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:31,909
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

409
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,294
Please?

410
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:36,465
Nobody's watching.

411
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:45,978
Look how cute it looks
with what you're wearing.

412
00:22:49,654 --> 00:22:51,657
Now, Mom, now.

413
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,213
Mom, what's wrong?

414
00:24:10,314 --> 00:24:13,529
Mom, I want to go inside.
I'm really tired.

415
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,365
Oh, just a minute.

416
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:21,962
Hi, Mel!

417
00:24:21,963 --> 00:24:24,134
Hey, Gypsy!

418
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:27,641
Hi, Mel.

419
00:24:31,524 --> 00:24:32,830
Ooh.

420
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:35,739
Okay, you go inside.
I'll be in in a minute.

421
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,577
Are you going over there?

422
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:39,163
Can I please come? I want to go.

423
00:24:39,164 --> 00:24:40,541
- No, no, no.
- I want to go.

424
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:41,835
Don't sass me.

425
00:24:41,836 --> 00:24:44,008
You want to go in, now go in.

426
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:51,353
Mel?

427
00:24:51,354 --> 00:24:53,817
Uh, hey, Mel?

428
00:24:53,818 --> 00:24:56,405
Um, could I speak to you for a minute?

429
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:00,205
Mel?

430
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:02,835
Um, can I talk to you for a minute?

431
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:03,986
What?

432
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:07,427
Hey!

433
00:25:07,428 --> 00:25:09,431
How you doing, Dee Dee?

434
00:25:09,432 --> 00:25:11,770
Oh, well, Gypsy's real happy

435
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:15,443
we ended up in a place
with such good neighbors.

436
00:25:15,444 --> 00:25:16,988
I can come back.

437
00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:18,784
How's that house treating you?

438
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:20,704
Like it was made just for you, I bet.

439
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:22,750
Oh, it was.

440
00:25:24,128 --> 00:25:25,966
That's a joke, Dee Dee.

441
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:28,677
I should know. I helped build it.

442
00:25:29,515 --> 00:25:30,724
We all did.

443
00:25:30,725 --> 00:25:32,640
That's how Habitat works.

444
00:25:33,648 --> 00:25:35,517
You need something?

445
00:25:37,238 --> 00:25:39,157
Well, Gypsy and I were just thinking

446
00:25:39,158 --> 00:25:40,911
of whipping something up tonight,

447
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:42,832
and I looked in the fridge,

448
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,003
and, dang it, we don't have any butter.

449
00:25:45,004 --> 00:25:47,007
So I was wondering if you have any butter

450
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,572
I could borrow.

451
00:25:49,555 --> 00:25:51,992
No, sorry. I'm watching my figure.

452
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,440
You might have to go down
to the store, you know...

453
00:25:55,441 --> 00:25:56,872
pick some up.

454
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:35,186
Did y'all see "Nancy Grace" last night?

455
00:26:35,187 --> 00:26:37,858
Do you believe that Casey Anthony shit?

456
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:39,987
Car smells like a dead body for a month

457
00:26:39,988 --> 00:26:41,866
and nobody notices?

458
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,494
I don't pay attention to that shit on TV.

459
00:26:43,495 --> 00:26:45,541
Everybody always acts all shocked.

460
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:47,670
But personally, if you keep an eye out,

461
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:49,882
you can tell if somebody's no good.

462
00:26:49,883 --> 00:26:51,343
Remember Tracy's boyfriend?

463
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:52,763
Jake?

464
00:26:52,764 --> 00:26:54,433
Remember how I called that?

465
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:56,813
Maybe you shouldn't talk
about that right now.

466
00:26:56,814 --> 00:26:58,308
She don't know them.

467
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:01,113
Why, Shelley? Dee Dee might
as well get used to the fact

468
00:27:01,114 --> 00:27:03,033
that sooner or later,

469
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:04,746
everybody knows everything about everyone

470
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:06,358
in this neighborhood.

471
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:53,050
Gypsy?

472
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:55,764
Oh.

473
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:58,060
Gypsybug?

474
00:28:01,025 --> 00:28:02,402
Hey, Mom.

475
00:28:02,403 --> 00:28:04,281
Did you have a nice visit with Mel?

476
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:06,118
Was Lacey there?

477
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,834
Oh, Gypsybug, I'm having a horrible day.

478
00:28:12,464 --> 00:28:15,554
Oh, I don't feel much
like cooking tonight.

479
00:28:15,555 --> 00:28:18,267
Let's get pizza.
Pizza always cheers you up.

480
00:28:18,268 --> 00:28:21,189
Well, you know what?
Maybe we can swing it.

481
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,893
Yay!

482
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,882
I like Lacey's mom.

483
00:28:54,883 --> 00:28:56,427
She's nice.

484
00:28:58,181 --> 00:28:59,850
I like her, too.

485
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:01,854
I don't think she likes me, though.

486
00:29:01,855 --> 00:29:03,817
Everybody likes you, Mom.

487
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:06,270
Oh, you're sweet.

488
00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:09,954
Well, I think on this block...

489
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:12,901
Mel is the queen bee.

490
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:15,487
You and her should be friends.

491
00:29:15,883 --> 00:29:17,553
And then me and Lacey could be friends.

492
00:29:17,554 --> 00:29:19,783
- Wouldn't that be fun?
- Hmm.

493
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,055
Unfortunately, your mama might have made

494
00:29:22,056 --> 00:29:23,579
a bad first impression.

495
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:26,445
I don't know quite how to fix it.

496
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:28,667
Why don't we invite them over?

497
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:30,620
You could make gumbo.

498
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:32,713
Everybody likes your gumbo.

499
00:29:35,297 --> 00:29:37,885
You know what? You're right.

500
00:29:39,222 --> 00:29:42,310
We should make a gumbo...

501
00:29:42,311 --> 00:29:45,483
for all our new neighbors.

502
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:49,115
We should throw a party
they can remember us by.

503
00:29:49,116 --> 00:29:50,271
Hmm?

504
00:29:51,705 --> 00:29:54,209
A party.

505
00:30:10,827 --> 00:30:12,370
Hello, everyone.

506
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:13,957
I'm Dee Dee. How do you do?

507
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:15,669
- Hi.
- That's my daughter, Gypsy.

508
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,550
She just loves playing
with the other little kids.

509
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:22,390
Oh, aren't you sweet?

510
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:24,435
Thank you for donating.

511
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:26,147
Oh, that's so sweet of you.

512
00:30:26,148 --> 00:30:29,028
I can't believe how generous
all our neighbors are.

513
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:31,909
It's not my best gumbo,
but it's a good gumbo.

514
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,453
Is it good? Have y'all tried it?

515
00:30:33,454 --> 00:30:35,124
It was hell on Earth...

516
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,169
- Mmm.
- But I had to go back

517
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,132
because my mama gave me this
before she died.

518
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:41,136
- It was a gris-gris.
- "Gris-gris"?

519
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:43,641
Oh, that's Louisiana
for "good-luck charm."

520
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:46,146
I want to give it to Gypsy one day.

521
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:50,321
Gyspy, how old are you?

522
00:30:50,322 --> 00:30:52,450
Gypsy, what type of seat?

523
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,329
Gypsy, look, a balloon!

524
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,416
Here, baby, look.

525
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:57,839
Yeah.

526
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:00,341
Light blue.

527
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,560
They are one step closer

528
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:28,523
to confirming the skeleton found here

529
00:31:28,524 --> 00:31:30,067
is Caylee Anthony,

530
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:33,073
saying that the bones belong
to a little girl.

531
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:34,743
Turns out the medical examiner says

532
00:31:34,744 --> 00:31:36,496
they're yet to conclude.

533
00:31:36,497 --> 00:31:38,125
Stop.

534
00:31:38,126 --> 00:31:40,880
Hey, Gypsy. Come hang out with us.

535
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:42,425
You guys, this is Gypsy.

536
00:31:42,426 --> 00:31:44,220
- Hey, Gypsy.
- How's it going?

537
00:31:44,221 --> 00:31:45,724
Hey, Gypsy.

538
00:31:45,725 --> 00:31:47,351
Okay, you have to help us

539
00:31:47,352 --> 00:31:48,980
keep an eye on things around here.

540
00:31:48,981 --> 00:31:51,359
Seriously, it's like
"Desperate Housewives."

541
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,700
There's a lot of stuff going on
behind closed doors.

542
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:57,581
Your mom lets you watch
"Desperate Housewives"?

543
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,835
Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

544
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:02,381
Um, babe, we got to actually get going.

545
00:32:02,382 --> 00:32:03,787
Oh.

546
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,972
We're gonna go see a movie
with some of Luke's friends.

547
00:32:05,973 --> 00:32:07,684
Uh, probably something with Megan Fox

548
00:32:07,685 --> 00:32:09,563
and, like, robots blowing up.

549
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:10,815
Can I come?

550
00:32:10,816 --> 00:32:12,372
Um...

551
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:15,449
actually, I think your mom and all...

552
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,119
she might not...

553
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,539
I'm sorry.

554
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,000
But, you know, I'll see you later, okay?

555
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:23,006
- Okay.
- Uh, thanks for coming.

556
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:13,023
Oh, he's got no job that I know of.

557
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,860
- No money that we ever see.
- Oh.

558
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:16,989
I should have listened to my mama.

559
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,241
Mothers know.

560
00:33:18,242 --> 00:33:20,538
Damn straight.

561
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:23,335
Oh, well, look who's up early.

562
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:25,380
Come on over here, Mel.

563
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:28,094
Mel, I'm so happy you made it.

564
00:33:28,095 --> 00:33:30,057
It wouldn't be a party without you.

565
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:31,727
I don't know about that.

566
00:33:31,728 --> 00:33:33,606
Well, did you try the gumbo, Mel?

567
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:35,192
We got us a chef here.

568
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:36,904
Oh, it's nothing.

569
00:33:36,905 --> 00:33:39,408
You can't get a decent pound
of andouille around here

570
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:41,079
no matter how hard you try.

571
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,085
But I worked it out.

572
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:45,979
I'll get you some.

573
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:56,401
Look, Dee Dee.

574
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:58,948
I ain't one to keep my mouth shut.

575
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:00,827
You know I saw what y'all
were doing at the mall.

576
00:34:00,828 --> 00:34:02,149
Oh...

577
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,503
Gypsy has a little problem.

578
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:07,841
She's got the mind of a child.
Sometimes she takes things.

579
00:34:07,842 --> 00:34:09,281
Cut the shit.

580
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:11,741
I saw you.

581
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:13,435
I just think it's funny,

582
00:34:13,436 --> 00:34:15,355
this whole "perfect mom" act
you got going.

583
00:34:15,356 --> 00:34:17,192
- It's not an act.
- Oh, come on, Dee Dee.

584
00:34:17,193 --> 00:34:19,030
You play like you're the saint.

585
00:34:19,031 --> 00:34:20,449
You've got your little girl

586
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,502
helping you steal from the jewelry rack?

587
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:25,000
Well...

588
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:26,461
you're right.

589
00:34:26,462 --> 00:34:28,298
I just...

590
00:34:30,094 --> 00:34:31,680
Gypsy...

591
00:34:31,681 --> 00:34:33,350
she's gonna die young.

592
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:36,022
She deserves to have
nice things once in a while,

593
00:34:36,023 --> 00:34:38,569
and disability just doesn't cover it.

594
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,197
And her father, he just...

595
00:34:40,198 --> 00:34:42,409
I'm just saying,
I think it's pretty funny...

596
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,330
Gypsy! No!

597
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:46,668
- Dee Dee, what's wrong?
- Oh, shit, she's allergic.

598
00:34:51,846 --> 00:34:54,976
- Okay.
- Ow!

599
00:34:54,977 --> 00:34:57,412
I got to get her to the emergency room!

600
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:00,445
Everybody, I'm sorry.

601
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:02,784
Just help yourself. There's food there.

602
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:06,792
There but for the grace of God.

603
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:10,048
That woman has been
kicked around, beat up,

604
00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:13,598
and gone through honest-to-God shit.

605
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:30,506
She's always had to be careful.

606
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:31,717
I know. I'm... I'm sorry.

607
00:35:31,718 --> 00:35:33,094
You remember what happens

608
00:35:33,095 --> 00:35:35,015
if you have an allergic reaction.

609
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:37,060
Your throat closes up.

610
00:35:37,061 --> 00:35:39,190
You can't breathe.

611
00:35:39,191 --> 00:35:41,987
Your body strangles you.

612
00:35:41,988 --> 00:35:44,408
Five minutes... I could have
lost you forever.

613
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,127
Is that what you want?

614
00:35:47,457 --> 00:35:50,086
- Why don't you listen to me?
- I'll listen.

615
00:35:50,087 --> 00:35:52,049
You say that.

616
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,343
Mom, I will.

617
00:35:53,344 --> 00:35:55,096
I'll listen.

618
00:35:55,097 --> 00:35:58,269
Gypsy...

619
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:01,902
I'm mad because I could have lost you.

620
00:36:01,903 --> 00:36:03,781
I love you.

621
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,632
Oh, jeez, look at us.

622
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:15,345
Mm.

623
00:36:15,346 --> 00:36:16,869
Hey, Dee Dee.

624
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,438
How's she doing?

625
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:24,739
Oh, uh, she's gonna be okay.

626
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,325
Hi, Mel.

627
00:36:26,326 --> 00:36:27,794
Hey, sweetie.

628
00:36:28,707 --> 00:36:31,003
Up we go.

629
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,425
Here we go.

630
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:36,305
Okay.

631
00:36:37,641 --> 00:36:40,897
Okay, okay.

632
00:36:43,862 --> 00:36:46,115
What are you doing here?

633
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:49,371
Well, you bolted so fast,
you forgot your wallet.

634
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:51,752
Don't want you to get
pulled over without a license.

635
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:54,256
Oh.

636
00:36:54,257 --> 00:36:57,513
Oh, thank you for bringing this.

637
00:36:57,514 --> 00:36:59,016
Sure thing.

638
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:01,856
Um, wait, wait.

639
00:37:06,448 --> 00:37:08,251
I, um...

640
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:14,088
Let's just forget it.

641
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:16,009
I mean, it is what it is, right?

642
00:37:17,513 --> 00:37:19,431
I don't want people to see us

643
00:37:19,432 --> 00:37:21,765
like they did in Louisiana.

644
00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:25,820
I got...

645
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:29,368
some... some misdemeanors and such,

646
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:30,607
and...

647
00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:32,484
I got...

648
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:35,737
a bad reputation, and...

649
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:38,762
people treated me like
I was nothing, and...

650
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,352
I don't know, something...

651
00:37:42,353 --> 00:37:45,080
went so wrong with my life.

652
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:48,625
And I don't know where or when...

653
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:51,961
but that girl, being her mama...

654
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,756
it's the only thing I ever done right.

655
00:37:58,887 --> 00:38:00,388
11 years ago,

656
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:03,144
Lacey's dad started acting real scary.

657
00:38:03,145 --> 00:38:05,148
Stuck the kids in the car and took off.

658
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,893
50 bucks to my name.

659
00:38:07,821 --> 00:38:09,699
I did some shit.

660
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,799
I ain't ashamed,

661
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,607
but I wouldn't put it on my gravestone.

662
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:16,630
What do you say?

663
00:38:16,631 --> 00:38:18,029
Fresh start?

664
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:21,574
I would like a...

665
00:38:22,058 --> 00:38:24,244
I would like a fresh start.

666
00:38:28,195 --> 00:38:30,366
Oh.

667
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,246
Is that my warrant?

668
00:39:15,247 --> 00:39:16,963
Shit.

669
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:21,258
It's like the North fucking Pole

670
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:23,095
in here, right?

671
00:40:38,038 --> 00:40:39,206
Ugh!

672
00:40:39,207 --> 00:40:41,836
Oh, shit.

673
00:40:45,094 --> 00:40:47,515
I think we found Ms. Blanchard.

674
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:50,311
Let's seal it off.

675
00:40:50,312 --> 00:40:51,856
This is a crime scene, everybody.

676
00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:53,735
- Nobody in or out.
- Wait, what's happening?

677
00:40:53,736 --> 00:40:56,741
Back up, please.

678
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,767
Hey. What did you find?

679
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:11,353
You gonna tell us what's going on now?

680
00:41:11,354 --> 00:41:14,038
We found Mrs. Blanchard. She's deceased.

681
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:17,041
Dee Dee's dead? How?

682
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:20,622
This is a homicide investigation.

683
00:41:20,623 --> 00:41:22,918
- Oh, my God.
- Back up!

684
00:41:26,176 --> 00:41:27,928
What about Gypsy?

685
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:30,433
Where is Gypsy?

686
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,366
Did you look
at the sky tonight, sweet girl?

687
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,541
And what did you see?

688
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:46,633
I saw all of the stars hanging up there.

689
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:48,344
You remember that night

690
00:41:48,345 --> 00:41:51,308
all those years ago?

691
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:53,187
The way the Spanish moss

692
00:41:53,188 --> 00:41:57,111
- was whispered in the trees...
- Mm.

693
00:41:57,112 --> 00:41:59,074
I thought it was a couple of ghosts.

694
00:41:59,075 --> 00:42:00,786
And I told you,

695
00:42:00,787 --> 00:42:04,084
- "Look at those stars..."
- "Not the ghosts."

696
00:42:05,212 --> 00:42:07,508
Because the stars are angels

697
00:42:07,509 --> 00:42:10,470
and the angels protect us.

698
00:42:11,307 --> 00:42:13,806
And you're my angel.

699
00:42:14,523 --> 00:42:16,943
And you protect me, and I protect you.

700
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:21,744
Okay.

701
00:47:07,274 --> 00:47:08,985
Gypsy knows better!

702
00:47:08,986 --> 00:47:10,697
She's always had to be careful.

703
00:47:12,242 --> 00:47:14,078
Yeah, I tell her, and I tell her...

704
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,124
- No.
- And I tell her.

705
00:48:26,808 --> 00:48:29,312
It's not possible, Mrs. Blanchard.

706
00:48:29,313 --> 00:48:32,276
The PediaSure you give her
has a lot of sugar.

707
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:34,729
Your daughter does not have
a sugar allergy.

708
00:48:37,412 --> 00:48:40,208
Well, something's wrong with her!

709
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,212
Mrs. Blanchard, we've checked everything.

710
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:44,383
Look at my daughter's chart. She's got...

711
00:48:44,384 --> 00:48:46,597
We've been here 15 times.

712
00:48:46,598 --> 00:48:48,016
I understand.

713
00:50:30,263 --> 00:50:32,560
I was thirsty.

714
00:50:33,562 --> 00:50:35,182
Get in bed.

715
00:51:06,654 --> 00:51:08,257
Oh...

716
00:51:10,343 --> 00:51:13,306
Bab... baby.

717
00:51:13,307 --> 00:51:16,563
My baby.

718
00:51:16,564 --> 00:51:18,567
Baby, it's okay.

719

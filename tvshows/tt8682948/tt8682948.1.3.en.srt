1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,650
Gypsy, her teeth
are like Swiss cheese.

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,160
I've been
sneaking out at night

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,080
to go and eat sweet stuff.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,460
- I do a lot worse than that
when I sneak out, right?

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,460
Yeah.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,760
I'm Allison Granger

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,600
with the Children's Division
of Missouri Social Services.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,770
A report has been filed
by a member of your community

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,350
concerning the safety
of your daughter.

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,270
Does your mom ever
make you do something

11
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,480
you don't want to do?

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,820
My mom is my best friend.

13
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,620
All she wants to do
is keep me safe.

14
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,660
They don't see it.

15
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,460
All that we do for them.

16
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,920
It's our cross to bear.

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,050
2009 "Child of the Year" award:

18
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,020
Gypsy Rose Blanchard.

19
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,770
I will bet you
a can of Coke

20
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,450
that you're not allergic
to sugar.

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,620
Mom, I was waiting for you!

<i>Dear Gypsy Rose,</i>

24
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,890
<i>your story warms my heart</i>

<i>This letter</i>

26
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,150
<i>is just a little something</i>
<i>to help your mama, too.</i>

27
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,570
<i>Sending you this money helps</i>
<i>me keep my mind at ease.</i>

28
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,910
<i>Please do not feel obligated</i>
<i>to respond to this letter.</i>

29
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,250
<i>It truly is my honor</i>
<i>to be able to help.</i>

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,070
You are my angel.

31
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,950
And you protect me...

32
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,700
and I protect you.

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,380
- Good night.

34
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,470
Good night.

35
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,550
<i>Kissing is a quiet activity.</i>

36
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,720
You don't want to hear
too much smacking there.

37
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,550
The...
that kind of thing--

38
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,560
<i>That's not correct</i>
<i>kissing technique.</i>

39
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,410
And just a little bit
of pink lipstick

40
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,620
to balance out
some dark circles.

41
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,710
Okay.

42
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,680
You look beautiful.
Look!

43
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,180
- Ooh!

44
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,520
Oh, how'd you get
so good at that?

45
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,400
- Um, oh, I just practiced
on a doll.

46
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,360
But you're so pretty.

47
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,450
- Aww.

48
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,820
Now it's your turn.

49
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,580
I'm so excited
to meet new people

50
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,250
at FanOptiCon.

51
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,130
Do you think maybe
we could call Lacey

52
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,930
and see if she can
do my makeup?

53
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,270
- Oh, no.

54
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,440
Honeybee, look at your dress.

55
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,740
You gotta go change.

56
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,740
I'm so sorry,
I must have shrunk it.

57
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,700
- Oh, well-- but, Mom,
you look so great.

58
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,540
And we match together.

59
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,630
- Don't argue.

60
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,130
Go on, go get Cinderella.

61
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,600
You make
the sweetest Cinderella.

62
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,390
And you'll look nice
and beautiful.

63
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,990
- Okay.

64
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,100
One princess
and one princess's mother.

65
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,740
Okay.

66
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,570
- How old are you?
- She's 15.

67
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,450
Born in 1995.

68
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,960
- Oh. The cutoff
for child's admission is 12.

69
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,170
But she looks 12,

70
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,010
so we'll just keep this
our little secret.

71
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,350
- Oh!

72
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,720
Oh, thank you.

73
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,980
- So you can keep that.
- Oh, thank you.

74
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,360
One for you, one for you.

75
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,650
- Thank you.

76
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,660
- You made my day.
- Aww.

77
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,080
- Mom, um...

78
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,380
I thought you said
I was born in 1993.

79
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,010
- Oh, if I said that,
I do apologize.

80
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,640
Since that car accident,

81
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,230
my head is no good
with numbers.

82
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,900
When we had that little trip
to your neurologist,

83
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,280
I looked at your card.

84
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
It said 1995.

85
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,640
Gypsy!
Hi, Shelley!

86
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,680
- Ooh!
- Can you believe this?

87
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,600
- You made it!

88
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,770
- Yes.

89
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,650
- Everyone's so nice
to each other here.

90
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,280
- Oh, we're all weirdoes
in our own way.

91
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,740
It's just nice to be around

92
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,370
your own,
specific fellow weirdoes.

93
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,500
Oh, this is Dougie,
my boyfriend.

94
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,840
- Oh, hello.
- But don't tell anybody that.

95
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,800
He is pure Dark Force today.

96
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,390
Can't talk.
- Oh, hi.

97
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,110
- And what are you, Shelley?
- Oh.

98
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,280
I'm a Rebel Commando
on the Endor Strike Force.

99
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,120
Oh, okay.

100
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,620
- Plus, I'm a friendly face,

101
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,000
so kids feel like
they can come up to Dougie

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,080
and take a picture.

103
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,500
Aww.

104
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,630
Ooh!

105
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,510
Oh, aren't they gorgeous?

106
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,180
- Oh, if there's anything
your heart desires,

107
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,100
tell me now.

108
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,730
- I like your dress.
- She's so lovely.

109
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,940
Oh, yes.

110
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,700
- Oh my God,
they're so pretty!

111
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,120
Oh, that brings me right back.

112
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,040
You know, your mama used to be
a pageant queen.

113
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,000
Really?
What was your talent?

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,170
- Oh, oh, it was nothing.

115
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,680
- Come on, now.

116
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,720
I was a pageant girl, too.
- Oh.

117
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,690
Oh, well, I did
a little bit of yodeling.

118
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,570
- "Yodeling"?
- Yes.

119
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,110
- Well, now we have to see it.
- Yeah, Mom!

120
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,370
I wanna see!
- Oh...

121
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,480
You called?

122
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,530
- Uh, Logan--
but you can call me Russ.

123
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,990
- Oh, well,
Claudinea Blanchard.

124
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,950
But you can call me Dee Dee.

125
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,580
This is my daughter,
Gypsy Rose.

126
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,790
- Hi.

127
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,290
- And this is Dougie,
and this is Shelley.

128
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,210
- How you doing?
- Hey, look at this.

129
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,340
I just had this done.
What do you think?

130
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,340
- Oh!
- Look like me?

131
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,890
Yes.

132
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,310
Yes, very handsome.
- Okay, good.

133
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,190
- Let me see if we can spot
Prince Charming.

134
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,900
- Okay.

135
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,910
Oh, Shelley look!

136
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,740
- So, Dee Dee...

137
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,290
What's a-- what's a real
beauty queen doing here

138
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,960
with all these ones
who are playing dress-up?

139
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,720
- Oh, you a real charmer.

140
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,850
Well, I'm here with Gypsy.

141
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,890
Oh, she loves dressing up

142
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,270
and looking at all the toys.

143
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,650
What do you like?

144
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,620
- What do you mean?

145
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,870
- There's, uh, art...

146
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,080
books, and, uh,
and a contest.

147
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,960
- Oh...
- They got speed dating.

148
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,090
Gypsy likes all of it.

149
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,720
She likes to meet all the nice
and interesting people and...

150
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,480
- What about you?

151
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,570
I don't understand.

152
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,320
Well,
I--I just want to say

153
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,540
I truly appreciate
your devotion to your daughter.

154
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,710
- Oh, she's my everything.

155
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,010
- Yeah, well,
that's just the thing.

156
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,760
And, you know,

157
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,720
maybe this is none
of my beeswax,

158
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,270
but, uh, you just seem
like someone

159
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,280
who's got layers to you.

160
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,950
And, uh...

161
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,750
well, I'm kinda curious
to know more about what--

162
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,790
what those might be.

163
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,920
- Oh...

164
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,210
I mean, it's not--
it's not every day

165
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,930
Oh, it's true.

166
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,350
Well...

167
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,980
Well, would you just excuse me
for one moment, Russ?

168
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,820
- Okay, all right.

169
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,370
Gypsy Rose,
I gotta go to the little girls' room.

170
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,540
Let's go.
- Oh, well, I can stay, Mom.

171
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,630
Shelley's here.

172
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,550
- Well...
- She's fine.

173
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,300
She's fine, Dee Dee.
- Okay.

174
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,720
Be back in a flash.
- Okay.

175
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,010
Whoop, excuse me.

176
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,390
- All right, you wanna go...

177
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,610
Really?

178
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,440
Dougie made a kid cry again.

179
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,650
I gotta go fix it.

180
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,280
Won't be but two minutes, okay?

181
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,910
- Okay, I'll wait here.
- All right, sweetie.

182
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,230
I think
it would look very good on you.

183
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,400
I think so,
but I like angel unicorn.

184
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,620
Oh, yes,
I think that would be great, too.

185
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,080
Maybe that purple's
good, too.

186
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,460
- Totally your color.
- Hi.

187
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,130
I'm Gypsy.
I love Wolverine.

188
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,180
Some call me Logan.

189
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,100
But you can call me Scott.

190
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,480
And everybody loves Cinderella.

191
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,070
- Would you like
to try those on?

192
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,530
- Oh, um, yeah.

193
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,530
Do you have a size four?

194
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,450
- No, but we do have
the same print

195
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,460
on a Mary Jane
in the kid's section.

196
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,300
In fact, have you ever
thought about Ariel?

197
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,470
You'd be great.
You wouldn't have to worry

198
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,720
about moving around
in the tail.

199
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,310
You'd be amazing.

200
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,110
- Oh, I don't have enough
for that.

201
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,280
- Okay, um...

202
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,990
how about a nice red wig?

203
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,160
A girl can do a lot
with a red wig.

204
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,460
- Barbara Gordon--
AKA Batgirl--

205
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,340
Red Sonja, Mystique,

206
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,010
and, of course,

207
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,390
there's only one redhead
for Wolverine:

208
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,350
Jean Grey.

209
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,230
- I don't know them.

210
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,320
- What?

211
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,990
- Would you like to try it on?

212
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,370
- Um...

213
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,580
I don't have enough
for that, either.

214
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,800
- One moment, okay?

215
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,720
- You really don't know
who Jean Grey is?

216
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,140
- I don't know!

217
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,180
- How about...

218
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,020
you start with Flounder?

219
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,070
On the house.

220
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,530
Can I help you?

221
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,200
- That fish is not a flounder.

222
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,420
It looks more like
an angelfish.

223
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,260
- Just because
they call him Flounder

224
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,050
doesn't mean
he <i>is</i> a flounder.

225
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,980
Do you even want
to be Ariel?

226
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,530
- Well, they threatened
to nail her fin to the floor.

227
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,920
- How old are you?

228
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,300
- 18.

229
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,100
Well, it just has
to make it through today.

230
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,930
We're gonna start trying
next month.

231
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,270
Wash your hands
before you slap my ass!

232
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,530
Ready?

233
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,740
I wanna meet someone
while I'm still cute.

234
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,660
Oh, I am so sorry, ma'am.

235
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,060
- Oh...

236
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,930
- So tell me about
your lady love.

237
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,390
- Me?

238
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,720
Oh, no, I don't...

239
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,850
I don't have a girlfriend.

240
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,150
- No, silly, I'm talking
about Wolverine's girlfriend.

241
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,530
- Oh, um...

242
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,290
I was a loner.

243
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,250
I liked it that way.

244
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,800
Doing what needed to be done.

245
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,970
- That's when I met her.

246
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,520
Jean Grey.

247
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,060
I love her,
and I know she loves me.

248
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,820
She's just...

249
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,570
obligated to someone else
who loves her, too.

250
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,870
So...

251
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,010
I walk alone.

252
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,350
Scott?

253
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,690
You're just about
the most honorable man

254
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,020
I've ever met.

255
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,530
- You are the sweetest
Cinderella I've ever met.

256
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,880
Oh, wow!

257
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,180
Look at that!
We have to go look at that!

258
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,470
Come on, let's go!

259
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,400
Have you ever seen
one of these before?

260
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,990
- Yes, of course.
It's the DeLorean.

261
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,120
- Of course I've seen--
- Guys, uh, excuse me?

262
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,410
You wanna come up front?

263
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,460
- Oh, no, that's okay.
- They're okay with it.

264
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,500
Come on.
- Are you sure?

265
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,800
Come up
to the front, yeah.

266
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,760
- Yeah, sweetie, go ahead.
- Thank you.

267
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,680
Thank you so much.

268
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,710
Okay, guys.

269
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,550
If you're ready,
say "great Scott!"

270
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,170
Great Scott!

271
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,750
Dee Dee was about the nicest,

272
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,420
most giving person I ever met.

273
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,970
What kind of monster
would do that to her

274
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,970
and take poor Gypsy
on top of it?

275
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,280
- What'd she always say?

276
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,740
"It's like a pair of shoes:

277
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,160
One never good
without the other."

278
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,960
- They really
only had each other.

279
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,170
- There were never
any men there.

280
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,180
- You know, this one time
Dee Dee called me

281
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,520
the middle of the night
asking about some guy.

282
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,820
She was all worked up.

283
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,450
It was a long time ago,
though, but...

284
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,080
she was pretty freaked.

285
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,660
- I mean, what would
possess Dee Dee to call you

286
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,080
in the middle of the night
about some guy?

287
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,920
- I didn't ask.

288
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,000
It didn't seem right.

289
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,590
I don't know
what was going on.

290
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,760
It was just really important
to Dee Dee to get his name.

291
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,560
- Well, how'd you not have
a million questions?

292
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,520
- Mel, I'm not you.

293
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,070
You're closer to her.

294
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,940
I didn't think much of it
at the time.

295
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,200
- Well, who was he?
- I don't remember.

296
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,410
Some guy.

297
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,080
That was four years ago.

298
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,080
Maybe she had a few.

299
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,550
A drunk dial or something.

300
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,230
You ever see that woman
drink beer?

301
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,670
You know what, Mel?

302
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,430
Maybe at times like these,

303
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,980
every little thing just comes
to your mind, okay?

304
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,860
- Well, who is this guy?
Where is he now?

305
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,280
- Mel, I don't know.

306
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,220
- Okay, sweetie, come on.
Big smile.

307
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,680
Big smile.

308
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,430
All righty.

309
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,730
- Where's-- where's Gypsy?

310
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,190
You said
you'd watch her for me!

311
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,440
Uh, she's just in
the next aisle with Wolverine.

312
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,900
- "Wolverine"?
I knew it.

313
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,990
Don't worry,
Scott's a nice guy.

314
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,120
- Do they hurt?
- Every time.

315
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,130
Oh, oh!

316
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,710
Oh, Gypsy, I found you.

317
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,970
- Oh, um, hi, Mom.

318
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,930
This is my friend, Wolverine.

319
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,730
But you can call him Scott.

320
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,270
Yeah, pleased to meet you.

321
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,900
Um, pardon the claws.

322
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,950
- Well, we have to get going.

323
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,410
- Can we please stay, Mom?

324
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,790
There's a party later on
with a costume contest.

325
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,920
- Oh, we just have
to get going, Gypsybug.

326
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,090
That's just not possible.

327
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,180
- Hey.

328
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,770
Great minds.

329
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,890
Hi, Miss Dee Dee.

330
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,190
Can I-- can I bend your ear?

331
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,450
- Oh, say good-bye
to your friend.

332
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,810
I guess I gotta go.

333
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,170
Unless you want to use those
on my mom for me.

334
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,930
- What?
I--I'm a good guy.

335
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,970
We can still be friends.

336
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,680
Are you on Facebook?

337
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,230
- My mom and I have an account.

338
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,320
- You're 18 and you don't have
your own Facebook account?

339
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,620
- I guess I don't.

340
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,120
What's yours?

341
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,420
Ms. Dee Dee,
I didn't--

342
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,630
I didn't mean
to scare you off earlier.

343
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,960
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

344
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,380
I know I can be
a little forward, I apologize.

345
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,680
Oh, not at all.

346
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,770
- Just, um, you know, I--
I been where you been.

347
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,400
I...

348
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,280
I lost my...

349
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,740
my boy when he was 13.

350
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,160
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

351
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,000
That's my worst nightmare.

352
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,380
- Yeah.

353
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,460
It was Batten disease.

354
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,590
He-- he was in a chair
at the end.

355
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,430
Oh, my Lord.

356
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,140
- So I understand how your--

357
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,360
your kid can be
your everything.

358
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
- Mm-hmm, she is my everything.

359
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,610
- Oh, I-- I see that.
That's the truth.

360
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,200
I see the way
you take care of her.

361
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,290
Yeah.

362
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,080
- You're the only
true superhero here.

363
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,290
- Oh, you are
embarrassing me. Ha.

364
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,130
Just, uh, from one
to another,

365
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,890
a little piece of advice:

366
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,640
You gotta cut out
a little piece

367
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,060
of the world for yourself.

368
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,860
That-- that's what I meant
when I was asking about you.

369
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,240
You can lose yourself
in all the giving.

370
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,990
Well, that is
a beautiful thought.

371
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,460
But having been where I am,

372
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,960
you know how hard that is.

373
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,630
Well, I understand how
you can think that way, sure.

374
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,970
Um, sure do.

375
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,650
Um, it's just that,
you know...

376
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,270
I just want to get to know you.

377
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,830
If you stay for a while,
buy you a pizza.

378
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,790
- Oh...
- Got my cutters.

379
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,920
- Oh, oh, I have to get back
to my daughter, but--

380
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,510
she needs her medication.

381
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,970
- Oh, I understand that.

382
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,270
Sure I do.

383
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,030
- Did you see him
following me around?

384
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,030
That used to happen
when I was a girl.

385
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,910
Oh, I'm not used to that.

386
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,080
I was just trying to spend
the day with my daughter,

387
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,670
and he comes up.

388
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,170
Did you think he was cute?

389
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,180
He was polite.

390
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,560
Some people just don't know
how to mind their own beeswax,

391
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,230
that's for sure.

392
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,190
I suppose he was just trying
to be nice,

393
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,780
but you never can tell.

394
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,040
- Mom?

395
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,870
How did you meet my dad?

396
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,080
- Oh, we were just

397
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,970
two young, dumb kids
on the bayou.

398
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,190
Dumb enough to fall in love.

399
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,610
- Well,
what's dumb about love?

400
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,070
Love is not dumb.

401
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,530
It makes you dumb,
that kind of love.

402
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,960
Not the way that I love you.

403
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,630
- I know that you love me,
but you must have loved my dad.

404
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,680
Like crazy.

405
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,640
I might still do.

406
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,940
That's probably why
I never had anyone else.

407
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,860
Then why did you split up?

408
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,530
- Oh, it wasn't my decision.

409
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,000
- Oh.

410
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,630
Then why...

411
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,510
I don't understand.

412
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,180
- What you need to understand

413
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,100
is that you can't rely
on any man.

414
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,360
Or anyone, for that matter,

415
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,070
other than your own mama.

416
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,620
- Um, so he just left?

417
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,300
- Well...

418
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,930
come to think of it,
it was my decision.

419
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,350
There were two choices,
but there was only one choice.

420
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,280
And I chose you.

421
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,990
And I will always choose you.

422
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,000
A man can leave.

423
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,420
A mother, not so much.

424
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,220
Well, we have enough love

425
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,970
between the two of us,
don't we?

426
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,440
- I love you, Mama.

427
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,990
- Oh, I love you, Gypsybug.

428
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,420
<i>She's 15.</i>
<i>Born in 1995.</i>

429
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,750
- Oh, Gypsy, girl!

430
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,710
Grab your mama
a little sweet tea.

431
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,510
I'll even let you have
a little sip

432
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,880
if you're a good girl.

433
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,810
- You got a deal, lady!
- Okay.

434
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,300
- Hello.
- Hi.

435
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,970
- That's Pump #7?

436
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,640
- And this too, please.

437
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,180
That'll be $35.25.

438
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,900
I got your quarter.
- Thank you.

439
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,160
And one of those, too.

440
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,780
Thank you.

441
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,160
- Hello?

442
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,210
Who is this?

443
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,210
Russ.

444
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,510
Oh, Wolverine.

445
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:47,510
Well, of course.
How could I forget?

446
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,180
How'd you get my number?

447
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,590
<i>Hey, it's Gypsy</i>
<i>from the convention.</i>

448
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,640
<i>Hi,</i>
<i>Gypsy-from-the-convention.</i>

449
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,070
<i>So weird, I was</i>

450
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,030
<i>What a crazy coincidence.</i>

451
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,040
<i>It must be fate.</i>

452
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,960
<i>Let's be friends, okay?</i>

453
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,300
<i>So, 18 years old</i>

454
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,180

<i>Better late than never,</i>
<i>I guess.</i>

456
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,640
<i>How's life?</i>

457
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,730
<i>I wanna know more about you.</i>

458
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,030
<i>I've been keeping busy.</i>

459
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,910
<i>Hanging out with my friends.</i>

460
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,450
<i>Sometimes I feel like</i>

462
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,000
<i>I'm sure you don't have</i>
<i>to work hard at that.</i>

463
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,130
<i>After all,</i>
<i>you charmed me, right?</i>

464
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,580
- Oh, hi.

465
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,170
<i>My work as a surgeon</i>
<i>is really demanding,</i>

466

<i>You're a really cool girl,</i>

470
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,490
<i> Scott, do you ever want</i>

471
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,030
<i>Sure, I do.</i>

475

476
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,430
<i>to get married in the snow.</i>

477
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,690
<i>Sounds like you're</i>
<i>a "White Wedding" kind of girl.</i>

478
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,320
<i>You're so funny.</i>

479
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,450

<i>if you ever want</i>
<i>to send me a present.</i>

485
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,030
<i>The castle takes deliveries?</i>

486
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,030
<i>L.O.L.</i>

487
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:04,410
<i>Or in case you want</i>
<i>to come take me away.</i>

488
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,750
<i>Are you Princess Fiona?</i>

489
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,970
- <i>I am.</i>
<i>Awaiting a knight so bold</i>

490
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,760
<i>as to rescue me.</i>

491
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,850
<i>Aw, that's nice.</i>
<i>Now, let's go!</i>

492
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:17,690
<i>Wait, Sir Knight,</i>
<i>this be-eth our first meeting.</i>

493
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,780
<i>Should it not be a wonderful,</i>
<i>romantic moment?</i>

494
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,450
<i>Yeah, sorry, lady.</i>

495
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,960
- Hi!

496
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,590
Hi!

497
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:32,090
Shh, my mom is sleeping
and she works really hard.

498
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,260
- Oh, okay.

499
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,980
Uh, are you Gypsy?
- Mm-hmm.

500
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,440
- Well, then this is for you.

501
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,530
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

502
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,620
Like Jean Grey.

503
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,870
<i>You know, Dee Dee,</i>
<i>I was thinking:</i>

504
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,750
We been talking a lot,
you know, and, um...

505
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,180
I was wondering if...

506
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,760
you'd be open to a visit?

507
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,440
- What do you mean?

508
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,360
- Well, I'd like to, uh--

509
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,030
I'd like to do some man work.

510
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,280
- Oh.

511
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,120
- It's best when you do it
for a good woman

512
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,870
who appreciates it and--

513
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:50,040
and it makes you feel
like a superhero.

514
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,130
I just haven't had a chance
to do any

515
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,890
since the divorce.

516
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,810
- Oh, I'm sorry.

517
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:01,020
<i>You haven't told me much</i>
<i>about her.</i>

518
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,400
<i>We just, uh,</i>
<i>married really young</i>

519
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,070
and she wasn't really built
for the long haul.

520
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,080
And she just-- she wanted more
out of life

521
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,790
than-- than me, you know?

522
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,300
And then when my son--
well, you know...

523
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,260
<i>I'm a simple guy.</i>

524
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,350
And simple things
make me happy.

525
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,440
And I just thought
to myself...

526
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,950
"Well, Dee Dee
doesn't have a man.

527
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,080
Maybe she could use one."

528
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,500
I could change the oil,
just do some yard work.

529
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,890
You know, some handyman stuff
around the house.

530
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,520
Just, um, you know,
take out the garbage.

531
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,270
- I wouldn't put you out.
We get along just fine.

532
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,400
- You don't
mind me saying, I--

533
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,240
I think you could use
some enjoyment for yourself.

534
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,540
You know?

535
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,920
I mean, geez,
you do everything for everyone.

536
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,000
Uh, so says everyone.

537
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,920
You know, I could-- I could
help you with your daughter.

538
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,010
- No.

539
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,480
Thank you, Russ.

540
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,400
Good-bye.

541
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,940
What are you...

542
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,730
- Giggling about?

543
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,030
- Hi, Lacey.
- Hi.

544
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,870
Man, I need something
to laugh at.

545
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,170
I called my mom
a "B-I-T-C-H"

546
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,510
'cause she says I have to go
to community college now

547
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,100
instead of real college.

548
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,730
I didn't get enough
of a scholarship.

549
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,150
So that's why I called her
a bitch, and--

550
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,320
and now she's making me
wash the windows

551
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,490
to learn something
about something.

552
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,830
I don't know.

553
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,880
Anyway, what's so funny?

554
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,550
Um...

555
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,520
Okay, I'm gonna tell you,
but really need

556
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,060
to keep your voice down, okay?

557
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,690
'Cause it's a secret.

558
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,700
- Okay. Shoot.

559
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,090
- I met my Prince Charming.

560
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,720
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

561
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,300
- How?

562
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,020
- I guess you could say
he swept me off my feet.

563
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,780
- Well...

564
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,740
I guess that's
what princes do, huh?

565
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,160
- Mm-hmm.
- They just

566
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,080
sweep you off your feet.

567
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,920
How'd you meet
this mystery man?

568
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,760
- Well...

569
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,050
uh, it was pretty magical,
actually.

570
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,060
I saw him and I just--I knew.

571
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,270
He's--he's manly,
and he's heroic,

572
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,400
but he's also really,
really nice.

573
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,160
And we're gonna have two kids--

574
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,830
once we're married,
of course.

575
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:18,960
But he's gonna take me
far away from here

576
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,250
to someplace
really special, you know?

577
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,630
Like--like Arkansas, maybe.

578
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,430
Oh, my gosh, and we're gonna
have a winter wedding

579
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,270
so that we can be in the snow
and I'll be like a snow gypsy.

580
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:30,570
- Wow, that sounds amazing.
- Lacey, you have to come.

581
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,980
You have to come
to the wedding.

582
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,450
Will you--will you be
my maid of honor?

583
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,780
You can wear red.

584
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,830
'Cause there's gonna be
red roses everywhere,

585
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,370
so you can match them.

586
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,760
- I wish my Grandma Emma
was still alive

587
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,770
so that she could come, too.

588
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,390
Oh, by the way,

589
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,690
that's my private
Facebook name, okay?

590
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,360
Emma Rose.

591
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,070
Okay.
- So happy.

592
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,120
Okay, yeah.

593
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,250
You know what?

594
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,870
If he has a brother,

595
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,710
you tell him
to come sweep me away.

596
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,720
He can find me
at the community college.

597
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,270
Okay, I'll tell him.

598
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,390
You...

599
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,610
it's a secret, right?

600
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,230
So you can't tell anyone.
You promise?

601
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,490
- No, no, I promise.

602
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,910
I won't tell a soul.

603
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,790
- We have a secret.

604
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,990
Scott.

605
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,620
Oh, no, what happened?

606
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,370
Are you okay?

607
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,500
Oh...

608
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,420
It's me, Gypsy.

609
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,720
- Gypsy?

610
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,480
- Yeah.

611
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,020
Yeah, it's me.

612
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,400
- But you're walking.

613
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,160
Shh, I can actually walk,
okay? Don't tell anyone.

614
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,340
- I just--I didn't know
you were coming.

615
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,590
- Of course I came.

616
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,350
I knew that you needed me.

617
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,770
- You look
completely different.

618
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,780
You look...

619
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,040
- I'm just--
I'm a little surprised is all.

620
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,210
My poor baby.
Gosh.

621
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,840
Have they given you anything
for your pain?

622
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,340
Anything?

623
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,720
Just a local.

624
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,730
They reset my nose.

625
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,020
- You need Vicodin
or--or maybe a Xanax.

626
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,360
Or what about a Percocet
or an Ativan?

627
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,400
I can ask for you.

628
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,280
- They--they said they wouldn't

629
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,450
because I've been drinking.

630
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,880
- Oh, silly, you don't need
to tell them the whole truth

631
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,590
when you're in pain.

632
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,350
Um...

633
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,180
well, it's too late now.

634
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,360
Yeah.

635
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,360
- I can't get over this.

636
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,990
I don't understand.

637
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,910
- You poor thing.
No one should suffer.

638
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,250
No one.

639
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,340
But don't you worry
about anything now, okay?

640
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,130
I'm gonna take care of you.

641
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,220
I'm gonna take
real good care of you.

642
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,020
- You look good with red hair.

643
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,940
- You like it?

644
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,260
Gypsy?

645
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,730
Gypsy?

646
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,150
Gypsy?

647
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,280
Oh...

648
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,500
<i>Dear Mother,</i>
<i>I'm in love</i>

649
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,050
<i>and running away to get married</i>
<i>and have kids,</i>

650
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,180
<i>and there's nothing</i>
<i>you can do to stop me.</i>

651
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,640
<i>Love, Gypsy,</i>
<i>your</i> 19<i>-year-old daughter.</i>

652
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:55,210
Oh, hello?
Shelley?

653
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:00,010
Shelley, you remember that man
we met at the convention?

654
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,230
He was dressed as Wolverine?

655
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:06,320
No, not that Wolverine,
the other Wolverine.

656
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,950
Do you know his name?

657
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,410
Think Shelley, I need it.

658
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,230
- What a beautiful place
you have.

659
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,280
- Really?

660
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,510
- I was just saying
it made me feel...

661
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,800
um, grown up.

662
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,190
- You're so tiny.

663
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,360
Not much taller than

664
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,540
when you're in the chair.

665
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,550
I'm never sitting
in that again.

666
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,590
Now that my Prince Charming

667
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,970
has saved me.

668
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,860
- What the fuck, man?

669
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,410
- It's just me, man.

670
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,300
- Dance with me.

671
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,430
- Hey, no--

672
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,060
We just woke him up and--

673
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,520
- Oh, we don't need music.

674
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,770
Come on.

675
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,650
I had a rough night.

676
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,070
I kinda just want
to sit here.

677
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,580
Oh, of course.

678
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,790
Um, let me help you.

679
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,210
Is the kitchen this way?

680
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,920
- Yeah, but I--I'm all right.

681
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,380
That's...

682
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,640
- I can't wait to hear
all about it.

683
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,650
Um...

684
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:58,040
Here, put this on your nose.

685
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,880
Thanks.

686
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,890
- Anything you need.

687
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:06,270
So tell me what happened.

688
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,980
It was just this drunk guy
at the bar.

689
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,610
He wouldn't leave
the bartender alone.

690
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,120
She's a friend of mine.

691
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,410
So I tried to talk to him,
get him to lay off...

692
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,750
But, like, nicely,
'cause I don't...

693
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,760
- Mm-hmm.

694
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,300
- I don't believe in violence.

695
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,390
But apparently he has
no problem with it,

696
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,640
'cause he got in
a couple good ones

697
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,110
before the bouncer
could get to me.

698
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,360
- Oh, my poor baby.

699
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,530
Yeah.

700
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,000
You are so brave.

701
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,890
Just what was right.

702
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,480
- My hero.

703
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,200
Wouldn't it be romantic if--

704
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,330
if after all this time

705
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:01,210
Wolverine and Jean Grey
could be together?

706
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:06,350
And she could finally be free
from that evil Cyclops?

707
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,940
- You know she kills him
in "Last Stand"?

708
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,270
Is Gypsy here?

709
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,900
Mom?

710
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,360
- Oh, Honey Bee.

711
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,410
Oh, I found your note.

712
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,410
- Okay.

713
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,040
- Listen to me, baby--
- Um, no.

714
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,930
I'm not a baby.
- No, I know.

715
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,510
I know.

716
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:33,100
I just always will see you
as my little girl.

717
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,980
But you're all grown up.

718
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,820
Oh, I can see that.

719
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,780
- I am, I am.

720
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,620
I know
you're punishing me,

721
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,540
and maybe I deserve it.

722
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,970
And I'm so sorry, baby.

723
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:52,310
I would do anything for you.

724
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:54,600
I would love you more

725
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,150
than anything
in the whole world.

726
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,820
I would give up anything
for you.

727
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,780
I have given up
everything for you.

728
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,410
I know.

729
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:06,710
Well, then come on.

730
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,880
Come on, let's go home.

731
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,180
- Listen, Mom...

732
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,890
I wanna stay with Scott.

733
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,940
Oh, I know you do, I know.

734
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,190
Oh, believe me, I know.

735
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:21,490
That's why-- come on, hon.

736
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:23,450
That's why I need you
to go home with me.

737
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:26,920
I--I'm not gonna make you
stop seeing your friend.

738
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,130
I promise you.

739
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:31,510
But this is not how you do it.

740
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:32,970
Sneaking off.

741
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:35,520
I had a anxiety attack.

742
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,400
I was terrified.

743
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,940
Let's just...

744
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,910
Let's just do this
the right way.

745
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,410
He can come over to the house.

746
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:47,330
We can both get to know him.

747
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:48,590
Come on.

748
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:50,670
Let's just go, Gypsy Rose.

749
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:53,850
Uh, just slow it down
and enjoy it.

750
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,350
Okay?

751
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,530
Come on, please.

752
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,950
Gypsy Rose...

753
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,080
Do you want me...

754
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,920
to cause a scene here?

755
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,170
Do you?

756
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,600
- No.

757
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,280
Will you excuse me?

758
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,790
I'll talk to you soon.

759
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,090
I don't know what she told you,

760
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,560
but she's 14 years old.

760
00:47:37,305 --> 00:48:37,728

We haven't decided if you passed

Ever since you were a little girl,

42

you've excelled
at the physical side of bending,

43
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,340
but completely ignored the spiritual side.

44
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,076
The Avatar must master both.

I haven't ignored it,
it just doesn't come as easy to me.

But that's why I should start training
with Tenzin immediately.

He's Mr. Spiritual.

Do you believe she's ready,
Master Katara?

49
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:44,067
Yes, if anyone can teach her what she
needs to learn, it's Tenzin.

00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,534
Very well, Korra.

all about your old adventures,

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,475
I've been dying to ask you.

81
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,306
What happened to Zuko's mom?

82
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,141
Well, Jinora, it's an incredible tale...

83
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,877
Gran-Gran, you look old.
How old are you?

84
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,679
And why is it so cold in the South Pole?

85
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,617
Can we make a campfire
and all huddle around it,

86
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,314
and tell scary stories
and make snowmen?

87
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,323
And then can you make the snowmen
move with waterbending and chase us?

88
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,817
Wouldn't that be fun? Huh? Wouldn't it?

89
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,491
Pema, let me help you.
Careful, now. Careful.

90
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,501
Stop doting on me.
I'm not helpless' I'm just pregnant.

91
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,666
The baby's strong.

92
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,710
I see another Airbender in your future.

93
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,802
All I want is one child like me.

94
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:13,318
A nice non-bender, who doesn't blast
wind in my face every five seconds.

95
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,354
Mommy, look! I'm a Snowbender!

96
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:22,725
Were Tenzin and his siblings this crazy
when they were kids?

97
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,589
Kya and Bumi certainly were,

98
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:28,359
but Tenzin has always
been rather serious.

99
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,367
Mother, please.

100
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,361

101
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,903
Look at you. So big and strong.

102
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,841
You've grown into quite
the young Avatar.

Yes, well... (SIGHS)

105
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,581
You're going to have to tell her
sooner or later.

106
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:50,882
Wait, tell me what?

107
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,380
You're not staying, are you?

108
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,685
I'm afraid not.
We're only visiting for the night.

109
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,459
Then I have to return to Republic City.

110
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:05,525
But, no' you're supposed to move here.
You're supposed to teach me.

TENZIN: I'm sorry, Korra.

112
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:10,375
Your airbending training
is going to have to wait.

113
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:18,074
KORRA: So how long until you're
ready to teach me airbending?

114
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,549
A week? A month?

115
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,719
It could be much longer.

116
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,277
I don't understand.

117
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,411
Why are you making me wait?

118
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,421
I have a responsibility to Republic City.
I'm one of its leaders.

And the situation there
is very unstable right now.

120
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:34,956
But you also have a responsibility
to teach me.

121
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,229
Believe me, I'd be happy
to find another airbending master,

122
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,634
but you're the only one.

Wait, there is!

126
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:45,808
If you can't stay here,

127
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,402
then I'll go back to Republic City
with you.

locked up in this compound

00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,234
and cover all the damages.

320
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,172
(SIGHS) Fine. Get her out of my city.

321
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:02,169
Always <i>a</i> pleasure, Lin. Let's go, Korra.

322
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,176
Hmm.

323
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:12,978
KORRA: Tenzin, please.

324
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,422
Don't send me back home.

325
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:18,393
You blatantly disobeyed my wishes,
and the Orders of the White Lotus.

326
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:20,589
Katara agreed with me
that I should come.

327
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,196
She said my destiny is in Republic City.

328
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,233
Don't bring my mother into this!

329
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,429
Look, I can't wait any longer
to finish my training.

330
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,336
Being cooped up and hidden away
from the world

331
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,036
isn't helping me become a better Avatar.

332
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:37,548
I saw a lot of the city today
and ifs totally out of whack.

333
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,549
I understand now why you need to stay.

334
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,881
Republic City does need you.

335
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,352
But it needs me, too!

336
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,284
(STRUGGLING FOR WORDS)

337
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,225
Is this your polar bear-dog, miss?

(SIGHS)

340
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,582
- Korra!
- Korra!

341
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:25,251
Are you coming to live with us
on the Island?

342
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,163
No, I'm sorry, lkki.

343
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:29,597
- I have to go home now.
- IKKI: Avvw!

344
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,805
TENZIN: Wait.

345
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,838
I have done my best
to guide Republic City

346
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:43,277
towards the dream my father had for it.

347
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:46,944
But you are right, it has fallen
out of balance since he passed.

348
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:50,579
I thought I should put off your training
in order to uphold his legacy.

349
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,183
But you are his legacy.

350
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,687
You may stay and train
airbending here with me.

351
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,285
Republic City needs its Avatar
once again.

352
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,355
Yes! Thank you! You're the best!

353
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,296
KIDS: Yay!

354
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,793

<i>(CLEARS THROAT)
Hello? I'm Korra, your new Avatar.</i>

358
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,713
Does this mean you've moved
to Republic City'?

359
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,315
Were you trying to send a message
to the Triads yesterday?

360
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:32,990
Will you be fighting crime or
the anti-bending revolution? Or both?

361
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,498
Will you be working with Chief Beifong
and the police?

362
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:39,564
<i>Uh... Yes, I am definitely here to stay,
but, honestly...</i>

363
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,704
<i>I don't exactly have a plan yet.</i>

364
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:45,071
<i>See, I'm still in training, but...</i>

365
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:49,078
<i>Look, all I know is Avatar Aang
meant for this city</i>

366
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:52,741
<i>to be the center of peace
and balance in the world.</i>

367
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:57,344
<i>And I believe we can make
his dream a reality.</i>

00:22:57,343 --> 00:23:00,256
<i>I look forward to serving you</i>

(OVER RADIO) <i>Fm so happy to be</i> here
<i>Thank you, Republic City.</i>

MAN: <i>AH right, that's
ab' the questions the..</i>

371
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:09,762
Amon' how do you want to handle this?

372
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:12,998
AMON: So the Avatar has arrived early.

373
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,363
It looks like we will have to accelerate
our plans.

1
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,304
Oh! What the hell was that?

3
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:27,153
Mum?

4
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:33,909
Mum!

5
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,079
Mum!

6
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,878
- I think the tumble dryer
might be on the mend.

7
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:44,962
- What?

8
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,121
Hello?

9
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,021
Is there anybody here?

10
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,656
Wait.

11
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,908
Balls.

12
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:44,206
One. One. One.

13
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,375
One.

14
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,586
Alt.

15
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:53,674
One. One. One. One.

16
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,180
- All right, let's have a look
at what we have.

17
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,932
One. One.

18
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:04,852
- Huh.

19
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,817
Let's see if this does
the trick.

20
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,198
Ah, yes.

21
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,035
Tormilade.

22
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,248
Wonderful.

23
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,556
Hm.

24
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,548
Hey, did you steal
one of my digestives?

25
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,133
- No.

26
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,927
- You did,
I can see you chewing.

27
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,971
You don't have to
creep around here, Dad,

28
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,514
just nicking things, it's daft.

29
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,099
- Hm. I like it.

30
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,686
Makes me feel like Raffles,
the gentleman thief.

31
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:35,067
- Hey! When are you gonna fix
the upstairs/downstairs?

32
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,361
- I'll look at it when I
come back from work, all right?

33
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,196
But please,
if you're gonna use it,

34
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,616
put on some underpants
'cause it's really unhygienic.

35
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,203
- Oh, stop trying to control me.

36
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,915
- Hey. Hey!

37
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:57,006
Oh, damn you!

38
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,992
Hello, Dave.

39
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,535
- Morning, Gus.
- Are you here yet?

40
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,370
- Yeah.
- Just pulling in now.

41
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:29,580
Bang on time
as always.

42
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,623
Would you mind
popping into my office?

43
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,043
I have a surprise for you that
I think you're going to like.

44
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,841
- No.
- Gus, I need to train up

45
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,760
more people like you,

46
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,803
and who better to train up
more Gus Robertses

47
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,180
than Gus Roberts himself?

48
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,265
I work better alone.

49
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,642
- Well, you worked
very well with Paul.

50
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,356
How did you like that copy
of "The White Sheet?"

51
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,150
Some pretty good articles
in that one.

52
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,361
It's only 200 printed.
It's very rare.

53
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:04,948
- Listen, Dave, um,
babysittin' some greenhorn

54
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,034
who doesn't know his
RG142 coaxial cable

55
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,119
from an eight inch heliax.

56
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,163
No. The last thing
I need is

57
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,415
some clueless millennial
mouth breather

58
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:16,460
cluttering up my van.

59
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,630
- Elton, I really should have
asked you to wait outside.

60
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,720
- Elton.
- Huh?

61
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,931
- If you would.

62
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,307
His wig's
a bit obvious, isn't it?

63
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,433
- Who's wig?

64
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,939
- What's a greenhorn?

65
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,441
- Somebody who doesn't know
their RG142 coaxial

66
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,235
from an eight inch heliax.

67
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,445
- Oh. Like a noob.

68
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,489
- What is a noob?

69
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,241
- It's like a greenhorn.

70
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,328
All right, noob,

71
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,288
we've got five installs
before lunch.

72
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,415
Better get a wriggle on.
Watch and learn, kid.

73
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,167
Watch and learn.

74
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,962
Sorry about
your old partner.

75
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,297
- Yeah, well, he's dead to me.

76
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,425
- Don't touch my shit.
- Oh, sorry.

77
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,177
Wouldn't he be dead to everyone?

78
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,887
- No, he's very much alive.

79
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,849
- He went and joined ISIS.
- What?

80
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,851
- Infrared Specialist
Internet Systems.

81
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,770
- Oh. I thought you meant
"ISIS" ISIS.

82
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:20,774
- Ipswich Server Interwoven Sciences
and Instant Supply Information Solutions.

83
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,777
Why would Paul join
those clowns?

84
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,571
- I think we got
our wires crossed.

85
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,949
- Yep. That is what happens
when you put an RG142 cable

86
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,701
into an AVA five port.

87
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,371
- You can take
that smile off your face.

88
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,832
- Sorry.
- Kind of mistake could kill a man.

89
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,051
- All right?
- Yep.

90
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,013
One. One.

91
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,977
- So...
is there a Mrs. Roberts?

92
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,648
- Shush.
- One. One. One.

93
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:07,196
What's this, then,
radio one?

94
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,947
- It's a number station.

95
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:13,118
- Cool.
What's a number station?

96
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,329
- They're these secret
long wave transmissions

97
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,915
that are just repeating
over and over and over again.

98
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,917
Since the second world war.

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,711
No one knows who sends them,
no one knows what they're for.

100
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,214
This particular one is called
the Lancashire Poacher.

101
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,841
- Yeah, a bit creepy.
Should we listen to five?

102
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,344
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Five.

103
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,847
One. Five.

104
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:39,311
- Oh.
- One. One. One.

105
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,854
Five.

106
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:46,068
- What have you done?
- I haven't done anything.

107
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,070
I swear, I didn't do anything,
I swear.

108
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,529
- Ah...
- Five.

109
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,658
- F... Okay, we, um...
- One.

110
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,910
- We need to go.
I need to...

111
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,495
We need to go.

112
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,795
One. One. One. Five.

113
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,672
- Thanks.

114
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,423
- That station has never
broadcast anything

115
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:09,925
except the number one.

116
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,261
- And now five.
- Five, yes, yes.

117
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,096
It must mean something.

118
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,143
Ah. It's Dave.

119
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,521
He's got a new install.
Let's go.

120
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,441
Shukraan, Muhammed.

121
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,567
Let's go.

122
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,368
- What?
- Where are we going?

123
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,336
- Miss Connelly?
My name is Gus Roberts.

124
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,297
This is my colleague Elton...

125
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,132
- Uh, John.

126
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,883
- Um, we're with Smyle.

127
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,343
I understand you have a problem
with your connection.

128
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,763
- Oh, I didn't expect you
so soon.

129
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,390
Oh, this is a nice surprise.

130
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,726
- Maybe that's why
we're called Smyle.

131
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,603
- Come in, boys.
- Thank you.

132
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,398
Oh, wow.

133
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,191
Look at this place.

134
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,444
- Hah!
- Uh, was this house

135
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,362
named after you, Miss Connelly?

136
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,531
- It was built by my grandfather

137
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,950
who passed it to my father
who left it to me

138
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,744
when he passed.

139
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,538
- Oh.
- It was his practice when I was a little girl.

140
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,333
- Oh, he was a doctor.
- A vet.

141
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,419
Nice. I was a receptionist
in a vet's office once.

142
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,754
Whole place
smelled like cats' piss.

143
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,214
- Oh...
- Was it the TV signal

144
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,507
that was the problem,
Miss Connelly?

145
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,093
- Um... it just
stopped working.

146
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:38,055
- Ah. Leave it with us.

147
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,723
- Would you like a cup of tea?

148
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,017
Yeah, a cup of tea
would be lovely. Thank you.

149
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,187
- I'll bring you
some biscuits, just in case.

150
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,688
- Oh, wicked.
Thanks, Miss Connelly.

151
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,315
Pleasure.

152
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,734
- Oh, she's nice.
Are they all this friendly?

153
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,778
- She's lonely.

154
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,738
See it all the time in my game.

155
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,656
Starved of company,
next thing you know,

156
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,743
she's round the back of a TV
with a pair of scissors.

157
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:00,827
Hey.

158
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,625
Loneliness can make people do
desperate things, my friend.

159
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,835
- Here we go.
- Jesus Christ.

160
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,799
Did you find the problem?

161
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,467
- Yeah. We have.

162
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,803
- How'd you think that happened?

163
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,596
- Never mind.

164
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,764
I'll go and fetch you
a replacement.

165
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,516
- Okay.

166
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:27,020
Well, maybe it was mice.

167
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,439
- Yeah, uh...
maybe you should get a cat?

168
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,901
- Oh, cats are bastards.

169
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,277
- Oh.

170
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,822
- I like dogs.

171
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,156
I used to have one.

172
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,827
His name was Pepper,
but he ran away.

173
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,205
- Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
- I put up some posters,

174
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,958
but so far, nobody's called.

175
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,543
- Uh, when did he run away?

176
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,795
- 1965.

177
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,672
- Uh, of course.

178
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,633
- Oh, that's, uh,
a picture of Pepper

179
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,468
with Father and I.

180
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,518
- What was that?
- Oh...

181
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,854
- Righty-ho.

182
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,607
Let me just place this cable,

183
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,944
and... we shall be...

184
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,113
on our way.

185
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,490
- Oh.
- There we go.

186
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,700
- Thank you.

187
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,419
- All right, here we are,
greenhorn.

188
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,546
- Yep.

189
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,132
Hey, I feel a bit sorry
for Miss Connelly.

190
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,676
All alone in that big,
scary house.

191
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,178
- What do you mean, scary?

192
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,724
- I don't know, haunted.

193
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,726
- Haunted. Huh.

194
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,561
You ever had a
paranormal experience?

195
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,314
- What? No.

196
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,149
Have you?

197
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,984
- Do me a favor.
Get your phone out.

198
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,489
Open the Youtube app.

199
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,199
- Yeah.
- The channel you're looking for is

200
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,950
the Truth Seeker.

201
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,994
And then cycle through
until you see

202
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,996
"Chills at Cordry Rectory."

203
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,707
- Uh, that one.
- Oh.

204
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,000
Okay.

205
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,838
Cordry Rectory.

206
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:20,008
Arguably, the second most
haunted rectory in Britain,

207
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,718
behind my beloved
boarding room, of course.

208
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,386
- Uh, cycle on a bit.

209
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,805
- Many, many years ago...
- Yep.

210
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,308
...eight
children were found dead...

211
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,976
- Bit more.
There's two of them.

212
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,770
- Yep.

213
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,730
- Bingo. From there.

214
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,733
- ...my paranormal hearings
and what not.

215
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,070
I sat and I watched it
slam closed...

216
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,281
over a period of nine hours.

217
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,866
- Not really slammin', is it?

218
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,077
- Are you trying to suggest
this wasn't a paranormal event?

219
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,289
- No. Just a really slow one.
- Ah...

220
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:54,626
But it's this
door that interested me most.

221
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,586
- Oh, my sister's got
a Youtube channel.

222
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,005
- Yeah?
- Yeah, she does, like, make-up tutorials.

223
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,382
She's got a few thousand
subscribers.

224
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,009
- Good. Bye.

225
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,886
- Oh. Okay.

226
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,059
- Just close the door.

227
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,604
- Sorry.

228
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,481
Okay, so, bye.

229
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,317
See you tomorrow.
Okay.

230
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,637
Uhh!

231
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,264
- Hello, Elie.

232
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,185
- Helen, don't do that.

233
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,395
- It's all going wrong.

234
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,147
- How'd you even get it on?

235
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,358
- I can't seem to fix
the panels onto the scooter.

236
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,569
CovCo CosCon is next week.

237
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,697
You have no idea how tired
this all makes me.

238
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,324
I was so exhausted by
lunch time,

239
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,451
I had to lay down and watch
"The Hobbit" trilogy.

240
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,870
- Did you finish it this time?
- Of course, I didn't.

241
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:15,123
Didn't even make it past
the mines of Moria.

242
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,463
- So, don't you want to know
how my day went?

243
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,132
- Oh, my God. It's always
about you, isn't it?

244
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,885
Okay, don't tell me.
You quit already.

245
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:30,388
- Ah, actually, I didn't.
I made a new friend.

246
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,015
And he's got a Youtube channel.

247
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,184
- Oh, what...
What does he call himself?

248
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,144
What's he c...
What does he call himself?

249
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:39,814
- Good night.
- Elton, what's he call himself?

250
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,447
- Well...

251
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:52,285
One. One. One. Five.

252
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,210
What is the meaning of this?

253
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,711
- Just want to see you
in those pants.

254
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,047
Okay? Hello.

255
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,882
- Uh, Gus, it's Dave.

256
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,425
I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

257
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,220
- No, no, no, just...
I'm talking to my dad.

258
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,681
What can I do you for?

259
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,140
- Um, sorry, I just...

260
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,809
I need you to do me
a favor tomorrow.

261
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,937
Um, it's Miss Connelly again.

262
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,824
- I expect you didn't think
you'd see me again so soon.

263
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,784
- Right, and you're saying
you still got a problem with

264
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,285
the TV signal, Miss Connelly.

265
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,537
- No, no, no, it's working,

266
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,623
but not the way
it's supposed to.

267
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:39,666
- Huh.

268
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,961
Here we go.

269
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,800
What the hell?
Do that again.

270
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,136
- What?
- Just step forward.

271
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,555
Look at that.

272
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,223
This looks like it's live.

273
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,600
- Where is that?
- I don't know.

274
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,314
- I heard that yesterday. I
told you this house was creepy.

275
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,817
- Are you sure you're the only
person here in the house?

276
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,360
- It's only ever been me.

277
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,279
Well, since Father died,
of course.

278
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,240
- Of course.
You don't mind if we have

279
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,075
a little look around
upstairs, do you?

280
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,619
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doin'?

281
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:17,662
- Don't look.
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

282
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,247
- Don't open that door.

283
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,790
- I didn't know. Sorry.
I was gettin' the stuff.

284
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,709
- Don't look.
- Okay.

285
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,127
- Take this.
- You said...

286
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,045
- Just now. Take it.
It's fine.

287
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,839
- Oh, wicked.

288
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,553
- Oh.
- Is that standard issue, then?

289
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,055
None of this
is standard issue.

290
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,515
Is it, girl?

291
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,933
- What is it?

292
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,394
- This is a electroplasmic
spectrometer.

293
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,855
Oh...

294
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,441
- Reveals the, uh, presence
of EM waves

295
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,359
emitted from the spectral plane.

296
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,780
Okay.

297
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:52,906
- Don't move.

298
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,787
Huh. It's a ghost detector.

299
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,954
Shut the door.

300
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:25,438
You must
think me so rude.

301
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,315
I haven't even offered you
a cup of tea,

302
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,193
- a roast or a bowl.
- I'll have a bowl.

303
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,736
- I think we're fine
for the time being.

304
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,029
Thank you, Mrs. Connelly.

305
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,747
What is this?

306
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,757
- Can we go back down now?
- No, no.

307
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,802
Let's wait and see if we can
hear the noise, okay?

308
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:56,928
Let's listen.

309
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,400
- Don't film me.

310
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,114
- I think it's
coming from in there.

311
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,324
- Well, that's
Father's old study,

312
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,285
where he used to do
all his work.

313
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,663
I never go in there.
I was never allowed.

314
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,040
- Do you mind if we have a look?

315
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,334
- Well, I... I suppose.

316
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,210
- Okay.

317
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,467
- Film this.

318
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,970
- Here we go. You ready?
- No.

319
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:44,183
- One...
- Ooh, a bit dizzy.

320
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,728
- Two... three.

321
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,657
- Gus, have you still got
those spare pants in the van?

322
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,284
- Yep.
- Thank you.

323
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,621
- That was Pepper's ball.
- Excuse me.

324
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:06,831
Um...

325
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,384
How about we have that
cup of tea now, Miss Connelly, huh?

326
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,387
- Oh, yes.
I'll pop the kettle on.

327
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:22,722
- You do that.

328
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,850
- Right, it was
the ball all along.

329
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,477
Should we just chip off, then?

330
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,938
- No, no. Balls just don't
bounce around on their own.

331
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,816
- Hang on, that's weird.

332
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,319
This room should be bigger
judging from the exterior.

333
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,904
- How on earth
would you know that?

334
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,281
- I worked for
an architect one summer.

335
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:41,783
- 'Course you did.

336
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,618
Hey, film me, I'm gonna do
a little PTC.

337
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:44,953
- Okay. Uh, what's PTC?

338
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,162
- A piece to camera.

339
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,706
- Okay. Okay, uh...

340
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,918
Tell me when you're rolling.

341
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,795
- Rolling.
- Okay.

342
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,924
Welcome, viewer,
to the Truth Seeker.

343
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,511
You join me here in a place
I've come to know as

344
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,221
Connelly's Nook

345
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:07,183
to solve the mystery
posed by this very ball.

346
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,936
- Just zoom in.

347
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,521
Zoomed.

348
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,647
- Join me.

349
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,654
- D... Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

350
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,702
Right. Great shot. Should
we head to the edit suite?

351
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,954
- No, no. Film this.

352
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,211
- Watch.

353
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,216
- Shawshank.

354
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,219
- What did you say?

355
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,680
- Shawshank.
- Oh. Can I use that?

356
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,098
- It's really good.
- Yeah.

357
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,767
- It's a big hole.
- Sure. Yeah, sure, yeah.

358
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:51,185
Here we go.

359
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:54,439
Now. Here we go.

360
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,399
Shawshank.

361
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,568
- That was it.

362
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,653
- It's attached here.
- Careful.

363
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:01,779
- Ahh.

364
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,409
Whaddaya know?

365
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,254
Wow. You were right.

366
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,548
- A tiny door.
- Yeah, that we shouldn't go in.

367
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,467
- Don't be such a noob.
Come on, let's go.

368
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,852
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

369
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:41,569
This looks like
what was on the TV downstairs.

370
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,238
- Is that Pepper?
- It's a badger, you pranny.

371
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,032
If this guy is just a vet,

372
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:49,911
then I am just a broadband
installation engineer.

373
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,204
- What'd you mean?
What else are you?

374
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,084
You... Just...

375
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,796
Look at this.

376
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,507
- Gus, I don't like this.

377
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,218
- What have we got here?

378
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,762
Hey. Pepper.

379
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,475
- Are you sh...

380
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,893
Are you sure we should be
playing that?

381
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,061
Haven't you seen "The Ring"?

382
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,354
- Ring?

383
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:26,489
Friday,
the 17th of December, 1965.

384
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,867
I'm closer than I've ever been
to discovering the secrets

385
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,453
of soul separation and transfer.

386
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:35,456
Tea's up.

387
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,125
- What's this room?

388
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,710
Alas,
I've run out of test subjects.

389
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,587
- That's Father's voice.

390
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:45,842
- Quiet, Pepper.
- Go and play.

391
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,970
Hm...

392
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,139
Pepper.

393
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,431
Come.

394
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:58,729
- Good boy.
- There's a good boy.

395
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:01,440
Is he still alive?

396
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:03,317
Now, don't struggle.

397
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:07,280
Your sacrifice
shan't be for naught.

398
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,074
- Oh...
- Now, where's my ax?

399
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:13,953
- My beautiful Pepper.

400
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:16,789
Papa,
is Pepper there with you?

401
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,541
No, Jennifer,
he's not in here.

402
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,086
He must be, uh, somewhere else.

403
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,381
Somewhere else.

404
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,348
Miss Connelly?

405
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,516
Miss Connelly,
are you still with us?

406
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,979
- El, cut there.
- Huh?

407
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,772
- Cut it.

408
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,024
- Oh.

409
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,321
Thank you again.

410
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,406
No, thank you,
Miss Connelly.

411
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,868
If you got a problem with your
smart connection or anything else,

412
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,661
give us a ring, yeah?
Bye-bye.

413
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,373
- So where do you think
Pepper went?

414
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:00,833
- I guess he just moved on.

415
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:02,710
- Moved where?
Where does your soul go to?

416
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,921
- Well, that's one of the
ultimate questions, isn't it?

417
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,756
- So you don't know.
- No.

418
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,925
Pepper. Come.

419
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,267
Good boy.

420
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,027
- You know what?
- I think Dave made

421
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,821
a very wise choice
putting us together.

422
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,698
You, sir, are gonna be
my new lucky charm.

423
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,496
- I'm leaving Smyle.

424
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,790
- What?
- I'm not cut out for this, Gus.

425
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:44,377
- What? Look, I understand you
might be feeling a bit discombobulated.

426
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,171
Believe me, I feel a bit
discombobulated, too,

427
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,131
but I think you should stay.

428
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,260
I just don't like the idea of going
around a load of spooky houses.

429
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,387
- It's not all like this.

430
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,806
Five. Nine. Seven.

431
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:01,018
- One. Five. Nine. Seven.
- What?

432
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,812
- Look out!

433
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,612
- What was that?
- One. Five.

434
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:14,323
- Did we hit anything?
- Nine. Seven.

435
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,244
- Anything?
- No.

436
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,956
Must have been
a trick of the light.

437
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,959
- What, that we both saw at the
same time the number station changed?

438
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,502
- Nine.
- No way.

439
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,628
Seven.

440
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,048
- This means something.

441
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,678
- Should we go?
- Yeah.

442
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,492
- I told you I wasn't
cut out for this.

443
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,119
- I've never felt more alive.

444
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,874
Well, don't get used to it.

445
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,543
Life on the road with Smyle
is usually a lot more mundane.

446
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,296
- Good. Can we just
put it behind us?

447
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,922
I've had enough scares
for one lifetime.

448
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,550
- Come on, you big blouse.
I'll drop you home.

449
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,345
- Put your foot down.
- When you drive, which will be never,

450
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:20,222
you can choose the speed.

450
00:27:21,305 --> 00:28:21,309

BELL CHIMES

3
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,642
I thought this day would never come.

4
00:01:54,692 --> 00:01:56,722
Expectations are high.

5
00:01:56,772 --> 00:01:58,682
Pray God we don't disappoint them.

6
00:01:58,732 --> 00:02:00,252
Aye.

7
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:31,852
A pleasant change -
to see a mine opening!

8
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:35,172
For how long, I wonder?

9
00:02:43,012 --> 00:02:49,362
My friends, when my father
closed this mine 20 years ago,

10
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:52,842
he little thought it
would have a future.

11
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:58,482
Today, with your help,
labour and good wishes,

12
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:01,042
we aim to prove him wrong.

13
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:06,002
Gentlemen, ladies, I declare
the Wheal Leisure Mine open.

14
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:09,812
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

15
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:19,682
'Tis a grand thing 'ee done, Ross.

16
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,162
Thank you, Ross!

17
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:23,602
~ Zacky. Mark.
~ Can't thank 'ee enough.

18
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:27,842
Then don't. If all goes well,
it's I who'll be thanking you.

19
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:29,232
Sir...

20
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:36,432
Thank you.

21
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:39,602
I'm that glad, sir!

22
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,682
For the miners an' their
families - an' for 'ee, sir!

23
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:45,042
My neck's on the line.
Are you glad about that?

24
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:48,332
Oh, no, sir! What shall
I do if it come to grief?

25
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:55,482
Are the rumours true, do you think?

26
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:58,272
He's a damned fool if they're not!

27
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,082
I take it you've forgiven him?

28
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:05,042
He saved your life.

29
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:07,882
Time for you to demonstrate
it wasn't wasted.

30
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:09,722
I've no mine to resurrect.

31
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:11,442
You have one to keep alive!

32
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:15,602
Start by stemming the leakage
of workers from our mine to his!

33
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:17,362
That is easier said than done.

34
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:19,882
Our wages are hardly
an incentive to stay.

35
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:22,132
HE SCOFFS

36
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:36,692
SHE WINCES

37
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:53,282
We will have iron ladders
down the main shaft.

38
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:55,642
~ Iron?
~ Wood rots.

39
00:04:55,692 --> 00:04:57,282
It'll cost you.

40
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:59,802
Better me than a man's life.

41
00:05:03,492 --> 00:05:06,402
Two shafts have been sunk,
but it's hard going.

42
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:08,682
We struck ironstone almost at once.

43
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:11,362
~ We may yet require gunpowder.
~ More expense?

44
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:14,082
Aye, but don't be discouraged.

45
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:17,632
Where there's ironstone,
there's often copper.

46
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:27,532
There. You mark that?

47
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:32,932
Chase that and we'll
hope to catch copper.

48
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:02,132
MAN AND WOMAN ARGUE

49
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:07,482
Judas! I can hear 'ee kickin'
up a dido three mile away!

50
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:09,962
~ 'Tis this great buffle 'ead!
~ Hush yer creenin', woman!

51
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:12,522
You'd think cheese
wouldn't choke 'ee!

52
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,402
Be she who started it!

53
00:06:14,452 --> 00:06:16,042
Mr Ross's rum again?

54
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:19,522
He won't miss it! His 'ead
be fair full 'o the mine.

55
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:21,562
He's gone an' breaked me arm!

56
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:23,532
Let's see.

57
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,962
SHE WINCES

58
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,602
'Tis only a sprain -

59
00:06:28,652 --> 00:06:31,722
but 'ee'll not be fit to cook
vittles this three week.

60
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:34,642
'Ee mun' step into th' breach, then!

61
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:37,642
It's all right, child -
Prudie'll instruct 'ee.

62
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:40,562
Talk o' the blind leadin' the blind!

63
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:43,042
Don't just stand there -

64
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:46,372
brew us a dish o' tea while
I rest me broken wing!

65
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:58,132
BELL CLANGS

66
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:05,612
~ Ross, have 'ee got a minute?
~ By all means.

67
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:10,362
Young Jim...

68
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:12,842
What's he been up to now?

69
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:15,732
My Jinny.

70
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:27,162
Poaching's a capital offence.

71
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:31,402
Believe me, I'm acquainted
with the niceties of the law.

72
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:34,802
'Tis not for my sake, Ross, 'tis
for me mother an' sisters.

73
00:07:34,852 --> 00:07:37,042
~ I can't see 'em starve.
~ And Jinny?

74
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:38,722
Sir?

75
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:41,002
Is her welfare of equal
concern to you?

76
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:43,962
Her father tells me
she is with child.

77
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:47,642
Yes, sir, an' I mean to do right
by 'er when I can afford it.

78
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:51,722
Dammit, man, the girl's frantic!
Why didn't you come to me before?

79
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,512
Why, Ross, but what could 'ee do?

80
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:00,602
It wants some small repairs.

81
00:08:00,652 --> 00:08:03,042
But nothin' a' pay?

82
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:06,572
You'd be doing me a favour,
keeping it clean and dry.

83
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:10,402
'Tis more than we could
ever 'ave hoped.

84
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:12,442
Well, then, that's settled.

85
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,362
So, now what's your excuse?

86
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:15,762
Sir?

87
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:17,602
Don't keep the girl waiting!

88
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:20,962
Be off to her father -
and while you're at it,

89
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:24,322
see Reverend Odgers about
getting the banns read.

90
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:28,692
And get rid of those nets.
Let's have no more poaching.

91
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:30,682
So, Prudie's recovery
may take some time.

92
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:33,072
Happen a month or so, sir.

93
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:38,932
Have her delay it
as long as possible.

94
00:10:01,452 --> 00:10:05,692
MUSICIANS PLAY, GENERAL CHATTER

95
00:10:35,732 --> 00:10:38,672
I wish you could forget him, my dear.

96
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,912
Is love so easy to forget?

97
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,322
Forgive me.

98
00:10:48,372 --> 00:10:52,572
I didn't mean... I didn't
mean to suggest...

99
00:10:54,372 --> 00:10:56,962
SHE INHALES SHARPLY

100
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:59,652
SHE GASPS IN PAIN

101
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:03,122
SHE RINGS THE BELL

102
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:06,012
Mrs Tabb, send for Dr Choake.

103
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:13,602
I wonder you do not think of
marriage, Captain Poldark?

104
00:11:13,652 --> 00:11:16,682
I dare say I shall, in due course.

105
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:20,322
Always remembering the purpose
for which it was ordained?

106
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:22,282
In particular...?

107
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:24,802
As a remedy against sin.

108
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,122
And to avoid fornication.

109
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:38,042
~ We can't thank 'ee enough.
~ Any man would do the same.

110
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:40,162
"Any man" would not.

111
00:11:41,372 --> 00:11:44,162
~ The only son.
~ An' since his father bit the dust...

112
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:48,012
There's next to nothing
coming into the household.

113
00:11:48,972 --> 00:11:52,282
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

114
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:54,972
SHE MOANS

115
00:11:58,732 --> 00:12:02,252
SHE PANTS AND GASPS

116
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:10,282
SHE GROANS IN PAIN

117
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:13,652
MUSICIANS PLAYING

118
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:15,132
A grandson!

119
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:21,002
The line continues.

120
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:23,002
Well done, my boy!

121
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,282
Thank Elizabeth. She did the work.

122
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:28,362
Ah, women! They make a
song and dance about it,

123
00:13:28,412 --> 00:13:30,922
but if things are properly managed...

124
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:32,712
A new Poldark!

125
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:46,012
DEMELZA SINGS MERRILY

126
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:56,692
LOUD SNORING

127
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:01,362
DOOR SLAMS SHUT

128
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:02,842
A letter...

129
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:05,362
A letter come from Trenwith.

130
00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:18,632
Francis and Elizabeth have a son.

131
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:06,372
Ah! Ross.

132
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:10,402
We were just saying,
any man opening a mine

133
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:14,202
these days must be exceptionally
brave or extremely foolish!

134
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:16,242
How so?

135
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,522
In these dire economic times...

136
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:21,602
Which might be less dire, were
they not in the hands of those

137
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:23,802
whose only purpose
is to make a profit.

138
00:15:23,852 --> 00:15:25,602
What other purpose is there?

139
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:29,002
Perhaps you should ask those
who exist on starvation wages.

140
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:32,042
Perhaps if you fraternised
less with the lower orders,

141
00:15:32,092 --> 00:15:34,002
you'd feel their woes less keenly.

142
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:35,842
One does feel that the gentry

143
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:38,082
and the vulgars should
keep to themselves.

144
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:41,002
Otherwise it just gets so confusing.

145
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:44,442
Good day.

146
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:52,202
Have we been introduced? I seem
to recall you're related to me(!)

147
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:56,442
Forgive me, Aunt. I've had much
to attend to of late. How are you?

148
00:15:56,492 --> 00:16:00,132
How should I be, with Mistress
Glumps for company?

149
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:04,402
Verity is well rid of
that scoundrel, Blamey.

150
00:16:04,452 --> 00:16:07,762
I trust you've learnt the
folly of interference?

151
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:10,962
It won't be repeated,
I assure you, Uncle.

152
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,682
What do you make of my grandson?

153
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:17,412
Please...

154
00:16:28,732 --> 00:16:30,922
A fine-looking boy, is he not?

155
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:32,442
Like his father.

156
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,492
~ And his mother?
~ I congratulate you both.

157
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:38,632
Please.

158
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:44,442
Ah, George...

159
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,082
You look pale.

160
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,132
I've been stronger.

161
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:52,882
I'd hoped you'd be named godfather.

162
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:56,292
But Francis and George are
inseparable these days.

163
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,722
Look at Geoffrey Charles!

164
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:07,842
He's smiling at you!

165
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:09,962
I can't imagine why!

166
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:24,532
Elizabeth?

167
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,122
GLASS CLINKS

168
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:40,042
Ladies and gentlemen.

169
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,802
This is a proud day for the Poldarks.

170
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:49,002
Behold, the future - Geoffrey
Charles Poldark,

171
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:52,242
heir to the great Trenwith estate.

172
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:56,762
And when I have taken
leave of this world

173
00:17:56,812 --> 00:18:02,202
and Francis has taught
the boy all he knows...

174
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:03,962
(That shouldn't take long.)

175
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:08,362
.. our great Poldark dynasty

176
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:11,082
will continue and...

177
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,922
HE GASPS IN PAIN

178
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:16,932
~ This wind... Damn me!
~ Dr Choake, quickly!

179
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,562
Father!

180
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:22,012
Carry him through. Come on.

181
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:30,002
On a Christening day?

182
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:34,082
And the child named after him?

183
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:37,052
'Tis a sign, mark my words.

184
00:18:52,772 --> 00:18:55,492
HE MOANS SOFTLY

185
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:12,002
Of course, a gentleman knows
where to draw the line.

186
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:13,562
Towards a lady of his own class,

187
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,002
his intentions should
be strictly honourable.

188
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:18,522
Towards a woman of the
lower class, however...

189
00:19:18,572 --> 00:19:21,202
Oh, indeed, it's all very
disagreeable, but men are men.

190
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:23,202
We paid a call some months ago.

191
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:25,802
There was the hussy - already
beginning to put on airs.

192
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:27,962
I saw her riding to
church, bold as brass,

193
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:30,202
~ all fligged up in her scarlet cloak!
~ It's too bad!

194
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,682
It tarnishes the family name

195
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:34,932
and my Elizabeth will
undoubtedly suffer...

196
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:39,922
Proof, if proof were needed,

197
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:43,042
that Ross Poldark is no gentleman.

198
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:45,412
HE YELLS AT HORSE

199
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:56,892
Good night, my darling boy.

200
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,362
My poor wife, neglected as usual.

201
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:08,722
How is your father?

202
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:10,162
Rallying.

203
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:12,482
Despite Choake's efforts!

204
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:16,192
You look very lovely, my dear.

205
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:35,722
Perhaps another night, I
still feel a little weak.

206
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:38,932
You seemed most... animated
this afternoon.

207
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,762
Hmm? With Ross.

208
00:20:42,812 --> 00:20:43,962
That's hardly fair.

209
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:46,882
"Oh, Ross, look at my baby.
See how he smiles at you.

210
00:20:46,932 --> 00:20:48,402
"Don't you wish he was yours?"

211
00:20:48,452 --> 00:20:50,592
How can you say that?!

212
00:20:52,212 --> 00:20:54,242
Of course.

213
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:56,842
Ross would never even
think such a thing.

214
00:20:56,892 --> 00:20:59,232
No, I'm sure he would not!

215
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,042
DOOR SLAMS, BABY CRIES

216
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:04,202
Listening at key-holes?

217
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:05,842
I've been tending to Father.

218
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:07,802
No doubt you take Elizabeth's side.

219
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:08,882
Against whom?

220
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:09,962
Or Ross's!

221
00:21:10,012 --> 00:21:11,562
I take no-one's side.

222
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:13,842
Had it been left to him, you
would be in Falmouth now,

223
00:21:13,892 --> 00:21:17,482
living with that scoundrel
in shame and misery.

224
00:21:17,532 --> 00:21:20,082
I don't regard marriage as misery.

225
00:21:20,132 --> 00:21:23,532
That's because you have
yet to experience it.

226
00:21:25,612 --> 00:21:28,282
(For which I have you to thank.)

227
00:21:38,972 --> 00:21:41,292
DOG BARKS

228
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:44,472
(Jim?)

229
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:54,612
FOOTSTEPS RETREAT

230
00:22:18,812 --> 00:22:20,362
'Jim's a good man,'

231
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:23,762
and it's good he should want
to provide for his family,

232
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:25,202
but not with poaching.

233
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:27,162
It's too dangerous.

234
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:31,212
Could 'ee maybe ask Captain
Ross to tell him to stop?

235
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:37,392
Mr Ross? Can I speak to 'ee, sir?

236
00:22:39,332 --> 00:22:40,882
Mr Ross, sir?

237
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:43,372
FAINT SNORING

238
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:45,732
Sir?

239
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:52,292
Mr Ross?

240
00:23:12,852 --> 00:23:14,602
"Wee-al...

241
00:23:14,652 --> 00:23:16,162
"Weel... Well...

242
00:23:16,212 --> 00:23:18,722
"Wheal...

243
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:22,492
"Leesh... Lie-sur."

244
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:07,692
Demelza?

245
00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:14,532
Cap'n Poldark, sir? Do 'ee need me?

246
00:24:17,012 --> 00:24:19,322
A heart stroke?

247
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:20,722
But Choake says you'll recover.

248
00:24:20,772 --> 00:24:22,162
Choake's a fool.

249
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,352
And I am not immortal.

250
00:24:24,972 --> 00:24:27,242
So, this is your chance.

251
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:28,842
To do what?

252
00:24:28,892 --> 00:24:30,962
Step up to the mark.

253
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:34,112
You do recall we have a mine?

254
00:24:35,692 --> 00:24:37,042
Yes, but...

255
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:39,642
It requires presence -

256
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:42,002
direction, leadership.

257
00:24:42,052 --> 00:24:43,452
Yours.

258
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:47,042
Yours!

259
00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:48,202
I know little of...

260
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:50,522
Learn - fast.

261
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,882
If your cousin continues
to pay decent wages,

262
00:24:53,932 --> 00:24:56,932
we'll soon have no-one
left at Grambler.

263
00:25:03,572 --> 00:25:06,572
Take a leaf out of
your cousin's book.

264
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:10,042
'Does he keep his distance?

265
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,362
'Does he watch from afar?

266
00:25:14,732 --> 00:25:18,722
'Or does he roll up his sleeves
and toil alongside his men?'

267
00:25:18,772 --> 00:25:20,842
Good day to you all.

268
00:25:24,052 --> 00:25:27,252
'Which do you think will
yield the better result?'

269
00:25:44,692 --> 00:25:47,892
How much longer do you
think before we eat?

270
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:54,322
And perhaps if there's some bread...

271
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:58,642
And maybe some...

272
00:26:01,492 --> 00:26:02,762
.. ale.

273
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,612
Have you eaten?

274
00:26:06,452 --> 00:26:08,482
I do sometimes forget to, sir.

275
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:10,002
Eat now.

276
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:11,252
Sit.

277
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,242
You've finished the lower field?

278
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:30,162
Yes, sir. And tomorrow I
be startin' on the meadow.

279
00:26:30,212 --> 00:26:33,322
You get through more in a
day than Prudie in a month!

280
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:35,802
I be young, sir. And strong...

281
00:26:35,852 --> 00:26:37,792
And not bone idle.

282
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:50,412
I heard Jinny was over. How is she?

283
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:56,562
In truth, sir,

284
00:26:56,612 --> 00:26:58,002
she's that worried.

285
00:26:58,052 --> 00:27:00,792
~ About what?
~ Jim and his poachin'.

286
00:27:01,892 --> 00:27:05,452
I thought perhaps 'ee
could tell him to stop.

287
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:09,172
I'll do more than that.

288
00:27:09,972 --> 00:27:11,602
I've a better job for him -

289
00:27:11,652 --> 00:27:14,192
assistant purser at the mine.

290
00:27:15,452 --> 00:27:17,972
Oh, Jinny'll be that glad!

DOG BARKS

Why must 'ee go?

293

We don't need nothin' more.

294
00:27:45,772 --> 00:27:48,282
Cap'n Poldark do give 'ee
work and this cottage and...

00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:50,802
'Tis not just for we, Jinny.

296
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:54,082
Cap'n Poldark do help us,

297
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:57,722
but I can't ask him to help
my mother and sisters.

298
00:27:57,772 --> 00:27:59,482
And since Father be gone,

299
00:27:59,532 --> 00:28:02,122
who else is going to put
bread in their mouths but I?

300
00:28:02,172 --> 00:28:05,112
She'd not wish 'ee to take such risk.

301
00:28:08,572 --> 00:28:11,312
There'll be no more after tonight.

302
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:14,162

~ Demelza, do we have any of that...?
~ Brandy, sir?

306
00:28:28,252 --> 00:28:31,722
Last of that hid in the
cupboard from France?

307
00:28:31,772 --> 00:28:33,372
Exactly so.

308
00:28:35,852 --> 00:28:39,322
~ Anythin' else?
~ Yes. If you could somehow
avoid the inference

309
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:41,242
that I'm utterly predictable?

310
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:42,882
Yes, sir.

311
00:28:42,932 --> 00:28:44,672

What will 'ee do?

Visit Sir Hugh Bodrugan,

Are you joining the hunt, sir?

Thank you, no.

00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:33,242
The poacher taken last
night on your land.

328
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:35,642
As magistrate, you'll have
hearing of the case.

329
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:38,202
~ He's an employee of mine.
~ Is he, by God.

330
00:30:38,252 --> 00:30:39,802
I would happily make good any loss

331
00:30:39,852 --> 00:30:41,922
if he could be let off
with a severe warning.

332
00:30:41,972 --> 00:30:44,402
Blast me, sir, he's on
his way to Truro gaol.

333
00:30:44,452 --> 00:30:48,042
~ I had him committed for trial
at eight o'clock this morning.
~ You were in haste, sir.

334
00:30:48,092 --> 00:30:50,602
There was no time to lose
- the hunt starts at nine.

335
00:30:50,652 --> 00:30:53,682
It's a damned disgrace, the amount
of good game going lost of late.

336
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:57,202
Hanging's barely good
enough for the villain!

337
00:30:57,252 --> 00:30:59,932
HORN SIGNALS START OF HUNT

338
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:07,242
'They disgust me, my own class.'

339
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:12,682
Not all of them, but... most.

340
00:31:12,732 --> 00:31:16,242
~ How is it, sir, that 'ee be not like 'em?
~ Perhaps I am.

341
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:19,762
No. No, sir. They don't
see us like you do.

342
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:24,442
As folk with hurts and
feelings, same as they.

343
00:31:24,492 --> 00:31:27,692
Sometimes I fail to see
that, too, Demelza.

344
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:32,052
Sometimes I barely see what's
right in front of me.

345
00:31:38,052 --> 00:31:39,562
He's just a lad, sir.

346
00:31:39,612 --> 00:31:42,162
They mun' sure let him go.

347
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:44,212
You would think so.

348
00:31:50,372 --> 00:31:51,642
Is Jinny ready?

349
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:53,722
She can't go, Ross. 'Tis 'er time.

350
00:31:53,772 --> 00:31:56,482
JINNY WAILS

351
00:31:56,532 --> 00:31:58,872
Bring him safe home, Ross.

352
00:32:20,212 --> 00:32:21,562
'.. Has been unemployed by you'

353
00:32:21,612 --> 00:32:25,602
in soliciting that pardon
from the Almighty

354
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:29,082
which I trust your prayers may obtain

355
00:32:29,132 --> 00:32:31,842
through the merits of your redeemer,

356
00:32:31,892 --> 00:32:34,932
whose first attribute is mercy.

357
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:38,122
It now only remains to me

358
00:32:38,172 --> 00:32:41,202
to pass the dreadful
sentence of the law,

359
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:44,042
which is to transportation.

360
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:46,232
JEERING Take him away.

361
00:32:49,172 --> 00:32:51,002
HE POUNDS GAVEL

362
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,602
What was his crime?

363
00:32:52,652 --> 00:32:54,122
Poaching.

364
00:32:57,372 --> 00:32:59,202
A word, sir?

365
00:32:59,252 --> 00:33:02,882
Oh... Don't tell me.
More funds required?

366
00:33:02,932 --> 00:33:05,082
No, another matter entirely.

367
00:33:05,132 --> 00:33:07,962
You treated Jim Carter when
he worked at Wheal Reath?

368
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:11,842
Convulsive asthma - a morbid
condition of the lungs.

369
00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:14,562
Did for his father, as I recall.

370
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:16,562
Why do you ask?

371
00:33:16,612 --> 00:33:20,202
Only with evidence of ill health
and testament of good character,

372
00:33:20,252 --> 00:33:23,452
I'd hope we could get
the charge dismissed.

373
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:24,642
Dismissed?!

374
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:27,082
I doubt his lungs would
survive a stint in gaol.

375
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:30,522
To be frank with you, sir, I've
no great sympathy for your aims.

376
00:33:30,572 --> 00:33:34,042
No good will come of being
sentimental about such folk.

377
00:33:34,092 --> 00:33:35,482
They're a different breed, sir.

378
00:33:35,532 --> 00:33:36,722
A different breed!

379
00:33:36,772 --> 00:33:38,772
Call James Carter!

380
00:33:44,212 --> 00:33:46,972
MURMURING

381
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:14,842
Will you join me?

382
00:34:15,572 --> 00:34:17,002
I have an estate to run.

383
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:19,122
One game won't hurt.

384
00:34:31,932 --> 00:34:34,402
So, he was caught red-handed?

385
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:35,642
And according to Sir Hugh,

386
00:34:35,692 --> 00:34:37,882
there's scarcely a pheasant
left in his woods.

387
00:34:37,932 --> 00:34:39,932
You may stand down.

388
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:42,362
Is there any defence in this case?

389
00:34:42,412 --> 00:34:44,762
May I ask the indulgence
of the court?

390
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:48,642
You have some evidence you wish
to give in this man's defence?

391
00:34:48,692 --> 00:34:51,042
I wish to give evidence
of his good character.

392
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:52,322
He's my servant.

393
00:34:52,372 --> 00:34:54,562
Take the witness stand, sir.

394
00:34:54,612 --> 00:34:57,292
MURMURING GROWS LOUDER

395
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:06,612
HE POUNDS GAVEL

396
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,122
No doubt, on the evidence
you've heard,

397
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:12,522
you will see nothing
exceptional in this case.

398
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:16,002
In your long experience I'm sure
there are many such cases -

399
00:35:16,052 --> 00:35:20,882
especially in times when
hunger, poverty and sickness

400
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:22,642
prevail amongst the poor.

401
00:35:22,692 --> 00:35:25,362
Keep to the matter in hand, sir.

402
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:29,202
I've reason to believe that the
accused fell into bad company

403
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:33,152
with an older man who has
so far escaped punishment.

404
00:35:33,692 --> 00:35:35,492
He has a wife...

405
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,722
.. a mother and four
sisters to support.

406
00:35:38,772 --> 00:35:41,722
Evidence, sir? Pertaining
to the crime itself?

407
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,002
I have it on the authority
of Dr Choake of Sawle

408
00:35:44,052 --> 00:35:46,602
that Jim Carter is suffering
from a chronic lung condition

409
00:35:46,652 --> 00:35:48,362
which may prove fatal.

410
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:50,562
I myself am prepared to stand surety

411
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:52,682
for his future employ
and good behaviour.

412
00:35:52,732 --> 00:35:54,562
Is it your contention, sir,

413
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:57,962
that the prisoner is not in a fit
state of health to go to prison?

414
00:35:58,012 --> 00:35:59,802
It is, sir.

415
00:35:59,852 --> 00:36:01,562
And furthermore,

416
00:36:01,612 --> 00:36:04,402
this very day he will become
a father for the first time.

417
00:36:04,452 --> 00:36:06,762
GASPING AND MURMURING

418
00:36:06,812 --> 00:36:08,612
HE POUNDS GAVEL

419
00:36:09,812 --> 00:36:11,682
The prisoner was ill
when he went poaching?

420
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:12,882
He's been ill for some time.

421
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:16,632
And his wife has been with
child "for some time"?

422
00:36:17,252 --> 00:36:19,762
It appears to me that if a man
is well enough to go poaching,

423
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:22,202
he's well enough to take
the consequences -

424
00:36:22,252 --> 00:36:26,052
whether or not it adversely
affects his wife and child.

425
00:36:32,892 --> 00:36:34,282
PRUDIE: And when 'ee get home,

426
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:37,602
there be calves to be meated and...

427
00:36:37,652 --> 00:36:39,852
Who be this 'ere, then?

428
00:36:40,652 --> 00:36:42,282
That be the maid's father.

429
00:36:42,332 --> 00:36:45,002
DEMELZA: What can he be wanting?

430
00:36:53,372 --> 00:36:54,642
So...

431
00:36:56,732 --> 00:36:58,602
'Ee be 'ere still?

432
00:36:58,652 --> 00:37:01,162
And content, too, Father.

433
00:37:01,212 --> 00:37:03,482
And I 'ope you are, too.

434
00:37:05,692 --> 00:37:08,162
Take a look at me, Daughter.

435
00:37:10,732 --> 00:37:12,532
What do 'ee see?

436
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:14,682
What's happened?

437
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,402
I be married.

438
00:37:18,812 --> 00:37:21,042
The Widow Chegwidden
have raised me up

439
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:22,602
and brought me out to meet the Lord.

440
00:37:22,652 --> 00:37:23,802
Meanin' what?

441
00:37:23,852 --> 00:37:26,952
Meanin' farewell drink
and livin' in sin.

442
00:37:28,692 --> 00:37:31,432
We live a good life now, Daughter.

443
00:37:31,772 --> 00:37:34,512
And we be fixin' to have 'ee back.

444
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:38,532
'Tis a fine woman
I've married, child.

445
00:37:39,012 --> 00:37:41,042
And we do think 'ee be better with we

446
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:44,282
than stayin' 'ere exposed
to all temptations of...

447
00:37:44,332 --> 00:37:45,722
flesh and the devil.

448
00:37:45,772 --> 00:37:46,842
"Temptations"?!

449
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:49,362
'Ee do know of what I speak.

450
00:37:50,532 --> 00:37:52,402
Confess, Daughter,

451
00:37:52,452 --> 00:37:54,602
what sin there is 'twixt
you and Poldark.

452
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:56,162
There's no sin!

453
00:37:56,212 --> 00:37:58,362
He's my master and I'm his servant.

454
00:37:58,412 --> 00:38:00,002
And more besides, if tales be true.

455
00:38:00,052 --> 00:38:02,602
~ What's it to me what folks say?
~ Nought to 'ee maybe,

456
00:38:02,652 --> 00:38:04,922
but I want no daughter of
mine mixed up in such talk!

457
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:07,362
Since when were 'ee so tender of me?

458
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:11,212
Since the Lord ope'd my
heart and shone His light!

459
00:38:11,932 --> 00:38:14,722
So I give 'ee a day to
make it right wi' Poldark,

460
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:17,772
and then I'll be back here
again to fetch 'ee home.

461
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:36,452
THEY WHISPER

462
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:42,082
INDISTINCT

463
00:38:42,132 --> 00:38:46,532
You paint a vivid picture of the
hardships endured by the poor, sir.

464
00:38:47,532 --> 00:38:48,762
Still,

465
00:38:48,812 --> 00:38:52,122
a man's need should not
determine his honesty,

466
00:38:52,172 --> 00:38:54,442
else all beggars would be thieves.

467
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:56,602
GROANING

468
00:38:56,652 --> 00:39:01,202
However, in view of these
extenuating circumstances

469
00:39:01,252 --> 00:39:04,602
and your testimony of
Carter's good character,

470
00:39:04,652 --> 00:39:08,202
the court is prepared to
take a more lenient view.

471
00:39:08,252 --> 00:39:10,892
MURMURING

472
00:39:16,852 --> 00:39:19,242
Sentenced to two years' imprisonment.

473
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:21,532
GASPING AND GROANING

474
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:29,562
Well, I trust I shall never
have the misfortune

475
00:39:29,612 --> 00:39:31,722
to have the "leniency" of
the court extended to me!

476
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:33,322
Have a care, Mr Poldark.

477
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:37,002
Such remarks are not entirely outside
the court's jurisdiction.

478
00:39:37,052 --> 00:39:38,122
No.

479
00:39:38,172 --> 00:39:40,922
Only mercy enjoys that privilege.

480
00:39:40,972 --> 00:39:42,772
One moment, sir.

481
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:46,802
You take issue with
the laws of this land?

482
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:48,922
I can't help but feel
that, in this case,

483
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:51,722
justice would have been
best served by clemency.

484
00:39:51,772 --> 00:39:53,402
Happily for justice,

485
00:39:53,452 --> 00:39:57,642
this court is better able to
interpret the law than you.

486
00:39:57,692 --> 00:40:01,802
Then the law is savage and you
interpret it without charity!

487
00:40:01,852 --> 00:40:03,482
The book from which you preach

488
00:40:03,532 --> 00:40:05,762
says that man shall not
live by bread alone.

489
00:40:05,812 --> 00:40:08,282
These days you're asking him
to live without even that!

490
00:40:08,332 --> 00:40:09,962
Step down, Mr Poldark,

491
00:40:10,012 --> 00:40:12,442
or we'll have you committed
for contempt of court.

492
00:40:12,492 --> 00:40:13,962
I can assure you, such a committal

493
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:17,092
would be an entirely accurate
reading of my thoughts.

494
00:40:26,972 --> 00:40:28,602
How can I go?

495
00:40:28,652 --> 00:40:30,602
I couldn't live nowhere else.

496
00:40:30,652 --> 00:40:33,162
Till I came, I never lived at all.

497
00:40:33,212 --> 00:40:35,532
I can't leave 'ere.

498
00:40:38,012 --> 00:40:40,082
(I can't leave him.)

499
00:40:42,612 --> 00:40:44,762
He'll make me go.

500
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:46,552
He won't care.

501
00:40:47,372 --> 00:40:50,002
I'm not so important
to him as he is to me.

502
00:40:50,052 --> 00:40:52,362
Spare yourself the trouble, child,

503
00:40:52,412 --> 00:40:54,752
he'll not be 'ome tonight.

504
00:40:59,012 --> 00:41:01,652
INDISTINCT CHATTER

505
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:09,802
What cheer, Captain Poldark?

506
00:41:09,852 --> 00:41:11,722
Precious little.

507
00:41:11,772 --> 00:41:13,522
I could remedy that.

508
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,312
You could not.

509
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:19,642
Nobody could.

510
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:24,652
Then I shall take my consolation
where it's more appreciated.

511
00:41:40,852 --> 00:41:42,202
A Poldark, you say?

512
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:44,442
Not a Poldark...

513
00:41:44,492 --> 00:41:45,482
Ooh!

514
00:41:45,532 --> 00:41:50,162
..THE Poldark of Trenwith House.

515
00:41:50,212 --> 00:41:53,252
Oh, Lord bless you, sir.
What other Poldark is there?

516
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:24,362
INDISTINCT SHOUTING

517
00:42:24,412 --> 00:42:26,892

518
00:42:28,332 --> 00:42:30,442
Gaoler!

519
00:42:30,492 --> 00:42:32,242
It was more than good
of 'ee to try, Ross.

520
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:35,092
Don't thank me, I failed miserably.

521
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:42,412
MAN COUGHS AND CRIES

522
00:42:59,932 --> 00:43:01,492
Goodbye.

523
00:43:05,972 --> 00:43:10,972
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

524
00:43:12,412 --> 00:43:15,282
I can't leave him! I can't! I can't!

525
00:43:16,292 --> 00:43:17,722
I must.

526
00:43:17,772 --> 00:43:19,852
~ Demelza?
~ DOOR SHUTS

527
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:26,692
Demelza!

528
00:43:49,212 --> 00:43:51,042
Demelza?

529
00:43:51,092 --> 00:43:52,362
Sir?

530
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:53,802
Close the window.

531
00:43:53,852 --> 00:43:55,322
Yes, sir.

532
00:44:02,372 --> 00:44:04,522
Are Jud and Prudie abed?

533
00:44:04,572 --> 00:44:06,642
Yes, sir, long since.

534
00:44:07,532 --> 00:44:09,402
Fetch me the rum.

535
00:44:10,292 --> 00:44:11,762
Yes, sir.

536
00:44:23,612 --> 00:44:25,882
Jim Carter got two years.

537
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:29,442
I feared it might be worse.

538
00:44:29,492 --> 00:44:32,322
I doubt he'll survive.

539
00:44:32,372 --> 00:44:33,922
'Ee did all 'ee could.

540
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:35,122
Did I?

541
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,772
I doubt it.

542
00:44:37,412 --> 00:44:40,412
I was too concerned
with my own dignity.

543
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:44,842
Grovelling and compliments
were the order of the day,

544
00:44:44,892 --> 00:44:48,962
and I made the mistake of trying
to teach them their business.

545
00:44:49,012 --> 00:44:51,082
A schoolboy error...

546
00:44:52,572 --> 00:44:55,112
.. and Jim paid dearly for it.

547
00:44:59,652 --> 00:45:01,052
Demelza?

548
00:45:04,932 --> 00:45:07,002
What are you wearing?

549
00:45:09,772 --> 00:45:12,962
I found it, sir, in one of
the chests in the library.

550
00:45:13,012 --> 00:45:16,002
You dare to go rifling
through those things?

551
00:45:16,052 --> 00:45:19,042
I'm... I'm sorry, sir. 'Ee never
told me I shouldn't look.

552
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:21,242
Surely that was obvious?

553
00:45:21,292 --> 00:45:23,122
You're employed as a maid.

554
00:45:23,172 --> 00:45:24,962
~ I know, sir.
~ And you've been a good one.

555
00:45:25,012 --> 00:45:27,042
And for that you're allowed
certain liberties.

556
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:29,202
But dressing up in fine clothes
is not one of them.

557
00:45:29,252 --> 00:45:32,402
~ I meant no 'arm, sir. It was
just rottin' away in that ol' box.
~ Take it off.

558
00:45:32,452 --> 00:45:35,532
~ I thought 'ee might let me wear it some...
~ Take it off now!

559
00:45:37,972 --> 00:45:40,042
If you don't take it off this minute,

560
00:45:40,092 --> 00:45:43,992
you can pack your things
and go back to your father!

561
00:45:46,732 --> 00:45:48,722
~ SHE CRIES
~ Demelza.

562
00:45:48,772 --> 00:45:52,852
Enough! Enough now. I shouldn't
have spoken so harshly.

563
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:56,052
Don't take it to heart.

564
00:45:56,692 --> 00:45:59,732
It's been a hellish day
and I'm not myself.

565
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:23,602
What is it? What've I done?

566
00:46:23,652 --> 00:46:25,522
I didn't take you from
your father for this.

567
00:46:25,572 --> 00:46:27,202
What do it matter what
you took me for?

568
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:30,052
~ Go to bed.
~ Sir...
~ Go to bed, now.

569
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,212
KNOCK ON DOOR

570
00:47:22,772 --> 00:47:24,372
What is it?

571
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,372
The dress...

572
00:47:42,012 --> 00:47:44,552
.. it unfastens down the back.

573
00:48:25,692 --> 00:48:28,292
You know what people say of us.

574
00:48:28,652 --> 00:48:29,852
Yes.

575
00:48:32,732 --> 00:48:35,002
If we behave like this...

576
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:38,372
.. it will be true.

577
00:48:41,012 --> 00:48:43,082
Then let it be true.

578
00:49:35,532 --> 00:49:37,532
DOOR HANDLE JANGLES

579
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:24,252
HARP MUSIC

580
00:50:27,932 --> 00:50:29,732
Where's Francis?

581
00:50:31,092 --> 00:50:33,202
He did not come home last night.

582
00:50:33,252 --> 00:50:37,122
~ He'll have stayed in town with George.
~ That upstart?

583
00:50:37,172 --> 00:50:38,962
Has he been going to the mine?

584
00:50:39,012 --> 00:50:41,162
I'm sure he has.

585
00:50:41,212 --> 00:50:42,762
Elizabeth,

586
00:50:42,812 --> 00:50:46,562
is he attending to his duties?

587
00:50:46,612 --> 00:50:48,682
Of course he is, sir.

588
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:53,482
Where's Demelza?

589
00:50:53,532 --> 00:50:55,002
Ain't seen her.

590
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,962
When she appears, tell her
to start on the barley field.

591
00:50:58,012 --> 00:50:59,642
You and I will set to with the hay.

592
00:50:59,692 --> 00:51:00,802
Aye, sir.

593
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:02,322
I, sir?!

594
00:51:02,372 --> 00:51:03,962
You, sir.

595
00:51:04,012 --> 00:51:05,802
Without Jim to cover your idleness,

596
00:51:05,852 --> 00:51:08,972
you may be forced to break
a sweat occasionally.

597
00:51:15,132 --> 00:51:16,932
It isn't right.

598
00:51:31,332 --> 00:51:35,532
They be sayin' that Jim Carter won't
last five minutes in Bodmin Gaol.

599
00:51:37,292 --> 00:51:40,292
If fever don't get
him, starvation will.

600
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:45,762
Still, if someone we know
hadn't spoke up for him,

601
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:49,612
he'd be on his way to seven
years' transportation.

602
00:52:38,412 --> 00:52:40,482
An unexpected pleasure.

603
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,072
I was passing this way and...

604
00:52:46,132 --> 00:52:49,132
I was sorry to hear
about your farm boy.

605
00:52:49,812 --> 00:52:52,812
Reverend Halse plays cards
with the Warleggans.

606
00:52:53,852 --> 00:52:54,882
And?

607
00:52:54,932 --> 00:52:58,362
Perhaps if you'd approached George,
things could have been arranged.

608
00:52:58,412 --> 00:53:00,562
Is that how justice works?

609
00:53:00,612 --> 00:53:02,752
We both know it, Ross.

610
00:53:05,772 --> 00:53:07,972
How's Geoffrey Charles?

611
00:53:08,572 --> 00:53:10,522
He's my joy.

612
00:53:10,572 --> 00:53:11,972
Our joy.

613
00:53:13,172 --> 00:53:16,122
I heard blasting as I
came by Wheal Leisure.

614
00:53:16,172 --> 00:53:18,372
Have you hit ironstone?

615
00:53:19,052 --> 00:53:21,252
This is a new interest!

616
00:53:21,692 --> 00:53:23,042
Francis thinks it's unladylike

617
00:53:23,092 --> 00:53:27,082
but how else can I understand the
business on which our fortunes,

618
00:53:27,132 --> 00:53:29,162
and those of our tenants, depend?

619
00:53:29,212 --> 00:53:31,522
You always had an enquiring mind.

620
00:53:31,572 --> 00:53:33,802
Marriage discourages such a thing.

621
00:53:33,852 --> 00:53:35,442
Always?

622
00:53:35,492 --> 00:53:38,292
Perhaps it depends on the partners.

623
00:53:39,612 --> 00:53:41,932
DOOR OPENS

624
00:53:48,132 --> 00:53:50,602
Beg your pardon, sir, ma'am.

625
00:53:53,892 --> 00:53:55,202
Can I get you anything, ma'am?

626
00:53:55,252 --> 00:53:57,082
Prudie served us.

627
00:53:57,132 --> 00:53:58,722
Her arm seems recovered.

628
00:53:58,772 --> 00:54:00,242
Yes, sir.

629
00:54:04,052 --> 00:54:06,962
I'll just see to these flowers.

630
00:54:07,012 --> 00:54:09,082
They're very pretty.

631
00:54:11,372 --> 00:54:13,442
Would you like them?

632
00:54:13,772 --> 00:54:15,162
Oh!

633
00:54:15,212 --> 00:54:18,522
Thank you, but I'm afraid
they won't last.

634
00:54:18,572 --> 00:54:21,042
See, they're fading already.

635
00:54:22,212 --> 00:54:24,552
Cornflowers are like that.

636
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:38,562
I must go.

637
00:54:38,612 --> 00:54:40,482
I'll see you out.

638
00:55:41,452 --> 00:55:42,852
Demelza?

639
00:55:48,372 --> 00:55:49,482
Where's Demelza?

640
00:55:49,532 --> 00:55:51,642
Last I seen her, she were
headin' towards Sawle

641
00:55:51,692 --> 00:55:54,632
wi' that blatherin' dog at her heels.

642
00:56:03,412 --> 00:56:05,682
I engaged you for two years.

643
00:56:05,732 --> 00:56:08,082
What do you mean by running away?

644
00:56:08,132 --> 00:56:10,722
~ Sir, I...
~ Haven't you been well treated?

645
00:56:10,772 --> 00:56:14,482
Aren't you grown used to
the house, and your tasks...

646
00:56:14,532 --> 00:56:16,122
and my moods?

647
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:18,762
~ Yes, sir, but...
~ Do you not give me what
I want before I even ask?

648
00:56:18,812 --> 00:56:20,362
Yes, sir, but I...

649
00:56:20,412 --> 00:56:22,162
I thought, after what happened...

650
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,602
You thought you would
no longer be my servant.

651
00:56:25,652 --> 00:56:27,722
Not from choice, sir.

652
00:56:30,732 --> 00:56:32,242
You're right.

653
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:34,962
You CAN no longer be my servant.

654
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,802
Dearly beloved,

655
00:56:40,852 --> 00:56:43,442
we are gathered together
here in the sight of God,

656
00:56:43,492 --> 00:56:47,442
to join together this
man and this woman

657
00:56:47,492 --> 00:56:49,492
in holy matrimony.

658
00:56:50,772 --> 00:56:52,722
Ross Vennor Poldark,

659
00:56:52,772 --> 00:56:55,932
do you take this woman to
be your lawful wedded wife?

660
00:57:02,892 --> 00:57:04,002
He's done it now!

661
00:57:04,052 --> 00:57:06,362
Could have had his pick, any
number of eligible girls.

662
00:57:06,412 --> 00:57:08,402
Instead of which he marries
his serving wench.

663
00:57:08,452 --> 00:57:10,802
Young girls these days
have such ideas -

664
00:57:10,852 --> 00:57:12,802
always trying to rise
above their station!

665
00:57:12,852 --> 00:57:14,162
How long till we strike copper?

666
00:57:14,212 --> 00:57:15,522
Could be months.

667
00:57:15,572 --> 00:57:18,002
Doors which were open will
be slammed in his face.

668
00:57:18,052 --> 00:57:20,602
Am I prepared to trust him
with more of my capital?

669
00:57:20,652 --> 00:57:22,002
His ventures will fail.

670
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:23,962
We can last till the
week before Christmas.

671
00:57:24,012 --> 00:57:25,242
"Ross Poldark"

672
00:57:25,292 --> 00:57:27,842
"too much of a risk for
the prudent investor"?

673
00:57:27,892 --> 00:57:31,002
And you can enjoy the sight of him
in the gutter, along with his slut.

674
00:57:31,052 --> 00:57:32,892
Ross'll be sorry he ever wed me.

675
00:57:33,305 --> 00:58:33,744

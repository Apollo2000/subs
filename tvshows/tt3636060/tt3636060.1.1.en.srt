2
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,240
Propose.

3
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,280
- Two. 
- What's the stake?

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,440
Your ring.

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,480
Gambling again, Poldark. Remind me why you enlisted.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,240
To escape the gallows, sir.

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,800
Your crime?

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,040
Brawling, sir. Free trading, assaulting a customs official.

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,600
Wastrels and thieves, the lot of you.

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,880
But you'll soon have the honour of redeeming yourselves -

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,880
in the service of King and country.

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,000
Do you doubt the justice of our cause, sir?

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,920
What cause would that be, sir? Liberty or tyranny?

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,720
GUNSHOT Ah!

15
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,640
GUNSHOTS

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,760
You want to leave here? Or die here?

17
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,040
On your feet, man! On your feet!

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,440
Pray do not be reckless,

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,960
I wish you to return.

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,080
It won't be for long.

21
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,720
You'll forget me.

22
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,360
Never!

23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,320
SHE LAUGHS

24
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,120
Are you sure?

25
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,200
I trust I may believe the evidence of my own eyes, dear.

26
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,800
Was he not reported dead?

27
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,920
Better if he had been! He's brought little credit to his family.

28
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,480
His father was no different. A scoundrel.

29
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,520
And a libertine.

30
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,920
Still, the family name counts for something.

31
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,320
And now he's to inherit.

32
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,080
Is my father dead?

33
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,840
Oh, sir! Bless me!

34
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,520
We had no idea you were awake.

35
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,200
When did he die?

36
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,760
Some six months past.

37
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,800
You'd had no word?

38
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,800
None that reached me.

39
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,520
How was the war, sir?

40
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,560
As any war, ma'am.

41
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,560
A waste of good men.

42
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,080
You are not going home to Nampara?

43
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,000
To my Uncle Charles first, ma'am.

44
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,000
Since my father will evidently not be at home,

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,840
I must look for a welcome elsewhere.

46
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,040
BACKGROUND CHATTER

47
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,160
SHE LAUGHS

48
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Do the honours, Verity. And no half-measures!

49
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
HE BURPS

50
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,680
I couldn't eat another morsel.

51
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,240
Piffle, girl, you're as thin as a wraith.

52
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,960
We must fatten you up!

53
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,320
Perhaps Francis will be able to coax her.

54
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,520
I happen to like her...just as she is.

55
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,080
DOOR OPENS

56
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,400
- Was that the door? 
- Were you expecting someone, my dear?

57
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,960
She's too valuable here to be thinking of gentlemen callers!

58
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,480
I hope I'm not intruding.

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,320
Oh, Ross!

60
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,760
We'd given up all hope.

61
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,920
Stap me, boy! You survived!

62
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,000
Good to see you again, cousin!

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,680
We had quite despaired - hadn't we, Elizabeth?

64
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,560
Yes.

65
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,600
Elizabeth!

66
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,560
I'd no idea you'd be here.

67
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,520
Do tell us, Ross, how we managed to lose the war!

68
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,680
By choosing the wrong side, ma'am.

69
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,880
I couldn't have wished for a better homecoming.

70
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,440
I must speak with you, Ross.

71
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
Yes, of course.

72
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,640
And what will you do with yourself now, nephew?

73
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,440
You'll find Nampara not as you left it.

74
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,960
Damn me, boy!

75
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,040
If we hadn't thought you'd gone to join the blest above!

76
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,240
Great Aunt, I'm glad to see you are still of the blest below.

77
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,840
We'd had no word from you, so...

78
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,800
Sit here, Ross. You must be exhausted.

79
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,960
Elizabeth, fetch me my wrap.

80
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,440
Yes, Mama.

81
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,560
SHE WHIMPERS

82
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,080
I seem to have interrupted a party.

83
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,520
Is this in honour of the peace or of the next war?

84
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,560
No, erm...

85
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,680
The occasion is...

86
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,240
Something far more pleasant.

87
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,480
My boy is to be married.

88
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,640
But that's tremendous!

89
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,960
Who is to be?

90
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,440
Elizabeth.

91
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,880
Elizabeth?

92
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,880
Elizabeth?

93
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,080
Naturally we're delighted that our two ancient

94
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,640
and distinguished families will be united.

95
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,320
Did my father suffer much, Uncle?

96
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,640
Ah...a pitiful end.

97
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,920
Affairs in tatters

98
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,920
and next-to-nothing left for you to inherit.

99
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,520
Not that we thought you'd be back to claim it.

100
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,920
It's a poor Cornwall you've returned to.

101
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,800
Taxes sky-high, wages in the gutter.

102
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,720
Mine closures every other week.

103
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,600
Bad as you, lad! Scarred for life, on its knees.

104
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,240
I can't stay.

105
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,320
I've only called to let you know I've returned.

106
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,200
I must trouble you for a horse, Charles.

107
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,240
But first, a toast.

108
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,040
To Elizabeth and Francis.

109
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,640
May they find happiness together.

110
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,040
- ALL: 
- Elizabeth and Francis.

111
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,840
Jud?

112
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,440
Prudie?

113
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,720
GOAT BLEATS

114
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,680
CHICKENS CLUCK

115
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,480
SNORING

116
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,320
THEY GASP

117
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,320
On your feet, now!

118
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,800
Judas!

119
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,400
- Is it Mr Ross? 
- Back from the grave!

120
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,800
You were my father's personal servants.

121
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,960
You were left in a position of trust.

122
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,640
Well, pick me liver, what could us do?

123
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,200
Left alone wi' no master to guide us?

124
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,560
I'll guide you with the side of my foot in future.

125
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,360
But see, 'twas rumoured you were dead.

126
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,840
Perhaps you started the tale?

127
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,040
Ain't no call to accuse us, Mr Ross,

128
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,960
ted'n right, ted'n fair, ted'n fit, ted'n friendly.

129
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,040
You'll get "friendly" if I don't see my face reflected in this floor

130
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,680
by the time you're done!

131
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,120
- Ross looked well. 
- He did.

132
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,880
Better than one might have expected.

133
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,320
Considering one thought him dead.

134
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,880
Elizabeth will make a fine Mistress of Trenwith.

135
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,320
Not for three months, Aunt.

136
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,000
Your father thinks it should be sooner.

137
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,720
- Does he? 
- His view is,

138
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,320
if two young people wish to be together,

139
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,960
what is there to wait for?

140
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,040
Can it be?

141
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,800
- Isn't a ghost! 
- See for yourself!

142
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,160
We 'eard you took a bullet!

143
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,600
Dodged a few.

144
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,560
And got a title?

145
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,840
Cap'n Poldark! An' the war?

146
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,320
An education, Jim.

147
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,360
Well...what happened here?

148
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Since yer father died, we've 'ad no repairs.

149
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,080
I'll remedy that. You were my father's tenants,

150
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,920
now you're mine.

151
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,520
Nay, Ross, you've enough to think of wi' ruined home and barren land.

152
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,960
I have hands, do I not? A spade, a plough...

153
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,280
Well, we can 'elp 'ee.

154
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,680
- I cannot pay you. 
- I would not expect it.

155
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,280
You labour long enough in my uncle's mine for a pittance,

156
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,520
- I'll not have you serve me for nothing. 
- Ross?

157
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,320
What did happen out there?

158
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,320
I grew up.

159
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,240
Mr Poldark to see you, Miss Elizabeth.

160
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,600
My dear, I have great news!

161
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,120
Your father left very little of value.

162
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,840
The house, two derelict mines, a few decaying cottages.

163
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,840
- The land, I fear, has been left to rot? 
- Entirely.

164
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,600
So you come to enquire as to credit?

165
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,440
As your friend, I would back you to the hilt.

166
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,400
As your banker, I'm obliged to disappoint.

167
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,760
Your father had debts, your property is mortgaged,

168
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,240
your land has no income.

169
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,080
- I'm a poor risk. 
- Quite so.

170
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,960
And my tenants? Can I do nothing for them?

171
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,520
I know you have an affection for these people,

172
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,440
but you can barely support yourself, let alone them.

173
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,600
- Then you'd advise me... 
- Look to your own devices.

174
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,800
Seek your fortune as and where you may.

175
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,440
Beggars cannot be choosers.

176
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,760
I hope you may rely on the friend, if not the banker.

177
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,600
I hope so, too.

178
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,960
For I need all the friends I can get.

179
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,600
Ross Poldark is alive.

180
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,560
That wastrel?

181
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,200
At school, I rather admired him.

182
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,600
He said what he thought, did what he liked.

183
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,200
And where did it get him?

184
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,320
It got him a following.

185
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,280
Something we frequently fail to acquire.

186
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,720
I wonder if he might not be useful to us?

187
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,920
His father's dead. He has no obvious source of income.

188
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,720
If we could rally him to our cause.

189
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,520
- To what end? 
- He has an ancient family name -

190
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,440
doors which are closed to us might open for him.

191
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,400
What inducements could we offer?

192
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,760
His need at present must be severe.

193
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,280
You mean to buy his friendship?

194
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,560
I would rather he bestowed it willingly.

195
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,760
I find people are very friendly when they cannot afford not to be.

196
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,400
Elizabeth, where are you going?

197
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,040
- I must speak with Ross, Mama. 
- To what purpose?

198
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,920
To explain, to ask him, "What shall we do?"

199
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,880
There is nothing to do. You are engaged to Francis.

200
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,280
But Ross and I...

201
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,680
Where is he now? Has he come to see you?

202
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,480
What can he offer you but poverty, uncertainty, a dubious reputation?

203
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,560
- I do not care about reputation. 
- But you should.

204
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,560
Francis adores you. You will be Mistress of Trenwith.

205
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,480
Had Ross not returned, would you have the slightest hesitation?

206
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,080
He HAS returned.

207
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,120
If he still cared for you...

208
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,560
would he not have been at the door by now?

209
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,280
Just clearing the field, Mr Ross.

210
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,360
A cheering spectacle.

211
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,920
And a needful one.

212
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,160
Hard work is now required if we're to put food on the table.

213
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,960
'Ard work?

214
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,160
I can see you're unfamiliar with the concept.

215
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,480
Let me clarify -

216
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,520
we have nothing to live on beyond the fruits of our own labours.

217
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,680
We shall need to tighten our belts.

218
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,240
And in some cases that can only be to the good.

219
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,000
Verity!

220
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,560
You would have been surprised to hear...

221
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,920
about Elizabeth.

222
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,640
I had no option on the girl.

223
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,400
It was strange how it happened -

224
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,440
one moment she barely noticed Francis, the next...

225
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,200
She noticed his mine, his house, his estate?

226
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,760
That was uncalled for.

227
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,600
The wedding's in a fortnight.

228
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,360
So soon?

229
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,520
I wish I could help you, my dear.

230
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,440
I must find my own way out of this.

231
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,200
THEY SING MERRILY

232
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,960
An alarming prospect, is it not?

233
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,080
A lifetime with me.

234
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,760
I cannot promise to be as fascinating as some.

235
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,080
Or as bold or...reckless.

236
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,760
But one thing I can promise you...

237
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,280
..my undying love.

238
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,000
And gratitude.

239
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,080
But if there is something that still troubles you.

240
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,200
If there is something that you wish to tell me...

241
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,760
There is.

242
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,320
I wish to tell you...

243
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
that I cannot wait to be your wife.

244
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,800
- Should you be doing this? 
- I cannot afford a farm hand.

245
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,120
Your father would not have wished you to stoop.

246
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,880
My father would not have wished me to starve.

247
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,240
She's proved a poor legacy.

248
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,200
Certainly a fickle one.

249
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,920
Well, her time may come again.

250
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,200
Perhaps I should examine her.

251
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,680
Is that wise?

252
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,880
How deep did they drive it?

253
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,760
30 fathoms? Most of it'll be under water by now.

254
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,120
Ross, my erm...my father's concerned...

255
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,440
..that...you should make the right choices.

256
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Face... Face certain realities.

257
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,720
Accept that your future may lie elsewhere.

258
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,800
I thank him for his concern.

259
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,520
Ross, you do know I'm to be married next week?

260
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,560
And?

261
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,640
You've... You've not yet accepted our invitation.

262
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,640
- I have things to attend to. 
- But you must come.

263
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,600
I am not one for ceremonies.

264
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,400
Ross, it is our dearest wish...

265
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,880
Ross? Ross?

266
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,680
You must understand, when I first met Elizabeth, there was no thought

267
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,720
of my coming between you.

268
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,360
But what could I do?

269
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,480
My feelings... Our feelings for each other...

270
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,120
For God's sake, must you rub my nose in it?!

271
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,720
Ross! For pity's...

272
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,080
HE GASPS

273
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,360
Why the hell don't you learn to swim?

274
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,960
For a moment, I thought you'd let me drown.

275
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,600
For a moment, I thought so, too.

276
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,920
Elizabeth...

277
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,920
..will thou have this man as your wedded husband?

278
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,520
'To live together after God's ordinance

279
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,240
'in a state of holy matrimony?

280
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,080
'Will thou love, honour and keep him...'

281
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,520
'..forsaking all others...

282
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,560
'..so long as you both shall live?'

283
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,960
I will.

284
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,640
Those who God hath joined together let no man put asunder.

285
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,040
Watch out, sir!

286
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,320
George has done well for himself.

287
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,520
As you'll discover, the Warleggans are on the rise.

288
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,800
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a proud day for the Poldarks.

289
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,480
LIVELY STRING MUSIC BEGINS

290
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,400
I wish you could dance, Ross.

291
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,680
I thank an American musket for sparing me the ordeal.

292
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,760
Perhaps I should have purchased her for you, nephew.

293
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,480
I broker my own business these days.

294
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,600
She'll be wasted here.

295
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,840
These Poldarks have nothing beyond the name.

296
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,480
Mine on its knees and mortgaged to the hilt,

297
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,000
Warleggan's Bank may send in the bailiffs as and when it chooses.

298
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,720
This is elegant talk for a wedding, Uncle(!)

299
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,520
Talk of a profit is always elegant, George.

300
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,200
DOOR OPENS

301
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,440
My compliments on the scratch!

302
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,240
Was it got in any actual fighting or another gambling brawl?

303
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,920
Old habits die hard.

304
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,520
I was sorry to hear of your father.

305
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,080
We have something in common.

306
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,000
Both fatherless, hostages to our family's fortune.

307
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,120
And there the similarity ends.

308
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,400
Cornwall is changing. These are difficult times.

309
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,560
I trust you will feel you can rely on your friends.

310
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,720
- What for? 
- Well, whatever you might require.

311
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,640
Thank you, George, I believe I can manage.

312
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,240
ROOSTER CROWS

313
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,440
Do you believe breeding can ever be bought?

314
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,240
You should ask your uncle.

315
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,920
Elizabeth would be delighted by talk of bailiffs on her wedding day.

316
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,440
Elizabeth's delight is surely no longer your concern.

317
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,120
There you are, Ross! I've been sent to find you.

318
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,800
Let the fight commence!

319
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,400
CHEERING

320
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,840
You see, he hadn't left after all!

321
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,000
I was glad to see you at church.

322
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,440
You must wonder why I wished you there.

323
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,440
After that night, when we had no chance to speak,

324
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,360
I thought you would come to see me.

325
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,920
CHEERING

326
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,680
Why would I do that?

327
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,000
To give me a chance to explain, to apologise...

328
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,400
For what?

329
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,640
There was no formal undertaking between us.

330
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,120
Not officially, no...

331
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,040
..but you know there was something,

332
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,440
an understanding.

333
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,840
But three years is a long time, Ross.

334
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,000
Elizabeth, remember your duty as a bride is to all your guests.

335
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,880
I've no taste for fighting, Mama.

336
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,440
Are you a fan of the sport, Ross?

337
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,160
Perhaps you'll instruct me in its finer points.

338
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,240
I doubt there are any subtleties of combat

339
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,440
on which I can offer you advice, ma'am.

340
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
I'll send Francis to you.

341
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,960
You mustn't blame my mother -

342
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,040
- this was my decision. 
- And we must abide by it.

343
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,200
And we shall be neighbours.

344
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,040
And friends?

345
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,600
If you say so.

346
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,800
Feeling neglected, my dear?

347
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,200
May I claim my bride, Ross?

348
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,360
- Still a good day for Poldarks? 
- Don't encourage her.

349
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,080
The dark Poldark or the fair?

350
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,640
'The stronger rises'

351
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,440
as the weaker falls.

352
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,560
For all is fair in love and war.

353
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,840
Still feeding that pair of wastrels?

354
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,440
If you turf them out, you could afford to buy stock.

355
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,800
They were my father's friends.

356
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,880
You drive yourself hard, boy.

357
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,560
Keeps me out of mischief.

358
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,680
I'm not unfeeling, Ross.

359
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,440
I know your father had the worst of the land and the property.

360
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,880
The lot of a younger son.

361
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,920
I'd like to show you something.

362
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,880
What do you see?

363
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,240
Grambler, your mine.

364
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,480
Not so.

365
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,240
What you see is the past.

366
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,920
Does it not still produce?

367
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,400
Precious little.

368
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,480
And nothing to trouble the Welsh mines,

369
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,440
where they're dragging it out by the cartload.

370
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,760
Meantime, we're sunk in debt,

371
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,280
the bankers have us by the throat.

372
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,080
I'm sorry.

373
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,880
And your mines? What of them?

374
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,880
Even worse than Grambler.

375
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,240
Derelict, both of them.

376
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,520
Your land? Barren.

377
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,080
There's nothing for you here, boy.

378
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,800
Your future lies elsewhere.

379
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,880
A change of profession.

380
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,280
The law, perhaps? Or even the church?!

381
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,880
- Do you really not know me, Uncle? 
- A move to London. Oxford?

382
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,120
I'll fund it.

383
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,120
Your education, your expenses.

384
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,720
I believe it's what your father would have wanted.

385
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,160
And Francis?

386
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,080
What do you believe he would want?

387
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,520
- For you to prosper. 
- Away from here.

388
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,080
I think that would be best for all concerned.

389
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,600
- I'll think on it. 
- You should be biting my hand off!

390
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,840
And may yet do so.

391
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,680
But till I've exhausted every possibility of making a living

392
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,200
on my own land, among my own people...

393
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,560
Damn your stubbornness, boy!

394
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,360
The land is useless, its people are starving,

395
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,000
what possible reason is there to stay?!

396
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,280
Today's market day?

397
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,680
Aye, sir, 'tis, sir.

398
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,120
Well, don't stand there gawping, Jud,

399
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,200
fetch me my father's pocket watch.

400
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,280
GENERAL HUBBUB

401
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,320
DOG BARKS

402
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,920
DOG WHINES

403
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,320
DOG BARKS

404
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,440
Hey, that's my dog!

405
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,440
Get away! Get off him!

406
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,400
Garrick! Get off him! Garrick!

407
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,600
Enough!

408
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,760
Take my advice, you run.

409
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,680
Or else?

410
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,240
- Have they hurt you, child? 
- Don't 'ee "child" me, mister.

411
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,720
I think we've provided enough sport for one day.

412
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,280
Anyone know this child?

413
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,480
Tom Carne's daughter from Illugan.

414
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,400
She'll get the strap if he catches 'er from 'ome,

415
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,880
and in 'er brother's clothes!

416
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,760
Easy, girl. No-one will rob you.

417
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,560
I came to see if the boy was...

418
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,240
Oh...

419
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,560
- You were right to step in. 
- I'm glad you think so.

420
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,720
I'm sure the child is grateful.

421
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,760
Doubt it.

422
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,000
Elizabeth?

423
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,920
They did hurt you.

424
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,560
- Not they. 
- Then who?

425
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,160
- (Father.) 
- What? 
- Father.

426
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,880
- Beats you? 
- Most days.

427
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,160
Family?

428
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,280
Six brothers.

429
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,680
Do you love your father?

430
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,680
Bible says I must.

431
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,880
What's your name?

432
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,920
- (Demelza Carne.) 
- Speak up, child.

433
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,880
Demelza Carne.

434
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,600
Ross Poldark.

435
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,360
Befriending the rabble, Ross?

436
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,560
One would never guess you were a gentleman.

437
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,040
It takes one to know one, I believe, George.

438
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,720
For a man so impecunious, he's very full of himself.

439
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,480
Perhaps he considers us tradesmen.

440
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,960
- Which we are. 
- Were.

441
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,000
It's a pity he owns nothing worth having.

442
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,680
Come.

443
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,680
I am taking you home to Illugan.

444
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,480
He may do so in the future.

445
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,320
When he does, it will be my pleasure to take it from him.

446
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,720
Go.

447
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,480
You're back early. How was market day?

448
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,280
Not without incident.

449
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,920
HE CHUCKLES

450
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,160
# There was an old couple and they was poor...

451
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,120
# They lived in a house that had but one door

452
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,280
# Oh, what a poor couple was they, was they... #

453
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,120
Illugan's that way.

454
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,200
Thank you, sir.

455
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,880
# There was an old couple and they was poor

456
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,360
# Tweedle, tweedle, go twee

457
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,520
# I've been sick since you have been gone... #

458
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,440
I'm in need of a kitchenmaid.

459
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,800
You'd get food, lodging, proper clothing.

460
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,840
I want someone strong, for the work is hard.

461
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,880
How far?

462
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,760
Too far to run home.

463
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,440
But perhaps you don't wish to come.

464
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,920
There be Garrick, sir,

465
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
him and me be friends.

466
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,600
Where I go, he goes.

467
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,280
- Who 'ee 'ave 'ere? 
- This is Demelza.

468
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,920
She's to help in the kitchen.

469
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,160
Pickin' up brats'll bring you no end o' trouble.

470
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,880
See to the horse.

471
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,840
She'll be seethin' with crawlers.

472
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,560
Not if I give her the same treatment I gave you.

473
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,800
Ted'n right, ted'n fair, ted'n fit, ted'n proper.

474
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,600
If you work for me, you must be clean, do you understand?

475
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,200
- No lice. 
- Yes, sir.

476
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,960
- Ain't no vittles for her. 
- Find some.

477
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,040
Scarce feed ourselves, how you going to feed another beside?

478
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,080
Leave that to me.

479
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,240
Wha' she be smirkin' at?

480
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,400
Blatherin' blasted brat!

481
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,440
- How old she be? 
- Old enough to know 'er own mind!

482
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,920
Not too big to feel the back of my hand.

483
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,800
- IN OTHER ROOM: 
- Don't need no help, managed fine till now.

484
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,240
Ted'n right, ted'n fit, ted'n proper.

485
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,520
Prudie? When did this letter come?

486
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,240
Just now, sir, from your Uncle Charles.

487
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,400
Don't lurk out there, girl. Come in.

488
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,760
Have Jud and Prudie made you welcome?

489
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,760
Of course not.

490
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,840
You must learn to stand up for yourself.

491
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,240
Show them you have a mind of your own and you will not be dictated to.

492
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,000
Clear this away.

493
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,080
To Prudie, not your dog.

494
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,240
Yes, sir.

495
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,440
I been thinkin', sir, about Garrick, sir,

496
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,560
and he be outside, whining to get in.

497
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,680
Let him whine.

498
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,480
Aye, sir.

499
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,080
But he be clean, he ain't got no crawlers.

500
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,560
All dogs have crawlers, I'll have none of them in my house.

501
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,200
Now go do as I bid you.

502
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,160
DOG WHINES

503
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,560
DOG CONTINUES WHINING

504
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,440
Ross? I wasn't expecting...

505
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,200
Is my uncle in?

506
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,240
Did you enjoy market day?

507
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,200
What time will my uncle be back?

508
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,040
You caused quite a stir.

509
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,400
Though not everyone appreciated your intervention.

510
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,120
The child did.

511
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,680
She got home safely?

512
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,240
I thought to employ the girl, as a kitchenmaid.

513
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,040
Her family appear to care little for her.

514
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,320
You should send her back to them - people are quick to judge.

515
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,720
Are you?

516
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,000
I shouldn't have come.

517
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,760
- I can see it upsets you. 
- Ross, it's not your coming here...

518
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,560
What, then?!

519
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,880
It hurts to think how you must hate me.

520
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,560
Good God, Elizabeth,

521
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,440
you of all people should know...

522
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,760
..from the moment I set eyes on you, no-one else existed.

523
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,280
- While I was away, all I could think about was coming back to you. 
- Ross...

524
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,480
Did we really not mean those things we said?

525
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,920
That day I left,

526
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,080
was there really nothing between us?

527
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,520
- Is there really nothing between us now? 
- I thought you were dead!

528
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,640
How can you come to me now and ask me things you know I can't answer?

529
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,480
Why can't you answer?

530
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,200
Why can't you answer?!

531
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,560
There's nothing for you here, Ross.

532
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,360
I love Francis.

533
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,240
You must forget me and make your life elsewhere.

534
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,760
You may rely upon it.

535
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,440
At least let us part as friends.

536
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,160
We can never be friends.

537
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,160
Tell my uncle he has his wish.

538
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,040
What wish? Ross?

539
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,600
What wish?!

540
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,160
- Tell the girl to fetch her belongings... 
- Eh?

541
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,160
- She's leaving. 
- Leaving? 
- As am I.

542
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,200
- You, sir? 
- To London. She to her father.

543
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,920
But 'er father's 'ere.

544
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,080
What can I do for you?

545
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,160
MAN CHUCKLES

546
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,680
What can he do...

547
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,200
..when he slocked my daughter, enticed 'er away?

548
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,400
- Where is she? 
- No idea.

549
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,160
They searched the 'ouse.

550
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,480
- By whose permission? 
- I need no permission to come after me own!

551
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,120
That's why you bring your family?

552
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,200
Not man enough to do the job yourself?

553
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,480
I brought more than we.

554
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,040
- So you can take her home and beat her? 
- Is that your business?

555
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,320
- If I choose to make it so. 
- All right, boys...scat!

556
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,040
Sir? There be 'ordes of 'em!

557
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,320
MEN SHOUT ANGRILY

558
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,840
'Llugan folk don't 'old wi' thievin'. We come for justice.

559
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,000
An army against one man? That's brave!

560
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,720
Afeared, are ye?

561
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,120
On the contrary, you couldn't have come at a better time!

562
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,680
Lord save 'im!

563
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,200
Nay, stand off, boys.

564
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,040
I'll handle this myself.

565
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,760
MEN SHOUT ANGRILY

566
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,720
What business 'ave 'ee 'ere?

567
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,280
Naught with 'ee, but wi' your fancy gent who stole a 'Llugan maid!

568
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,440
And we're here to take her back!

569
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,520
Good luck to 'ee!

570
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,520
THEY SCREAM

571
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,200
THEY GRUNT

572
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,200
Mr Francis! Mr Francis!

573
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,560
They be killin' Mr Ross!

574
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,360
Devil are you saying, woman?

575
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,600
They be murderin' 'im, sir!

576
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,400
Mr Ross be fightin' for 'is life!

577
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,760
You must go to him, Francis, you must help him!

578
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,040
- The woman exaggerates. 
- For pity's sake!

579
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,680
Take Elizabeth inside.

580
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,400
HE PANTS

581
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,680
THEY GRUNT

582
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,680
Be so good as to close the door on your way out.

583
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,200
DOOR CLOSES

584
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,640
'Ee be alive, sir!

585
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,000
It would appear so.

586
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,920
Any sign of the girl?

587
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,720
I ain't seen 'er since God knows when.

588
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,280
'Appen she run away, sir.

589
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,920
'Appen that be for the best, sir.

590
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,480
I'm inclined to agree with you.

591
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,240
She appears to be more trouble than she's worth.

592
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,560
Where's Jud?

593
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,400
Gone to fight the Illugan miners, sir.

594
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,840
'Appen he be dead himself before long.

595
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:35,160
And I left a widow, all forlorn.

596
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,520
You 'eard 'im, he don't want thee 'ere.

597
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,480
"More trouble than she's worth." His words, not mine.

598
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,840
Now, hop it, girl. Back where 'ee belong.

599
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,000
DISTANT CHATTER

600
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,920
In God's name, what happened?

601
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,480
Francis?

602
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,240
They'll not thank him for dragging them into his folly.

603
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,160
Which gives him even less reason to stay.

604
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,240
He means to leave?

605
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,080
He's been invited to leave.

606
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,920
What have you done, Father?

607
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,200
They'll be nursing their bruises till next back end!

608
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,520
So you leave me at home to dispatch one man,

609
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,920
while you treat yourselves to a full-scale brawl?

610
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,120
Aye, sir. That's the truth of it, sir.

611
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,920
- Won't happen again. 
- Don't say that!

612
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,960
Quarrels of my own making I'll fight my own way, you understand?

613
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,600
- 'Twas a matter of pride. 
- Nay, of personal affront.

614
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,080
The quarrel was mine.

615
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,800
Hey, Ross, friends don't stand by when one of their own's at stake.

616
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,400
Come the day Wheal Leisure's fit, she can count on us 'n' all.

617
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,040
I don't like it, Father.

618
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,000
You'd like it less if you lost your wife.

619
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,880
You're assuming I can't keep her myself.

620
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,160
Can you?

621
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,160
# The old man he went far from home

622
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,080
# Tweedle, Tweedle, go twee

623
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:11,920
# The old man he went far from home All the while...

624
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,160
# Oh, what a weak woman was she Was she

625
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,000
# Oh, what a weak woman was she

626
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,720
# Oh, I've been sick since you have been gone

627
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,440
# Tweedle, Tweedle, go twee... #

628
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,440
What have you got to sing about?

629
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,680
You're making a mistake.

630
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:57,480
- Am I? 
- Your place is here. Your land, your mines.

631
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,920
Are you asking me to stay, Elizabeth?

632
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:05,400
I'm saying that everything that matters to you is in Cornwall.

633
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,640
Where did you think I was going?

634
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,040
To London. Your uncle said...

635
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,160
My uncle's mistaken.

636
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,560
Then what are you doing?

637
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,920
I lost sight of something.

638
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,440
I came in search of it.

639
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,760
Having found it, I'm going home.

640
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,880
What's that to you?

641
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,360
My inheritance.

642
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,000
- Are we acquainted, ma'am? 
- We could be.

643
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,240
'Twill end in tears.

644
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,640
- Will we be blamed? 
- Did we furnish the pistol?

645
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,720
And I would sooner gamble on a vein of copper

646
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,160
and the sweat of 50 men than by the turn of a card.

647
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,600
Look to your liberty, cousin,

648
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,360
for a great many girls would be glad to acquire the name of Poldark.

649
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,760
You don't belong here.

650
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,800
'Whatever was between you, she's put it behind her. So must you.'

651
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,320
You be wanting rid of me?

652
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,240
- Francis, I urge you to consider... 
- That anyone may abuse our trust.

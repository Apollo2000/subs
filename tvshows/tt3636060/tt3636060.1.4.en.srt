00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,870
~ Tidn't right.
~ Tidn't fair.

3
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,190
~ Tidn't fit.
~ Tidn't proper.

4
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,390
~ Won't last.
~ Won't work.

5
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,040
~ Who'd she think she is?
~ Who'd 'ee think she is?

6
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,550
'Chit of a girl.'

7
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,030
~ She'll be too grand t'skivvy.
~ Too common t' curtsey.

8
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,230
'Tis all cocky-eyed.

9
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,430
He's late t'night, Garrick.

10
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,840
Mm? Where can he be?

11
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,320
Sir!

12
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,040
Ross.

13
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,830
I was thinking 'ee might
stop over in town.

14
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,670
I have a home, do I not? And a wife?

15
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,750
I do sometimes forget.

16
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,950
~ That I live here?
~ That I'm your wife.

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,200
Let this be a reminder.

18
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,070
~ Why are you up so late?
~ I 'ave chores.

19
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,840
~ Suppose I have other plans for you?
~ Tell me.

20
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,440
Yes, Ross.

21
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,470
Folks'll wonder.

22
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,950
~ They'll not understand.
I don't rightly understand.
~ What?

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,110
How it came t'happen - this. We.

24
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,350
You're not required to understand.

25
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
You're required to accept
it as a fact of life.

26
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,270
So it's not t'be a secret?

27
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,120
Why should it?

28
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,670
Good day, ladies. Are
we expecting a storm?

29
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,630
~ Storm o'pilchards, God willin'!
~ They're late this year.

30
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,710
An we d'fear they miss'd us entire
an' swung away t'Ireland.

31
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,510
If that happens you'll have nothing
to see you through winter.

32
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,360
~ An' we'll starve.
~ Simple as that.

33
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,740
Let's hope it won't come to that.

34
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,430
I'm not a magician, sir! I cannot
conjure wages out of thin air!

35
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,480
The men must wait.

36
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,230
~ Did my father send you?
~ Why would he?

37
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,470
Read me the riot act, tell
me what I'm doing wrong?

38
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,870
Or was it my wife?

39
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,870
Does she think I'm falling
short of the mark?

40
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,470
Is she wrong to be concerned?

41
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,640
~ What she doesn't know, won't hurt her.
~ What she suspects, might.

42
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,830
Gaming? Whoring? What gentleman
doesn't occasionally indulge?

43
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,200
~ This one.
~ Since when?
~ Since my wedding.

44
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,270
'Your kitchen maid?'

45
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,120
But, Ross, surely you must see...

46
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,390
With such a wife you cannot hope

47
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,710
to have entry into any
respectable gathering.

48
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,790
You will cut yourself out of
society, consign yourself to...

49
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,270
A life of peace and seclusion?

50
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,550
I must try to bear it as best I can.

51
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,800
May I leave you to share the
glad tidings at Trenwith?

52
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,190
Demelza?

53
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,270
Damn me, he's done it now!

54
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,060
What the devil can he mean by it?

55
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,270
I never thought you
the marrying kind.

56
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,750
Is she wealthy?

57
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,150
~ Not at all.
~ 'Could've had his pick.'

58
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,990
Any number of eligible girls
from rising families.

59
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,510
Instead of which... he
marries his serving wench.

60
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,910
~ It beggars belief.
~ It may beggar him.

61
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,190
He must be deranged.

62
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,710
How else could he lower
his sights so abominably?

63
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,550
Is she beautiful?

64
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,630
In a way.

65
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,870
In spite of our assets, we Warleggans
struggle to pass muster.

66
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,870
How will he fare with a
scullery maid on his arm?

67
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,550
'His family with never forgive him.'

68
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,270
Society will never forgive him.

69
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,870
'Doors which were open will
be slammed in his face.'

70
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,470
His ventures will fail...

71
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,670
and you can enjoy the sight of him
in the gutter along with his slut.

72
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,270
So you love her?

73
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,120
We get on.

74
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,350
"My dear Ross, I am the last person
to criticise your attachment.

75
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,310
"But I would like to be the first
to write to you and wish you joy..."

76
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,710
".. I am presently taken
up with tending Father

77
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,870
"but I hope soon to call to offer
my felicitations in person."

78
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,550
There. We have at least one friend.

79
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,390
"Callin'"? Who 'as time to call?

80
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,230
What they mean by it - "callin'".

81
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,680
Callin'.

82
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,840
What?

83
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,110
'Ee bin givin' me squinny-eye ever
since I got back from church.

84
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,550
'Ow else we mun look? We don't
rightly know 'oo we lookin' at!

85
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,390
One minute she Miss Skivvily-
Scullery-Kitchen-Maid,

86
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,990
the next she be Mistress
'Igh n' Mighty!

87
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,070
Do 'ee think it's not as strange
to me as it is to you?

88
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,550
Do 'ee imagine I ever looked
for or 'spected it?

89
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,710
~ Come to think of it, 'tis
more your fault than mine!
~ 'Ow be that, then?

90
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,110
'Tis you 'ave raised me up
an' taught me all I know.

91
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,670
So if I'm fit for better
than I'd 'oped,

92
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,840
blame 'ee'selves for eddycatin' me!

93
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,110
~ We?
~ Eddycators?

94
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,160
~ We made 'er what she is.
~ She 'ave we a' thank ferrit.

95
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,590
~ She still do all her chores.
~ An' most o' yourn.
~ An' 'tis better'n

96
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,080
takin' orders from some fudgy-faced
baggage wi' drop-curls!

97
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,600
Damn this ironstone,
is there no end to it?

98
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,070
How long till we strike copper?

99
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,470
IF we strike copper
- it could be months.

100
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,750
~ Can we last?
~ With good will and good men.

101
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,950
~ And the power of luck beside.
~ We'll need a rise in the price of ore.

102
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,670
Else we're all wastin' our time.

103
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,630
~ This shareholders meetin'...
~ Not a prospect I relish.

104
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,030
We're no closer to copper, so I
must appeal for further investment

105
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,190
if we're to keep blasting.

106
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,670
But - are they not friends o' yourn?

107
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,160
If ever they were, they're
reconsidering the connection.

108
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,640
I would that I had nothing better
to do than admire the view!

109
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,190
They'd happily swap
places with you, sir.

110
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,790
You have means to last the winter.
Without the pilchards, they do not.

111
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,230
Those who cannot feed,
should not breed.

112
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,790
I believe felicitations are in order.

113
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,390
Your son John? Recently wed.

114
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,230
To Miss Ruth Teague.
A determined girl.

115
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,270
~ My best wishes to them both.
~ But are we not remiss

116
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,230
overlooking the presence of
a bridegroom in our midst?

117
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,110
Oh, yes - indeed, indeed.

118
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,030
Congratulations, Captain Poldark,
you have our best wishes for you

119
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,550
~ and your young bride.
~ I thank you, gentlemen.

120
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,270
Now, if you'll excuse me,

121
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,360
I must consult Captain Henshawe
before our meeting.

122
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,110
I confess myself uneasy.

123
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,150
His early skirmishes with the law,

124
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,750
his contempt of court
at the last assizes...

125
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,150
and now this marriage
to his serving wench.

126
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,630
~ You think him foolish?
~ I think him reckless in the extreme.

127
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,510
Is a man that demonstrates such
spectacular lack of judgment

128
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,470
to be trusted? Is he fit to helm
a venture of such risk as a mine?

129
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,030
More to the point,

130
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,590
am I prepared to trust him
with more of my capital?

131
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,390
I am not, sir.

132
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,270
I can see no reason for pouring
good money after bad.

133
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,070
Come to me when you've struck
copper and I may reconsider.

134
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,920
Till then you'll see no
more of me or my guineas.

135
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,360
The rest of you share his opinion?

136
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,080
I do not.

137
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,040
Nor do I.

138
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,800
Gentlemen, thank you. I'm sorry we
could not bring you better reports.

139
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,590
You got the candles an' twine?
An' muslin for the cheese?

140
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,120
Open it.

141
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,270
A book for you.

142
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,470
To practise your letters.

143
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,520
And ribbons to tie
up that unruly mane.

144
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,870
I know little of these things.

145
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,020
If they don't suit,
give them to Prudie.

146
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,470
~ Did I mention I wrote to your father?
~ Oh, Ross, ye never!

147
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,150
He'll be that vexed, thinkin'
I'm never comin' 'ome.

148
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,070
I told him your duty lay here.

149
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,590
So it do, Ross. Nothin's changed.

150
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,350
Nothing?

151
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,750
I d'get less sleep!

152
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,030
~ That's your only complaint?
~ I 'ave no complaints.

153
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,510
I do, however.

154
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,990
~ Tell me.
~ You have yet to make an
official visit to the mine.

155
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,750
~ Oh, no, Ross - I couldn't.
'Ow would it look?
~ "Look"?

156
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,550
~ A kitchen maid givin' 'erself airs.
~ I see no kitchen maid.

157
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,910
I see a wife whose duty is to take
an interest in her husband's work.

158
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,640
~ I do take an interest!
~ Excellent. First thing tomorrow, then.

159
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,910
Harder, dammit. Push harder.

160
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,110
Is this wise, sir? Can Grambler
not wait till you're stronger?

161
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,950
~ Dr Choake ordered bed-rest.
~ Dr Choake doesn't have a failing mine

162
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,390
or a son who's neither
use nor ornament!

163
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,750
I'm touched by your faith, Father.

164
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,910
Not sufficiently touched to behave
like a man and the heir of Trenwith?

165
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,480
~ Father!
~ Father!

166
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,230
I never knew such ironstone.
It's impenetrable.

167
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,870
Our luck has deserted us.

168
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,630
Let's 'ope the pilchards
don't do likewise.

169
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,680
Mining and fishing is our lifeblood.
Surely both won't fail.

170
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,670
Captain Henshawe, you
know my wife Demelza?

171
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,790
~ A pleasure to see you, ma'am.
~ G'day to 'ee, sir.

172
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,070
~ No sight 'o th' shoals yet.
~ Demelza's of mining stock herself.

173
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,110
Her father's a tributer at Illuggan.

174
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,150
Perhaps you'd like him
to join us here, ma'am?

175
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,000
I'd as lief stick a fork in my eye!

176
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,480
Um...we d'get on better
from a distance, sir.

177
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,950
I must be gettin' back.

178
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,600
~ The pies'll be burnin'.
~ Right.

179
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,420
We hope to see you here often, ma'am.

180
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,910
~ I was that worried I'd show 'ee up!
~ Why would you?

181
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,710
~ I've no notion how to be.
~ As you are.

182
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,390
~ What am I?
~ A lady.
~ I'm not - an' I don't know 'ow.

183
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,590
You're a quick learner.

184
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,710
Nay, Ross, I came a'day at your behest,
but I shan't venture again.

185
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:36,150
Miners are my own kind - but I'd
not be so kindly received by yours.

186
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,790
Judas! I'll fetch
'im such a doostin'!

187
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,430
~ Demelza!
~ Oi! Guts!
~ Demelza!

188
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,910
Get back 'ere, you
good-fer-nothin' viper!

189
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,560
Thievin', connivin'...

190
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,070
'Alf a morn I labour'd
at that pie, y'lizard!

191
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,550
~ Demelza, leave him be!
~ Think to fox me, would 'ee?

192
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,070
'Ee'll 'ave to be quicker 'n that!

193
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,790
Damn me if a man can't take
a fair morsel now 'n then.

194
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,390
~ I told you to stop. Did you not hear me?
~ Yes, but...

195
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,790
I cannot have my wife wrestling
a manservant. It's unbecoming.

196
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,430
No, Ross.

197
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,820
I see it is not dignified.

198
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,600
~ I'll remember next time.
~ There'll be no next time.

199
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,630
There's only one way to remind
you you're no longer a servant.

200
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,750
~ But you'll do all th' arrangin'?
~ I will not.

201
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,470
You are mistress of Nampara. It's
for you to engage your own servants.

202
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,080
I'll serve 'ee gladly, ma'am.
When shall 'ee want me?

203
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,280
~ Tomorrow'd be quite convenient.
~ Yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.

204
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,510
'She curtsey'd to me.'

205
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,760
Get used to it.

206
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,070
~ No, I never will.
~ I must visit my uncle.

207
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,790
~ Perhaps it's time for you to come with me.
~ No...

208
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,590
No, I cud'n't. There's
calves t'be meated,

209
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,760
~ an' pastry t'make...
~ From tomorrow, that excuse won't avail you!

210
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,830
How does the patient fare?

211
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,270
Lucky to have any blood left.

212
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,470
Progress is excellent.

213
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,270
If he continues with my treatment,

214
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,910
he can expect to eat a
hearty Christmas dinner!

215
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,150
But how will you manage, Ross,

216
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,830
without a kitchen-maid?

217
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,590
My wife has, this very
day, engaged another.

218
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,030
The cheek of the devil!

219
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,150
But your father was no different!

220
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,550
The Nampara Poldarks were renowned
for their disregard of convention.

221
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,400
Good day to you.

222
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,110
We're so delighted by the news, Ross.

223
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,830
~ Francis, especially, was
quick to see the advantage!
~ Father.

224
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,550
~ Of what?
~ A wife to divert you!

225
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,150
He feels it marginally less
likely that you'll ride over

226
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,950
and steal Elizabeth from him!

227
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,790
Father!

228
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,510
Compose yourself.

229
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,030
My heart! My heart!

230
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,200
~ Fetch the doctor.
~ Damn Choake promised me Christmas dinner!

231
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,900
He's asked to see you.

232
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,190
I've lost all faith

233
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,510
in this world of ours...

234
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,470
.. and my legacy.

235
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,200
~ We both know Francis is not the man you are.
~ Uncle...

236
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,630
Look after him for me.

237
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,920
~ Of course.
~ And our family.

238
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,020
And our good name.

239
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
You have my word.

240
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,630
He'll be missed.

241
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,320
Not by me.

242
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,180
Is it terrible to feel
nothing but relief?

243
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,190
~ Nothing I ever did pleased him.
~ Not even your choice of wife?

244
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,240
He always said she would make
a fine mistress of Trenwith.

245
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,420
And I, an indifferent master.

246
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,230
~ You can still prove him wrong.
~ Now I've come into my estate?

247
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Half of it's mortgaged, the
other half soon will be.

248
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,070
But apparently now...

249
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,820
I'm one of the most important
men in the county.

250
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,350
How is it 'ee be not at the buryin'?

251
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,630
'Tis for fancy folks an' family
- not for the likes of me.

252
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,720
Are ye not family?

253
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,790
Ross might say so.

254
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,830
But I know 'tis not my place.

255
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,790
What is your place?

256
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,910
Betwixt an' between.

257
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,230
Neither one nor t'other.

258
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,550
You need more flour,
stops it from sticking.

259
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,200
See?

260
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,390
I warned Charles. Too many
capons and custards.

261
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,750
Look at me - poached
egg, a little broth -

262
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,920
fit as a fiddle!

263
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,430
Fitter than Francis
by the look of it.

264
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,350
Grambler must be taking its toll.

265
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,430
Not to mention a young morsel
by the name of Margaret.

266
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,590
Have you dined there yourself lately?

267
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,280
My tastes are more
refined these days.

268
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,990
Are you not coming down?

269
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,470
I really cannot face it.

270
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,800
Nor I, but one of us
must play the hostess.

271
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,510
She didn't come.

272
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,350
His wife.

273
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,670
This isn't the occasion.

274
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,680
~ Will you give him my good wishes?
~ Shouldn't you do that yourself?

275
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,560
I wouldn't know where to begin.

276
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,470
"Unwell"? And not even the thought
of a tete-a-tete with Ross

277
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,430
~ could persuade her?
~ Francis...

278
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,520
She'll have few opportunities with
Mistress Poldark to amuse him.

279
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,430
~ You must be relieved.
~ How?

280
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,470
You're not the only one
to disgrace the family

281
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,030
~ by an unsuitable attachment.
~ Francis!

282
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,190
Consider yourself fortunate.
See what you've missed.

283
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,560
~ Dr Choake.
~ Mm? Mm.

284
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,310
I've puzzled you out.

285
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,390
Was I so hard to fathom?

286
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,190
Well, I thought so, but your recent
nuptials have made everything clear.

287
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,590
It delights you to thumb
your nose at society,

288
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,710
because you consider yourself above
the niceties by which it operates.

289
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,840
Not above. Just indifferent.

290
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,270
~ Are you pleased with Wheal Leisure?
~ Pray do not mention it to me.

291
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,230
Mining's always a gamble.

292
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,470
And the gamester rarely
meets a Good Samaritan.

293
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,310
As in?

294
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,270
Oh, someone willing to take
a worthless bet off his hands.

295
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,870
But should I hear of anyone,

296
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,190
would you be interested?

297
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,390
What have I told you?

298
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,870
I don't require my wife
to crochet and sip tea,

299
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,080
but I do require her to remember
she's not a beast of burden.

300
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,630
~ Are you happy?
~ I am.
~ Then I hope you'll be even more so

301
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,620
when I tell you who's coming to stay.

302
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,360
Come on through.

303
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,390
It's so kind of you
to invite me, my dear.

304
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,990
Would you care for some refreshment?

305
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,310
Oh, no, please! Let me
take care of myself.

306
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,390
~ The last thing I want is
to give you any trouble.
~ No trouble at all.

307
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,710
We've been looking forward to
your visit. Haven't we, Demelza?

308
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,840
Yes, Ross.

309
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,150
It's a quiet house since father died.

310
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,950
Though Elizabeth plays the harp and
speaks French to Geoffrey Charles.

311
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,710
And I have my needlework.
Aunt Agatha her spinning.

312
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,120
~ And Francis?
~ Is...

313
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,940
.. often away.

314
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,350
This pie is delicious, my dear.
Did you bake it yourself?

315
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,680
Custard! I'll go an' see if it's set.

316
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,990
She thinks you a great
lady who will show me

317
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,630
~ what a mistake I made in marrying her.
~ What can I do?

318
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,230
I'm sure you'll think of something.

319
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,470
Ross! No! Where are you going?

320
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,880
You cannot just - Ross!

321
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,440
~ Blasted copper. It's
proving a devil to find.
~ Blasting is the word.

322
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,820
It seems to be our only hope.

323
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,480
Right, boys.

324
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,030
~ Some tea?
~ Oh! Thank you!

325
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,640
But no. It's a little early.

326
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,560
Oh. Yes, so it is.

327
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,510
Thank you, Jinny.

328
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,080
You know, Ross is very dear to me.

329
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,350
What woman should ever deserve
him, I couldn't imagine.

330
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,120
~ So when I heard he'd married you, I was...
~ Horrified.
~ .. relieved.

331
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,240
Before he met you he was...

332
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,270
.. broken. Lost.

333
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,630
So I was relieved to think he'd
found someone to console him,

334
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,440
to save him from his loneliness.

335
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,640
But now I see it's
more than consolation.

336
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,460
You've given him hope.

337
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,600
A life without hope is bleak.

338
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,150
~ And a life without love...
~ Oh, 'tis not that.

339
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,230
~ You do not...?
~ Love 'im?

340
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,120
Beyond anythin'.

341
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,910
But...

342
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,900
I could never hope that... that he...

343
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,470
That he would ever...

344
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,630
He's kind to me.

345
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,710
And when we're abed...

346
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,310
I 'ave reason to think
I do please 'im.

347
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,600
Oh, I'm sure you do.

348
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,190
But I'd never call it love.

349
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,180
Ee's never used that word t'me and...

350
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,380
I misdoubt 'ee ever shall.

351
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,200
It's life's greatest
treasure to love.

352
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,760
And be loved in return.

353
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,670
My dear, do you think I care
a jot where you come from,

354
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,120
or who your father is,
or how well you curtsey?

355
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,710
I of'en wished I could curtsey.

356
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,100
Will you teach me, Verity?

357
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,230
The left, left, left!

358
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,750
Well, make up yer blasted
blatherin' minds!

359
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,350
What in God's name are you doing?

360
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,510
We thought we should
move it into the parlour

361
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,630
so Demelza may learn to dance.

362
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,480
If you ladies would give us leave?

363
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,870
Dip. One, two, three...

364
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,270
Dip.

365
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,230
Dip. One, two, three.

366
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,670
On your tip-toes.

367
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,600
One, two, three. Dip...

368
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,360
Foot behind.

369
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,840
One, two, three. Step.

370
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,790
Slowly...

371
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,240
And dip... One, two, three.

372
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,750
That man who used
to meet Verity here?

373
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,590
~ Captain Blamey?
~ Has nothin' bin heard of 'im?

374
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,430
Thankfully, no.

375
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,190
~ Oh, Ross, the shame on you!
~ What do you mean?

376
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,390
~ How could you let 'em part like that?
~ What the devil could I do?

377
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,550
You should've stood up t'yer uncle.

378
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,830
Even now in 'er heart she
still hankers for 'im.

379
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,880
Then she must stop.

380
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,120
Why should she?

381
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,390
Must hope be buried?

382
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,270
An' love denied?

383
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,190
What do you know of love?

384
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,840
~ A little.
~ Is that all?

385
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,670
Then you must practice more.

386
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,830
Must you go home tomorrow?

387
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,510
Francis needs me.

388
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,950
But I'll come again soon.

389
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,230
~ Did you really hate it today?
~ Oh, no!

390
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,550
I'm just afeared we spent too much
money and 'twill all be wasted.

391
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,870
~ How could it?
~ Only that...

392
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,820
p'raps my measuring might
not be the same for long.

393
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,590
My dear, do you mean...?

394
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,190
~ Oh, Ross will be delighted!
~ Don' tell 'im! Not yet. See..

395
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,190
ee's not liked me fer long.

396
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,670
And when I get to waddlin'
about like an old duck,

397
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,120
~ he might forget he ever liked me at all.
~ Ross forgets nothing.

398
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,580
If we are to find copper
it's now or not at all.

399
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,470
Come to watch us set our final fuse?

400
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,230
Will one more blast get us through?

401
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,150
One more blast is all we can afford.

402
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,230
~ I heard the bell! What's amiss?
~ We must leave at once.

403
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,750
Quickly!

404
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,710
~ What is it?
~ Nothin', sir.

405
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,280
Ross. Just...

406
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,630
~ What's the matter?
~ Sometimes...

407
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,200
I d'think I displease you.

408
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,310
I'm used to giving orders and having
no-one to suit but myself,

409
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,750
but you are far from
displeasing to me.

410
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,710
~ See, how would I know that?
~ I'll endeavour to make it clearer.

411
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,960
We must go. Make haste!

412
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,800
Where are we going?

413
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,590
~ Good catch, eh, Mark?
~ 'Andsome, Ross.

414
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,470
More than a quarter of a million,
they reckon, afore they're done.

415
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,630
I'm very glad. It'll make
the difference this winter.

416
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,950
~ 'Twill indeed! Night, Ross. Night, ma'am.
~ Night, Mark.

417
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,340
Night, Ross. Night, ma'am.

418
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,440
~ Night, Ross. Night, ma'am.
~ Night.

419
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,380
Everyone's happy tonight.

420
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,110
They like you.

421
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,360
~ Nonsense.
~ 'Tis the truth. I should
know - I'm one of 'em.

422
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,790
You're a gent.

423
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,550
You don't despise 'em, you help 'em.

424
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,030
You give 'em food, an' work, an...

425
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,190
~ Marry you.
~ No, not that.

426
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,550
They don' know what t'make o'that.

427
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,270
But they like you jus' the same.

428
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,150
And you?

429
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,000
Do you like me?

430
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,150
I could learn to.

431
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,200
And I, you.

432
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,910
We're still not through.

433
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,400
~ I could swear we're almost there.
~ But we're out of gunpowder.

434
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,910
Capital. Investors. How
long can we continue?

435
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,750
An optimist would
say... three months?

436
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,910
~ And a realist?
~ Two.

437
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,430
I must find more investment.

438
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:22,190
It gives me no pleasure to tell
you this, but capital's short.

439
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,350
~ I understand.
~ Though I've kept my ear to the ground...

440
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,750
~ in case other speculators could be found.
~ And?

441
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,670
Tom Choake has done
you no favours, Ross.

442
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,670
~ His views on your marriage...
~ "Ross Poldark, the loose cannon.

443
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,000
"Too much of a risk for
the prudent investor."

444
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,150
~ I blame myself.
~ You couldn't foresee as we'd 'it such rock.

445
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,790
But I could foresee that
in marrying my kitchen maid,

446
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,870
I'd scandalise all I might
look to for capital.

447
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,270
Well, short of jilting her
and wedding a rich heiress...

448
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,390
Perhaps I was over-hasty.

449
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,630
But it's done now.

450
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,830
So how shall we order things?

451
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,670
We can last till the
week before Christmas.

452
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,990
Let it be the week after.

453
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,880
If I have to sell half my house,
I'll not ruin Christmas for them.

454
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,350
? The boar's head in my hand bear I

455
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,070
? Bedeck'd with bay and rosemary

456
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,630
? So pray my masters, be merree

457
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,230
? Quod estes in convivio

458
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,910
? Caput apri defero

459
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,590
? Redens laudes Domino

460
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,070
? Caput apri defero

461
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,590
? Redens laudes Domino

462
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,110
? Caput apri defero

463
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,590
? Redens laudes Domino

464
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,990
? Caput apri defero

465
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,440
? Redens laudes Domino... ?

466
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,950
From Francis.

467
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,990
Inviting us to spend
Christmas at Trenwith.

468
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,240
Oh.

469
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,540
What's the matter?

470
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,910
I-I couldn't.

471
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,910
You go.

472
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,790
Naturally, we both
go or we both stay.

473
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,910
Ross, I aren't their sort.

474
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,870
They'll look down their noses and
send me t'eat wi' th' servants.

475
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,510
Do you think I ought
to be ashamed of you?

476
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,630
~ 'Tis not that but...
~ You think they are so much better than you?

477
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,470
I don't, but...

478
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,550
they'll think so.

479
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,870
Mebbe not Verity, but...

480
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,280
Elizabeth.

481
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,070
You do her an injustice.

482
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,270
~ And me.
~ You?

483
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,350
To think I could admire someone
who thought meanly of you.

484
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,190
Do you admire her?

485
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,190
Elizabeth was born to be admired.

486
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,840
An' I was born to pull turnips.

487
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,640
~ What you doin'?
~ Accepting the invitation.

488
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,430
What a sorry Christmas
I've handed them.

489
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,430
No. You've handed them near-on
twelve month o' work

490
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,880
they'd otherwise not 'ave.

491
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,440
Welcome.

492
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,230
My dear, it's so good
of you to come to us.

493
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,080
May I take you to meet Aunt Agatha?

494
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,310
Married, you say? To my nephew?
Why wasn't I told of this?

495
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,230
You were, Aunt. I told you myself.

496
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,070
They never tell me anything.

497
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,520
And you, where are you from?

498
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,430
'Luggan, ma'am.

499
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,080
Who do we know from Illuggan?

500
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,710
The Cardews?

501
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,800
You'll know Sir John, of course.
And the Perrins of Helston Hall?

502
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,430
No, no, ma'am.

503
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,670
Six generations of
Poldarks I've seen.

504
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,830
Now what do you think of that?

505
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,830
You think I don't look old
enough? Quite right, too.

506
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,670
Now, you go and sit by Elizabeth so
that I can see how you measure up.

507
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,880
~ Aunt Agatha.
~ Go on, child. Go. Off you go.

508
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,150
Hmm.

509
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,590
Pretty little thing.

510
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,990
A mite coarse beside Elizabeth

511
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,590
but doubtless she'll
polish up sufficient

512
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,880
when the need arises.

513
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,590
'I thought she'd hate me.'

514
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,750
I wouldn't blame 'er. I mean,
I probably should in 'er shoes.

515
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,400
Then you've less sense
than I credit you with.

516
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,920
You think I don't know
what you're about?

517
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,110
~ Taking her under your wing,
making her your friend.
~ Francis...

518
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,830
"Oh, Ross, see how kind
and generous I am!

519
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,790
"Look, what a pearl you've lost!"

520
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,840
~ You're being ridiculous.
~ Am I?

521
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,270
~ What's this?
~ Jus' something I ordered from town.

522
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,430
No, Ross! It's meant as a surprise!

523
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,150
It's just a family party.

524
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,790
No need to flig yourself up for it.

525
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,710
I asked Verity and she said it was
right t'change fer Christmas Eve.

526
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,270
Well, don't lace your stays too
tight - they feed you well here,

527
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,660
and I know your appetite.

528
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,270
You were very kind to Demelza.

529
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,870
Who wouldn't be? She looks
like a startled faun.

530
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,480
She's young. And this must
seem very daunting to her.

531
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,800
You don't despise my choice, then?

532
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,030
What right have I to despise anyone?

533
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,380
Besides, I've too much
to distract me here.

534
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,440
Grambler failing and Francis
gambling away his inheritance.

535
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,800
~ I'm sad to hear it.
~ Oh, and worse!

536
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,430
Rumours...

537
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,390
no, reports...

538
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,780
that he has another woman.

539
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,620
Has he?

540
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,500
If he has, he's an idiot.

541
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,750
I am ravenous! When do we dine?

542
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,230
'I can scarce stand up.'

543
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,710
Lord knows how I'll
keep my food down.

544
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,200
And then they'll think that
I'm that vulgar and simple...

545
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,070
Ross will be sorry he ever wed me.

546
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,230
Here, let me help you.

547
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,820
I shan't lace you too tightly.

548
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,780
Thank you.

549
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,000
Trust your husband. And yourself.

550
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,360
Visitors? At this hour?

551
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,790
Mm.

552
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,590
We were just passing, Francis.

553
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,670
Thought we'd come and offer
the compliments of the season.

554
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,270
If we're intruding,
we can easily depart.

555
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,790
Oh, damn me nostrils, though!

556
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,230
What do I scent?

557
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,550
Swan? Partridge?

558
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,710
Mrs Tabb, please lay four
more places for dinner.

559
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,710
Ross Poldark, the famed recluse!

560
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,430
For all we see of you, you
might be Robinson Crusoe.

561
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,350
Oh, but he has his Man Friday, dear.

562
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,270
Is she hereabout?

563
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,320
Or should we seek
her in the scullery?

564
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,150
An attempt on the King's life?

565
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,190
Ambushed for his waistcoat, no doubt.

566
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,670
I'm told it's worth more than
half the mines in Cornwall.

567
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,750
And the Royal Household servants
not paid for 12 months.

568
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,270
I'm amazed no-one's attempted
to sharpen a knife

569
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,670
on the King of France.

570
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,670
Give them time, sir. Give them time.

571
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,260
~ Dinner is served.
~ Excellent!

572
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,660
Demelza...

573
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,470
Let me introduce you.

574
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,670
Damn you, Ross, for keeping
this rosebud a secret.

575
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,030
Hardly secret, John.

576
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,310
All the county was talking
of her in June.

577
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,310
Yes, ma'am. People dearly
love to gossip, don't they?

578
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,590
Ha! Well answered, mistress.

579
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,870
A merry Christmas, and
damnation to all gossip.

580
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,390
~ She's on her mettle tonight.
~ Overdoing the manners a bit.

581
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,190
Look at her plate. She's
hardly touched a morsel.

582
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,230
Too busy making conquests.

583
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,430
What news of the mine, Ross?
Are we swimming in copper yet.

584
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,150
~ Not according to my father.
~ We have reason for optimism.

585
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,520
Glad to hear it, Ross. At least
one of us is prospering.

586
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,470
~ You believe him?
~ Each way, we win.

587
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,020
Enjoy his ruin, or the
fruits of his labours.

588
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,910
Our friend Choake saw
the wisdom of my offer

589
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,060
and sold me his shares
in Wheal Leisure.

590
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,150
How do you manage for
servants, Elizabeth?

591
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,150
Mama and I were only saying,

592
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,070
young girls these days
have such ideas.

593
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,990
Always trying to rise
above their station.

594
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,950
I haven't noticed that.

595
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,990
Perhaps you've been unlucky.

596
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,230
Well...

597
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,670
at least I have my own household.

598
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,270
My poor sisters all lack husbands.

599
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,840
And truly, beyond the age
of 23, what hope is there?

600
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,940
I don't believe there's ever
cause to give up hope.

601
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,710
'Tis sometimes just
a question of waiting.

602
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,910
And seizing the opportunity
when it comes?

603
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,760
I bow before your expertise, ma'am.

604
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,510
Mistress Poldark, now you
must play something for us.

605
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,830
No, no, I don't...

606
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,430
Not musical, ma'am? Did your
governess not teach you?

607
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,870
~ Demelza sings.
~ Oh? Then we must hear her.

608
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,720
We surely must!

609
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:27,720
? I'd pluck a fair rose for my love

610
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,390
? I'd pluck a red rose blowing

611
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,510
? Love's in my heart

612
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,190
? A-trying so to prove

613
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,800
? What your heart's knowing

614
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:54,750
? I'd pluck a finger on a thorn

615
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:00,470
? I'd pluck a finger bleeding

616
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,070
? Red is my heart

617
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:08,070
? Wounded and forlorn

618
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:12,880
? And your heart needing

619
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:20,470
? I'd hold a finger to my tongue

620
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:25,800
? I'd hold a finger waiting

621
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,150
? My heart is sore

622
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,520
? Until it joins in song

623
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,400
? Wi' your heart mating. ?

624
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,720
Good night.

625
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,910
It's a curious thing.

626
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,280
We envy a man for something he has.

627
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,320
Yet the truth may be, he
hasn't got it after all.

628
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,200
And we have.

629
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,310
Am I rambling?

630
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,900
Ignore me.

631
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,630
Merry Christmas, cousin.

632
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,800
Merry Christmas.

633
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,940
Merry Christmas, my love.

634
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,320
~ Thank you, Francis.
~ Merry Christmas.
~ Merry Christmas.

635
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,240
That wasn't so bad.

636
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,470
I hope you won't live to regret
your choice of husband.

637
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,120
~ Why would I?
~ We may soon be destitute.

638
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,680
There are other kinds of treasure.

639
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,160
What is it? A rock fall?

640
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,710
What happened?

641
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,360
Copper! Copper's been struck.
A monstrous load.

642
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,220
There's masses of copper!

643
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,110
So, how did I do, Ross?

644
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,760
You were not too ashamed of me?

645
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,440
Why do you think I married you?

646
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,150
I don't rightly know.

647
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,280
To satisfy an appetite?

648
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,270
To save myself from being alone?

649
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,020
Because it was the right thing to do?

650
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,110
I had few expectations.

651
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,830
At best, you'd be a distraction.

652
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,420
A bandage to ease a wound.

653
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,280
But I was mistaken.

654
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,760
You've redeemed me.

655
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,340
I am your humble servant.

656
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,400
And I love you.

657
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,600
I hope you will have
a little love to spare.

658
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,510
For what?

659
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,340
Our child.

660
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,310
Did you hear of the
riots in Launceston?

661
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,750
People can only starve for so
long while the rich get fat.

662
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,510
My shares in Wheal Leisure... You
must take that as a compliment.

663
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,150
~ What of the other shareholders?
~ Two or three more wish to sell.

664
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,750
This is Dwight Enys. I have him
to thank for patching me up.

665
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,710
For months now, Grambler
has been failing.

666
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,510
She means Francis has been failing,

667
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,390
~ You barely know her.
~ Maybe so, Ross.

668
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,430
But truly, she's my heart's desire.

669
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,830
~ My name is Poldark.
~ Did Verity send you?

670
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,270
May I see her? How? When?

671
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,030
My husband's against me, stirring
up what should be left alone.

672
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,160
Some obstacles cannot be overcome.

673
00:57:53,305 --> 00:58:53,889

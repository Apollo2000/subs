2
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,341
"Tis in the blood, your
father would say.'

3
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:20,501
Mining, 'tis is in the blood.

4
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:24,321
'Like a vein of copper.

5
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:27,341
"Tis the bread of life.

6
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,941
'Eat, sleep, live and breathe it.

7
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:40,341
'She's your salvation...

8
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:42,761
'.. and your downfall.'

9
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:45,541
My Lord!

10
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:48,761
My Lord Basset!

11
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:53,141
'Make you reckless, make you bold...'

12
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:58,811
It isn't right,

13
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:00,861
this is all we have.

14
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:03,291
Many a friend did break

15
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:05,131
and many more will follow.

16
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:07,691
My Lord Basset!

17
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:10,411
There are bailiffs at Wheal Reath.

18
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:14,771
"Tis a fool's game...'

19
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:15,931
You can't do this!

20
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:17,091
Back!

21
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:19,131
'..it will end in tears.'

22
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,651
I admire your optimism.

23
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:23,771
Your father died afore his time.

24
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:25,361
In his bed.

25
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:28,331
It was mining did for him.

26
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,051
My Lord Basset!

27
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:32,611
'And he won't be the last neither.'

28
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:35,051
And if he were here today,

29
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:37,811
he'd tell you to not to
make the same mistake.

30
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:39,331
I wonder.

31
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:52,971
Judas, it's cold!

32
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:55,261
Argh! It's freezing!

33
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:03,891
Satisfied?

34
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:05,331
Shouldn't I be?

35
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:07,411
It ain't enough not a' stink.

36
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:11,381
A body must scrub herself raw as a
buttock of beef to please some folk!

37
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:21,931
What happened?

38
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:23,811
'Tis the mine, Ross.

39
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,011
They closed it.

40
00:03:26,061 --> 00:03:28,261
They closed Wheal Reath.

41
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:29,611
Is it true,

42
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:31,211
about Lord Basset?

43
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:32,491
It would appear so.

44
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,251
Will we be blamed?

45
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:36,011
Did we furnish the pistol?

46
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:38,211
~ We called in his loans.
~ No,

47
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,601
we declined to extend them.

48
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:44,291
Does it not reflect poorly on us,

49
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:46,811
that we let his pleas
fall upon deaf ears?

50
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:50,161
Are we in the business
of sentiment or profit?

51
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,451
Will I be going now, Mr George?

52
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,051
Have you been dismissed?

53
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:59,971
No, but happen I have
other engagements.

54
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:01,851
None that reward you so well.

55
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,731
Return to my chamber.

56
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:06,611
And... in future,

57
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:09,061
you will address me as "sir".

58
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:11,171
Yes, sir.

59
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:20,061
These ancient families lack backbone.

60
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:23,651
I wonder they survive.

61
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:27,531
Why would they close it?

62
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:30,661
Believe me, this is the bank's
doing, not the owner's. Here.

63
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:34,891
It's now Grambler who has the
only mine left hereabouts.

64
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,451
Is my uncle taking on men?

65
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:39,571
Even if he were, my breathin'...

66
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:42,561
You'd welcome a few
months above grass?

67
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:48,371
I need to work, Ross, or...

68
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,931
my mother and sisters will starve.

69
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:53,121
Can you use a farmhand?

70
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,331
So, now we be home to all the
waifs and strays in the county?

71
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,541
Rags n' tatters of Wheal Reath
and their begging bowls!

72
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:26,691
Ross!

73
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:28,811
You still here, boy?

74
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:30,571
When do you leave for London?

75
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:32,811
I'm minded to stay

76
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:35,061
and take my chances here.

77
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:38,091
As I expected.

78
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:40,531
Stubborn as your father!

79
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:42,721
Little good it did him.

80
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:45,291
Well, I fancy you'll do better.

81
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:47,481
Better than his cousin?

82
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:51,411
You heard about Wheal Reath?

83
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:53,131
And the owner.

84
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,741
Lord Basset shot himself.

85
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:58,211
Bad business.

86
00:06:58,261 --> 00:06:59,731
Very bad.

87
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:04,051
Does Grambler have loans
with the Warleggans?

88
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:06,331
Everyone has loans
with the Warleggans.

89
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:07,411
That doesn't alarm you?

90
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,201
George is like a brother to Francis.

91
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:13,611
You must visit me soon, Verity.

92
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:15,931
And neglect her duties here?

93
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:18,651
She has no time for gadding about.

94
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:20,601
Well...

95
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,541
.. I trust you've learnt
one lesson today?

96
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:29,141
The hazards of owning a mine.

97
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:02,441
Feeling tired, my dear?

98
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,651
A little.

99
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:08,211
Perhaps I should rest a while.

100
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:11,621
Shall I join you?

101
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,061
Oh, you blatherin' idiot!

102
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:01,731
Poldark, we have orders to take you
to Bodmin Jail for inciting a riot!

103
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,131
You have a new farmhand.

104
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:07,771
'Tis a fine thing you done for Jim.

105
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:10,131
Happen you could do
the same thing for we,

106
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:11,571
below ground?

107
00:09:11,621 --> 00:09:13,691
You have pitches already,
at Grambler.

108
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:17,411
Ah, where it please your uncle
to pay us starvation wages.

109
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:19,651
The owners have we
by the throat, Ross.

110
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:21,901
We can't go on like this.

111
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:24,851
I can promise nothing.

112
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,121
Ah.

113
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:11,371
Father tells me you intend to remain.

114
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:13,331
Does that disappoint you?

115
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:14,921
Not at all.

116
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:19,291
We were always more
friends than cousins.

117
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:21,941
I would be sorry if that changed.

118
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:27,091
I've been wondering if this
mine was entirely worked out.

119
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:28,691
You don't think of reopening her?

120
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:31,291
I'll think of anything that
might help those poor devils

121
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:32,411
at Wheal Reath.

122
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:34,851
You consider them
your responsibility?

123
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,531
You don't?

124
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:39,171
My father doesn't trust
me with responsibility.

125
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,971
He likes to keep the mysteries
of mine-owning to himself.

126
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:46,021
Perhaps we should open
Leisure together.

127
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:51,561
Share the burden and the spoils.

128
00:10:57,781 --> 00:10:59,811
What are you doing?

129
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:03,131
This is no task for you.
Let me or Mrs Tabb...

130
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:05,011
What may I do, then?

131
00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:07,171
There is much you may do, Elizabeth.

132
00:11:07,221 --> 00:11:09,491
You are the lady of the house.

133
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:14,221
You may go out when you choose,
pay calls, attend balls...

134
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:18,811
And may you not?

135
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:21,371
I'm 25. Unmarried.

136
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:25,171
I spin and I bake, pick preserves,

137
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:28,651
I dose the servants with
possets when they're ill.

138
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:31,021
My life is not your life.

139
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:42,531
Suppose I wished to open a mine?

140
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:45,131
I'd suppose you'd taken
leave of your senses.

141
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:47,131
What in the least would I require?

142
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:48,611
~ Capital?
~ I have none.

143
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:51,011
~ Expertise?
~ A smattering.

144
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:52,571
Allies?

145
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:55,691
None of means. My cousin
will lend his name.

146
00:11:55,741 --> 00:11:58,261
So, you'd require investors.

147
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:01,331
Can you find me any?

148
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:02,931
In these uncertain times?

149
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:07,331
With no experience, no bona fides
and a reputation somewhat tarnished?

150
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:09,971
Are you speaking as my
banker or my friend?

151
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,291
Both.

152
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:30,011
Good day, my lord.

153
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:32,371
Are we acquainted, ma'am?

154
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:34,211
We could be.

155
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:37,541
I have neither time nor the
money to seek such diversions.

156
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:45,141
What do you seek, milord?

157
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:49,461
Better days ahead, I see.

158
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:52,651
A prosperous business.

159
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:56,001
Perhaps you should try
a different profession.

160
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:00,531
Sweetheart, perhaps?

161
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:03,691
I made the mistake of going to war.

162
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,241
And when you returned, she
was pledged to another.

163
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:10,081
Yet you still care for her.

164
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:13,081
Perhaps she loves you still.

165
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,411
Ross?

166
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:41,801
Verity?

167
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:45,851
You escaped, then?

168
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:48,841
Father's gone to the
mine for an hour.

169
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:52,491
I see you've not been idle!

170
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,681
I needed a distraction.

171
00:13:55,821 --> 00:13:59,101
Demelza! This is my cousin, Verity.

172
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:06,851
Has she settled?

173
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:08,901
Still somewhat feral.

174
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:14,331
Does your wound still pain you?

175
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:16,181
Less than it did.

176
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:24,461
Then I wonder if I might ask
you the greatest of favours?

177
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:51,011
My dear, tonight's assembly,
will you not reconsider?

178
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:54,761
You know how I love to show
off my wife to the world.

179
00:15:08,581 --> 00:15:10,531
Where's he going?

180
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:12,251
To the dance.

181
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,361
He don't look too glad about it.

182
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:18,761
Gentlefolks is strange.

183
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:29,971
I'm obliged to you, Ross.

184
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,651
For vanquishing my
loathing of a gavotte?

185
00:15:32,701 --> 00:15:34,931
For persuading father to let me come.

186
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:37,611
As official escort, I'm
entirely at your service.

187
00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:39,131
Don't be!

188
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:54,331
Look to your liberty, cousin.

189
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:55,971
Is it in danger?

190
00:15:56,021 --> 00:16:00,061
From a great many girls who would be
glad to acquire the name of Poldark!

191
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,531
Those ruffians at Wheal Reath
made a nuisance of themselves.

192
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:16,771
You'd hardly expect them
to celebrate the closure.

193
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:19,691
They have no business to
have an opinion at all!

194
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:22,651
Some would say that view is outdated.

195
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:25,731
In America, for instance, they
have more liberal views.

196
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:27,451
All men created equal?

197
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:31,691
Preposterous! Distinctions
of rank must be preserved.

198
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,841
Especially when they're
so dearly bought.

199
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:41,331
To the Trade!

200
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:45,141
And the Captain Ross, for providing
for our ease and comfort!

201
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:49,501
This be the life!

202
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:59,451
Not dancing, Ross?

203
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:01,531
Will none of the ladies have you?

204
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:04,371
The whiff of soil is
hard to swill off,

205
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:06,051
but if one communes with peasants...

206
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:07,691
Do you prescribe perfume?

207
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:09,931
It covers a multitude of sins!

208
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:11,521
Like money.

209
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:14,571
Indeed!

210
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:17,781
For how else would a family
of blacksmiths become bankers?

211
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:23,691
One of these days,
you may come knocking.

212
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:25,331
I would need to be desperate.

213
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:27,921
I look forward to the prospect.

214
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:41,741
You know that lady?

215
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:55,411
Captain Poldark.

216
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:56,931
Miss Teague.

217
00:17:56,981 --> 00:17:59,051
How do you find your first ball?

218
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:01,641
Exceeding all expectations, sir!

219
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,411
A sea captain? How... invigorating!

220
00:18:09,461 --> 00:18:11,531
One is seldom idle.

221
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:15,741
And so much to remember.
The sails, the masts.

222
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:20,491
~ Are you interested in rigging, ma'am?
~ Oh, exceedingly!

223
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,251
Are you fond of dancing,
Captain Poldark?

224
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:27,861
I fear I possess few of the
refinements of polite society.

225
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:51,051
~ Ross Poldark!
~ Mr Treneglos.

226
00:19:51,101 --> 00:19:54,771
I saw you sniffing round that
old strumpet the other day.

227
00:19:56,221 --> 00:20:00,251
Wheal Leisure? You don't
mean to resurrect her?

228
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:02,771
It would take a brave
man to open a mine now.

229
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:05,651
~ Don't you agree, Henshawe?
~ Depends on the mine.

230
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:09,131
Mr Henshawe? You were mine captain
at Leisure in my father's day?

231
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:10,851
~ I was.
~ You worked her for tin?
~ Aye.

232
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:14,291
But in the last samples taken, there
were definite signs of copper.

233
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:17,641
A pity she closed before
we could dig further.

234
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:21,211
But if you know of anyone
who'd be willing to chance

235
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,931
a little speculation, Mr Pascoe...

236
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,651
I'll see what can be done.

237
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:28,651
I'd require discretion.

238
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:31,041
I fully comprehend you, sir.

239
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:39,171
~ Mizzenmast, you say?
~ Which is part square-rigged
and carries a gaff.

240
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:42,491
~ A gaff?
~ And a spanker boom.
~ So many names!

241
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:49,941
When may I see you again?

242
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:56,381
Oh! Captain Blamey,
that I couldn't say.

243
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,821
Judas!

244
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,331
What 'ee be doin' in there?

245
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:14,171
Jus' lookin'.

246
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:15,891
Jus' lookin'?

247
00:21:16,581 --> 00:21:21,141
There's books, an' maps,
an' knives, an' 'arpicord...

248
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:24,171
Can 'ee read?

249
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:27,211
Can 'ee play?

250
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:28,531
Can try...

251
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:31,171
Be nothin' in there
for the likes of we.

252
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:34,501
~ Unless we be gettin' ideas
above us station? ~ No!

253
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,651
~ Go home.
~ What?

254
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:41,101
Back where 'ee come from.
'Ee don't belong 'ere.

255
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:46,851
Forgive me.

256
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:51,131
I do no wish to appear forward
but I'd dearly like us

257
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:52,931
to be better acquainted.

258
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:54,851
I, too.

259
00:21:54,901 --> 00:21:58,261
I should not have said that!
What must you think of me?

260
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:01,931
Can you be unaware of that, ma'am?

261
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:14,371
Remind me, Captain Poldark, was I
engaged to you for this next dance?

262
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:16,731
Not that I recall.

263
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:18,781
Would you excuse me?

264
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:46,091
Ah, Ross, are you come to
take my wife off my hands?

265
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:48,131
If she's no objection.

266
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:49,971
Did you not promise me this dance?

267
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:51,611
The cotillion.

268
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:55,141
And I dare say Ross will return
you to me in one piece.

269
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:36,371
Your cousin is most attentive.

270
00:23:36,421 --> 00:23:38,531
~ Hm?
~ To your wife.

271
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:41,371
Oh, I don't think he
cares for dancing.

272
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,891
He only came to please Verity.

273
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:47,611
Who is that man?

274
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:50,451
Captain Blamey, master
of the Lisbon packet.

275
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:52,211
A pretty catch.

276
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:55,731
~ And at her age...
~ She won't get many more chances?

277
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:57,731
But Father couldn't spare her.

278
00:23:57,781 --> 00:24:00,011
And Elizabeth would miss her.

279
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:03,621
Though doubtless your wife would
find ways of distracting herself.

280
00:24:53,981 --> 00:24:55,851
Ross.

281
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:58,531
May I introduce Captain
Andrew Blamey?

282
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:02,291
My cousin Ross Poldark, my
sister-in-law, Elizabeth Poldark.

283
00:25:02,341 --> 00:25:03,651
Your servant, ma'am, sir.

284
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:06,411
I hope our boisterous spirits
don't offend you, sir.

285
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:09,621
Not in the least, ma'am. I've
every reason to be happy myself.

286
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,371
If I could dare to hope

287
00:25:16,421 --> 00:25:20,411
that my interest would in the
smallest way be returned.

288
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:23,581
I think you might dare
to hope that, sir.

289
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:27,531
May I speak with your father?

290
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:31,651
You may think me presumptuous
but my attachment is sincere.

291
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:34,451
I would not wish to proceed
without his approval.

292
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:37,501
Forgive me, I must
speak with my cousin.

293
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:42,561
My dear, I believe Francis
is looking for you.

294
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:52,611
~ People love to gossip. ~ Isn't
that why they come to such evenings?

295
00:25:52,661 --> 00:25:55,981
But to give them cause? To make
your attentions so pronounced?

296
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:03,051
Whatever was between you, trust
me, she has put it behind her.

297
00:26:03,101 --> 00:26:04,741
So must you.

298
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:13,931
You'll take supper with us?

299
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:16,321
Thank you. I've no appetite.

300
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:26,411
Miss Verity, I cannot
go to your father

301
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:30,061
without your being in full
possession of the facts.

302
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:36,301
Ross Poldark in love?
Quite the spectacle.

303
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:40,051
Though, may I say,
an excellent choice.

304
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:44,821
Ruth Teague is unlikely to remind
one of a previous attachment.

305
00:27:14,141 --> 00:27:16,211
May I be of service, me lord?

306
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,741
One service is all I require.

307
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,481
You don't say much, me lord.

308
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:37,251
But p'raps you don't pay
me for my conversation.

309
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:38,971
My apologies.

310
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:43,241
I was not in a talkative
mood last night.

311
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:50,421
A rare hand.

312
00:28:52,301 --> 00:28:54,931
Knows what it wants but...

313
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:57,181
not always how to get it.

314
00:30:19,101 --> 00:30:21,171
Is my nephew at home?>

315
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:27,341
Uncle, to what do I owe the pleasure?

316
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:32,561
Opening a mine?

317
00:30:33,661 --> 00:30:35,611
Despite our conversation?

318
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:37,731
Exploring the idea.

319
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:39,531
Stubborn.

320
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:41,251
Rash.

321
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:44,051
~ Won't take no for an answer.
~ Well...

322
00:30:44,101 --> 00:30:46,371
The curse of the Poldarks.

323
00:30:47,821 --> 00:30:52,061
And our salvation! I salute you, boy.

324
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:55,531
Take Francis with you.

325
00:30:55,581 --> 00:30:59,371
He needs to learn some
initiative. When do you meet?

326
00:30:59,421 --> 00:31:02,931
Tomorrow, if Pascoe can
drum up any interest.

327
00:31:02,981 --> 00:31:04,851
Francis will come.

328
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:08,741
He must learn to stand
on his own two feet.

329
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:13,021
~ You must help him.
~ I will, Uncle, of course.

330
00:31:14,421 --> 00:31:17,011
But if you could urge discretion.

331
00:31:17,061 --> 00:31:20,661
Especially with regard
to his good friend George?

332
00:31:24,461 --> 00:31:25,891
He's ready for 'ee, sir.

333
00:31:25,941 --> 00:31:28,451
~ Demelza.
~ Sir?

334
00:31:28,501 --> 00:31:29,811
You look weary to the bone.

335
00:31:29,861 --> 00:31:31,931
Have they been making
you a beast of burden?

336
00:31:31,981 --> 00:31:34,321
No, sir, I be content, sir.

337
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:39,331
~ It be that Jud. 'Ee be sayin'
I got ideas? I an't got ideas!
~ No?

338
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:41,171
I do know me place.

339
00:31:41,221 --> 00:31:43,731
Your place is where I say it is.

340
00:31:43,781 --> 00:31:45,581
Fetch your cloak.

341
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:47,611
Sir?

342
00:31:47,661 --> 00:31:49,601
Never 'ad no cloak.

343
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,741
This is an important day for us both.

344
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:29,361
Let's see who can strike
the better bargain.

345
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:34,641
Verity!

346
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:55,851
Oh, Ross.

347
00:32:55,901 --> 00:32:58,811
~ Is Francis with you?
~ He's at the inn.

348
00:32:58,861 --> 00:33:01,331
~ Could I be of service?
~ I believe I can manage.

349
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:03,051
No, allow me.

350
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:14,961
Did you enjoy the assembly?

351
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:18,291
Ruth Teague seemed
very taken with you.

352
00:33:18,341 --> 00:33:19,731
I scarcely remember her.

353
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:21,581
How can that be?

354
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:25,101
There were distractions.

355
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:28,931
Perhaps you should pursue her.

356
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:31,691
Would that please you?

357
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:35,131
I have to go.

358
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,651
Verity will be looking for me.

359
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:54,371
~ Four pence, or I'll take them away.
~ Three pence.
~ Four pence!

360
00:33:54,421 --> 00:33:57,721
Three pence? Four pence,
and you've got a sale.

361
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:03,741
I will leave you.

362
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:09,581
Ross.

363
00:34:12,661 --> 00:34:14,261
Shall we go?

364
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:17,961
I'm in no mood to speculate.

365
00:34:18,821 --> 00:34:20,491
May I ask why?

366
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:26,101
I need something I can depend on.

367
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:08,051
~ Are we expecting your cousin?
~ Francis has changed his mind.

368
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:11,941
~ A pity. He would've lent a certain...
~ Gravity?

369
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:17,201
Gentlemen, welcome.

370
00:35:18,301 --> 00:35:21,581
You come here today
to decide one thing.

371
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:27,941
Whether to risk good gold
in the pursuit of copper.

372
00:35:29,581 --> 00:35:32,331
The times could hardly
be less auspicious.

373
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:34,171
When Wheal Reath closes...

374
00:35:34,221 --> 00:35:36,691
And Grambler's future
hangs in the balance.

375
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:39,371
.. when Welsh mines prosper
and Cornwall's on its knees,

376
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:41,411
what chance has this meagre venture?

377
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:44,381
Your cousin divides opinion.

378
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:47,931
Some think him arrogant.

379
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:51,291
Others observe a sense
of... entitlement.

380
00:35:51,341 --> 00:35:54,081
~ To what?
~ Whatever takes his fancy.

381
00:35:55,701 --> 00:35:57,611
But perhaps they misjudge him.

382
00:35:57,661 --> 00:36:00,291
So, what do I hear
of his latest venture?

383
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:04,851
The venture is small, so
overheads will be low.

384
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:07,971
Without Reath, supply to
the markets will fall,

385
00:36:08,021 --> 00:36:10,891
so the price of copper should rise.

386
00:36:10,941 --> 00:36:12,651
And if it doesn't?

387
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:15,251
Is he seeking investment?

388
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:17,371
I really couldn't say.

389
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,211
So the question is
what will it cost us?

390
00:36:21,261 --> 00:36:24,371
To begin with, I propose
to act as manager

391
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:26,811
and head purser without salary.

392
00:36:26,861 --> 00:36:30,091
If Captain Henshawe would
oversee the works...

393
00:36:30,141 --> 00:36:31,731
Also without salary?

394
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:34,771
At a favourable rate, until
we're up and running.

395
00:36:34,821 --> 00:36:38,691
If Mr Renfrew would supply gear
and tackle at nominal cost.

396
00:36:40,061 --> 00:36:41,451
The man has impudence!

397
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:45,331
Pascoe's Bank will honour
our drafts up to £300.

398
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:47,371
Pascoe's Bank?

399
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:50,091
~ Yes.
~ Not Warleggans?

400
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,011
Warleggans would be happy
to accommodate him.

401
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:56,061
Given the friendship
between our families.

402
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,921
Perhaps he doesn't value friendship.

403
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:02,651
Or family.

404
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:07,131
Warleggans will lend to a mine
for as long as it prospers,

405
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:11,051
but once it starts to struggle, they
withdraw credit and see it go under.

406
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:14,251
They could close Grambler tomorrow
as they closed Reath.

407
00:37:14,301 --> 00:37:18,061
Business is business but should
profit be the be-all and end-all?

408
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:23,611
I'm inclined to agree. We
know Reath was struggling,

409
00:37:23,661 --> 00:37:26,211
but closing it cost
the shareholders dear.

410
00:37:26,261 --> 00:37:29,491
~ And the miners dearer.
~ And the owner his life.

411
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:33,411
We cannot choose our family.
But we can choose our friends.

412
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:36,891
And, as a friend, I say to you,
if ever you need my assistance...

413
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:39,021
~ What assistance might I need?
~ What any man needs.

414
00:37:39,061 --> 00:37:42,611
Someone to alert him if he sees his
friend being played for a fool.

415
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:43,971
A fool?

416
00:37:44,021 --> 00:37:46,941
In love, in business, at cards.

417
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:50,251
It's true, my losses have
been considerable of late.

418
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:53,331
Then let me prove our
friendship by advancing

419
00:37:53,381 --> 00:37:55,721
whatever might defray them.

420
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:58,451
Gentlemen, I'll be straight with you.

421
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:02,771
The rewards could be considerable
but so are the risks.

422
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:06,651
But if you like a wager, and
which of us here doesn't,

423
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,211
then I'd sooner gamble
on a vein of copper

424
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:12,861
and the sweat of 50 men than
on the turn of a card.

425
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:17,211
50 guineas apiece will cover
the first three months.

426
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,931
There's mine.

427
00:38:27,821 --> 00:38:29,301
And mine.

428
00:38:31,661 --> 00:38:33,341
And mine.

429
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:50,811
If I may take the liberty
of proposing a toast?

430
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,501
A toast.

431
00:38:53,821 --> 00:38:55,331
To Wheal Leisure!

432
00:38:55,381 --> 00:38:57,051
Wheal Leisure!

433
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:20,331
He tried to swizzle me
but I beat 'im down.

434
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:21,931
I expected no less.

435
00:39:21,981 --> 00:39:24,451
A good day's work for us both.

436
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:29,721
What am I? A circus attraction?

437
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:32,211
A poorly-dressed one!

438
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:33,931
Come with me.

439
00:39:55,621 --> 00:39:58,451
This cannot continue, she must
be brought to her senses.

440
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:02,691
She must indeed. But what of
him? Has he no sense of shame?

441
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:05,291
I hold her most to blame! She
must have encouraged him.

442
00:40:05,341 --> 00:40:08,171
~ If you had seen her at the assembly.
~ But you were there!

443
00:40:08,221 --> 00:40:10,851
~ Could you not have put a stop to it?
~ I should not have needed to!

444
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:13,211
She should be mistress
of her own behaviour!

445
00:40:13,261 --> 00:40:14,931
Something must be done at once

446
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:18,481
before our family name is
dragged through the mud!

447
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,451
Jud?

448
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:48,541
Jud!

449
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:52,261
Prudie!

450
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,411
'Ee be lookin' fer Mr Ross?

451
00:41:05,461 --> 00:41:07,421
I am.

452
00:41:20,221 --> 00:41:21,691
Elizabeth.

453
00:41:24,261 --> 00:41:26,611
Have you been offered
some refreshment?

454
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:29,001
Your maid has done her best.

455
00:41:31,261 --> 00:41:32,861
You can go.

456
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:44,211
~ Oh, Ross...
~ What is it?

457
00:41:44,261 --> 00:41:47,051
How to even begin to
put it into words...

458
00:41:47,101 --> 00:41:48,211
Don't try.

459
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:50,811
You love Francis, I love Francis.

460
00:41:50,861 --> 00:41:53,731
But this cannot be
allowed to continue!

461
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:54,931
Out.

462
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:58,531
Damn me, if a man can't get about
'is sacred an' profane duties

463
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:00,411
~ wi'out a blastin' from...
~ Out!

464
00:42:00,461 --> 00:42:02,371
You must speak with Francis.

465
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:05,691
And your uncle, you must
speak with both of them.

466
00:42:05,741 --> 00:42:07,941
I'll follow you directly.

467
00:42:11,341 --> 00:42:13,211
Saddle my horse.

468
00:42:13,261 --> 00:42:15,611
And remind me to thrash
you when I return.

469
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:17,771
In't no call for that, Mr Ross.

470
00:42:17,821 --> 00:42:22,621
Tidn' just, tidn'
kind, tidn' civil...

471
00:42:24,421 --> 00:42:26,291
.. tidn' friendly.

472
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:52,131
It's a bad business, Ross.

473
00:42:52,181 --> 00:42:54,721
But we must make the best of it.

474
00:42:58,621 --> 00:43:01,361
Verity has greatly disappointed us.

475
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:05,531
~ Verity?
~ You're aware that she formed
an attachment at the ball?

476
00:43:05,581 --> 00:43:07,851
Who could fail to be aware?
She was all over the man!

477
00:43:07,901 --> 00:43:10,771
~ The sea captain? Blamey?
~ He's been secretly paying court to her

478
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:12,171
~ ever since.
~ Hoping, no doubt,

479
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:16,171
to secure her before she became
aware of his appalling past.

480
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:19,171
~ The varmint! ~ He's a drunkard,
who beat his wife to death.

481
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,651
~ Is this certain?
~ Verity has confirmed it.

482
00:43:21,701 --> 00:43:23,731
And forgiven him.

483
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:27,571
She's a plain girl, and
that makes her easy prey.

484
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:30,371
We must close ranks and protect her.

485
00:43:30,421 --> 00:43:32,611
Of course, but how?

486
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:37,661
She will not leave this house until
she swears never to see him again.

487
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:55,421
Ross!

488
00:43:57,221 --> 00:44:00,221
I heard what they told
you. It isn't true.

489
00:44:02,701 --> 00:44:05,691
It was an accident. She
tried to strike him.

490
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:10,291
He pushed her away, she
fell and hit her head.

491
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:12,851
~ He told you this?
~ At the ball.

492
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:15,851
But there was never any
intent to harm her.

493
00:44:15,901 --> 00:44:18,851
None in the world. And
he's paid for what he did.

494
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:21,171
He lost his rank and went to prison.

495
00:44:21,221 --> 00:44:24,371
~ And I know he would never
lift a finger to hurt me.
~ But still,

496
00:44:24,421 --> 00:44:26,851
~ how can you be sure he...
~ I'm sure.

497
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:30,251
He loves me. I love him.

498
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:33,401
You of all people know
what that feels like.

499
00:44:34,941 --> 00:44:36,261
Yes.

500
00:44:37,581 --> 00:44:38,781
Yes.

501
00:44:40,821 --> 00:44:42,491
What can I do?

502
00:44:45,581 --> 00:44:47,091
Captain Poldark,

503
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:50,011
most generous, to allow
us to meet here

504
00:44:50,061 --> 00:44:52,331
in view of your concerns.

505
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:54,611
Verity trusts you. I trust Verity.

506
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:57,061
She's my angel of redemption.

507
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:00,491
You'll have no cause to regret it.

508
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:04,101
I believe you, sir.

509
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:16,261
Sir.

510
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:23,421
Dammit! Tell our guests
to keep to the parlour.

511
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:40,531
Farming is such an engaging
hobby, is it not?

512
00:45:40,581 --> 00:45:42,691
More than a hobby for me, ma'am.

513
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:45,051
But do you not hunt, Captain Poldark?

514
00:45:45,101 --> 00:45:47,731
Would it not be a fine thing
to be mixing with people

515
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:50,811
~ of your own station?
~ I'm very well occupied here.

516
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:53,771
~ Of course, Ruth is an accomplished rider.
~ Of course.

517
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:56,171
Not that it's her
only accomplishment.

518
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:59,291
One has only to taste her syllabubs
to know their succulence.

519
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:01,131
Indeed.

520
00:46:01,181 --> 00:46:05,851
Is Miss Verity still meeting that
blackguard in spite of her father?

521
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:08,691
~ I um...
~ Of course, you're so out of the way here,

522
00:46:08,741 --> 00:46:12,291
~ you would not hear of it.
~ No, indeed.

523
00:46:12,341 --> 00:46:15,821
This must be the young
person that you adopted?

524
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,811
I've adopted no-one.

525
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:22,171
I needed a kitchen wench, the girl
is old enough to know her own mind.

526
00:46:22,221 --> 00:46:26,341
Of course, she looks as if
she would know her own mind.

527
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:29,571
But I must beg your
indulgence, ladies.

528
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:31,651
There is much I must attend to.

529
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:34,611
But you must take tea
with us at Teague House.

530
00:46:34,661 --> 00:46:37,821
Perhaps we can show you what a
woman's touch can do to a home.

531
00:46:38,861 --> 00:46:41,491
I thank you, ma'am, but I fear...

532
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:43,741
your efforts would be...

533
00:46:44,581 --> 00:46:46,541
.. wasted.

534
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:54,621
Yes, of course. Yes.

535
00:46:55,301 --> 00:46:58,531
~ My daughter, Esther, lives
with her governess in Plymouth.
~ Oh, indeed?

536
00:46:58,581 --> 00:47:00,811
And my son, James, was
midshipman with the fleet.

537
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:03,601
~ A midshipman?
~ I miss them greatly.

538
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:06,851
And you, who are no less
attached to your family,

539
00:47:06,901 --> 00:47:09,091
would surely be loathe to
quit them for my sake...>

540
00:47:09,141 --> 00:47:11,411
Have you had word of your family?

541
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:14,051
No, sir, I don't expect none.

542
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:16,851
Without me to skivvy for them,
they'll have no love o' me.

543
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:18,411
Particularly your father.

544
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,891
Too busy in the kiddleys
or down the mine.

545
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:24,091
~ And your brothers?
~ Soon be followin' in 'is footsteps.

546
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:26,611
Seems we both have
mining in our blood.

547
00:47:26,661 --> 00:47:30,221
Aye, sir. Though God knows if
that's a blessin' or a curse.

548
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:47,891
This is good timing. I was about
to ride to Wheal Leisure.

549
00:47:47,941 --> 00:47:50,371
The investors meeting went well.

550
00:47:50,421 --> 00:47:54,331
~ I hope I may yet to persuade
Francis to join us.
~ That will depend.

551
00:47:54,381 --> 00:47:57,051
I take nothing for granted.

552
00:47:57,101 --> 00:47:59,891
And I still ask for George
to be kept in the dark.

553
00:47:59,941 --> 00:48:02,891
I doubt your friendship would
prevent him betraying you

554
00:48:02,941 --> 00:48:04,371
if the need arose.

555
00:48:04,421 --> 00:48:07,581
Any more than our kinship has
prevented you from betraying us?

556
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:13,201
Do you deny that Verity is meeting
that man at your house?

557
00:48:13,261 --> 00:48:14,731
I think you misjudge him.

558
00:48:14,781 --> 00:48:17,121
I think I've misjudged you!

559
00:48:25,981 --> 00:48:29,331
~ Filthy skunk! Sneaking behind
our backs to debauch my sister!
~ Francis!

560
00:48:29,381 --> 00:48:31,651
~ No...
~ Deceiving her family...
~ Francis, please!

561
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,611
If you and your father
refuse to meet me...

562
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:35,291
We do not deal with wife murderers!

563
00:48:35,341 --> 00:48:37,411
I have a right to choose my own life!

564
00:48:37,461 --> 00:48:40,331
Honour means nothing to your
sort. Perhaps a thrashing will.

565
00:48:40,381 --> 00:48:41,651
Not in my house!

566
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:43,891
You have the impudence
to take his side?

567
00:48:43,941 --> 00:48:47,011
I take no-one's side, but you won't
change the issue with this foolery.

568
00:48:47,061 --> 00:48:50,171
I have no wish to quarrel,
but Verity is coming with me.

569
00:48:50,221 --> 00:48:53,411
~ That she is not!
~ Please, Father!
~ There'll be no cleaning of your boots

570
00:48:53,461 --> 00:48:57,461
~ on this family!
~ You insolent puppy!
~ Oh, "puppy", is it?

571
00:49:03,621 --> 00:49:06,451
When will it be convenient for
you to meet me, Captain Blamey?

572
00:49:06,501 --> 00:49:09,011
~ As soon as you like, sir.
~ Andrew, no! Francis, please?

573
00:49:09,061 --> 00:49:11,801
~ Get me a pistol.
~ Get one yourself.

574
00:49:14,381 --> 00:49:16,771
This fellow claims to be a gentleman.

575
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:20,931
~ Let him step outside and prove it!
~ Francis! No! Ross, stop them!

576
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:23,211
Stop him! He's out
of his depth, Charles!

577
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:25,531
Francis, I implore you...!

578
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:31,971
Andrew, please, for my
sake. Francis! Francis!

579
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:34,771
Francis, have no truck
with this scoundrel!

580
00:49:34,821 --> 00:49:37,051
~ Verity will come home with us.
~ Yes, Father.

581
00:49:37,101 --> 00:49:39,411
It's gone beyond that.
The skunk insulted me!

582
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:42,491
Fight it out with fists, then. He's
not worth the risk of a pistol!

583
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:44,851
Do you want this family
to be a laughing stock?

584
00:49:44,901 --> 00:49:47,731
~ Francis, I urge you to consider...
~ Consider what?

585
00:49:47,781 --> 00:49:50,331
That anyone may abuse our trust
and take advantage of us?

586
00:49:50,381 --> 00:49:52,321
Francis, I beg you.

587
00:49:53,541 --> 00:49:55,451
I will have satisfaction!

588
00:49:55,501 --> 00:49:57,531
You, there! Act as referee.
Can you count?

589
00:49:57,581 --> 00:50:00,131
Aye, sir. One, two, four, seven...

590
00:50:00,181 --> 00:50:02,251
We'll do it ourselves.

591
00:50:05,181 --> 00:50:07,771
One, two, three...

592
00:50:07,821 --> 00:50:09,531
Stop them, please stop them.

593
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:11,251
.. four,

594
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:13,171
five,

595
00:50:13,221 --> 00:50:14,571
six,

596
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:16,091
seven,

597
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:17,451
eight,

598
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:19,091
nine,

599
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,341
ten.

600
00:50:27,341 --> 00:50:29,541
~ No!
~ Francis...

601
00:50:44,701 --> 00:50:47,041
Prudie! Fetch me some water.

602
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:57,341
~ I know it was not your intention.
~ God forbid.

603
00:50:58,821 --> 00:51:00,291
Help me stop the bleeding.

604
00:51:00,341 --> 00:51:04,211
I can't, sir, I be
afeared of the blood.

605
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:06,051
Surely you must see how impossible

606
00:51:06,101 --> 00:51:09,041
it would be for us
to be together now?

607
00:51:09,181 --> 00:51:10,651
I do see.

608
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,371
I'll 'elp, sir. I b'ain't afeared.

609
00:51:32,741 --> 00:51:36,541
Goodbye... Verity.

610
00:52:05,701 --> 00:52:07,301
Where is he?

611
00:52:13,661 --> 00:52:17,491
Oh, God, no, no, no! How
could you let this happen?

612
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:19,531
~ Elizabeth...
~ You let him die.

613
00:52:19,581 --> 00:52:21,091
How could you let him die?

614
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:22,811
Speak to him.

615
00:52:46,421 --> 00:52:48,771
Your cousin do owe 'ee 'is life.

616
00:52:48,821 --> 00:52:51,211
Where'd 'ee learn to do such things?

617
00:52:51,261 --> 00:52:53,801
On the battlefields of Virginia.

618
00:53:03,501 --> 00:53:06,931
You are a disgrace to
the name of Poldark.

619
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:09,051
I'm sorry you think so.

620
00:53:09,101 --> 00:53:11,411
I offer no thanks.

621
00:53:11,461 --> 00:53:13,731
I feel no gratitude.

622
00:53:13,781 --> 00:53:16,381
I hold you entirely to blame.

623
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:19,451
I understand.

624
00:53:28,301 --> 00:53:29,931
I do not blame you.

625
00:53:29,981 --> 00:53:32,131
I wouldn't for the
world wish him hurt.

626
00:53:32,181 --> 00:53:35,611
I know that. And I'm grateful
for all you've done.

627
00:53:35,661 --> 00:53:37,461
Come, Elizabeth!

628
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:41,851
The more so now since,
more than ever,

629
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:44,441
I need him well and at my side.

630
00:53:47,301 --> 00:53:49,041
I'm with child.

631
00:53:51,821 --> 00:53:53,291
Elizabeth!

632
00:54:17,941 --> 00:54:21,291
Do I have "half-wit" branded
across my forehead?

633
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,011
No.

634
00:54:23,061 --> 00:54:25,371
Yet I fell for it, again.

635
00:54:25,421 --> 00:54:29,581
Built a castle out of winks and
smiles, and all the while...

636
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:34,331
I should be grateful.

637
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:36,781
What clearer proof is needed?

638
00:54:40,301 --> 00:54:42,701
Fetch Jim and Jud and Prudie.

639
00:54:43,301 --> 00:54:45,241
We have work to do.

640
00:55:31,821 --> 00:55:33,761
You did well today.

641
00:55:34,821 --> 00:55:38,321
I can see how valuable you
must be to your family.

642
00:55:38,581 --> 00:55:40,131
~ Sir?
~ And if you miss them,

643
00:55:40,181 --> 00:55:42,451
if you feel their need
is greater than mine...

644
00:55:42,501 --> 00:55:45,531
~ 'Ee be wantin' rid of me?
~ What?

645
00:55:45,581 --> 00:55:47,051
'Ee be wishin' me gone?

646
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:49,651
Sir, I'll work 'arder. I'll scrub
an' scour an' fettle an'...

647
00:55:49,701 --> 00:55:53,051
~ Demelza, your work is
more than satisfactory.
~ Then why, sir?

648
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:56,211
I was merely offering you the
chance to return to your home.

649
00:55:56,261 --> 00:55:59,001
If that's where you feel you belong.

650
00:56:00,741 --> 00:56:02,621
I belong 'ere.

651
00:56:11,021 --> 00:56:12,691
I belong 'ere.

652
00:56:38,901 --> 00:56:41,931
I declare the Wheal
Leisure mine open!

653
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,531
I wish you could forget him, my dear.

654
00:56:43,581 --> 00:56:45,091
Is love so easy to forget?

655
00:56:45,141 --> 00:56:47,091
Are the rumours true, do you think?

656
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:49,131
He's a damned fool if they're not!

657
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:52,251
Any man opening a mine must
be exceptionally brave

658
00:56:52,301 --> 00:56:54,131
or extremely foolish.

659
00:56:54,181 --> 00:56:57,971
'Tis a sign, mark my words.

660
00:56:58,021 --> 00:57:02,181
Step down, Mr Poldark, or we'll have
you committed for contempt of court.

661
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:06,571
Confess what sin there
is 'twixt you an' Poldark!

662
00:57:06,621 --> 00:57:08,661
You know what people say of us?

662
00:57:09,305 --> 00:58:09,287

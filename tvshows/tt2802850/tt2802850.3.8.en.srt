Hey.

21
00:05:48,604 --> 00:05:50,652
What's the plan? Are you just...

22
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:53,073
Where are we going?

23
00:05:57,265 --> 00:05:58,530
What?

24
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,200
Is that...

25
00:06:02,473 --> 00:06:04,540
You speak with sign language?

26
00:06:06,774 --> 00:06:08,407
Are you kidding me?

27
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:10,209
How are we supposed...

28
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:12,422
Chained to a deaf guy.

29
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:14,013
Jesus.

30
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,224
We need to cut this.

31
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:06,522
We were headed north, towards Watab.

32
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:09,030
Maybe 40 minutes on the bus.
Maybe longer.

33
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:10,944
I think I fell asleep.

34
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:14,930
A river nearby...

35
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:18,224
The Mississippi, I'm guessing.

36
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:19,535
Hey.

37
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:21,337
Hey!

38
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:23,943
We need a plan.

39
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:26,576
A plan!

All she do... Talk, talk, talk.

43
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,627
Whoo-ee! Good shooting, son!

44
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:30,382

00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:31,472

<i>Tell me you brought the getaway money.</i>

50
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,665
<i>Baby?</i>

51
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:58,824
<i>It's just... It happened so fast.</i>

52
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:05,765
<i>Ray, we need that money.</i>

53
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:09,068
<i>I know.</i>

54
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,309
<i>I'm going.</i>

00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:20,693
<i>Ray...</i>

56
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,816
<i>You want me to go?</i>

57
00:11:27,557 --> 00:11:29,224
<i>No. I'm fine.</i>

58
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,830
<i>I got it.</i>

59
00:12:56,002 --> 00:12:57,206
Put your back in it.

60
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:03,379
Oh. It's okay.

61
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:05,240
Get down. Get down. Get down.

62
00:13:30,073 --> 00:13:31,106
No!

63
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:38,892
Okay. Okay. Okay...

64
00:13:39,675 --> 00:13:42,276
One, two, three.

65
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:09,590
You bitch!

66
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:58,916
No. No way.

67
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,560
No. No.

68
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:45,719
You want shoes?

69
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:48,801
What?

70
00:17:50,214 --> 00:17:51,446
Shoes.

71
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:54,174
No.

72
00:17:54,926 --> 00:17:56,492
Just whiskey.

73
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:58,924
Make it a double.

74
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:01,548
And one for my friend.

75
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:25,942
Yeah. Just this much.

76
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:27,510
Sherry.

77
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:36,850
Shartis?

78
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,419
Huh?

79
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:46,021
"Job sat on his dung heap,
covered in boils."

80
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:51,163
- Mister, it's been a long day.
- Ah!

81
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:53,057
They're all long.

82
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,401
That's the nature of existence.

83
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,770
Life is suffering.

84
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:02,841
I think you're beginning
to understand that.

85
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:05,011
Hmm?

86
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,413
Amen.

87
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,282
Can I show you something?

88
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,126
Aw...

89
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:27,976
Ray is the cat.

90
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:29,801
What?

91
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:32,062
His name... I call him Ray.

92
00:19:32,273 --> 00:19:34,105
I know, I know. That's not
really a cat's name,

93
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,374
but when I looked at him,
that was the name that stuck.

94
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,843
But this is how it is, I think.

95
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,648
Are you familiar with <i>Ghuilgul?</i>

96
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:45,750
It's Hebrew.

97
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:49,653
It's a word that describes
how an old soul

98
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,157
attaches itself to a new body.

99
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,067
Ray?

100
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,703
Is that you?

101
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:11,022
Unfortunately, some souls
cannot find a body to enter.

102
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:12,990
And they become lost.

103
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,392
Rabbi Nachman believed

104
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,119
the Jewish victims
of the massacre of Uman

105
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,884
were lost souls.

106
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,619
1768 in Ukraine,

107
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:25,313
untold thousands killed by the Cossack.

108
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,539
Women and children...

109
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:29,235
Their bodies dumped in a hole

110
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:30,861
and forgotten.

111
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,323
When Rabbi Nachman first visited Uman,

112
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:39,689
he saw the mass grave,
and he called it...

113
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:42,002
a garden.

114
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,734
He told his followers
that he wanted to be buried there.

115
00:20:47,511 --> 00:20:49,611
The master of the field.

116
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:54,226
His soul, he said, would bind

117
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,764
and comfort theirs.

118
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,594
Have you been to this place before?

119
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:09,065
The bowling alley?

120
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,601
Is that what you see?

121
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:19,542
Oh...

122
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:25,614
Cheers.

123
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,283
Oh...

124
00:21:31,388 --> 00:21:33,722
Hits the spot.

125
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,741
We all end up here eventually.

126
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:42,093
To be weighed and judged.

127
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:44,881
As it is now for you and your friend.

128
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:47,636
You know, some thought that
he should have stayed behind,

129
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:51,173
but I convinced him that
he was on a better path now.

130
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:54,473
And you...

131
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:56,027
What about me?

132
00:22:00,073 --> 00:22:01,072
I don't...

133
00:22:01,217 --> 00:22:03,934
"Who will rise for me
against the wicked?"

134
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,129
Who will take a stand against evildoers?

135
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:11,025
You need a ride?

136
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:14,793
- Uh...
- There's a car out front.

137
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:17,186
It's a green Volkswagen Beetle.

138
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:20,668
This is the universe at its most ironic.

139
00:22:21,337 --> 00:22:24,905
Don't worry. Its sins
have been swept clean.

140
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:26,972
You and your friend should take it.

141
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:29,133
The keys are under the mat.

142
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:31,512
I...

143
00:22:32,564 --> 00:22:34,897
- Thank you.
- Oh, don't thank me.

144
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:40,658
Simply deliver a message
when the time comes.

145
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,190
A message?

146
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:45,859
- To who?
- To the wicked.

147
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:48,229
Tell them...

148
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:53,004
"Though thou exalt thyself
like the eagle,

149
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:57,611
"though thou make thy nest
among the stars,

150
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,124
"thence will I bring thee down,

151
00:23:00,276 --> 00:23:01,775
"sayeth the Lord."

152
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:07,686
"Though thou exalt thyself..."

153
00:23:07,711 --> 00:23:09,315
It's okay. It's okay.

154
00:23:09,884 --> 00:23:11,217
You'll remember.

155
00:23:20,562 --> 00:23:21,894
Ray...

156
00:23:24,592 --> 00:23:27,031
I'm afraid you have to leave the cat.

157
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:39,445
It's okay.

158
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,530
Don't worry.

159
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,058
Hey, do me a favor, will you?

160
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:51,225
Mmm.

161
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:53,263
When the Gophers play,

162
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:55,126
put a little beer in a bowl

163
00:23:55,162 --> 00:23:57,095
and put it in front of the game.

164
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:12,802
Napkins.

165
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:18,641
And some vodka.

166
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:37,087
Yuri...

167
00:25:41,532 --> 00:25:43,335
You are Yuri Gurka,

168
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,640
Cossack of the plains.

169
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,686
Grandchild of the Wolves' Hundred.

170
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:50,704
I have a message for you

171
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:54,743
from Helga Albrecht
and the Rabbi Nachman.

172
00:26:33,738 --> 00:26:34,971
Socks.

173
00:26:35,606 --> 00:26:37,106
Great.

174
00:26:37,891 --> 00:26:40,518
I... I needed socks.

175
00:26:40,813 --> 00:26:43,612
- Thanks.
- Don't thank us, thank Santa.

176
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:50,319
I should, um, go check on the ragout.

177
00:26:51,288 --> 00:26:52,722
Let me help you.

178
00:27:04,235 --> 00:27:06,201
Are you having a good Christmas?

179
00:27:06,504 --> 00:27:08,333
Oh... You know...

180
00:27:08,473 --> 00:27:09,938
Kinda weird.

181
00:27:10,307 --> 00:27:13,239
I know, we'll figure it out.

182
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:19,571
Hmm.

183
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:21,283
Burgle.

184
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,009
Oh, jeez.

185
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:09,233
- Sir.
- Not now.

186
00:28:09,268 --> 00:28:10,801
Gloria Burgle. Eden Valley police.

187
00:28:10,837 --> 00:28:13,037
You had one of mine
on the bus. Nikki Swango?

188
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,438
We're still doing a head count.

189
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:15,606
There's some dead from the crash,

190
00:28:15,642 --> 00:28:17,575
- others from the assault.
- Assault?

191
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:20,658
We count three sets of
boot prints on the approach.

192
00:28:20,822 --> 00:28:22,994
We got a stolen crotch rocket
in the trees.

193
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,947
Plus some kind of homemade ramp

194
00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:26,604
we think caused the upend.

195
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:28,352
You saw the vehicle on the way in?

196
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:30,161
The yellow deal flipped on its top?

197
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:32,607
Couple of bystanders probably
slowed to do the Christian thing,

198
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:35,192
then recognized the debacle
for what it was.

199
00:28:35,393 --> 00:28:37,566
Second vehicle, panel van maybe,

200
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:39,887
chases them for 2 miles,
runs them off the road,

201
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,738
finishes the couple execution style.

202
00:28:41,832 --> 00:28:42,973
Jeez.

203
00:28:43,134 --> 00:28:45,134
If I could just get
a look inside the bus,

204
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,503
my suspect, well, she's real memorable.

205
00:28:47,528 --> 00:28:48,727
- A woman, you said?
- Yeah.

206
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:51,070
No women on the bus,
I can tell you that.

207
00:28:51,142 --> 00:28:52,241
Anything I can...

208
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:55,045
That patch on your coat,
does it say "US Marshal"?

209
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,768
- No, sir.
- Well then,

210
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:59,724
we'll call you
when we find out, either way.

211
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:02,467
- Either?
- Dead or Alive.

212
00:29:20,304 --> 00:29:22,786
Yeah, is he home?

213
00:29:22,904 --> 00:29:24,193
We got a meeting.

214
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:31,546
What the heck?

215
00:29:37,888 --> 00:29:41,132
Sy, come in.
We're just having lunch, mind you.

216
00:29:41,225 --> 00:29:44,567
Where's Emmit?
I tried calling yesterday, but...

217
00:29:44,694 --> 00:29:48,129
He's resting. He's upstairs.

218
00:29:48,215 --> 00:29:51,099
All this bother with his brother,
he's very upset.

219
00:29:51,512 --> 00:29:53,179
I know, I was there.

220
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:55,739
So, if he's...

221
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:00,908
Can you get him?

222
00:30:01,414 --> 00:30:03,377
Like I told your man,
the police asked us

223
00:30:03,412 --> 00:30:05,336
to come down to the precinct,
give a statement.

224
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,749
Yeah. That's all taken care of.

225
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:12,291
- What? When?
- Just come and take a seat.

226
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:13,970
Please.

227
00:30:16,126 --> 00:30:19,260
In fact, there's some very good news.

228
00:30:20,234 --> 00:30:22,191
- Good news?
- Yes.

229
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:24,564
Today, you are $5 million richer

230
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,299
than you were yesterday.

231
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:30,470
- What?
- Year-end bonuses.

232
00:30:31,943 --> 00:30:33,075
We already...

233
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,108
Round two. There is a round three,

234
00:30:35,144 --> 00:30:36,970
but I thought it better to hold it

235
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:38,704
till the next fiscal year.

236
00:30:38,768 --> 00:30:40,101
Sweet potato?

237
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:42,215
Uh... No.

238
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:46,064
I'm... I'm not very hungry.

239
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:49,626
No, no. It would be a shame
to let it all go to waste.

240
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:52,235
Think of all them starving children.

241
00:30:53,578 --> 00:30:54,742
No?

242
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,915
What about some tea then, eh?

243
00:30:57,999 --> 00:30:59,699
Fancy a nice cuppa?

244
00:30:59,843 --> 00:31:01,899
Sure. Good Christ.

245
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,251
- Sugar?
- No. I...

246
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:04,669
That's fine.

247
00:31:07,014 --> 00:31:08,914
It was me mum's recipe,

248
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:13,199
the secret of which
she smuggled beneath her bosom

249
00:31:13,449 --> 00:31:15,980
all the way from Wales to Bristol.

250
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,260
- It's a little bitter.
- Yeah.

251
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,871
Well, try some more, I think
you'll find it smooths out nicely.

252
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:53,052
Right, well, I'll tell
the big man you stopped by,

253
00:31:53,087 --> 00:31:55,221
and don't worry about all this
trouble with the police.

254
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:59,424
I think you'll find these things
have a way of clearing themselves up.

255
00:32:01,438 --> 00:32:03,338
Okay, well, just...

256
00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:06,273
I feel like I should
at least check on him.

257
00:32:06,336 --> 00:32:08,703
- Make sure he's...
- No, he's resting now.

258
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:10,851
Little bit of the old snore and drool.

259
00:32:10,905 --> 00:32:14,065
He took a pill, I think,
maybe two. Or three.

260
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:15,759
As soon as he's wakeys,

261
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:17,838
I'll have him give you a ring-a-ding.

262
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,226
Copacetic?

263
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:24,190
- Five million?
- Bye-bye, Mr. Feltz.

264
00:33:35,257 --> 00:33:36,488
Anderson said he couldn't wait,

265
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,042
said you should call to reschedule.

266
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:40,661
You okay there, chief?

267
00:33:42,544 --> 00:33:43,643
I just...

268
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,690
Give me a minute.

269
00:33:50,103 --> 00:33:51,133
Jeez.

270
00:33:53,842 --> 00:33:55,008
I'm okay.

271
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:07,120
Well, that's not right.

272
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:19,235
Oh, Jeez. Call 911!

273
00:34:22,363 --> 00:34:23,893
Make a hole, guys.

274
00:34:27,177 --> 00:34:28,309
Stay with us.

275
00:34:28,678 --> 00:34:29,843
Almost there.

276
00:34:30,576 --> 00:34:32,084
Running fast.

277
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,681
Almost there. Come on.

278
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,126
Stay with us.

279
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:41,502
Three, two, one, lift.

280
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:02,343
- No.
- How's he doing?

281
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,200
Spoke to Mr. Feltz's doctor last week.

282
00:36:04,242 --> 00:36:07,031
He says they're still stumped.
Some kind of toxic shock, sounds like.

283
00:36:07,086 --> 00:36:10,309
What kind of toxic, is my question.
Toxic as in toxin? As in poison?

284
00:36:10,384 --> 00:36:11,934
Like that Russian fella.

285
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:14,238
I already spoke to your boss.
Both of you.

286
00:36:14,493 --> 00:36:16,516
- This is harassment.
- We're on our lunch break.

287
00:36:16,581 --> 00:36:18,266
Heard it was shepherd's
pie day in the cafeteria.

288
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:19,749
And here you are.

289
00:36:25,074 --> 00:36:26,374
How's business?

290
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,673
Private company like yours,
it's hard for us to tell.

291
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,009
Newspaper said you've been buying up
a lot of new properties though.

292
00:36:31,057 --> 00:36:32,524
Expanding?

293
00:36:39,274 --> 00:36:41,516
- Wasn't that your brother's car?
- Um, I...

294
00:36:42,322 --> 00:36:44,482
I must have parked somewhere else.

295
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,067
I had to take a taxi.
I think my car was stolen.

296
00:36:56,152 --> 00:36:58,262
- Stolen? Do you want me to...
- No, no.

297
00:36:58,473 --> 00:37:00,005
I'm just being silly, probably.

298
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:01,989
Just forgot where I parked.

299
00:37:35,437 --> 00:37:36,572
Madeline!

300
00:37:40,996 --> 00:37:42,671
Jeez! We've got the intercom.

301
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,175
What the shit is this?

302
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:46,097
It's... I don't know.

303
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:47,980
Saw 'em when I came in this morning.

304
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,493
- Thought maybe you redecorated...
- I want...

305
00:37:51,516 --> 00:37:53,915
- They have logs at the front desk, yeah?
- Yes.

306
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,192
The comings and goings and... cameras!

307
00:37:56,217 --> 00:37:58,499
- Mr. Stussy, you're hurting me.
- Oh, sorry.

308
00:37:58,981 --> 00:38:03,175
You know, maybe Mr. Varga...
He does that thing sometimes.

309
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,152
- Maybe...
- I bet that's it, Maddy.

310
00:38:05,261 --> 00:38:07,683
Probably he told me and I forgot.

311
00:38:07,894 --> 00:38:08,936
I'm sorry about your arm.

312
00:38:08,961 --> 00:38:11,779
No, it's... You were surprised, is all.

313
00:38:13,076 --> 00:38:14,575
After what happened to Sy...

314
00:38:14,696 --> 00:38:16,196
Your darn brother.

315
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:17,730
You want me to call him?

316
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:20,867
My brother?

317
00:38:21,725 --> 00:38:23,625
No. Mr. Varga.

318
00:38:24,646 --> 00:38:26,606
No. No.

319
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:29,755
See if you can find out what
happened to the old pictures.

320
00:38:30,312 --> 00:38:32,479
Make sure they don't throw them out.

321
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:08,963
That's him.

322
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:14,374
Mr. Stussy...

323
00:39:14,615 --> 00:39:16,694
- He's alive.
<i>- Who?</i>

324
00:39:17,158 --> 00:39:18,444
Ray.

325
00:39:18,577 --> 00:39:21,577
Somehow he...
I can feel him watching me.

326
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:24,373
<i>Your dead brother? How interesting.</i>

327
00:39:24,422 --> 00:39:26,930
Listen. I think we should...

328
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,180
I think we need more men.

329
00:39:29,836 --> 00:39:32,041
What kind of men? Short men?

330
00:39:32,106 --> 00:39:33,172
<i>Melancholy?</i>

331
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:34,440
I'm not kidding.

332
00:39:35,276 --> 00:39:37,976
What if they're... A new move.

333
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:39,441
Setting me up...

334
00:39:39,547 --> 00:39:40,612
<i>They?</i>

335
00:39:41,152 --> 00:39:42,651
Ray and the girl.

336
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,318
She's still out there according to...

337
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:46,387
well, the cops and the newspapers.

338
00:39:46,412 --> 00:39:48,498
And you said yourself,
your man never came back so...

339
00:39:48,564 --> 00:39:49,729
<i>Canada.</i>

340
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,353
<i>What?</i>

341
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:54,960
If the girl is alive... If...

342
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:58,782
Then she did what any smart person
wanted for murder would do

343
00:39:58,807 --> 00:40:00,640
and then she ran away to Canada.

344
00:40:01,201 --> 00:40:03,101
Ray's car was parked in my spot.

345
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:04,835
The Corvette.

346
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:06,368
<i>At the hospital.</i>

347
00:40:08,161 --> 00:40:09,434
You were at the hospital?

348
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,239
And now I'm standing in my office.

349
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:15,846
- And all the pictures are...
<i>- Emmit?</i>

350
00:40:16,487 --> 00:40:18,086
Emmit, are you listening?

351
00:40:18,552 --> 00:40:19,784
<i>Yes.</i>

352
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,469
You won.

353
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:24,626
I won? What did I win?

354
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:27,225
Life.

355
00:40:28,355 --> 00:40:29,787
<i>Sit tight.</i>

356
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,461
<i>Meemo will be over presently
to take you home.</i>

357
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:34,447
There's some papers to sign.

358
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:37,531
You're selling a shopping mall.

359
00:40:38,294 --> 00:40:39,893
I own a shopping mall?

360
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,121
What?

361
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,299
Help!

362
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:22,236
Help!

363
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:37,919
He has a what?

364
00:42:39,022 --> 00:42:40,966
And you were here the whole time?

365
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,422
It's me.

366
00:42:43,158 --> 00:42:44,524
It's my fault.

367
00:42:46,361 --> 00:42:48,195
Did he sign the papers?

368
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:52,365
Emmit, we've talked about this.

369
00:42:52,401 --> 00:42:55,545
If you don't sign the papers,
we don't make the money.

370
00:42:55,638 --> 00:42:58,694
No. No more papers.

371
00:42:58,808 --> 00:43:00,207
No more signing.

372
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,272
Something's going on here.

373
00:43:02,544 --> 00:43:05,145
A hand reaching out
from beyond the grave.

374
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:06,981
Things I've done.

375
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,251
Transgressions.

376
00:43:09,994 --> 00:43:11,927
And now, death.

377
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:14,321
Creeping close.

378
00:43:15,013 --> 00:43:16,980
Step by step.

379
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:20,527
A father dead on a driveway.

380
00:43:20,962 --> 00:43:24,864
An older brother taking
advantage of a younger...

381
00:43:25,173 --> 00:43:26,608
<i>Mi amore...</i>

382
00:43:27,045 --> 00:43:28,335
Sit.

383
00:43:35,043 --> 00:43:36,876
You know how I describe you

384
00:43:37,005 --> 00:43:39,943
when I meet with my bankers
and hedge fund managers?

385
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,483
A hero.

386
00:43:44,253 --> 00:43:48,600
Clear of mind.
A man of singular purpose.

387
00:43:49,758 --> 00:43:53,507
But even heroes have setbacks.

388
00:43:54,062 --> 00:43:56,562
A messy divorce, death of a loved one

389
00:43:56,597 --> 00:43:59,007
or a beloved business partner.

390
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,726
Sy's not dead.

391
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:02,415
- Yet...
- What?

392
00:44:02,497 --> 00:44:03,630
What?

393
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:08,926
Look, my point is that

394
00:44:09,348 --> 00:44:12,458
you have to remember
that even heroes can lose sight

395
00:44:12,536 --> 00:44:15,122
of what's real from time to time.

396
00:44:15,211 --> 00:44:16,500
Try these.

397
00:44:16,993 --> 00:44:19,375
- What? What are they?
- A mild sedative.

398
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,034
Something to stop the engines racing.

399
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:30,883
Now...

400
00:44:31,646 --> 00:44:35,461
I want you to picture an island.

401
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,381
Tropical island, somewhere warm.

402
00:44:38,515 --> 00:44:40,719
South Pacific, perhaps. Can you see it?

403
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:42,143
Yeah.

404
00:44:42,297 --> 00:44:44,413
Now I want you to imagine

405
00:44:45,213 --> 00:44:49,281
that on this island,
one day in September, 1945,

406
00:44:49,317 --> 00:44:52,512
a blizzard of paper fell from the sky.

407
00:44:52,847 --> 00:44:55,746
Leaflets, dropped in their hundreds

408
00:44:55,822 --> 00:44:57,722
by the allied forces

409
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,758
to tell the Japanese soldiers
stationed there

410
00:45:00,793 --> 00:45:02,493
that the war was over.

411
00:45:03,029 --> 00:45:05,750
The emperor has surrendered.

412
00:45:07,234 --> 00:45:08,933
But down below,

413
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:13,943
one man refused to believe.

414
00:45:14,307 --> 00:45:16,818
Lieutenant Hiroo Onoda.

415
00:45:16,944 --> 00:45:19,888
A man of honor, values...

416
00:45:20,213 --> 00:45:22,864
And as the rest of the world
went about its business,

417
00:45:22,926 --> 00:45:27,912
1946, 47, 50, 64, 71...

418
00:45:28,488 --> 00:45:30,421
As peace was made,

419
00:45:30,457 --> 00:45:34,251
in a cold war fort
Hiroo Onoda battled on,

420
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:36,024
a tireless soldier

421
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:38,195
of the emperor's imperial army,

422
00:45:38,765 --> 00:45:41,665
and the last man to die for an ideal.

423
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:45,035
He was just a boy.

424
00:45:47,673 --> 00:45:51,084
He used to follow me around
after school.

425
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,584
"Emmit, play with me.

426
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:58,076
Emmit, watch this."

427
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:04,955
Is the Bible a children's book?

428
00:46:07,827 --> 00:46:11,127
What we're doing here,
the sober affairs of men...

429
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:12,962
These are feats of great strength,

430
00:46:12,998 --> 00:46:14,498
of cunning and fortitude.

431
00:46:14,533 --> 00:46:17,167
Not child's play.
Not the best you can do.

432
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:21,559
Nobody remembers the second man
to climb Mount Everest.

433
00:46:22,622 --> 00:46:23,674
That's it.

434
00:46:24,876 --> 00:46:26,109
Sleep now.

435
00:46:30,015 --> 00:46:32,683
Everything will be clearer
in the morning.

436
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:33,742
Well, that's it for me then.

437
00:47:34,244 --> 00:47:37,011
- Gotta pay the sitter.
- Okay, Chief.

438
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:40,747
Told you. Can't call me that anymore.

439
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:43,251
I'm a Deputy now, same as you.

440
00:47:52,462 --> 00:47:54,795
I'll run the rest of these
tomorrow. Which, you know...

441
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:56,414
Serving eviction notices
doesn't give you

442
00:47:56,439 --> 00:47:57,923
a sense of hope and purpose, what will?

443
00:48:05,225 --> 00:48:06,808
You know what?

444
00:48:27,096 --> 00:48:28,962
Throw this in the "Outgoing"
for the morning?

445
00:48:29,377 --> 00:48:31,008
My name's Emmit Stussy.

446
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:35,068
I want to confess.

447

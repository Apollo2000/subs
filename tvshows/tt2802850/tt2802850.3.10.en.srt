GLORIA: <i>And you're saying this proves...</i>

207
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:53,927
Until 18 months ago, Stussy Lots was
a traditional real estate concern.

208
00:22:53,963 --> 00:22:56,429
They owned two dozen
parcels around Minnesota,

209
00:22:56,465 --> 00:22:58,365
ground and elevated lots.

210
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,100
They charged a standard fee for parking,

211
00:23:00,136 --> 00:23:01,668
monthly rates and hourly meters.

212
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:04,071
Then the books show a
million dollar loan

213
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:05,739
from this company called Narwhal.

214
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:08,041
As far as I can tell, the
corporate ID number is fake.

215
00:23:08,644 --> 00:23:10,310
So, four months ago,

216
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:13,080
new incorporation papers
were filed with the city,

217
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:17,950
adding V.M. Varga as a
partner at Stussy Lots.

218

Country of origin isn't
listed on the form.

220
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,323
But that sounds like the man that I met.

221
00:23:24,358 --> 00:23:26,325
So, are we talking about
money laundering or...

222
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,905
That's what I thought at first, but no.

223
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,195
This is something different.

224
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,998
It's more of a leveraged
buyout or bleed out,

225
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:35,034
in which an outside entity
acquires a healthy company,

226
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:36,702
borrows millions of dollars in its name,

227
00:23:36,737 --> 00:23:38,404
which is pocketed by the partners.

228
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:40,039
Then they sell the company,

229
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:42,574
now laden with debt, for
a fraction of the price.

230
00:23:42,944 --> 00:23:44,376
And that's a crime?

231
00:23:44,412 --> 00:23:46,412
Not when it's done properly. No.

232
00:23:46,447 --> 00:23:47,546
What's that?

233
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:49,748
I was saying, morality aside,

234
00:23:49,784 --> 00:23:54,019
one company buying another and
strip-mining it for profit

235
00:23:54,054 --> 00:23:57,322
is perfectly legal as long as one
follows the letter of the law

236
00:23:57,357 --> 00:23:59,357

492
00:46:29,134 --> 00:46:32,026
and six counts of conspiracy
to commit murder.

493
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:35,639
And then I'm gonna go home to my
son, it's his birthday tomorrow.

494
00:46:35,674 --> 00:46:37,807
I promised I'd take him
to the state fair.

495
00:46:37,842 --> 00:46:39,242
You ever guess a pig's weight?

496
00:46:39,278 --> 00:46:41,110
Or eat a deep fried Snickers bar?

497
00:46:42,861 --> 00:46:45,222
There's no better way to
spend a Saturday in this,

498
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:47,402
our great American experiment.

499
00:46:52,189 --> 00:46:55,724
So, while you're eating mashed
potatoes from a box in a dark room,

500
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,260
think of me among the
amber waves of grain.

501
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:06,769
No.

502
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,094
That's not what's gonna happen next.

503
00:47:13,344 --> 00:47:15,611
What's gonna happen next is this.

504
00:47:17,047 --> 00:47:20,215
In five minutes that
door is going to open,

505
00:47:20,884 --> 00:47:24,152
and a man you can't
argue with will tell me

506
00:47:24,188 --> 00:47:25,687
I'm free to go.

507
00:47:25,722 --> 00:47:28,356
And I will stand from this chair

508
00:47:28,391 --> 00:47:32,060
and disappear into the
world, so help me God.

509
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:43,460
Rikers and Snickers bars.

510
00:47:44,488 --> 00:47:45,820
You'll see.

511
00:47:46,643 --> 00:47:48,009
(TSKS)

512
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:50,846
Agent Burgle.

513
00:47:53,851 --> 00:47:55,183
Gloria.

514
00:47:57,686 --> 00:47:59,353
Trust me.

515
00:48:00,489 --> 00:48:02,489
The future is certain.

516
00:48:03,226 --> 00:48:06,126
And when it comes, you will
know without question,

517
00:48:06,162 --> 00:48:08,262
your place in the world.

518
00:48:09,165 --> 00:48:11,732
Until then, we've said
all there is to say.

519
00:48:12,735 --> 00:48:16,570
Any further debate would be
simply wasting our breath.

520
00:48:17,506 --> 00:48:21,242
And if there's one thing I
can't abide, it's waste.

521
00:48:33,788 --> 00:48:35,088
Goodbye.

522

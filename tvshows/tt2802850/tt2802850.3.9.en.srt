00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,884
You want some pop? Sprite or something?

00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:38,862
No.

10
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:46,877
This is Deputy Gloria Burgle,

11
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,152
Meeker County Sheriff's office,

12
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,480
with an interview of Emmit Stussy,

13
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:51,481
March 16, 2011.

14
00:02:53,685 --> 00:02:56,018
First up, I'm curious about something.

15
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:57,954
Your house is an hour's drive from here.

16
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,056
There's three St. Cloud
metros near your office.

17
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:01,725
Why come all the way down here?

18
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,025
You gave me your card.

19
00:03:04,363 --> 00:03:05,628
Okay, then.

20
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:08,963
Well, I got a lot of questions,

21
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:11,601
but I guess, maybe,
you should just start.

22
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:13,770
I want to be clear about something.

23
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:16,205
If anybody comes here,
claiming to be my lawyer,

24
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:17,240
don't let them in.

25
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:20,171
- Like who?
- Anybody.

26
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,780
I'm saying, I'm here on my own proxy.

27
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:25,648
Want no contact with the outside world.

28
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:27,616
Don't trust anyone who comes,

29
00:03:27,651 --> 00:03:28,891
if they do, which they may not.

30
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:35,397
He was right, you know?

31
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:36,799
- Who?
- Ray.

32
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:38,835
I tricked him.

33
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:42,605
Or not tricked, but...

34
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:46,366
A lie is not a lie if
you believe it's true,

35
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:47,309
do you think that?

36
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:49,951
It's not my story.

37
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:52,949
I think that.

38
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:55,852
Or I did, I guess.

39
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,455
I don't know what I believe now.

40
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:05,226
He played tennis.

41
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,896
Ray?

42
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:11,093
Our dad.

43
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:13,969
At his club, rain or
shine, every Saturday.

44
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,270
He had that thing all dads have

45
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:16,905
after 30 years of wearing socks,

46
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,473
where the hair gets worn away,

47
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,341
so he's basically bald
from the shins down.

48
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:25,807
I was on the drive, you know, throwing

49
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:28,483
a ball against the house, a tennis ball.

50
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,912
Wasn't supposed to,
but he was gone, so...

51
00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:35,290
And Ray's someplace, kitchen probably,

52
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:36,992
he was always eating, that kid.

53
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:37,993
Real chubby.

54
00:04:39,886 --> 00:04:41,686
And then, Dad's home.

55
00:04:44,724 --> 00:04:46,323
He had this old Mercedes diesel,

56
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,559
you could hear it on the come.

57
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,315
So I hide the ball and he pulls in.

58
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:57,835
Not out of the car ten seconds,

59
00:04:57,871 --> 00:05:00,872
when down he goes, flat on his face.

60
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:05,276
One minute, he's waving hello,
the next, just drops like...

61
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:06,911
Like the lights go out.

62
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:22,559
I killed him.

63
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:23,973
- Your dad?
- Ray.

64
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:26,797
First I tricked him,

65
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:29,502
then I killed him.

66
00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:31,935
Like no days had passed.

67
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:34,004
Like one thing goes and then another.

68
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,283
Like you whack a tennis
ball back and forth.

69
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:39,209
Killed him where?

70
00:05:39,244 --> 00:05:41,492
In the den of a shithole apartment.

71
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,948
Framed picture-puzzle in the wall,

72
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:46,549
like some six-year-old,

73
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:48,421
so proud, he had to hang it up.

74
00:05:50,655 --> 00:05:51,621
Christmas Eve.

75
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,158
You think there's a
special level of hell

76
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:57,433
for people that killed their
loved ones on Christmas Eve?

77
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:06,424
I wanted the stamps, see?

78
00:06:07,872 --> 00:06:10,406
My dad gave me a car,
but I wanted the stamps.

79
00:06:10,442 --> 00:06:12,242
What 17-year-old boy wants stamps

80
00:06:12,277 --> 00:06:14,210
when he can have a cherry-red Corvette?

81
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:16,212
But I did.

82
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:18,714
And Ray, like I said,
he was a chubby kid.

83
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,716
15 years old, never been laid,

84
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,593
never even felt up a girl, so...

85
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:27,492
I let it slip.

86
00:06:29,193 --> 00:06:34,096
How this car, well... It's
like a magnet, isn't it?

87
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:36,265
Like catnip for kitty cats,

88
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,067
and if you turn up to school Monday

89
00:06:38,102 --> 00:06:40,169
in this thing, well, it's a done deal.

90
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:44,273
And now, he's begging me.

91
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:47,843
"Emmit, please, take the
damn stamps, give me the car."

92
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,175
Like it's his idea.

93
00:06:50,489 --> 00:06:52,956
What's that old quote, that...

94
00:06:52,984 --> 00:06:54,584
"The greatest trick
the Devil ever pulled

95
00:06:54,618 --> 00:06:56,518
was convincing the
world he didn't exist."

96
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:01,990
How did you?

97
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:03,617
I cut his throat.

98
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:05,794
Blood everywhere.

99
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:07,829
"Exsanguinate," that's the term,

100
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:09,130
the cause of death.

101
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,832
But how, exactly?

102
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,071
One stamp left.

103
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:17,739
I sold the rest and used the capital

104
00:07:17,774 --> 00:07:19,007
to get things rolling,

105
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:20,509
but I kept the two-cent,

106
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:22,477
hung it on the wall of my study.

107
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:24,646
Like it was my first dollar I ever made.

108
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,350
But think of it from his point of view,

109
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:30,618
my brother.

110
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:32,714
Like a stick in the
eye, every time he...

111
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:36,524
'Cause I won, see?

112
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:39,894
I won.

113
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,495
And he spent his days watching
scumbags piss on his shoes.

114
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,906
So, I go to him and,
"Enough's enough," I said.

115
00:07:51,942 --> 00:07:54,308
"This dumb feud, let's
put it in the past."

116
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:57,511
And I give him the frame,

117
00:07:57,547 --> 00:07:59,781
but he's still mad and
he tries to give it back,

118
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:02,450
so we start shoving
and the frame breaks.

119
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:05,753
And a piece of glass, stuck in his neck.

120
00:08:05,788 --> 00:08:07,047
You hit him with it?

121
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:08,622
No, I didn't... I...

122
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:10,657
I didn't mean to...

123
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:12,860
It was just one of those,
"What are the odds?" moments.

124
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:16,529
Murder though, I'm not saying it wasn't.

125
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:18,036
Hmm.

126
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:23,832
Thirty years I've been killing him.

127
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:27,507
That was just when he fell.

128
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:48,461
I'm not sure one's gonna do it.

129
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:50,730
I got another picked out,
closer to the precinct.

130
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:53,933
What matters is he signs those papers.

131
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,968
And we get him out of that precinct

132
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:57,270
before he gets too chatty.

133
00:08:57,306 --> 00:08:58,605
I can monitor the radios,

134
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,039
see if there's a workaround
to the new security.

135
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,075
No, let's move shop, go
to stage four. No mistakes.

136
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:11,646
Shit!

137
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,350
Hello.

138
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,720
Hope you got you checkbook handy.

139
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:55,255
Who's this?

140
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,263
You first.

141
00:13:57,993 --> 00:14:01,294
Madam, it's just lazy
to steal from someone

142
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,630
without knowing their name.

143
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:07,534
Yeah. That's what I am. Lazy.

144
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:08,535
Oh...

145
00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:13,473
The Swango. Our recidivist.

146
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:14,941
Bingo.

147
00:14:14,976 --> 00:14:19,591
Mr. Cayman Islands XXJJ19462SK.

148
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:25,017
Or should I say Switzerland ZZ91482S?

149
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:27,053
No, account numbers mean nothing

150
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:28,921
without their passwords,

151
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:32,191
without the answer to
six security questions.

152
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:35,555
Was it six? Thanks. Thought it was five.

153
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,996
What do you want?

154
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:39,598
Your name, for starters.

155
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,233
V.M. Varga.

156
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:44,328
What's the "V.M." stand for?

157
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:48,107
How much and where?

158
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:50,076
Not sure that tracks alphabetically.

159
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,277
Look, if you're gonna be clever,

160
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,155
I'm gonna go for a nice lie down.

161
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:57,778
Two million. Lobby of the
Clarion Hotel, 4:00 p.m.

162
00:14:58,886 --> 00:14:59,918
Come alone.

163
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,244
Nice sweater.

164
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,069
It's a cardigan.

165
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,689
Lopez.

166
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,913
Yeah.

167
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:18,389
- Hello?
- Yeah.

168
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,394
Hear me?

169
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,562
Hello?

170
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:24,732
Yeah, it's me. It's Gloria.

171
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:27,434
Oh, hey, there. I was
just thinking of you.

172
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:29,803
Yeah? Hey, let me ask you something.

173
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,772
Yeah, strangest thing,
I'm here on a case.

174
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:34,174
A new case, just this
morning, a homicide,

175
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:35,976
and you'll never guess the Vic's name.

176
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:37,144
When you talked to

177
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:40,447
this Goldfarb lady at the restaurant,

178
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:42,415
she gave you a full alibi for Emmit.

179
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:45,452
Yeah, that's it. Spoke
for 20 minutes at least.

180
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:47,021
Nice lady, real sophisticated.

181
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:49,623
Said they'd been there
since 6:15 approx,

182
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,091
maybe even 5:55.

183
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:53,092
Her and Mr. Feltz and Mr. Stussy,

184
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:55,361
which, like I said,
you'll never guess what.

185
00:16:55,396 --> 00:16:58,230
Well, thing is, he just confessed.

186
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,598
- Who?
- Emmit.

187
00:16:59,634 --> 00:17:01,801
Just walked in off the street,
told me the whole story,

188
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:04,003
even named the murder
weapon. So I'm wondering,

189
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:06,739
how come this lady alibis
him when he says he's guilty?

190
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,142
It's a puzzler.

191
00:17:09,177 --> 00:17:11,510
Maybe bring her back
in and ask her yourself.

192
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:13,272
Yeah, sounds right.

193
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:15,195
Wait, you were saying something before

194
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:16,515
about a new homicide?

195
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:18,484
Yeah. Guy's throat was cut.

196
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:21,287
They found a piece of
glass on the linoleum.

197
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:22,421
What guy?

198
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:24,757
Dentist, lives on a nice quiet street,

199
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,242
but get this, his name...

200
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:28,227
Marvin Stussy.

201
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:31,697
Okay then.

202
00:17:33,163 --> 00:17:34,333
Okay then.

203
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:42,007
Hey, there.

204
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:43,175
Hey.

205
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:44,510
Brought burgers.

206
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:48,480
Aw. Aren't you sweet?

207
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:49,682
Ron drive you?

208
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:51,283
No, took the bus.

209
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,356
So, how's it going?

210
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:59,463
Good, you know.

211
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,193
Think I might put this thing to bed.

212
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:02,424
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

213
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:07,288
Hmm.

214
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:09,601
You know, I was thinking,

215
00:18:09,604 --> 00:18:11,269
maybe drive up to the lake this weekend,

216
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:13,137
do some canoeing? Like
when you were little?

217
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:15,281
- Mom.
- I know, but it'll be fun.

218
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:18,142
Rather go to the mall.

219
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:19,711
The mall?

220
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:21,579
Yeah, with my friends.

221
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:23,075
Oh, I was thinking for us.

222
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:25,538
Okay.

223
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,418
No, no, if you wanna go
to the mall, that's...

224
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,986
Lake sounds...

225
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:31,155
And I know you're not little.

226
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,890
I mean, you're practically all grown up.

227
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:36,827
Phone's for you, Chief. Nope, Deputy.

228
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:38,562
- Hey, Nathan.
- Hey, Donny.

229
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:42,966
Burgle.

230
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:46,007
Oh. hi, thanks for calling me back.

231
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:50,434
That'd be great, if you don't mind.

232
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:51,642
Really help me out.

233
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:54,351
Super, see you then.

234
00:18:57,082 --> 00:18:58,649
Due diligence. Just kicking the tires

235
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:00,484
on Emmit's alibi witness.

236
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,752
Oh.

237
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,357
Heck, I think I might
finally put this thing to bed.

238
00:19:35,953 --> 00:19:38,220
What do we got?

239
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:41,324
Victim's a white male, late fifties.

240
00:19:44,862 --> 00:19:46,429
Wife found him in the kitchen.

241
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:52,000
Jesus.

242
00:19:58,209 --> 00:19:59,674
Prints?

243
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,845
Yeah, we got a good one on the fridge.

244
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,214
Moron got glue on his finger
and he wiped it on the door.

245
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:09,017
What's his name, again?

246
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,819
George.

247
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,890
His last name, asshat.

248
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:18,160
Stussy.

249
00:20:18,195 --> 00:20:19,324
George Stussy.

250
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:23,597
Donny?

251
00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:26,700
Yeah, Chief?

252
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:28,435
Come here, so I don't have to yell.

253
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,642
I think he pooped.

254
00:20:36,364 --> 00:20:37,497
Check with St. Cloud,

255
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,747
see if they found prints at their scene.

256
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:41,448
- That one was a stabbing.
- I know.

257
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:44,252
- Broken glass, right?
- Yeah.

258
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,803
This one's asphyxiation,
just like Burgle's dad.

259
00:20:50,826 --> 00:20:52,927
I'm thinking he's alternating his kills

260
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:54,762
to throw us off the scent.

261
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:56,097
- Who?
- Killer.

262
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:58,532
Killer, singular?

263
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:06,039
This guy must really hate Stussys.

264
00:21:08,124 --> 00:21:10,878
Chief, neighbor says
she saw a maroon Cadillac

265
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:13,547
hauling ass out of here right
before the wife got home.

266
00:21:13,582 --> 00:21:15,389
- She get a plate number?
- You betcha.

267
00:21:47,982 --> 00:21:49,281
About time.

268
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,757
Mrs. Goldfarb? Thanks
again for coming in.

269
00:22:11,793 --> 00:22:14,960
I was very clear with the
other officer last time.

270
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:16,729
You realize memories fade.

271
00:22:16,764 --> 00:22:17,997
Oh, you'll do great.

272
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:19,636
Why don't we talk in my office?

273
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:26,672
So, like I said, I'm just
checking up on a few things.

274
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,542
We've had some developments in the case.

275
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:30,676
And this is a murder?

276
00:22:30,712 --> 00:22:32,111
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:22:32,146 --> 00:22:34,613
Mr. Stussy's brother Raymond,
killed in his own home.

278
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:36,110
- Awful.
- Hmm.

279
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:39,018
If you don't mind me asking,

280
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:40,352
how did you end up having dinner

281
00:22:40,387 --> 00:22:42,287
with Mr. Feltz and
Mr. Stussy that night?

282
00:22:42,323 --> 00:22:45,790
It was a... A mutual
friend introduced us.

283
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:47,692
And what was his name?

284
00:22:47,728 --> 00:22:49,194
Buck Olander.

285
00:22:49,229 --> 00:22:52,163
He's a banker. St. Cloud.

286
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:53,832
So, this was a business dinner?

287
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:56,334
Well, I'm new in town and Buck agreed

288
00:22:56,369 --> 00:22:58,569
to introduce me to some people.

289
00:22:58,605 --> 00:22:59,637
New from where?

290
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:00,705
Does it matter?

291
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:05,110
St. Louis.

292
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:13,651
And you're aware what happened
to Mr. Feltz, subsequently?

293
00:23:13,686 --> 00:23:14,953
His illness?

294
00:23:14,988 --> 00:23:17,789
I heard. Quel dommage.

295
00:23:17,824 --> 00:23:19,823
When it rains, it pours.

296
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:21,480
Sometimes it drizzles.

297
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:23,861
It's a saying.

298
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:27,297
When it rains, it pours.

299
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:30,333
Like a penny saved is a penny earned.

300
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:35,672
In your statement you said

301
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,776
that Mr. Feltz and Mr.
Stussy arrived separately.

302
00:23:38,811 --> 00:23:40,377
Yes, I think that's right.

303
00:23:40,412 --> 00:23:41,611
Who was first?

304
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:42,780
Mr. Feltz.

305
00:23:43,897 --> 00:23:45,382
And how soon after...

306
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:46,884
um...

307
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:48,285
How soon after...

308
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,358
after...

309
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:51,989
- Excuse me a second.
- Yeah.

310
00:23:52,825 --> 00:23:54,658
Perp admitted.

311
00:23:54,693 --> 00:23:55,892
Yep. Donny.

312
00:23:57,162 --> 00:23:58,828
- What's up?
- Manhunt's over.

313
00:23:58,863 --> 00:24:00,297
- There was a manhunt?
- Yeah.

314
00:24:00,332 --> 00:24:02,519
For, like, 30 minutes. Real exciting.

315
00:24:02,522 --> 00:24:04,066
You were right about this case,

316
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,635
it's a real twister.

317
00:24:05,671 --> 00:24:07,657
- I'll let new chief explain.
- My...

318
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,541
Did you tell her, Donny?

319
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:14,891
Well, I solved it.

320
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:15,945
Solved what?

321
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,614
Your murders.

322
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:19,916
The old-timer in Eden
Valley and then the dead PO.

323
00:24:19,951 --> 00:24:21,751
Don't even.

324
00:24:21,787 --> 00:24:23,886
I got the Parking Lot King
in holding, he confessed.

325
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,922
To both?

326
00:24:25,957 --> 00:24:27,812
No, the...

327
00:24:27,815 --> 00:24:29,292
We already established there's proof

328
00:24:29,294 --> 00:24:30,927
Maurice LeFay killed Ennis,

329
00:24:30,962 --> 00:24:33,095
Ray's parolee, and now
Emmit's basically confirming

330
00:24:33,131 --> 00:24:34,763
that the Ray murder was tit for tat.

331
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,967
But we have two new
murders, here and St. Cloud,

332
00:24:38,002 --> 00:24:39,568
both surnamed Stussy,

333
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,971
both picture perfect doubles
of your earlier crimes.

334
00:24:42,006 --> 00:24:43,539
Glass-in-the-neck bleed out,

335
00:24:43,574 --> 00:24:45,294
my stiff with his nose
and mouth glued shut.

336
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,392
How about that?

337
00:24:46,395 --> 00:24:48,110
And your theory is what?

338
00:24:48,146 --> 00:24:50,579
A serial killer with two MOs?

339
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,948
- How does...
- Good going, Chief.

340
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:53,850
- How does that make sense?
- Just listen.

341
00:24:53,885 --> 00:24:55,718
When we arrested this piece of shit,

342
00:24:55,753 --> 00:24:59,222
he had some mail in his trunk
from your stepdad's house.

343
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,358
Yeah, that's right.

344
00:25:02,393 --> 00:25:06,127
And a framed photo of Ray
and his scofflaw girlfriend

345
00:25:06,163 --> 00:25:07,929
from their domicile.

346
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,531
Also, the trunk,

347
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:11,981
full of broken glass, blood, superglue.

348
00:25:11,996 --> 00:25:13,101
Those are facts.

349
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,973
I got... Hold on. I got different facts.

350
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:19,742
Maurice LeFay's fingerprints...

351
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:21,276
He confessed.

352
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,646
My guy. In the car ride
over. All four murders.

353
00:25:24,682 --> 00:25:26,314
- He...
- Cried like a goddamned baby.

354
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,516
You should've seen it.

355
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:30,686
I mean...

356
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:33,255
Who the hell is this
out-of-the-blue guy even?

357
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,423
Donald Wu.

358
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:36,191
Served 22 years beating a guy's skull in

359
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:37,557
with a tire iron.

360
00:25:37,596 --> 00:25:39,795
Been out six months,
living under the highway.

361
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,596
Get this.

362
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:45,267
Said his mom's boyfriend, named Stussy.

363
00:25:45,302 --> 00:25:47,744
Used to diddle him in his
closet after lights out.

364
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,706
- Chief...
- Mmm-mmm.

365
00:25:51,741 --> 00:25:52,740
No.

366
00:25:53,877 --> 00:25:55,643
You said yourself,

367
00:25:55,678 --> 00:25:58,146
the Parking Lot King's
got a two-witness alibi.

368
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,782
So what you're looking
at here is psychology.

369
00:26:00,817 --> 00:26:03,018
He feels guilty, all those years

370
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:05,287
fighting with his loser brother...

371
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:08,456
Finally, guilt gets to him, in he comes.

372
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:09,645
You believe it

373
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:10,992
'cause you got a hard-on for the guy

374
00:26:10,994 --> 00:26:12,160
and you wanna believe it.

375
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:14,495
Okay?

376
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:20,067
Cut him loose, Deputy. We got our man.

377
00:26:21,503 --> 00:26:22,903
That's an order.

378
00:26:32,248 --> 00:26:33,680
Is it gonna be much longer?

379
00:26:33,715 --> 00:26:36,266
I gotta be downtown in an hour.

380
00:26:44,793 --> 00:26:46,327
No.

381
00:26:46,362 --> 00:26:48,195
No. You can go.

382
00:26:56,404 --> 00:26:59,372
Actually, just so I know,

383
00:26:59,407 --> 00:27:02,141
how soon after Mr. Feltz
did Mr. Stussy arrive?

384
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:03,510
Five minutes, maybe.

385
00:27:04,947 --> 00:27:06,813
In your statement you
said a half an hour.

386
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:09,349
Well, I'm sure that's what it was then.

387
00:27:09,384 --> 00:27:11,677
You know how the memory can play tricks.

388
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:15,649
That's another saying.

389
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:21,227
Are you covering for him?

390
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:25,931
I'm gonna go.

391
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:29,201
If you have any more questions,

392
00:27:29,236 --> 00:27:30,784
let my lawyer know.

393
00:28:06,995 --> 00:28:08,675
It's done. They're letting him out.

394
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,766
Doyle'll drive you to meet the Swango,

395
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:15,457
I'm moving to stage five.

396
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:50,192
Loved you in Death of a Salesman.

397
00:28:52,739 --> 00:28:53,805
Hilarious.

398
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:05,383
I'm going to have some tea.
Would you like some tea?

399
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:07,360
No, thanks.

400
00:29:08,422 --> 00:29:10,988
You know why I chose this place?

401
00:29:11,023 --> 00:29:12,289
Were you born here?

402
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,960
Don't be mean. Am I being mean?

403
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:18,763
We could've used a real grenade.

404
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:22,795
No, you're right. My apologies.

405
00:29:24,403 --> 00:29:26,236
It was the Wildcat Regional.

406
00:29:26,272 --> 00:29:28,748
Third runner up, me and Ray.

407
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:31,553
That's why we're here.

408
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,090
That's a bridge tournament.

409
00:29:36,716 --> 00:29:37,785
How quaint.

410
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,884
I've never understood this

411
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,587
repulsive affinity of playing games.

412
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:45,432
Oh, Bridge isn't a game.

413
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:49,166
58 octillion possible deals.

414
00:29:50,064 --> 00:29:51,496
Then you got the human factor.

415
00:29:52,831 --> 00:29:54,965
Symbiosis with your partner.

416
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,468
The cheats and tells of your opponents.

417
00:29:57,503 --> 00:29:58,502
Strategy.

418
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:01,938
That was my strength.

419
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:03,340
Yeah, I can tell.

420
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:07,753
You sure I can't tempt you?

421
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:11,907
It's my mother's recipe.

422
00:30:13,152 --> 00:30:14,451
No? Well...

423
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:17,988
You got it?

424
00:30:19,257 --> 00:30:20,256
Yes.

425
00:30:21,043 --> 00:30:22,676
I have it,

426
00:30:22,718 --> 00:30:27,226
but I'd like to offer you
something else instead.

427
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,400
A job.

428
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:38,390
Remind me what you do again.

429
00:30:38,414 --> 00:30:41,149
I work for a company called Narwal.

430
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:46,272
No, you don't.

431
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:48,717
You tell people you work
for a company called Narwal

432
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:50,520
'cause people look
past middle management.

433
00:30:52,223 --> 00:30:54,225
But I know a boss when I see one.

434
00:30:57,528 --> 00:30:59,794
Very good.

435
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:01,896
You just added a zero to your salary.

436
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:05,167
That's okay.

437
00:31:05,202 --> 00:31:06,334
I already got a job.

438
00:31:07,704 --> 00:31:09,204
Blackmailing you.

439
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:11,173
All right now.

440
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:12,541
And tell me.

441
00:31:14,078 --> 00:31:16,445
How do you think
that's going to play out

442
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,780
from a strategist's point of view?

443
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:23,389
Well,

444
00:31:23,405 --> 00:31:25,420
there's a 60% chance that briefcase

445
00:31:25,456 --> 00:31:28,156
is full of your dirty underwear.

446
00:31:28,192 --> 00:31:30,225
And since I don't see your associate,

447
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,293
I figure he's out there
somewhere watching us.

448
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,561
Maybe even with a rifle.

449
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:37,752
Go on.

450
00:31:39,903 --> 00:31:42,588
And if I brought the books
and the hard drives with me,

451
00:31:43,845 --> 00:31:45,474
you're gonna give your man a signal

452
00:31:47,345 --> 00:31:48,505
and he's gonna take the shot.

453
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:53,248
And did you? Bring them?

454
00:31:58,789 --> 00:31:59,944
The problem is

455
00:32:01,225 --> 00:32:03,984
this is a public place
with a lot of witnesses.

456
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:07,295
And you're a pretty
distinctive-looking guy.

457
00:32:09,165 --> 00:32:10,365
Am I?

458
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:14,702
Look around.

459
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:36,057
Nice.

460
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:39,527
There, you see,

461
00:32:39,562 --> 00:32:41,562
I'm guessing the Wildcat Regional

462
00:32:41,597 --> 00:32:43,221
was an amateur affair.

463
00:32:45,534 --> 00:32:47,033
Semi-professional.

464
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:12,461
See, you got cocky.

465
00:33:13,594 --> 00:33:15,728
Forgot to count all
the pieces on the board.

466
00:33:17,566 --> 00:33:18,965
The cards I'm not showing.

467
00:33:21,135 --> 00:33:22,622
So now it's just me and you.

468
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:25,572
And I want my money.

469
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:38,307
You just added another
two zeros to your salary.

470
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:42,288
What's in the briefcase?

471
00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:43,573
Where are my things?

472
00:33:44,593 --> 00:33:46,492
Well, now, Willy Loman,

473
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:47,727
I feel I ought to punish you

474
00:33:47,762 --> 00:33:50,079
for not doing what you were told.

475
00:33:50,082 --> 00:33:51,931
So maybe I share one of the hard drives

476
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:53,063
with the police.

477
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:57,836
You...

478
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:01,039
You can't win this game,
you do realize that?

479
00:34:01,075 --> 00:34:02,674
I thought you didn't play games.

480
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,042
I'm offering you a fortune,

481
00:34:04,078 --> 00:34:06,579
you're asking for a
piggy bank, pourquoi?

482
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,076
Because I wanna hurt you.

483
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:13,933
Not be your pet.

484
00:34:16,457 --> 00:34:18,224
I wanna look you in the face

485
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:20,363
and rip out something you love.

486
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:25,792
I didn't kill him.

487
00:34:27,502 --> 00:34:29,934
You do know that? It was Emmit.

488
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:34,925
Wasn't Emmit who came
for me in the precinct.

489
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:38,309
Wasn't Emmit who flipped that bus.

490
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:45,049
You know,

491
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:48,786
I didn't have any
feeling about you before,

492
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:51,088
but now I'm starting
to really dislike you.

493
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:55,293
Good.

494
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,967
I'll give you till
tomorrow to get my money.

495
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,604
You want me to stay?

496
00:35:45,552 --> 00:35:46,718
Should I sit?

497
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,757
Got married straight out of high school

498
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:55,626
to a guy I knew since
fifth grade summer camp.

499
00:35:57,096 --> 00:35:58,796
Summer wedding.

500
00:35:58,832 --> 00:36:00,531
Guests were mostly mosquitoes.

501
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:04,335
We had a baby boy, then a toddler,

502
00:36:05,304 --> 00:36:06,636
now a teen.

503
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:10,741
Last year, my husband phones me at work,

504
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:12,609
tells me he's got a
boyfriend named Dale.

505
00:36:12,644 --> 00:36:14,811
Says they're moving in together.

506
00:36:14,847 --> 00:36:16,062
Says he's sorry.

507
00:36:17,215 --> 00:36:18,815
He loves me, but not like that.

508
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:22,976
"What else is there?" I say.

509
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:27,570
You think the world is something,

510
00:36:27,573 --> 00:36:29,481
then it turns out to be something else.

511
00:36:37,603 --> 00:36:39,469
You're free to go.

512
00:36:39,505 --> 00:36:40,437
What?

513
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,739
No, I'm...

514
00:36:43,775 --> 00:36:46,697
I told you what happened, what I did.

515
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,177
I want no special treatment
just 'cause I'm rich.

516
00:36:49,213 --> 00:36:50,546
You treat me like every other felon.

517
00:36:50,548 --> 00:36:52,481
No, you're not getting it.

518
00:36:52,517 --> 00:36:54,316
Somebody came, just not who you thought.

519
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:57,219
What are you talking about?

520
00:36:57,254 --> 00:36:58,843
Since you confessed,

521
00:36:58,846 --> 00:37:01,146
two other fellas named
Stussy have been murdered.

522
00:37:03,528 --> 00:37:05,060
The first with the copycat approach

523
00:37:05,095 --> 00:37:06,796
mimicking my stepdad.

524
00:37:06,831 --> 00:37:10,332
The second made to look like
your brother's neck puncture.

525
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:12,835
Whoever it was, planted
evidence in both places

526
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,370
to make it look like all this
is the work of a serial killer

527
00:37:15,406 --> 00:37:17,205
who hates people surnamed Stussy.

528
00:37:19,176 --> 00:37:20,909
Are you saying that people are dead

529
00:37:20,945 --> 00:37:22,377
because they've got my name?

530
00:37:23,347 --> 00:37:24,346
Yes.

531
00:37:25,782 --> 00:37:27,567
But the real beauty of it is

532
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,918
they gave us a suspect and he confessed.

533
00:37:29,954 --> 00:37:31,119
He...

534
00:37:31,155 --> 00:37:32,554
Confessed to all four murders.

535
00:37:33,623 --> 00:37:35,736
Some three-time loser

536
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:37,479
who couldn't make it
in the modern world.

537
00:37:37,482 --> 00:37:39,194
What must they've paid him?

538
00:37:39,229 --> 00:37:41,296
Must've been a heck of a price.

539
00:37:41,332 --> 00:37:42,564
But it worked.

540
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:47,669
That confession, combined
with the evidence I mentioned,

541
00:37:47,704 --> 00:37:49,571
means he goes to prison
the rest of his life

542
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:50,738
and you go home.

543
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,248
Who is he?

544
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,420
Who?

545
00:38:06,456 --> 00:38:08,591
The master pulling the strings.

546
00:38:09,758 --> 00:38:11,058
That fella I met in your office

547
00:38:11,094 --> 00:38:12,426
who said he sold ladies shoes,

548
00:38:12,462 --> 00:38:14,295
this is him, right?

549
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,662
His work.

550
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:21,768
I'm...

551
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:26,922
I'm...

552
00:38:30,981 --> 00:38:31,980
I...

553
00:38:36,385 --> 00:38:37,506
I'm sorry.

554
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:14,980
The problem is not that
there is evil in the world,

555
00:40:15,015 --> 00:40:17,449
the problem is that there is good.

556
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,453
Because otherwise, who would care?

557
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:52,149
Reinforcements have arrived.

558
00:40:52,185 --> 00:40:53,562
Whiskey or beer?

559
00:40:55,188 --> 00:40:58,556
Well, you're not supposed
to drink during ovulation,

560
00:40:58,591 --> 00:41:01,301
but at the same time,

561
00:41:01,304 --> 00:41:03,094
if I have to look that thing in the eye

562
00:41:03,096 --> 00:41:04,228
sober one more time,

563
00:41:04,263 --> 00:41:05,496
I may jump out a window,

564
00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:08,082
so Moscow Mule and make it ornery.

565
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:11,569
Still punching the clock, huh?

566
00:41:11,604 --> 00:41:14,604
With all the romance of two
lumberjacks chopping wood.

567
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,933
Thank God for K-Y.

568
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:20,069
So when you called, well,
I can't say I was sorry.

569
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,748
One more.

570
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,917
To showing up and fighting back.

571
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,319
Except...

572
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:34,224
It's over. The good guys lost.

573
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:37,494
For the present, but we all
know Jesus wins in the end.

574
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:38,961
I'll drink to that.

575
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:46,236
You know, before you got here,

576
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:48,270
I was thinking, see
Ennis, my step-father,

577
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,305
he wrote these space books...

578
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,473
And I read one of 'em.

579
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,378
The Planet Wyh with the "H" at the end.

580
00:41:56,413 --> 00:42:01,009
And it was about this android,
I guess you call it, who...

581
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:03,918
His master died and he wandered

582
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,455
the universe alone
for two million years.

583
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,639
- Jeez.
- Yeah. And...

584
00:42:09,926 --> 00:42:11,991
And all he could say was, "I can help."

585
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,731
But he couldn't, or
at least he never did.

586
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,367
But he kept on saying it. "I can help."

587
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:20,976
And he kept on failing.

588
00:42:22,105 --> 00:42:24,838
Which is, if I had to define it,

589
00:42:24,874 --> 00:42:26,374
the way I feel most days.

590
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:28,209
Come on now.

591
00:42:28,244 --> 00:42:29,443
And the other days,

592
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:31,745
if I'm being honest, how I feel is...

593
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:35,583
Invisible. Or not invisible.

594
00:42:36,919 --> 00:42:37,985
Unreal.

595
00:42:39,155 --> 00:42:40,721
Does that make sense?

596
00:42:40,756 --> 00:42:42,767
No, ma'am.

597
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,492
Well, there's the fact
that automatic doors

598
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:45,926
never open for me,

599
00:42:45,961 --> 00:42:49,063
and the sensors on, like, the...

600
00:42:49,098 --> 00:42:51,131
The sink or the soap
dispenser never sense me.

601
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:53,434
And when I make a call,
no one can ever hear me.

602
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:58,539
So I got this theory, in private,

603
00:43:00,642 --> 00:43:02,657
that I don't actually exist.

604
00:43:12,053 --> 00:43:13,186
Right.

605
00:43:20,662 --> 00:43:22,128
I got a whole speech I could make.

606
00:43:22,163 --> 00:43:23,330
Oh, please don't.

607
00:43:25,678 --> 00:43:27,701
Here's what I think you need. Stand up.

608
00:43:29,104 --> 00:43:31,131
- Why?
- I wanna show you somethin'.

609
00:43:37,411 --> 00:43:38,577
What?

610
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:11,143
Okay?

611
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:18,784
Better get to the ladies
and clean yourself up

612
00:44:18,786 --> 00:44:20,085
'cause we got some heavy drinking to do

613
00:44:20,087 --> 00:44:21,653
and I can't have people
thinking I forced you.

614
00:44:25,225 --> 00:44:26,357
Thanks.

615
00:44:26,393 --> 00:44:28,126
Yeah.

616
00:44:28,162 --> 00:44:29,895
We got the bond of the uniform.

617
00:44:31,398 --> 00:44:32,898
Plus, I like you.

618
00:44:35,836 --> 00:44:37,068
I like you, too.

619
00:44:58,724 --> 00:45:00,090
Ugh!

620
00:45:00,126 --> 00:45:00,991
Great.

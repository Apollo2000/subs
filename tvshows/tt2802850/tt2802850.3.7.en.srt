Shit.

<i>...The millipede does possess glands</i>

00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:08,788

Mrs. Curtis.

No! No! No! No! No!

- No! No! No! No!

Ah! Speak of the devil.

00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:00,970
Here's the headhunter himself,
as promised.

20
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:03,331
- Sorry. Sorry.
- All right. Told her you were

21
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,441
- reviewing the court release.
- Huh?

22
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:07,936
- The...
- Oh. Yeah.

23
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:11,123
So...

24
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:15,100
Is it Mrs. Goldfarb, or...

25
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,382
- My friends call me Ruby.
- Ruby.

26
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:21,507
That's swell. I could use a drink.
Anybody else?

27
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:22,634
We're drinking rose.

28
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,236
Old-fashioned on the rocks.

29
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:31,125
Sy tells me you're in self-storage.

30
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:34,913
Me and my late husband.
We started in mortuaries.

31
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:37,114
Ah, just another kind
of storage, I suppose.

32
00:04:38,383 --> 00:04:40,413
That's what my Tovaldt used to say.

33
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:42,406
Both good businesses. Steady.

34
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:44,888
Mmm. Heck, maybe
we should be buying you out.

35
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:46,823
- Oh...
- Uh...

36
00:04:46,926 --> 00:04:48,391
Well, now, Emmit...

37
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,651
I know, I know. That's not the plan.

38
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:53,922
But... Thanks. Heck,

39
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,852
you don't get where I am
by sticking to the plan.

40
00:04:56,935 --> 00:04:58,868
- Hmm.
- To new friends.

41
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:00,002
New friends.

42
00:05:39,308 --> 00:05:42,542
He's dead, in case you couldn't tell.

43
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:51,052
Lady cop who printed you
said you're a little tender.

44
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:54,487
Around the middle, maybe?

45
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,123
Got some bruises.

46
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,782
See, I'm a simple guy.

47
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,814
When it snows, I put on boots.

48
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,891
Sun comes out, I wear shades.

49
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:13,834
I see a girl like you and a
guy like that, I think...

50
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:17,974
"Now, how's a working man
with hillbilly hair and a beer belly

51
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,778
"land Miss State Penitentiary 2010?"

52
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,883
And then I get the record.

53
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:30,750
I see the girl
has got 18 months' probation

54
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,322
and the guy with his head half cut off

55
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,830
was the shlub who signed the forms.

56
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:39,362
Now it starts to make sense.

57
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,365
I mean, stop me if I get it wrong,

58
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,439
if this wasn't some kind of tit-for-tat

59
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:46,337
handjob-gets-you-work-release program...

60
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:50,373
If it was, whatever.
Love story of the century.

61
00:06:53,944 --> 00:06:56,378
No? That's what I thought.

62
00:06:57,682 --> 00:07:00,657
See? Simple things.

63
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:03,196
Cause and effect, crime and punishment.

64
00:07:03,343 --> 00:07:05,439
Mash a potato, you know what you get?

65
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:07,189
Mashed potatoes.

66
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,088
I want a lawyer.

67
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:14,257
Yeah?

68
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:16,960
Well, that's a mistake.

69
00:07:19,402 --> 00:07:20,820
Think it through.

70
00:07:21,738 --> 00:07:24,348
The evidence, shared domicile,

71
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:27,090
you, a known felon,
spinning a web of lies.

72
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:30,239
History of domestic violence
with a beer-drinking loser.

73
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:32,813
You don't have to be a mathematician
to add two plus two.

74
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:38,337
No. Your best bet?

75
00:07:39,354 --> 00:07:40,611
Tearjerker.

76
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,604
What a monster he was.

77
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:47,893
How he beat you every night
where it wouldn't show.

78
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:02,240
Okay. We're done.

79
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:06,277
I'll leave the picture,

80
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:09,201
in case you're the type of girl
who likes to take pride in her work.

81
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:50,533
This can't be good, right?

82
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:20,028
Should I start, or...

83
00:09:20,063 --> 00:09:22,931
- Is she mine?
- No, you got the other one.

84
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:26,502
Okay, here's what's gonna happen.

85
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:29,065
St. Cloud Homicide's
gonna handle this case,

86
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:31,205
and you're both gonna go back to...

87
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:32,554
What'd you do?

88
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:33,908
Traffic enforcement.

89
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:36,218
- Traffic enforcement.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:38,679
Gloria Burgle, Chief of
the Eden Valley police.

91
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:40,247
For about another week.

92
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:42,359
Eight days, yes, sir,
including Christmas,

93
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:43,585
which, you might be surprised to hear,

94
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:46,169
is a pretty busy day for misdemeanor
infractions in Eden Valley,

95
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:48,855
mostly surrounding too much eggnog
and a Class C motor vehicle.

96
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,189
Is she kidding?

97
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:51,591
She likes to think she's a smart one.

98
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:53,517
Anyhoo, given the preciousness of time,

99
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,595
I'd like to talk to
the suspect, Nikki Swango,

100
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,986
preferably right now.

101
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:58,244
I just talked to her.

102
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,670
Which, I'm sure,
was enlightening for her,

103
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:01,348
but without all the proper nuance.

104
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:03,180
See, I got a paper grid that lays out

105
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:05,679
all the inter-related parties
delineating their personal

106
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:07,250
and professional relationship
to the murders.

107
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:08,833
It's a substantial document.

108
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,906
"Murders," plural?

109
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,500
- No.
- Yes, sir. Three so far.

110
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:14,773
The first victim being
Ennis Stussy of Eden Valley,

111
00:10:14,808 --> 00:10:16,207
which, again, is my purview.

112
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:19,277
Ennis, a green grocer,
was suffocated by Maurice LeFay,

113
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:20,902
a, last I checked, resident of St. Cloud

114
00:10:20,957 --> 00:10:22,660
and repeat offender who was on probation

115
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,288
under the supervision of Ray Stussy,
our current victim.

116
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,183
Maurice LeFay,
in case you were wondering,

117
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:29,219
also died under
mysterious circumstances,

118
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,487
making him victim number three.

119
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:31,789
Allegedly.

120
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:34,230
And at the heart of the case
is what we believe to be a rivalry

121
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,336
between Ray Stussy
and his brother, Emmit,

122
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:37,961
the parking lot king of Minnesota.

123
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:39,462
I know who Emmit Stussy is.

124
00:10:39,497 --> 00:10:41,585
Then you can understand
how a rich man like that,

125
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:43,663
pillar of the community,
might be targeted by his younger,

126
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:45,000
less successful brother.

127
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:46,702
A brother with possibly shaky morals

128
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:48,471
and access to wily criminal elements.

129
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:50,105
Unfortunately, Ray's plan,

130
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:51,674
as far as I can tell,
went off the rails,

131
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:53,345
resulting in the death
of my random Stussy

132
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,299
and the reason I'm sitting here today.

133
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,727
Only an intellectual could
believe something so stupid.

134
00:11:04,387 --> 00:11:06,988
Well, sirs, as you'll see
if you try working the angles,

135
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:08,790
the alternatives make even less sense.

136
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:10,459
Especially given the new victim...

137
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:12,257
Uh...

138
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:14,366
Get back to traffic enforcement.

139
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,764
Yes, sir.

140
00:11:19,349 --> 00:11:21,983
And you, I got no jurisdiction over you,

141
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:24,732
but this is St. Cloud Metro's case now.

142
00:11:24,907 --> 00:11:27,445
So, if we need you or your grid,

143
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:28,820
we'll give you a holler.

144
00:11:28,945 --> 00:11:30,609
- Sir...
- You're dismissed.

145
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,479
Wait for me outside.

146
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:42,714
I guess that's it then.

147
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:44,768
We need to find Emmit.
Try his office or at home.

148
00:11:44,815 --> 00:11:47,426
Tell him Ray died under suspicious
circumstance, Gauge his reaction.

149
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:48,979
- Are you sure? That's...
- I'm gonna brace the girlfriend,

150
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:50,450
try to get some answers. Go.

151
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,020
Either you're on vacation
till the handover,

152
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:58,770
take some time to grieve,
be with your family,

153
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:00,582
merry Christmas, all that,

154
00:12:00,774 --> 00:12:03,059
or start looking for another job.

155
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:05,254
Happy holidays, sir.

156
00:12:05,545 --> 00:12:06,777
That's what I thought.

157
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:27,931
Whoo! I tell ya, they got me running

158
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:29,899
six different directions today.

159
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:32,172
- How you doing?
- Form.

160
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,786
Yeah, I'm supposed to talk
to Swango, looks like, Nikki.

161
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:38,282
Form.

162
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:39,591
I don't...

163
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:42,412
Nobody told me I needed a...

164
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:47,439
Is that an interview request form, or...

165
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:48,918
It's the blue one.

166
00:12:51,923 --> 00:12:54,156
See the shift sergeant. One floor up.

167
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,741
You know, is there any way?

168
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:00,762
I was supposed
to be out of here an hour ago,

169
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:03,843
Christmas Eve and all that.
My boy at home. He's 12.

170
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:05,700
I think I got a picture here somewhere.

171
00:13:09,224 --> 00:13:11,424
One flight up, you said? All right.

172
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:21,281
Nope.

173
00:13:22,484 --> 00:13:24,350
Nope.

174
00:13:25,487 --> 00:13:26,653
Oh, maybe.

175
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:31,214
Yeah, right, Donny,
like you got a chance there.

176
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:36,662
Yeah, Eden Valley Police. What can I...

177
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:40,795
Oh, yeah? Jeez.

178
00:13:41,473 --> 00:13:44,742
Did they take anything,
or you just think it's vandalism?

179
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:49,660
Okay, hang tight. There in a jiff.

180
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:02,139
_

181
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:29,187
Ah, God dang it!

182
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:50,032
Firing on all cylinders today, Mashman.

183
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:10,751
Hello?

184
00:15:47,454 --> 00:15:49,198
Uh, sir?

185
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:52,424
- You're not supposed to be in here.
- Shh.

186
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:57,468
Uh, you can't be in here, sir.

187
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,820
Library is closed.

188
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:04,571
You're here.

189
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,838
Well, sir, I work here, so that's...

190
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:12,275
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

191
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:17,347
Sir?

192
00:16:19,284 --> 00:16:20,716
You're gonna have to leave.

193
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,141
I just did.

194
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:28,904
What?

195
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,664
You asked, then I left.

196
00:16:32,098 --> 00:16:33,597
I'm not here.

197
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:38,366
Well, that's... I see you.

198
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,580
You think you see me.

199
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:44,338
But your eyes are lying.

200
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:46,790
That's...

201
00:16:48,945 --> 00:16:51,470
Sir, in another three minutes,

202
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:53,517
we're gonna have a real...

203
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,523
You should think of what you're doing.

204
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:03,727
Man, alone,

205
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,805
in a room full of books,

206
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:08,313
talking to himself.

207
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:13,774
In my country we call such people...

208
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:16,415
<i>bezumets.</i>

209
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:21,046
Or maybe you think I'm your conscience.

210
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:25,116
How's that story,
the Ghost of Christmas Past?

211
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:27,343
I...

212
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,446
You came back for a reason,
I'm thinking.

213
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:35,720
The gun.

214
00:17:36,774 --> 00:17:38,156
It's there on the counter.

215
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,229
Pick it up, your gun.

216
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,047
Now go.

217
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:51,790
You don't seem like a guy
who's ready to retire.

218
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:54,483
Well, you know, Sy thinks it's time.

219
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,437
That's funny.

220
00:18:55,462 --> 00:18:57,897
- He said that you...
- No. W-We're both... We're both ready.

221
00:18:57,922 --> 00:19:00,131
That's... We agreed this was the way to...

222
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:01,788
Quit while we're ahead.

223
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:03,153
What's the saying?

224
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:05,254
"If you love something, let it go."

225
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:07,136
"If it comes back, it's yours."

226
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:09,621
"If it doesn't,
hunt it down and kill it."

227
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:14,061
Is the version I heard.

228
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:17,933
You can see why
I'm usually the negotiator.

229
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,260
There's something... You've got a...

230
00:19:24,315 --> 00:19:25,830
Oh.

231
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:27,327
That's just...

232
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:30,139
Must be some red wine from lunch.

233
00:19:30,164 --> 00:19:31,278
Mmm.

234
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,959
Any more questions
on the business? Projections?

235
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:36,671
No, it was real thorough,
your presentation.

236
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:39,330
My front office guy
took a look at your numbers

237
00:19:39,365 --> 00:19:40,932
and he said your books really sing.

238
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:44,220
Mmm. Well then,
I say we call it a night.

239
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:46,868
And I'll get our attorney
started on the paperwork.

240
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:48,640
Sy said your husband died.

241
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,167
- That's not... We don't need to...
- That's okay. No.

242
00:19:54,547 --> 00:19:59,564
My Tovaldt, it'll be a year
in May, he passed.

243
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:02,134
- Do you have a... Oh.
- Stella.

244
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:06,287
Twenty-five years. She left last week.

245
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,614
Sex tape.

246
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:09,991
- That's...
- Not a real one, of course.

247
00:20:10,052 --> 00:20:13,049
I mean, it was a real sex tape,
just not my, you know...

248
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:17,252
Forgery, to the end of
securing a payout which...

249
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:20,703
You know, that's the price of it,
I guess, being rich.

250
00:20:21,566 --> 00:20:23,465
- I don't know.
- Enemies, I'm saying.

251
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,240
Not at first.
First come the well-wishers

252
00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:26,542
with their fake smiles.

253
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:27,943
Then the richer you get,

254
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,878
here come the deadbeats
with their hands out...

255
00:20:29,913 --> 00:20:31,379
You know, it's getting pretty late.

256
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:33,662
And then the jackals,
laughing in the dark,

257
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:36,384
trying to pick the meat off your bones.

258
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:37,619
Check, please!

259
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,688
Money is a blessing and a curse.

260
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,954
No, don't blame money. It's people.

261
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:42,946
Mmm.

262
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:46,212
Sore losers making up stories
how we're villains,

263
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:48,556
the dreamers, the hard workers,

264
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:51,951
in the office before dawn,
toiling, saving,

265
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:54,046
like Ebenezer Scrooge and the like.

266
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:56,904
- Have you heard of the vile maxim?
- No.

267
00:20:57,107 --> 00:20:59,834
"All for ourselves
and nothing for other people

268
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:03,166
"is the vile maxim
of the masters of mankind."

269
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,870
You think a rich man wrote that?

270
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:08,421
No, it was the others.

271
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:11,546
The grubby hands outside the glass,
trying to get in,

272
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,120
- putting their filthy peckers...
- What the Christ?

273
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:18,735
This is bordering on harassment now.

274
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:19,868
What's happening?

275
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:22,060
Uh, nothing. Just a misunderstanding.

276
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:23,727
Excuse me for a moment.

277
00:21:36,275 --> 00:21:38,193
You remind me a little of my husband.

278
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:48,632
You two would've
gotten along really well.

279
00:22:09,474 --> 00:22:11,329
- Sir.
- It's Ray.

280
00:22:13,678 --> 00:22:15,144
Mr. Stussy, your brother...

281
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:16,845
I've been here since 6:00.

282
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:18,589
Huh?

283
00:22:18,718 --> 00:22:20,484
Just been sitting here
all night, gabbing.

284
00:22:20,685 --> 00:22:22,502
Sy'll tell you. Business.

285
00:22:22,787 --> 00:22:26,408
Or more social I guess,
I had a few drinks.

286
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:32,259
Yes, sir. I'm sorry to say

287
00:22:32,395 --> 00:22:33,931
your brother, I'm afraid, he's deceased.

288
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:36,064
We found his body earlier this evening.

289
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:39,299
Raymond.

290
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:41,502
Yes, sir, I'm sorry for your loss.

291
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,955
It's that girlfriend, the criminal.

292
00:22:48,516 --> 00:22:50,717
You should bring her in,
put the cuffs on.

293
00:22:50,814 --> 00:22:52,080
If anyone had motive...

294
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:54,269
Motive for what, sir? I never said...

295
00:22:54,294 --> 00:22:56,683
We're upset. Alcohol's been shared...

296
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:58,585
I just meant if...

297
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:02,601
Are you saying he had a heart attack?

298
00:23:02,817 --> 00:23:06,785
Uh... No, sir, we're thinking foul play.

299
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:09,198
See? I told you that girl was no good.

300
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:12,049
Some kind of a black widow,
using my brother to get...

301
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:14,424
- Sir...
- We're upset.

302
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:16,346
It's big news.

303
00:23:16,776 --> 00:23:18,674
A beloved brother dying suddenly?

304
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:20,943
Any kind of statement you need from us,

305
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:23,973
talk to Bruce Lipshitz at
Green, Greene and Gruene.

306
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:26,325
If you don't mind me asking, Mr. Stussy,

307
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:28,098
when was the last time
that you saw your brother?

308
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:29,877
Like I said, call Bruce Lipshitz...

309
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:31,182
We've been here all night.

310
00:23:31,213 --> 00:23:33,122
Otherwise, thank you
for the information.

311
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:36,822
We're devastated, obviously.
He was a real saint, Ray.

312
00:23:37,127 --> 00:23:40,320
Troubled, but, you know, he meant well.

313
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:43,156
- He was my brother.
- I'm gonna take my friend home now.

314
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:51,351
Yeah.

315
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:53,930
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
He was acting...

316
00:23:55,048 --> 00:23:56,413
Kind of weird.

317
00:23:59,215 --> 00:24:01,371
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Hold on.

318
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,250
Officer Winnie Lopez, St. Cloud Metro.

319
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:05,085
I'm wondering if you might have a minute

320
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:06,687
to answer a few questions.

321
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,326
I'll call Kitson in the morning,

322
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:35,006
assuming you wanna bury Ray
in the family plot.

323
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,778
And I don't need to know where you...

324
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,215
I'll talk to the widow,

325
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:47,719
circle back, in case the cops wanna...

326
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,953
You got there at 6:00, like you said.

327
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:56,088
You think this was him, Varga?

328
00:24:56,594 --> 00:24:58,182
After what happened to Irv,

329
00:24:58,362 --> 00:25:00,298
trying to get to you, keep us from...

330
00:25:00,323 --> 00:25:01,846
What's your angle here?

331
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,933
- My...
- Your angle.

332
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:07,034
You don't think it's funny, the timing?

333
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,631
Ray coming to the party,
demanding money,

334
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:12,858
him and his girl, with us in the black,

335
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,623
and how he gained access
to my safety deposit box?

336
00:25:17,092 --> 00:25:19,873
- I don't...
- Not to mention things you said to me.

337
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,584
Accusations, you might say,
about Ermentraub

338
00:25:23,753 --> 00:25:25,650
and who it was that urged caution

339
00:25:25,675 --> 00:25:27,120
as opposed to rushing in.

340
00:25:27,272 --> 00:25:28,503
Blaming me, in other words.

341
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:32,977
I was thinking, maybe...

342
00:25:34,383 --> 00:25:36,571
you and Ray...

343
00:25:37,561 --> 00:25:38,661
What?

344
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:41,335
You and Ray.

345
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:43,577
Me and Ray?

346
00:25:44,236 --> 00:25:47,297
Is that what he's telling you? Varga?

347
00:25:47,322 --> 00:25:48,945
- 'Cause that's just crazy.
- Is it?

348
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,369
You really think I'm...

349
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:54,290
In the face of all logic,

350
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:56,514
that somehow I decided, me,

351
00:25:56,712 --> 00:25:59,790
the partner in a multi-million
dollar corporation,

352
00:25:59,876 --> 00:26:02,087
that I decided to what, turn on you?

353
00:26:02,355 --> 00:26:04,745
Join forces with your leptard brother

354
00:26:04,902 --> 00:26:06,660
and his syphilitic floozy,

355
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,134
so I could turn millions into thousands?

356
00:26:09,677 --> 00:26:11,210
What's the math there?

357
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,699
I'm sorry. I just...

358
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,880
No. I know.

359
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:27,866
It's been a long...
The pressure I'm under...

360
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,300
Now this.

361
00:26:30,404 --> 00:26:31,903
No, we both feel it.

362
00:26:32,021 --> 00:26:33,842
Not knowing who to trust.

363
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,207
Me.

364
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:39,030
You can always trust me.

365
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,756
Which is why I'm more
convinced now than ever,

366
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:45,749
we gotta hit the eject button here

367
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:49,185
on the whole... Take the money and run.

368
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:53,077
- The widow Goldfarb.
- And I know you got reservations

369
00:26:53,102 --> 00:26:55,876
about selling and putting her
in harm's way, a bystander,

370
00:26:55,901 --> 00:26:58,147
but I really think this is...

371
00:26:58,298 --> 00:26:59,813
What choice do we have?

372
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:02,077
We're fighting for our lives here.

373
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:07,004
Meat from the bones.

374
00:27:13,623 --> 00:27:15,122
You want me to call Stella?

375
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,986
I'm sure, given the circumstances,

376
00:27:19,393 --> 00:27:22,424
maybe this leads to reconciliation.

377
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:25,687
No, I just want to be alone right now.

378
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:33,594
Anything you need, day or night...

379
00:28:14,507 --> 00:28:15,940
How do you feel?

380
00:28:19,446 --> 00:28:20,512
Free.

381
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:29,362
When I was a kid,

382
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:33,300
whenever I had a nightmare,

383
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:36,744
my mother would sit
at the foot of the bed

384
00:28:36,843 --> 00:28:38,477
and say a little rhyme.

385
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,518
"There was a crooked man

386
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:46,292
"and he walked a crooked mile

387
00:28:47,121 --> 00:28:49,980
"and he found a crooked sixpence

388
00:28:50,141 --> 00:28:52,714
"besides a crooked stile,

389
00:28:53,237 --> 00:28:55,312
"and he bought a crooked cat,

390
00:28:55,531 --> 00:28:57,531
"which caught a crooked mouse,

391
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:01,055
<i>"and they all lived together</i>

392
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,480
<i>"in a little crooked house."</i>

393
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:05,168
There you are.

394
00:29:05,322 --> 00:29:07,894
I was getting worried.

395
00:29:08,892 --> 00:29:11,059
You just missed the girls.

396
00:29:12,496 --> 00:29:14,617
They came by for a...

397
00:29:15,311 --> 00:29:17,202
surprise visit.

398
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:22,002
I said you had a dinner.

399
00:29:23,172 --> 00:29:25,593
May be back by 8:00.

400
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:27,341
Anyhoo...

401
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,745
You just missed them.

402
00:29:33,548 --> 00:29:35,748
Oh. But...

403
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:38,746
we made butterscotch pudding.

404
00:29:41,055 --> 00:29:43,923
I could fix you a bowl.

405
00:29:50,698 --> 00:29:53,999
Oh! For Pete's sake, hon, what's wrong?

406
00:29:57,571 --> 00:29:58,904
The world.

407
00:30:01,462 --> 00:30:03,228
The world is wrong.

408
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:08,316
What are you saying? Huh?

409
00:30:09,382 --> 00:30:11,676
It looks like my world,

410
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:15,378
but everything's different.

411
00:30:47,998 --> 00:30:50,869
Oh. Uh... Hey there.
Merry Christmas to ya.

412
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:54,894
Um, I'm looking for
a blue form, I guess.

413
00:30:54,949 --> 00:30:56,304
Yeah.

414
00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:59,785
- Yeah, you're not St. Cloud.
- No, that's...

415
00:30:59,897 --> 00:31:01,045
I'm over at Eden Valley,

416
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,654
just in town to interview a prisoner
and they told me that...

417
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,514
Yeah, blue forms
are for St. Cloud officers.

418
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:08,650
Inter-departmental requests,
that's a whole other... Yup.

419
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:11,619
You gotta get your superior officer's
approval on this form

420
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:13,017
before I can give you the blue one.

421
00:31:13,462 --> 00:31:15,195
Well, since I'm Chief of Eden Valley,

422
00:31:15,224 --> 00:31:17,457
couldn't I just, I don't know,
approve myself?

423
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:20,414
You can't do that. That's...

424
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:22,361
Let me guess, against regulations?

425
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:24,853
Darn right it's against regulations.

426
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:29,980
You're gonna need to
get Chief Muderlack's

427
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:31,926
John Hancock on one of these babies,

428
00:31:31,997 --> 00:31:33,160
then I'll give you the yellow one,

429
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:35,528
and then when that's filled,
you get the blue.

430
00:32:48,744 --> 00:32:50,466
My lawyer here?

431
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:53,224
Turn around and put your hands
through the bars.

432
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:55,490
Why?

433
00:32:55,937 --> 00:32:57,937
Gotta check your cell for contraband.

434
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:03,014
How about I just stand in the corner
and mind my own business?

435
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,717
How about you do the electricity dance,

436
00:33:06,092 --> 00:33:07,296
maybe wet your pants?

437
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:21,517
Ow!

438
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,310
Be a good girl now.

439
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:30,426
What's happening? Is that...

440
00:33:30,544 --> 00:33:32,535
- No.
- Easy, son.

441
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,588
Put the syringe down,
on the floor, slowly.

442
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:38,622
- He was doing something.
- Quiet.

443
00:33:39,562 --> 00:33:40,762
On the floor.

444
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:57,106
- Stand down, stand down!
- No! Wait!

445
00:33:57,188 --> 00:33:58,984
Wait, there's an officer,
he just ran out.

446
00:33:59,063 --> 00:34:01,266
I was... Somebody go after him!

447
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,649
- Listen to me!
- God damn it!

448
00:34:04,182 --> 00:34:07,018
No, wait. There's something going on.

449
00:34:07,352 --> 00:34:09,318
- The syringe...
- That's a murder weapon.

450
00:34:09,378 --> 00:34:10,687
He was gonna kill me, the officer.

451
00:34:10,722 --> 00:34:12,057
- He cuffed me here...
- Shut up.

452
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,580
Jesus Christ.

453
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,897
How do I know this ain't yours? Huh?

454
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:24,475
The tape. Check the tape.

455
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:37,243
Son of a bitch.
Who controls that, the camera?

456
00:34:37,372 --> 00:34:39,253
There's a switch on the wall,

457
00:34:39,487 --> 00:34:41,261
but I was here the whole time.

458
00:34:41,518 --> 00:34:43,034
Maybe a hack.

459
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:44,433
What kind of hack?

460
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:46,988
A breach, I mean. Outside agents.

461
00:34:47,055 --> 00:34:48,955
Come on, it's a glitch.

462
00:34:49,257 --> 00:34:51,127
Try watching a movie
at my house some time.

463
00:34:51,338 --> 00:34:53,845
You got a bad cable,
the thing just won't play.

464
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:57,359
Sir, somebody came for that girl.

465
00:34:57,914 --> 00:35:00,023
A man in uniform.

466
00:35:00,402 --> 00:35:02,402
Three murders in, going for a fourth,

467
00:35:02,438 --> 00:35:04,268
either one of your men
or an impersonator.

468
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:07,080
So, it's a conspiracy now?

469
00:35:10,183 --> 00:35:11,950
I'm not talking about certainty.

470
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,815
I'm saying there's doubt.

471
00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:15,600
Three bodies, all connected,

472
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:17,850
and now our chief suspect,
even while she's in custody,

473
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:19,585
has these mysterious circumstances.

474
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:21,296
A syringe full of who knows what.

475
00:35:21,342 --> 00:35:23,041
How do we know this is the end of it?

476
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:24,553
A spree.

477
00:35:24,658 --> 00:35:26,458
The point is, even if it's a coincidence,

478
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:27,692
shouldn't we talk to her?

479
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:29,789
Exhaust all possibilities?

480
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,069
Damn it.

481
00:35:49,409 --> 00:35:50,844
Hey, partner, give us a minute?

482
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:01,657
I don't want you cutting him open.

483
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,360
My Ray.

484
00:36:04,618 --> 00:36:06,102
He doesn't deserve that.

485
00:36:06,193 --> 00:36:09,453
It's a homicide.
We gotta do an autopsy by law.

486
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:17,572
Who was that fella,
the one with the syringe?

487
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:20,833
Nikki.

488
00:36:21,077 --> 00:36:22,224
What?

489
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:23,997
We both know he came here to kill you

490
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,747
for something you saw
or something you know.

491
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:27,778
That... We don't both know that.

492
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,464
I'm sticking to my mashed-potato
theory from earlier.

493
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:33,186
I think your boyfriend
hired a con to rob his brother,

494
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:34,555
and things went from bad to worse.

495
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,785
And then, I don't know,

496
00:36:35,876 --> 00:36:37,621
maybe the brother came back at him hard.

497
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:42,884
Maybe not the brother.

498
00:36:44,306 --> 00:36:45,353
Meaning?

499
00:36:50,204 --> 00:36:51,780
Follow the money.

500
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:53,452
That's all I'll say.

501
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,585
The money? What money?

502
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,218
Come on, it's Christmas Eve.

503
00:37:04,394 --> 00:37:06,240
I got a boy at home
that can't sleep at night

504
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:07,592
'cause somebody murdered his grandpa

505
00:37:07,629 --> 00:37:09,842
and he's afraid they might be
coming for him next.

506
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:16,094
Follow the money.

507
00:37:17,798 --> 00:37:20,064
You know what?
Your probation is revoked.

508
00:37:20,158 --> 00:37:22,166
We're transferring you to the state pen.

509
00:37:22,268 --> 00:37:24,301
Protective custody. You're welcome.

510
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:30,549
You know, forensics is doing
a test on the syringe.

511
00:37:30,677 --> 00:37:32,650
You ask me to place a bet?

512
00:37:32,979 --> 00:37:35,134
I think it takes a jury
10 minutes to convict you,

513
00:37:35,347 --> 00:37:37,847
nutbag with a syringe
or no nutbag with a syringe.

514
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:46,191
You like pie?

515
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:49,212
I'm gonna visit you after the holiday,
bring you some pie.

516
00:37:49,427 --> 00:37:51,305
Maybe we can talk about Ray.

517
00:37:51,797 --> 00:37:54,196
What he liked, who he was.

518
00:37:59,082 --> 00:38:00,268
Coconut.

519
00:38:03,975 --> 00:38:05,608
I like coconut cream pie.

520
00:38:07,645 --> 00:38:09,456
With chocolate flakes on top.

521
00:42:27,897 --> 00:42:32,897

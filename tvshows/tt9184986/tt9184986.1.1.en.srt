TEUTOBURG FOREST, 9 AD

THREE ROMAN LEGIONS
ARE ADVANCING TOWARDS GERMANIA

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,666
THE LARGEST ARMY IN THE WORLD

5
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:35,416
IS MET WITH MANY QUARRELING TRIBES

6
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:44,708
THE ROMANS CALLED THEM BARBARIANS

7
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:50,125
THEIR ENCOUNTER

8
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,666

11
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,416
Come on, I'll get you!

12
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:29,708
Come on!

13
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:30,833
Come on, guys!

14
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:42,750
Ansgar!

15
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,208
Ansgar!

16
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,333
Ansgar, stop!

17
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,625
Hey, little brother.

18
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,125
Are you hunting?

19
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,916
Show me what a good hunter you are!

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,208
Come on.
Show me what a good hunter you are!

21
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,291
A mouse? A frog?

22
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,916
Come on.

23
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,500
Father.

24
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,625
Thusnelda, leave your brother alone.
Let's go.

25
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,166
He'll be here any minute.

26
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,500
Let your hair down.

27
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,208
Welcome to the Cherusci,
Reik Hadgan.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,416
Your long journey was not in vain.
We've been waiting for you.

29
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,250
The hips are a bit small.

30
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,708
Good teeth.

31
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,291
Hmm, strong muscles.

32
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,375
And a firm fist.

33
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't touch her hair, Hadgan.
She's not yours yet.

34
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,791
There's the matter of the price.

35
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:28,708
Don't start again, Hadgan.
The bridal price is set. Five mares.

36
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,541
In times like these?

37
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,666
For a woman so skinny?

38
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:35,791
Think it over.

39
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,666
I'll walk you to the gate.

40
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,375
Should I stab him for you?

41
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,791
I can take care of him.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,208
It's a steep price, but I'll take her.

43
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,541
You're buying more than a wife, Hadgan.
You're buying an ally.

44
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,041
In half a moon, I'll return for her.

45
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,708
She'll obey. You'll see.

46
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,625
Romans!

47
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:42,333
Augustus,
emperor of the holy city of Rome,

48
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,750
has appointed a new governor for Germania.

49
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:49,125
Senator Publius Quinctilius Varus.

50
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,333
Do you understand
what he's saying?

51
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,416
No.

52
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,875
Fuck,
these brutes don't understand a word.

53
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,541
From now on...

54
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,583
Rome will no longer waive your tribute.

55
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,750
Segestes, what is it?

56
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,833
The Romans want tribute.

57
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,875
Varus requires
every tribe to pay the value

58
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,125
of 20 cows

59
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:20,291
or 50 centners of grain.

60
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,308
They want cattle and grain.

61
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,208
Are you blind?

62
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,500
Does it look like
there's anything to take from us?

63
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,166
What?

64
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,583
Say that again.

65
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,375
He wants you to say that again.

66
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,291
You have three days.

67
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,875
They're giving us three days.

68
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:09,958
What?

69
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:15,250
Why are the Romans breaking our agreement?
We made peace with Rome!

70
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,541
Without any tribute.

71
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,458
Enough!

72
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,541
Rome is bleeding us dry
even after I gave them my sons.

73
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,041
What do you want to do?

74
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,333
The Romans have the upper hand

75
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,333
and I don't need
to remind you by how much.

76
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,000
Indeed you don't, Segestes.

77
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,583
- The mother of your sons...
- Do not speak of my wife.

78
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,458
Do not speak of my sons.

79
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,916
Send out messengers.

80
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,750
To every tribe.

81
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,666
We'll put it to them.
Everyone will have a vote.

82
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,791
That's useless.

83
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,583
You know the tribes will never unite.

84
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,791
I will commit them all to fight.

85
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,625
The Romans won't take any more.

86
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
You're the reik.

87
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,041
Reiks!

88
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:14,541
The Romans are now
demanding taxes from all Germanic peoples.

89
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,750
We have to decide tonight.

90
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,958
Will we let the Romans subjugate us...

91
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,625
or will we fight back?

92
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,791
"Germanic"?

93
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,416
Since when are we Germanic?

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,916
The Romans call us that...

95
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,750
because they can't tell us apart.

96
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,041
Then they're blind!

97
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,541
I've got nothing in common
with you Cherusci.

98
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,541
- Or with those damn cattle-thieving Marsi.
- Take that back, Hadgan.

99
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,833
I'd rather drink piss.

100
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:44,916
Then open your mouth!

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,333
- Come on!
- Stop it!

102
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,791
What's wrong with you?

103
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,333
No blood shall be spilled when we meet.

104
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,125
What do we get
if we pay this tribute, anyway?

105
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,333
- Right.
- Even more overfed Romans.

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,583
I say enough is enough.

107
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,166
I say we fight them!

108
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,500
You want to rise up
against the greatest army in the world?

109
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,875
You may as well smash your own heads in.

110
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,041
There are 10,000 Romans here.

111
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,708
5,000 coming across the Lippe.
Do you get it or are you all stupid?

112
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,000
It's peace that we need.

113
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,750
Your idea of peace
amounts to a reeking pile of shit.

114
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,708
I'll pay no tribute!

115
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:35,791
Never!

116
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,250
Never!

117
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,958
We need a decision, reik.

118
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,208
We have an alliance with Rome.

119
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,875
And you gave a great deal for it.

120
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,291
Aldarich of the Marsi.

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,458
No war with the Romans!

122
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,958
We haven't heard
from Hadgan of the Chatti.

123
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,083
No war with the Romans.

124
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,250
The tribes disagree.

125
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,791
What do you say, reik?

126
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:14,125
Will the Cherusci go to war...
without the support of every tribe?

127
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,750
We'll keep the peace.

128
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,750
Were you spying?

129
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,250
So what?

130
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,708
You won't be saying that
once you've been punished.

131
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,750
It's better than being touched by you.

132
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,041
Not one of you has any balls.

133
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,708
My little brother's braver
than all those asses.

134
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,666
Yes, but you're his sister.

135
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,916
And you're a woman.

136
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:39,083
- And our reik isn't a real man.
- Careful, Thusnelda.

137
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,666
I've sworn Segimer an oath.

138
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:43,791
You know that.

139
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,416
We've sworn each other an oath, too.

140
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,500
Or does this not mean anything?

141
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,583
Report me to the reik.

142
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,416
I'm going to.

143
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,625
- I'm waiting.
- I'm going to.

144
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:00,708
Yes, please do.

145
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,833
- I will.
- Please.

146
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,666
- Yeah, I'm going to.
- Then do it.

147
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,208
- Do it. Do it.
- I will. I will.

148
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,625
- Yes, I will.
- Yeah?

149
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,125
- I will.
- Yeah?

150
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,958
- I will. I'm going to.
- Do it.

151
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,083
Hey.

152
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,916
- I have to go.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

153
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,291
I'm so tired of meeting in secret.

154
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,416
Folkwin...

155
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,041
Yeah?

156
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,291
My father has a bridegroom for me.

157
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,625
Who?

158
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,208
A reik.

159
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,083
Who?

160
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:55,958
Hadgan.

161
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,416
The ugly Chatti?

162
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,000
The Reik of the Chatti.

163
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,916
A man like you...

164
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,833
Your father's a brewer.

165
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:13,041
- My father is a lord.
- Your father is a damn Roman-lover

166
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:17,458
who's just waiting for his opportunity
to stab our reik in the back and who...

167
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,916
sells you like an ox.

168
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,625
And what should we do about it?

169
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:22,708
Just run away?

170
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:23,791
Yeah.

171
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,291
I'll steal you.

172
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,458
Here and now.

173
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,875
Come on.

174
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,500
Come on. Come on.

175
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,833
Folkwin.

176
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,416
I want you...

177
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,000
but they'll banish us.

178
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,666
You don't want that.

179
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,625
Maybe the Romans will kill him.

180
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:03,291
You're finally here, my son.

181
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,541
Welcome to Germania.

182
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,416
It's good to see you again
after all this time.

183
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:29,958
I could really use
your strategic advice in this crazy land.

184
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,333
Come here, you little berserker.

185
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,250
Do you know what day it is today?

186
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,583
Today is the day

187
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:54,041
that you get sacrificed to the gods.

188
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,958
First, I'll throw you in the bog,

189
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,291
and then comes Woden.

190
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:04,166
And he will gnaw the flesh...

191
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,250
...from your bones.

192
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,541
And bless us with sunshine
for days and days.

193
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,750
Oh, no, no. No.

194
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,000
Hey. Hey.

195
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,875
As long as I live,

196
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,125
no harm will come to you.

197
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,041
Okay, little brother?

198
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,083
Promise. What's a wolf say?

199
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,000
What's a wolf say?

200
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,583
Folkwin, we have to gather the tribute.

201
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,666
- Order of the reik.
- No.

202
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,375
Get.

203
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,833
We don't even have enough
to feed ourselves, Mother.

204
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,041
We'll give our last goat
to keep the peace if the reik asks us.

205
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,041
No, no, no...

206
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,500
Sheep are going, too.

207
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,458
Where's the rest?

208
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,333
I asked you a question. Where is the rest?

209
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,916
- Slurp it up by yourself at home. Just go.
- Leave my father alone.

210
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,541
You are not the reik.

211
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,083
That's not even enough
to wipe my ass with.

212
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,833
He praises our efforts
toward mutual friendship...

213
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,166
but he's not satisfied.

214
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Go!

215
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,916
What's going on? Wait.

216
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,250
Segestes, tell them to stop.

217
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,833
We have nothing more to give you!

218
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,583
You can't do this!

219
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,500
This isn't even close
to what Rome requires.

220
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,125
He says it's not enough.

221
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,333
We kept our part of the deal
and Rome is now going to.

222
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:43,333
Governor Varus expects
a demonstration of your loyalty to Rome.

223
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,458
Your leader should kiss our standard.

224
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,791
They demand
that you kiss their eagle.

225
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,166
Go on.

226
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,250
On your knees.

227
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,541
Reik.

228
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,750
- No! No!
- Stop it.

229
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,583
- Enough! Calm down, Thusnelda.
- What are you doing?

230
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,041
- Don't!
- Not now.

231
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,291
- Let go of me!
- Hold him down!

232
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:05,833
Ansgar!

233
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,208
Rome wants a sign of our friendship?

234
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,291
Fine!

235
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,416
Rome victorious!

236
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,833
Rome victorious!

237
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,500
No, no, no, no...

238
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,458
Please!

239
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:35,166
Mother,
I didn't want this to happen.

240
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,625
Women of the woods...

241
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,375
take my sacrifice.

242
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,833
Mother of Blood...

243
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,375
give me bravery...

244
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,708
and strength...

245
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,250
until my brother is avenged.

246
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,583
Mother of Fire...

247
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,541
misgivings and doubt be burned...

248
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,125
until my brother is avenged.

249
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,291
And Sister of Wrath...

250
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,458
grant me cruel twins...

251
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,208
death and doom.

252
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,750
And be a good sister to me now...

253
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,916
though I was not.

254
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,750
Though I was not.

255
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:36,541
Most of the tribes
have submitted and paid the tribute.

256
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,208
But not him.

257
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:42,791
But not him.

258
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,541
I'll give you one more chance, barbarian.

259
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,291
Metellus.

260
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,875
The tribes don't understand this.

261
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:22,666
According to their law,
a man cannot sentence another man to die.

262
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,500
There is no Germanic law.

263
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,875
There is only Rome.

264
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,458
They must learn.

265
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:57,083
Ansgar is
a favorite of the gods.

266
00:25:57,791 --> 00:25:59,041
Because he survived?

267
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:03,750
Because he's been to the Kingdom of Death,
and he returned.

268
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,416
It seems he still has a task
to complete up here.

269
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:10,375
What task must I complete?

270
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:12,583
What do the gods want?

271
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,833
Only Woden, the father of the gods,
can see what will happen.

272
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:19,333
That's why he sacrificed his own eye.

273
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,916
If you are truly meant to fight,
the gods will send you a sign.

274
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,541
The past shadows...

275
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:30,500
become the light of coming days.

276
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:34,416
<i>A sign?</i>

277
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:38,000
It's complete bullshit. I hate oracles.

278
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,500
You don't believe the gods send us signs?

279
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:42,500
I believe in my sword.

280
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:44,375
And I will do everything I can

281
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:47,166
to avenge your brother, if you want that.

282
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:52,000
- I don't want to wait for a sign.
- Then let's make our own.

283
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:56,083
We'll capture
the most valuable thing to them.

284
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,416
Their holy symbol.

285
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:03,000
- How will you do that?
- Not me.

286
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,083
Us.

287
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,416
Then they'll all see
that you're more than just a swordsman.

288
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,916
And we show everyone
that Rome is not invincible.

289
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,833
Let's go bird hunting.

290
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:11,916
If we don't do something now...

291
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:15,083
then soon everything
here will belong to them.

292
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,000
But if we manage this...

293
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,333
we're not just taking the Roman eagle,

294
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:22,333
we're taking our people's fear away.

295
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,083
Yes, of course.

296
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:28,333
I mean, there are
worse reasons to die, but...

297
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,708
So this is the plan?

298
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,875
The four of us raid the Roman fort?

299
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,291
<i>How will we even get in?</i>

300
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:39,500
<i>You go through the back,
the two of us through the front.</i>

301
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,875
I've got what every legionnaire wants.

302
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:52,875
Hello.

303
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:56,625
For...

304
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:58,833
Metellus.

305
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:03,666
A slave.

306
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:07,583
For Centurion Metellus.

307
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:12,291
- I wasn't told about this.
- Who is this slave?

308
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,375
Shh. Shh.

309
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,583
A prostitute... a sex slave.

310
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,333
Let them in.

311
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:28,750
If Metellus doesn't have her,
he'll have you.

312
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,083
Yeah.

313
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:35,125
Yeah.

314
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:40,208
Call me a sex slave once more
and I'll cut your balls off.

315
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:43,166
- Say we manage to get inside.
- Mmm.

316
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,041
We just walk up
and take the eagle with us or what?

317
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,708
No, we'll take care of that.

318
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,375
- Halt.
- Hello.

319
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56,458
Hello.

320
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,000
You want an orgy? An orgy?

321
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,666
Orgy? Huh? Huh?

322
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:13,375
Roman shits.

323
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You go first.

324
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,208
Next time, I wanna go through the front.

325
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:27,791
You can touch her, too.
Go ahead. Yeah, yeah. Come.

326
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,750
Here, look, yes. Yes.

327
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:32,125
She's all yours. Look at her.

328
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:34,333
Everything's exactly
where it should be, right?

329
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,333
You two will make sure we have a way out.

330
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:40,500
And how?

331
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:37,208
Quick.

332
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:07,083
Greetings.

333
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:09,875
I found one.

334
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,398
Secure the camp.

335
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:18,250
Secure the camp!

336
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:22,083
<i>Hungry wolves surround you.</i>

337
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,583
Teeth bared, ready to mangle you.

338
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:26,875
What do you do?

339
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:30,291
Close the gate!

340
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:32,833
Quickly!

341
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:46,208
We have to be hungrier
than all the wolves.

342
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,458
Steadfast.

343
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:55,666
If we're ready to give everything...

344
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,875
Fetch water!

345
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,041
Hurry!

346
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:09,500
Then we get what we want,
and the Romans get...

347
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,000
what they deserve.

348
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,708
The eagle is sacred!

349
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:14,958
The guards will all be punished,
just as Mars will punish us.

350
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,291
Give me a hundred legionaries, Governor.

351
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,333
Oh, yes?

352
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:22,083
I will bring it back.

353
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:25,416
How do you know where to go?

354
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:32,916
There are hundreds,
thousands of barbarian villages.

355
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:37,333
I will burn them down, one after another.

356
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,541
And provoke a rebellion?

357
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:44,375
That's exactly what they want.

358
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:49,958
I'll look for them.

359
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:53,375
Give me the Germanic mercenaries.

360
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:56,166
I'll have the eagle back by tomorrow.

361
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:06,083
Go to Adjunct Prefect Talio.

362
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,708
I want you to ride out at dawn.

363
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,833
The Romans feast
on meat, and we only get the bones.

364
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:30,416
Shh! Just be quiet.

365
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:35,041
Where can I find
the leader of your cohort, Talio?

366
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:15,875
What is this?

367
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:18,875
What the hell are you doing?

368
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:22,208
The barbarian started it, dominus.

369
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,500
Is that true?

370
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,708
I asked you if that was true.

371
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:35,625
Forgive me... dominus.

372
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:40,458
They may wear Roman armor,
they may get Roman pay...

373
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:44,250
but they are
and will remain damned barbarians!

374
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:49,666
You're not exactly
a model soldier, either.

375
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:52,083
Dismissed!

376
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:57,583
I have a mission from Varus himself.

377
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:00,541
You and your men will be my support.

378
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:03,000
We ride out at dawn.

379
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:06,958
Men! Ready your mounts!

380
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:09,000
We're off come sunrise.

381
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:11,250
We have to lick
Rome's stinking cunt again.

382
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:22,125
Is that your humble
opinion of our empire, then?

383
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:27,166
You speak our language?

384
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:40,125
That's enough.

385
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,333
They have the eagle!
They have the eagle!

386
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:15,625
The eagle! They have the eagle!

387
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:50,958
Long live Folkwin!

388
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:55,750
Long live Thusnelda!

389
00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:00,333
Long live Hanno and Eigil!

390
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:00,125
You know what this means, don't you?

391
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:02,416
Yeah.

392
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:04,916
That we can beat them.

393
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,541
It means blood.

394
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,125
A lot of blood.

395
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:16,375
Revenge is certain.

396
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,750
How will they even find us, huh?

397
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:29,708
Between us and the Romans,
there are hundreds of villages.

398
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,500
Look there.

399
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,375
Just look.

400
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,083
They're all waiting for a sign! Look!

401
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:45,041
You go this way,
and you, that way.

402
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,291
Come on. Come on.

403
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:41,125
Romans! Romans!

404
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,333
Romans!

405
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:58,333
Bring it inside.

406
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:03,375
Close it!

407
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:57,208
Open the gate.

408
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:05,916
Open the gate!

409
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:43,458
Hello, Father.

409
00:46:44,305 --> 00:47:44,275

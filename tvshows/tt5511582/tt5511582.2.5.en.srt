1
00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:01,563
Previously on "Timeless"...

2
00:00:01,565 --> 00:00:04,492
After Jessica died I
stopped caring. Not anymore.

3
00:00:06,725 --> 00:00:09,187
Jessica? You're actually here.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,890
- Jessica's alive.
- How is that possible?

5
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:12,729
- I'm so sorry.
- Wyatt, I'm thrilled for you.

6
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:14,264
- But you and me...
- She's your wife,

7
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:15,698
- and you love her.
- And then you disappeared

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,167
for two months without saying anything?

9
00:00:17,169 --> 00:00:19,067
You're putting me on this pedestal.

10
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,069
I'm not that person.

11
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:21,671
She's a witch.

12
00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:23,339
Lucy!

13
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:26,042
- Lucy, your arm.
- I'll be fine.

14
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:34,551
You failed 'cause your
daughter, who you should have

15
00:00:34,553 --> 00:00:36,386
let me kill in 1818, is still out there.

16
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:37,888
I'm taking you off the Lucy assignment.

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,222
That's not necessary.

18
00:00:39,224 --> 00:00:40,891
She's our problem now.

19
00:00:41,893 --> 00:00:44,606
_

20
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:47,096
_

21
00:00:49,234 --> 00:00:51,768
Quite a ruckus in the dorm last night.

22
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,504
I'm not sure what you're
talking about, Lem.

23
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:56,105
The fire alarm? Oh, come on.

24
00:00:56,107 --> 00:00:57,776
Five bucks says that
was you sneaking out

25
00:00:57,779 --> 00:00:59,108
with a girl from Miss Porter's.

26
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,546
If it was, and I'm saying
it'd be a vicious lie,

27
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:03,315
there's not a soul who can prove it.

28
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:06,015
Ah, Jack. A moment,
please, in my office.

29
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:08,017
Yes, sir.

30
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:09,886
What else did you do, Jack?

31
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,421
I honestly don't know,

32
00:01:11,423 --> 00:01:13,890
but I'm about to find out.

33
00:01:13,892 --> 00:01:17,513
Muckers Club meeting
tonight. Don't be late.

34
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:20,596
You wanted to see me, sir.

35
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:23,801
Come in, Jack, and
close the door, will you?

36
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:51,094
Hey. You're awake.

37
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:52,930
Fever dropped. That's a good sign.

38
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:56,165
Wyatt?

39
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,501
He's on a mission.

40
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:00,837
He went without me?

41
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:04,774
You were stabbed with a knife
full of 17th-century germs

42
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:08,177
and running a fever of 105, remember?

43
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,780
Ow. I don't care.

44
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,415
He shouldn't have gone without me.

45
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:13,983
Flynn's pinch hitting.

46
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:16,119
I'm sure he and Wyatt have
everything under control.

47
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:18,154
Sure. What could go wrong?

48
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:19,589
Would've been weird anyway, right?

49
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,185
You and Wyatt on a trip?

50
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:25,762
Rufus told me. About Hollywood.

51
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:28,765
You, Wyatt. Sounded pretty romantic.

52
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:30,833
I didn't know that he was still married.

53
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:32,802
I mean...

54
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:34,404
I didn't know that Jessica was...

55
00:02:34,406 --> 00:02:36,440
Alive again. I know.

56
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:39,475
Wasn't judging.

57
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,279
I just...

58
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:46,015
I just mean it must be hard.

59
00:02:46,017 --> 00:02:48,084
Especially with her here.

60
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:49,485
I want him to be happy.

61
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:51,688
I mean, this is what he's always wanted.

62
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,823
- So...
- What about what you want?

63
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:57,093
We're still friends.
Mm, we have the missions.

64
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:58,428
I'll be fine.

65
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,029
Hey, whoa, whoa, okay.

66
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:01,667
- I'll be fine, I'll be fine.
- Take it easy.

67
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:03,766
- Don't be a hero today.
- No heroics.

68
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,435
I'm just gonna get some tea.

69
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:13,543
Oh, hey.

70
00:03:13,545 --> 00:03:15,812
- Hey.
- Lucy, right?

71
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:17,627
- How you feeling?
- Not that great, actually.

72
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,323
I think I'm gonna go
back to bed and rest.

73
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:20,693
Do you want some tea?

74
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:23,320
Sit down.

75
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:27,190
I tend bar for a living, so
it's like physically impossible

76
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:29,326
for me to let someone
else serve their own drink.

77
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:32,594
So you're a historian, right?

78
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:35,465
- Mm-hmm.
- That must be interesting.

79
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,235
Don't know why I said that.

80
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:41,738
I have no idea what a historian does.

81
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,573
Hmm.

82
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,745
Yeah, well, um, I teach.

83
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:52,849
I taught... I mean I used to,
you know, before all of this.

84
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:54,517
Well, Wyatt said he wouldn't survive

85
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:56,085
the missions without you.

86
00:03:56,088 --> 00:03:58,779
No, it's really more
the other way around.

87
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:02,369
You, um... you said you're a bartender?

88
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:05,061
Yeah, yeah, yeah. At
Gilroy's in the Mission.

89
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:06,863
Drinks suck, but the management's cool.

90
00:04:06,865 --> 00:04:08,635
Uh, is that where you and Wyatt met?

91
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:10,967
No, Wyatt and I met in high school.

92
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:12,368
Yeah.

93
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,303
We've been together since senior year

94
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:16,606
if you can believe that.
He didn't tell you this?

95
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,174
Yeah, he's not much of a talker.

96
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:20,443
What about you? Are you married?

97
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:22,311
No.

98
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:25,581
Me... not married.

99
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:29,619
I mean, I, uh... I was
engaged once, kind of.

100
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:31,254
For like a moment. I don't know. It's...

101
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:33,122
It's complicated.

102
00:04:33,124 --> 00:04:36,058
It always is, isn't it?

103
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,861
Wyatt and I have been in
counseling for two years.

104
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:40,563
I mean in my reality.

105
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:43,132
I guess not in his.

106
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:46,536
Or yours. It's, uh...

107
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:49,338
This time travel stuff
really messes with your head.

108
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:07,557
- What happened?
- Things got messy.

109
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,955
Without Lucy, we were
scrambling till we figured out

110
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,425
- who they were after.
- We were almost too late.

111
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:13,029
Sleeper Agent started shooting at us.

112
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,034
Yeah, and we couldn't shoot
back 'cause there was kids.

113
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:16,966
- Kids?
- We barely made it out alive.

114
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,701
Wait, where's Flynn?

115
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:21,037
- We had to split up.
- You left him there?

116
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,973
We're gonna go back and pick him up.

117
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:26,475
After we deal with our, uh, situation.

118
00:05:26,477 --> 00:05:27,711
Situation?

119
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:32,683
Who is that?

120
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:36,686
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

121
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:39,355
Please tell me that's
not who I think it is.

122
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:40,690
It's not who you think it is,

123
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:42,024
unless you think it's young JFK.

124
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:43,693
Then it's definitely
who you think it is.

125
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:45,828
John F. Kennedy?

126
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,798
You brought President Kennedy?
Are you out of your minds?

127
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,199
Well, he was knocked out, okay?

128
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:51,955
He doesn't know where or when he is.

129
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,029
They were gonna kill him.

130
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:54,591
They chased us all the
way to the "Lifeboat."

131
00:05:54,593 --> 00:05:56,305
- This was our best option.
- It was our only option.

132
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:58,207
Besides, we... we have a plan.

133
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,976
Flynn's gonna take care
of Rittenhouse in '34.

134
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:02,345
We're gonna recharge the
"Lifeboat" and take JFK back.

135
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:04,080
- And pick up Flynn.
- Yeah, sure, that too.

136
00:06:04,082 --> 00:06:05,748
Okay, so let me get this straight.

137
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,884
We just need to keep
John alive long enough

138
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:09,752
so we can return him so he can become

139
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:11,019
arguably the most beloved president

140
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:12,755
of the 20th century.

141
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:13,991
No big deal.

142
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

143
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:19,295
You're all right.

144
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:21,084
Don't be scared. We're
not gonna hurt you.

145
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:22,720
Who are you people?

146
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,167
P-private security.

147
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,571
Uh, your father hired us to protect you.

148
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:30,837
Mr. Greer. My English teacher.

149
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,375
He... he tried to kill me.

150
00:06:32,377 --> 00:06:33,577
Why would he do that?

151
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:39,581
You come from a wealthy family, John,

152
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:41,083
and, uh, we think that Mr. Greer

153
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:42,852
was trying to kidnap you

154
00:06:42,854 --> 00:06:47,790
for ransom, and Wyatt
and Rufus here saved you.

155
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,325
I need to talk to my father.

156
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:50,785
I just got off the phone with him.

157
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:51,984
He's on his way.

158
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,330
Am I in a storage closet?

159
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,431
You're safe. And that's what matters.

160
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:01,203
So why don't you rest and
just make yourself comfortable.

161
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:04,273
I know that this is a
lot to take in, so, um,

162
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:09,013
uh, we'll come back, uh, when
it's time for you to go home.

163
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:18,208
Hey, hey, you feeling any better?

164
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:19,810
I'm fine.

165
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:21,590
It's hard to imagine that skinny kid

166
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:23,459
grows up to bang Marilyn Monroe, huh?

167
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:26,929
Hmm, Kennedy's intern
and mistress Mimi Alfred

168
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:28,631
said that he had a way
of making a woman feel

169
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:30,366
like she was the only one that mattered,

170
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:32,068
even when he was
married to someone else.

171
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:36,238
Look, I'm sorry. I know
this is really weird.

172
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,940
But I didn't have a choice.
I couldn't take the...

173
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:40,142
- This is so awkward for me.
- There you are.

174
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:43,572
Did I interrupt something?

175
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:46,082
- No.
- Hmm.

176
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:47,917
I was, uh,

177
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,961
just gonna get John something to eat.

178
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:58,327
Our secret bunker's
getting kind of crowded.

179
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:01,732
Thought, uh, JFK might
be a little hungry.

180
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:04,666
It's been a tough week for you.

181
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:06,268
I'm on the mend.

182
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,070
That's not what I meant.

183
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,306
You've been quiet since
you got back from Salem,

184
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:12,074
and I have a feeling I know why.

185
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,176
You do?

186
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:18,280
Your mother tried to have
you hanged as a witch.

187
00:08:18,282 --> 00:08:20,750
I imagine that'd be just
a little bit upsetting.

188
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:22,151
Do you want to talk about it?

189
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:25,354
Not really, but thanks for asking.

190
00:08:25,356 --> 00:08:28,125
I hope he enjoys whatever that is.

191
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:35,699
John?

192
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:40,835
I thought you might be
hungry, so I made you a...

193
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:49,814
Guys.

194
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:52,260
Guys!

195
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:56,708

196
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,606
Can't tell how far back it goes.

197
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:05,274
I spoke with the guards upstairs.

198
00:09:05,276 --> 00:09:06,729
They didn't see him.

199
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:09,111
Oh, my God, if we don't put
JFK back where he belongs,

200
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:11,580
he doesn't become president,
no JFK, no Peace Corps,

201
00:09:11,582 --> 00:09:13,516
- no Civil Rights Act...
- No immigration reform.

202
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,019
But there is nuclear war with Cuba.

203
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,185
All right, look. Nothing
is gonna happen to JFK.

204
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:18,799
We're gonna find him. Rufus...

205
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:20,956
Jiya and I will check
traffic and security cams.

206
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,343
Okay, great. I'm gonna need a car.

207
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:23,526
No, not a chance.

208
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:24,960
Rittenhouse could come after you.

209
00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:26,362
Rittenhouse will come after him.

210
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:27,963
So unless we're okay with finding out

211
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,406
what a world looks like after
a few dozen mushroom clouds...

212
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:32,581
All right. I'll run
point from my office.

213
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:34,551
I need all of you to stay
in touch with me, okay?

214
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:36,539
All right, hey, I think you
ought to sit this one out.

215
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,775
- Get some rest.
- Oh, I can come with you.

216
00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:41,911
I don't really think
that's probably a good idea.

217
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:43,362
- Why not?
- This is a matter

218
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:45,877
of national security. These
missions are dangerous.

219
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,781
Well, she's a teacher, right?

220
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,220
Ooh.

221
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:53,674
Never mind. Just... trying to help.

222
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,044
You know what? Uh...

223
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:58,881
Maybe you're right. Uh...

224
00:09:58,884 --> 00:10:02,085
More eyes the better, right?

225
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:05,733
Okay, fine. Just be careful.

226
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:09,438
You know what? I'll come too.

227
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,240
Lucy, you are still recovering.

228
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:14,410
I'm... I'm feeling better,
and didn't Wyatt say

229
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:16,378
can't hurt to have more eyes?

230
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,280
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

231
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:21,417
The closest building is a
gas station two miles away.

232
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,953
Okay.

233
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,067
Hey, baby.

234
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:39,468
Hey, let's order, uh...

235
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,403
Download a movie and just chill tonight.

236
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:53,616
Can I help you?

237
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:55,651
Pardon me. Where can
I find a pay telephone?

238
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:58,721
A pay phone? I don't know, a museum?

239
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:00,743
Please, I-I need to call my father.

240
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:02,291
I think I've been kidnapped.

241
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:03,659
Whoa. Seriously?

242
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:06,195
Okay, here, use mine.

243
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,663
- What is this?
- My phone.

244
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:10,132
This isn't a telephone.

245
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:12,535
Okay, um, let me.
What's your dad's number?

246
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:14,503
Gramercy 5934.

247
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:17,206
Is... is that international?

248
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,643
- What's today's date?
- April 5th.

249
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:23,879
- What year?
- 2018.

250
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:25,714
How can this be?

251
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:32,054
Um, are you in line?

252
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:35,340
No, go ahead.

253
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:36,792
Hey, is something wrong?

254
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:44,563
I'm having a rather strange day.

255
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:47,837
Well, I hope your day gets better.

256
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:51,207
Wait.

257
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:52,908
Uh...

258
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,945
- Can I hitch a ride with you?
- Where's your car?

259
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:59,181
- I don't have one.
- Why don't you call an Uber?

260
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:01,784
I don't know who that is.

261
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:04,587
Uh, we're going to Palo
Alto. Where do you need to go?

262
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:07,723
Anywhere far from here.

263
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:10,159
Palo Alto.

264
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:12,761
That's in California, right?

265
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:14,697
He's weird.

266
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:17,766
But he can come.

267
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:22,238
7 million people in the Bay Area,

268
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,206
and we're supposed to
find one horny teenage boy?

269
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,908
It's gonna be fine. We'll find him.

270
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,177
You sound quite sure of that.

271
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:29,578
Well, think about it.

272
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,413
We all still know who JFK is, right?

273
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:33,189
- Must mean we're gonna find him.
- Come again?

274
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:34,917
What a fascinating loop.

275
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,852
Jiya is suggesting that
because we still know

276
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:39,088
JFK becomes president in '61,

277
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,598
very fact that we're
still aware of him really

278
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:43,282
proves that he eventually makes it back

279
00:12:43,285 --> 00:12:44,627
to where he's supposed to be.

280
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:46,595
Yeah, for now, until
he gets hit by a car

281
00:12:46,597 --> 00:12:49,732
or shot by Rittenhouse, then
history changes in an instant.

282
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:52,234
- And we don't even know it.
- Yeah, that's true too.

283
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:54,158
- Okay, what about my visions.
- What about your visions?

284
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,272
I had a vision about a
man dying and he died.

285
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:58,007
You tried to stop it,
but history doesn't change

286
00:12:58,009 --> 00:12:59,638
- as easily as you want it to.
- Okay, that's more like

287
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,872
a self-fulfilling prophecy.

288
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,582
Or maybe it's just a prophecy.

289
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:03,912
Sorry, what are we talking about?

290
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:05,347
Never mind. Forget it.

291
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:12,454
Hello?

292
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:13,622
Just a sec.

293
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:15,090
Okay, so here's the deal.

294
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:17,326
John's my brother,
and he's off his meds.

295
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:18,494
Okay, who am I?

296
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:21,597
You're... my friend.

297
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,899
We can be friends, can't we?

298
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,467
Okay, dumb question,

299
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:27,251
but why don't you guys
just tell the truth?

300
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:28,771
Oh, that we're looking
for President Kennedy

301
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:30,472
who time traveled from 1934?

302
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:33,173
Okay, well, not all that.
But Wyatt's military.

303
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:34,843
They should answer his questions, right?

304
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:36,378
Yeah, well, we normally try to keep

305
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,780
a lower profile than that, so...

306
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:40,582
- Why?
- Because.

307
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:43,152
Sorry about that. How can I help you?

308
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:45,707
Yeah, we are, uh,
looking for a teenage boy

309
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,589
that might have came
through here, skinny kid,

310
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:49,625
light blue sport coat, tie.

311
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:51,727
Sorry, haven't seen him.

312
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:56,665
All right, look. Uh...

313
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,574
- U.S. Army.
- So?

314
00:13:58,577 --> 00:13:59,910
Please.

315
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:01,403
We've been looking everyone for him.

316
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:03,005
He's my brother, and he wandered

317
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,074
- out of the house today.
- What's wrong with him?

318
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:07,609
He suffers from delusions and paranoia.

319
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:09,114
I mean, he thinks that
people are after him.

320
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:10,946
He'll be fine as soon as
we can get him his meds.

321
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:12,381
- Mm.
- What meds?

322
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:13,949
- What? What meds?
- Um...

323
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:16,352
Risperidone.

324
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:18,187
It's an antipsychotic.

325
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:21,690
I can call his doctor if you'd like.

326
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:23,425
H-he came by about 40 minutes ago.

327
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:25,027
Do you know where he went?

328
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:26,962
He left with some kids.

329
00:14:26,964 --> 00:14:28,652
I think I heard 'em say

330
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:30,733
- they were heading to Palo Alto.
- Palo Alto.

331
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:32,167
Do you have any idea
what they were driving?

332
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:34,236
Hard to forget. It was a red BMW.

333
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:35,704
- Red BMW, thanks a lot.
- Great.

334
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:37,309
- Okay.
- Thank you.

335
00:14:44,181 --> 00:14:47,249
So, uh, how do you all know each other?

336
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:48,684
From school.

337
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:51,186
You all go to the same school?

338
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:54,123
- Together?
- Yeah.

339
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,592
- Why?
- My school's pretty boring.

340
00:14:56,594 --> 00:14:59,066
And, uh, white.

341
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:01,730
Oh. Private school?

342
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:05,334
Are you okay?

343
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:06,869
Swell.

344
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:10,672
Okay. What's your deal?

345
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:13,075
My... deal?

346
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:14,710
Yeah, what's with the funny suit?

347
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:17,946
And who were you hiding from back there?

348
00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:19,948
What's wrong with my suit?

349
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,717
It's a nice suit.

350
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,685
You're obviously in
some type of trouble.

351
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:27,122
Just tell us what it is and
then maybe we can help you.

352
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,596
There are people after me.

353
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:36,432
They kidnapped me and kept me

354
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:38,840
in some kind of, uh, underground bunker.

355
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:43,271
I... I don't know who
they are or what they want.

356
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:45,040
It's hard to explain.

357
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:47,242
Why don't you just go to the police?

358
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:50,179
The police can't help me.

359
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,434
John.

360
00:15:51,437 --> 00:15:55,005
- John, what is it?
- My stomach.

361
00:15:55,008 --> 00:15:57,185
Do either of you have
any TUMS or something?

362
00:15:57,188 --> 00:15:59,684
- I need... I need a doctor.
- What's wrong with him?

363
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:01,541
I don't... I don't know,
but he does not look good.

364
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,724
We need to get him to a hospital.

365
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:04,159
Yo, he better not puke in my car.

366
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:05,994
Just go.

367
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:10,833
Rufus, what do you mean you lost 'em?

368
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:12,205
There aren't cameras on every street.

369
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:13,512
They drove out of range.

370
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,003
Well, what direction were they heading?

371
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:16,338
South on Willow.

372
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,840
All right. What's in the area?

373
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,308
There's a Chinese restaurant,

374
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,943
Starbucks, Bailey's Bar and Grille,

375
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:22,535
a hospital, a park...

376
00:16:22,538 --> 00:16:24,178
I don't know much about JFK,

377
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:25,985
but a bar sounds right up his alley.

378
00:16:25,988 --> 00:16:27,868
No, no, no, I bet he's
going to the hospital.

379
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:29,084
What makes you say that?

380
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:31,520
Well, John suffered from
health issues his entire life.

381
00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:33,655
Spent most of his childhood
in and out of hospitals.

382
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:35,791
I mean, Bobby even joked that
if someone ever were to write

383
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:37,192
a book about his brother,
it would be titled

384
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:38,704
"John F. Kennedy: A Medical History."

385
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,043
Doesn't mean he's sick now.

386
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:42,029
Stress probably makes
his conditions worse.

387
00:16:42,032 --> 00:16:44,566
And I'm imagining he's probably
pretty stressed right now.

388
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:46,301
If we're wrong...

389
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:49,304
Hey, I'd go with the
historian on this one.

390
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:51,306
I mean, she's kept you
alive this long, right?

391
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:54,843
Hospital it is.

392
00:16:57,848 --> 00:16:59,915
Things didn't go as planned.

393
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,450
They got JFK.

394
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,552
Did Lucy get involved?

395
00:17:03,554 --> 00:17:05,654
No, I didn't see her there.

396
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:08,657
But they took Kennedy in the "Lifeboat."

397
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,592
I think he's here somewhere.

398
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:11,894
Then find him.

399
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,028
From everything I've read,

400
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,696
Kennedy galvanized this nation

401
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:16,899
in a direction that runs
counter to our goals.

402
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:18,500
We need someone in that Oval Office

403
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:19,902
that we can control.

404
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:21,904
- Like Nixon.
- I'm working on it.

405
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:25,004
I know where we can find Kennedy.

406
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:26,373
I'm listening.

407
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:28,509
Kennedy's chronic health issues

408
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:30,712
are one of history's best-kept secrets.

409
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:33,556
Ulcers, colitis, blood infections.

410
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,751
With everything that
he's just been through,

411
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:37,626
I wouldn't be surprised if he fell ill.

412
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:38,887
What do you suggest?

413
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:40,923
We search every hospital in the city.

414
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:42,848
Sooner or later,
Kennedy's bound to show up

415
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:45,760
at one of them, and when
he does, we take him out.

416
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:51,400
All right. Send out one of our men.

417
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:55,037
No. I got this.

418
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,874
- I'll figure it out.
- Thank you, Emma.

419
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:01,510
And if you run into
Lucy and her friends,

420
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:03,845
take them out as well.

421
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:07,049
With pleasure.

422
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,418
- You get the plate on the BMW?
- Uh, no.

423
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,103
Call me when you do.

424
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:35,943
This is like being stoned
to death with popcorn.

425
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:36,992
We're never gonna find the boy using

426
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:38,785
- such primitive technology.
- At least we have computers.

427
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:40,780
Try doing this with
a Civil War spyglass.

428
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:42,127
No, I'm calling Agent Christopher.

429
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:44,618
What we need are drones.

430
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,274
Still think we're gonna find JFK?

431
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:48,188
Found the car, didn't
we? Have a little faith.

432
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,072
I don't have any faith,
but you already know that.

433
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:51,992
Okay.

434
00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:53,460
You don't ever wonder if there's

435
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:54,862
something bigger out there?

436
00:18:54,864 --> 00:18:56,964
What, like extraterrestrials?

437
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:59,700
No, there's definitely
extraterrestrials.

438
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:02,302
I mean...

439
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:03,804
A higher power.

440
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:05,884
Okay, where's this coming from?

441
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:07,333
- Is this about your visions?
- Okay, look, I know

442
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:09,392
it sounds crazy but I feel like
I'm having them for a reason.

443
00:19:09,394 --> 00:19:12,513
Look, they're side effects
of... of time travel, okay?

444
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:14,448
There's no such thing as a higher power.

445
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,483
Okay, then how do you explain
my heart murmur being cured?

446
00:19:16,485 --> 00:19:18,051
Or the fact that all my
visions have come true?

447
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:19,453
All side effects, okay?

448
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:20,988
If everything happens for a reason,

449
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,635
then what's the reason
for JFK getting shot

450
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:25,526
by some crazy dude with three names?

451
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:27,028
I don't know.

452
00:19:29,464 --> 00:19:31,163
Look.

453
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,900
When I was a kid,

454
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:36,870
my mom used to thank God for
every good thing that happened.

455
00:19:36,872 --> 00:19:38,939
And when something bad
happened, she'd say,

456
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:41,675
"Everything happens for a
reason," or, "God has a plan."

457
00:19:43,612 --> 00:19:49,182
I watched my mom get on her
knees and pray every night,

458
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:53,487
begging God to take us out
of our crappy neighborhood.

459
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:55,522
But you know who did?

460
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:58,292
Me.

461
00:19:58,294 --> 00:20:00,060
God doesn't exist.

462
00:20:00,062 --> 00:20:01,728
Pardon the interruption,

463
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,565
but I can't get a hold
of Agent Christopher.

464
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:04,698
Did you try her office?

465
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,200
Yeah, of course, but apparently she...

466
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:09,236
No one's seen her.

467
00:20:09,238 --> 00:20:11,606
Then where is she?

468
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:14,741
Agent Christopher.

469
00:20:14,743 --> 00:20:17,611
We haven't formally met.

470
00:20:17,613 --> 00:20:20,247
- I'm Carol Preston.
- I know who you are.

471
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:22,597
I wanted to talk, one mother to another.

472
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,326
You couldn't just text, Carol?

473
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:26,553
Hmm, you know, despite
what you must think,

474
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:29,081
I do care about my daughter very much.

475
00:20:29,084 --> 00:20:31,792
I was young when I
got pregnant with Lucy.

476
00:20:31,794 --> 00:20:34,227
I naively thought that I could

477
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:37,064
give her up for adoption
without my family knowing.

478
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:39,600
So you didn't want your
child to be Rittenhouse.

479
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:44,972
Unlike Lucy, I've known
about my place in Rittenhouse

480
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:47,474
since I was 15 years old.

481
00:20:47,476 --> 00:20:49,543
It was a burden.

482
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:52,913
So I convinced myself
that not keeping my child

483
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:55,503
was the right thing to do.
That must have been tough.

484
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,317
It wasn't.

485
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,986
Not at first.

486
00:20:58,988 --> 00:21:00,904
Then the weeks went by,

487
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:03,457
and I felt her growing inside me.

488
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:07,328
Then I started to wonder
what she might be like.

489
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:10,497
And by the time she
came into this world,

490
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:12,833
I knew there was no way
I was gonna let her go.

491
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:14,635
Why are you telling me this?

492
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:17,771
Because I can't protect
my daughter anymore.

493
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:19,906
Rittenhouse will kill Lucy

494
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:22,109
if she continues to
interfere with their plans.

495
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:26,513
So I need you to keep my
daughter off of these missions.

496
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:28,362
It's the only way to keep her safe.

497
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:29,650
What do you expect me to do?

498
00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:30,779
- Tie Lucy up...
- Yes.

499
00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:31,985
- Until all this is over?
- Yes.

500
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:33,487
If that's what it takes.

501
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:34,787
If you think that's gonna work,

502
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,490
then you don't know
your daughter at all.

503
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:38,959
Oh, I was hoping

504
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:43,130
that you of all people would understand.

505
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:46,065
You know, I would think
long and hard about this,

506
00:21:46,068 --> 00:21:47,501
Agent Christopher.

507
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:49,336
It'd be a shame if your children

508
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:51,838
grow up without a mother.

509
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,846
God, I hate hospitals.

510
00:21:59,848 --> 00:22:02,215
- Remember Hawaii?
- Ugh, don't remind me.

511
00:22:02,217 --> 00:22:03,617
What happened?

512
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:05,385
Uh, we were on a surfing trip.

513
00:22:05,387 --> 00:22:06,928
- You surf?
- Yeah.

514
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:09,073
Eh... not as well as he thinks he does.

515
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:10,357
- No.
- You wiped out.

516
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,526
Hit himself on the head with
a board, got a concussion.

517
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:14,428
Ended up in this awful hospital.

518
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,329
You remember that?

519
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:19,399
I remember that you never left my side.

520
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:22,669
You slept in that
uncomfortable chair for days.

521
00:22:22,671 --> 00:22:24,404
I remember that.

522
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:35,649
Knock, knock.

523
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:37,901
- You stayed.
- Yeah. You look better.

524
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:40,253
This hospital is incredible.

525
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:42,522
The medicine worked almost instantly.

526
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:44,357
Um, I have to go soon.

527
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:46,262
My brother's having this
party tonight that my friends

528
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,994
have been looking forward to all week.

529
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:50,664
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

530
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,532
Is there anybody that
I can call for you?

531
00:22:52,534 --> 00:22:54,335
Family or...

532
00:22:56,137 --> 00:22:57,503
Kayla, we've been friends

533
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:59,372
for all of two hours, wouldn't you say?

534
00:22:59,374 --> 00:23:03,076
- Just about.
- Yeah, so I can trust you.

535
00:23:03,078 --> 00:23:04,778
Obviously.

536
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,380
What I'm about to tell you
is going to sound crazy.

537
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:10,751
Crazier than you being kidnapped?

538
00:23:10,753 --> 00:23:12,419
When I woke up this morning,

539
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:15,555
I was at my boarding
school in Connecticut.

540
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:18,558
The year was 1934.

541
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,227
Then a group of strangers kidnapped me

542
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:23,764
and brought me here
to the, uh... future.

543
00:23:26,268 --> 00:23:28,253
What kind of meds did they give you?

544
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,637
I promise.

545
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:33,273
It's the truth.

546
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:35,275
I need to find a time machine.

547
00:23:35,277 --> 00:23:38,278
John, time machines don't exist.

548
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,846
But they must.

549
00:23:39,848 --> 00:23:42,816
How else could I be here?

550
00:23:42,818 --> 00:23:44,151
The bunker.

551
00:23:44,153 --> 00:23:45,485
There must be a time machine

552
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:46,787
at the place where I was locked up.

553
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:48,563
Maybe it's the only one of its kind.

554
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:50,066
Wait, you're saying you want to go back

555
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:51,725
to the place that you just escaped from?

556
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:55,262
Maybe that's the only way I
can get back home to my time.

557
00:23:55,264 --> 00:23:57,197
And I could really use your help.

558
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:01,134
Hi, I'm looking for my
brother, John Kennedy.

559
00:24:01,136 --> 00:24:02,669
I got a message saying that he was here.

560
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:04,938
Popular kid. He should be out soon.

561
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,640
I know they're all trying
to get to some party.

562
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:08,896
Oh, can, uh... Can we see him?

563
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:11,354
Like I told his aunt, you're
gonna have to wait here

564
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:13,513
- until there's an update.
- Aunt?

565
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:16,183
Excuse me.

566
00:24:17,786 --> 00:24:19,319
Room 325. Let's go.

567
00:24:40,642 --> 00:24:42,323
Whoa! Whoa!

568
00:25:18,247 --> 00:25:21,081
Wyatt. Jessica, over there.

569
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:30,257
Uh-uh.

570
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:31,591
I wouldn't if I were you.

571
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,895
Or maybe her life doesn't matter anymore

572
00:25:34,897 --> 00:25:36,495
now that you have your wife back.

573
00:25:40,202 --> 00:25:42,068
Do it.

574
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,571
She's their only pilot.

575
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,396
Do it.

576
00:25:52,614 --> 00:25:55,215
Lucy. Lucy. Are you all right?

577
00:25:55,217 --> 00:25:57,784
- You okay? Yeah?
- Yeah.

578
00:25:57,786 --> 00:26:00,453
Go, go, go.

579
00:26:00,455 --> 00:26:02,756
Drop the gun now!

580
00:26:10,074 --> 00:26:12,487
This is a mistake. Wyatt was
the one that was attacked.

581
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,948
Take it up with the police
when they get here.

582
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,212
Look, I have a license for the gun.

583
00:26:15,214 --> 00:26:16,794
I'm U.S. Army Special Forces.

584
00:26:16,797 --> 00:26:18,745
Call Agent Denise Christopher
at Homeland Security.

585
00:26:18,747 --> 00:26:20,246
- She'll clear it all up.
- There must be someone

586
00:26:20,248 --> 00:26:22,622
in management that we can talk
to... who is your supervisor?

587
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,388
His name is Lou Ritchey,
and he's gone for the day.

588
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,500
Of course he is.

589
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:26,834
Ma'am, you should wait in the lobby.

590
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,450
The police want to talk to the
both of you when they get here.

591
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:31,371
You slipped him a paper clip.

592
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:33,841
Don't worry. We've done this before.

593
00:26:36,378 --> 00:26:38,411
You don't want to get
that checked, we're here?

594
00:26:38,413 --> 00:26:41,314
I'll live. We've got
much bigger problems.

595
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,054
You okay?

596
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:52,125
The way Wyatt looked
at you back there...

597
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:54,895
Doesn't take a professor
to figure it out.

598
00:26:54,897 --> 00:26:57,264
I get it.

599
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:59,466
He thought I was dead and...

600
00:26:59,468 --> 00:27:01,289
it's not like he was
faithful to me before.

601
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:03,559
I don't know why he'd
be faithful to me now.

602
00:27:03,562 --> 00:27:05,939
- Jessica, it's...
- Look, Lucy, this was fun.

603
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:08,542
And insane.

604
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,745
And I believe Wyatt's changed.

605
00:27:11,747 --> 00:27:13,659
Yesterday I was ready to divorce him,

606
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:16,195
and after seeing him
like this I thought...

607
00:27:16,198 --> 00:27:17,598
maybe he's right.

608
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:21,588
Maybe he does deserve
another chance, but...

609
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,123
I don't think I'm the one

610
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,025
he should be getting that chance with.

611
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,564
Tell him I said bye.

612
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:33,934
Okay.

613
00:27:35,938 --> 00:27:37,904
Jessica, wait. Wait.

614
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, just...

615
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:42,076
Just don't leave yet. Hear me out, okay?

616
00:27:44,812 --> 00:27:46,846
When we went to 1962 Vegas,

617
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:48,949
Wyatt sent you a telegram
from Western Union.

618
00:27:48,951 --> 00:27:50,584
- Like in "Back to the Future"?
- Yes.

619
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,320
Like in "Back to the
Future," but it didn't work.

620
00:27:53,322 --> 00:27:56,089
So then he stole the "Lifeboat"
to try and go back and stop

621
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,390
your killer from ever being born,

622
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:58,658
but it didn't work either.

623
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,994
And he got court-martialed for it too.

624
00:28:00,996 --> 00:28:03,496
- He did?
- Yes.

625
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:05,465
My point is...

626
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,803
Even though you weren't there,

627
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:12,105
you were always on Wyatt's mind.

628
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,542
He risked his job, his
freedom, everything,

629
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:17,744
because he never stopped loving you,

630
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:20,146
not for a second.

631
00:28:20,148 --> 00:28:24,417
And all he wants, all
that he has wanted,

632
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,286
is a chance to show you that.

633
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,824
Let's go.

634
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:33,106
Oh, what? How?

635
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:35,462
Told you we've been doing this a while.

636
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,766
You in?

637
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:56,650
Good? Ready?

638
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:12,699
John Kennedy?

639
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:14,814
Like the President? That's what he said.

640
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:17,051
Kayla, this guy is obviously unstable.

641
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:19,020
Maybe we shouldn't have
brought him to your house.

642
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,374
My mom will be back
tomorrow. She's a shrink.

643
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:24,611
She helps troubled kids
like him all the time.

644
00:29:24,613 --> 00:29:27,747
Heads up. Hail to the Chief.

645
00:29:27,749 --> 00:29:29,149
Are you ready to go?

646
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,284
Actually, I was thinking

647
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:33,778
it's... it's kind of dark outside.

648
00:29:33,781 --> 00:29:36,529
It might be kind of hard
to find a secret bunker.

649
00:29:36,532 --> 00:29:38,465
So why don't you just stay here

650
00:29:38,468 --> 00:29:40,360
and then we can go first thing tomorrow?

651
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,829
I suppose that'll
give us time to come up

652
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:44,764
with an actual plan.

653
00:29:44,766 --> 00:29:46,942
Any chance I can sneak a gin rickey?

654
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:51,404
Come on.

655
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:53,273
- Let's go somewhere quieter.
- Yeah.

656
00:29:55,077 --> 00:29:57,844
I hope you've had sufficient
time to reconsider.

657
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:59,312
I have.

658
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:00,880
In my line of work,

659
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:04,036
we all have that one
case we can't shake.

660
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:06,753
Mine was a school shooting in 2011.

661
00:30:06,755 --> 00:30:09,556
After it happened, I yanked
my kids out of their classrooms

662
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,520
and decided they were
going to be homeschooled.

663
00:30:11,523 --> 00:30:13,093
There was no discussion.

664
00:30:13,095 --> 00:30:14,527
I needed them to be safe.

665
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:16,278
You did what was best for your family.

666
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,931
I did what was best for me.

667
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:20,300
My son...

668
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:22,002
he was so angry.

669
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:24,471
It created such a rift between us

670
00:30:24,473 --> 00:30:28,341
that finally I had
to give in and let go.

671
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:30,153
We all have to do that at some point.

672
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:31,811
What are you talking...

673
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:35,015
You're stalling.

674
00:30:41,123 --> 00:30:43,423
She's chipped.

675
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,309
Your tax dollars at work.

676
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:47,293
Thanks for giving me
that time to reconsider.

677
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:48,895
Someone should be here any minute now.

678
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:50,764
Do it.

679
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:58,321
- Did you find JFK?
- No, we missed him.

680
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:01,532
- Any luck finding the car?
- None. What now?

681
00:31:01,535 --> 00:31:03,468
Have you guys checked Instagram?

682
00:31:03,471 --> 00:31:05,901
That nurse mentioned something
about John going to a party.

683
00:31:05,904 --> 00:31:07,537
If he's at a party with a bunch of kids,

684
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:10,106
he's bound to show up
in a picture or two.

685
00:31:10,108 --> 00:31:12,542
Hey, Rufus, she's right.
Check social media.

686
00:31:12,544 --> 00:31:14,244
Facebook, Instagram,
Snapchat, all of it.

687
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:15,613
We're on it.

688
00:31:18,998 --> 00:31:20,831
Make yourself comfortable.

689
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:29,025
Have you read all these books?

690
00:31:29,027 --> 00:31:30,961
Most of them.

691
00:31:30,963 --> 00:31:32,562
I love to read.

692
00:31:32,564 --> 00:31:35,031
Me too.

693
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:37,834
Ah, "The Poetry of Robert Frost."

694
00:31:37,836 --> 00:31:39,936
You like poetry?

695
00:31:39,938 --> 00:31:41,471
I love it.

696
00:31:41,473 --> 00:31:43,573
All literature, really.

697
00:31:43,575 --> 00:31:46,276
I spend so many days sick in bed.

698
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:48,177
My mother jokes she can hardly see me

699
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,748
behind the books piled around my pillow.

700
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,978
- You really do look like him.
- Like who?

701
00:32:05,998 --> 00:32:09,065
How did you get this photo?

702
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:11,868
And what is this thing?

703
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:16,235
It's an iPad. So... so this is you?

704
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:17,607
You're President Kennedy?

705
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:19,767
President of what?

706
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:24,250
Of the United States.

707
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,786
I become president of the United States?

708
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:33,290
I... I don't understand.

709
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:36,326
That was supposed to be my brother, Joe.

710
00:32:36,328 --> 00:32:40,997
Does this, uh, iPad know him too?

711
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:43,767
Yeah.

712
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:46,353
That's him.

713
00:32:46,356 --> 00:32:50,173
"Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. was
the oldest of nine children.

714
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:52,342
"Graduated from Harvard College.

715
00:32:52,344 --> 00:32:55,679
Then went to Harvard
Law." Hey, good on him!

716
00:32:55,681 --> 00:32:57,914
"But he left before graduation

717
00:32:57,916 --> 00:33:03,329
to join the U.S. Navy
during World War II."

718
00:33:03,332 --> 00:33:07,000
World War II?

719
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:10,205
"A naval pilot, he was...

720
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:13,353
killed off the coast of France

721
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:16,257
during a secret mission at age 29."

722
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:22,672
It's the Kennedy curse.

723
00:33:22,674 --> 00:33:24,259
The what?

724
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:27,409
Mm, people think that the
Kennedy family was cursed

725
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:31,381
because so many of them died so young.

726
00:33:31,383 --> 00:33:33,350
You know what? You
really shouldn't... John.

727
00:33:33,352 --> 00:33:36,753
My sister Kathleen
died in a plane crash.

728
00:33:36,755 --> 00:33:38,856
Bobby was shot, just like...

729
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:43,560
Just like his brother, John.

730
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:54,004
Anything yet?

731
00:33:54,007 --> 00:33:55,941
Facebook's facial
recognition really thinks

732
00:33:55,944 --> 00:33:58,644
Ansel Elgort looks like JFK.

733
00:33:58,647 --> 00:34:01,348
- Wait, I think I found him.
- Really?

734
00:34:01,351 --> 00:34:03,149
That's definitely him.

735
00:34:03,152 --> 00:34:04,752
I think he's at someone's house.

736
00:34:04,755 --> 00:34:06,033
Can you pin his location?

737
00:34:06,036 --> 00:34:08,837
Tell me you got good news.

738
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,643
490 Kingsley Road.

739
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:12,947
Okay, I'll map it now. Thanks, guys.

740
00:34:17,729 --> 00:34:20,697
Denise?

741
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,830
Are you hurt?

742
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,334
Connor, what are you doing here?

743
00:34:24,336 --> 00:34:26,770
Looking for you. What happened?

744
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:29,239
These agents managed to track your chip.

745
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:31,441
Carol Preston wanted
to have a little chat.

746
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:34,210
Mom? Who are you talking to?

747
00:34:34,212 --> 00:34:35,643
Hi, sweetie pie.

748
00:34:35,646 --> 00:34:37,343
Mom's just talking
to a friend from work.

749
00:34:37,346 --> 00:34:40,284
Just go back inside,
I'll be in in a minute.

750
00:34:42,615 --> 00:34:44,281
What is it?

751
00:34:44,284 --> 00:34:46,851
What did Lucy's mother want?

752
00:34:46,854 --> 00:34:50,155
To remind me that we both
have families to lose.

753
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:03,506
Hey.

754
00:35:03,508 --> 00:35:05,252
Brought you something.

755
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:13,583
- Is that... me?
- It's pretty cool, huh?

756
00:35:13,585 --> 00:35:16,019
Joe's the one who's
destined for greatness.

757
00:35:16,021 --> 00:35:18,822
He's smart and good

758
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:21,057
and disciplined.

759
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:24,594
Not like me.

760
00:35:24,597 --> 00:35:27,363
Okay. I think you had enough.

761
00:35:27,365 --> 00:35:29,432
Come on. You need to sober up.

762
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:31,769
- Do you want to go get food...
- No, leave me alone.

763
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:41,453
Ah, I see not much has changed

764
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:42,814
since we were in high school.

765
00:35:42,817 --> 00:35:44,514
Hey, someone's mom is here!

766
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:47,205
Mom, my ass.

767
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,285
All right, you two see if
you can find him out here.

768
00:35:49,287 --> 00:35:51,621
- I'll check inside.
- Wait, wait, wait.

769
00:35:51,623 --> 00:35:54,557
If we find him, I'll just call you.

770
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,961
Cell phones.

771
00:35:56,964 --> 00:35:59,197
We don't usually get cell
phones 'cause we're...

772
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,721
- traveling to the past.
- Right.

773
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,592
Go away.

774
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,465
John.

775
00:36:07,468 --> 00:36:09,510
- We have to go.
- What-what's going on?

776
00:36:09,513 --> 00:36:11,373
I know my father didn't send you.

777
00:36:11,376 --> 00:36:14,077
Okay. You're right.

778
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,679
I'm sorry we lied to you about that.

779
00:36:16,681 --> 00:36:19,716
We are trying to protect you.

780
00:36:19,718 --> 00:36:22,919
I want to go home.

781
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:25,688
Great. Let's get you home.

782
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:32,195
John!

783
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:39,033
Miss, please help me!

784
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:45,036
Kayla!

785
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:49,879
Kayla!

786
00:36:49,882 --> 00:36:51,176
Everybody get down!

787
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:01,520
Oh, my God. Are you guys okay?

788
00:37:01,522 --> 00:37:03,188
I-I think so.

789
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,990
Kayla?

790
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:06,994
So everything that you
told me, that was real?

791
00:37:09,196 --> 00:37:11,496
Oh, my God.

792
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:13,698
Thank you for helping me.

793
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,534
Even when you didn't believe me.

794
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:21,339
Meeting you gives me
hope for the future.

795
00:37:21,341 --> 00:37:23,909
Your secret's safe with me.

796
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:35,654
So... this is it.

797
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:37,389
No one's going to believe this.

798
00:37:37,391 --> 00:37:39,586
Yeah, uh, about that,

799
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:41,689
I wouldn't mention it
when you get back home.

800
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,128
To anyone. Ever.

801
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,263
The safety of the world
kind of depends on it.

802
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:46,431
I understand.

803
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:49,267
All right. You ready to go?

804
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,543
John.

805
00:37:58,546 --> 00:38:00,927
You okay?

806
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,049
I know about my siblings' deaths.

807
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:06,117
My own assassination.

808
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,386
Well, maybe you can change your fate.

809
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:17,801
Don't go to Dallas on
November 22nd, 1963.

810
00:38:17,804 --> 00:38:19,703
What about the curse?

811
00:38:19,706 --> 00:38:22,606
Everyone I love is going
to die a tragic death.

812
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:26,010
You may not be able to
save everybody, John, but

813
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:29,941
you are going to make the
world a much better place.

814
00:38:29,943 --> 00:38:32,310
There are worse fates.

815
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:38,583
Was I a good president?

816
00:38:38,585 --> 00:38:40,752
One of the greatest.

817
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:59,137
You're back.

818
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:00,973
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

819
00:39:00,976 --> 00:39:03,577
We need to talk.

820
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:10,282
I'm so sorry that you
had to go through this.

821
00:39:10,284 --> 00:39:11,850
You don't ever have to apologize

822
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:14,028
for your mother's actions, Lucy.

823
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:15,831
You think she was telling the truth?

824
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:17,200
About her love?

825
00:39:17,203 --> 00:39:20,638
Or that you have a target on your back?

826
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:23,208
- Both.
- Yeah.

827
00:39:23,211 --> 00:39:25,311
To both.

828
00:39:25,314 --> 00:39:28,983
I won't sugarcoat this, Lucy.
Rittenhouse wants you dead.

829
00:39:28,986 --> 00:39:31,686
I mean, look how close
they already came.

830
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:34,262
Maybe you should consider
staying off the missions.

831
00:39:34,265 --> 00:39:35,540
You can still brief the team

832
00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:38,043
- on the history before they go.
- No.

833
00:39:38,046 --> 00:39:39,810
Everyone else is risking their lives

834
00:39:39,813 --> 00:39:41,098
trying to stop Rittenhouse.

835
00:39:41,101 --> 00:39:43,636
There is no way that I'm
hiding in this bunker.

836
00:39:46,793 --> 00:39:49,327
If you were my daughter,

837
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,831
I'd be so proud.

838
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:58,493
The day I've had.

839
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,599
Someone needs to figure
out how to put more seats

840
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:02,602
- into this damn "Lifeboat."
- We're working on it.

841
00:40:02,605 --> 00:40:04,208
Well, work faster, 'cause next time,

842
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:07,072
it won't be me who's left behind.

843
00:40:07,075 --> 00:40:08,970
Did you take care of the Sleeper?

844
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:12,141
Yes, ma'am. All three of them.

845
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:14,178
Uh, so what do we know about JFK.

846
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:15,467
Uh, does he serve a second term?

847
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,448
Does he have like ten more kids?

848
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,215
What second term? JFK was assassinated

849
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:20,009
two years into office.

850
00:40:20,012 --> 00:40:21,447
That's not right. I-I told him.

851
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,798
I told him not to go to Dallas.

852
00:40:22,801 --> 00:40:24,931
Dallas? It happened in Austin.

853
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:30,783
Guess it was just meant to be.

854
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,295
Oh, God.

855
00:40:36,298 --> 00:40:38,139
Sorry.

856
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:43,073
Lucy.

857
00:40:43,076 --> 00:40:44,509
Thank you.

858
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:46,236
For what?

859
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,240
Uh, Jessica's giving me a second chance,

860
00:40:49,243 --> 00:40:53,179
and she said it was 'cause of you.

861
00:40:53,182 --> 00:40:55,849
Well, the history that
you two have between you,

862
00:40:55,852 --> 00:40:57,518
it's special.

863
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,121
And...

864
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:01,858
you deserve to finally be happy, Wyatt.

865
00:41:06,387 --> 00:41:09,421
I have no regrets.

866
00:41:09,424 --> 00:41:11,725
Me neither.

867
00:41:11,728 --> 00:41:15,496
Well, I'll see you around the bunker.

868
00:41:15,499 --> 00:41:18,800
- Baby doll.
- See you around the bunker.

869
00:41:18,803 --> 00:41:21,304
Shweetheart.

870
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:39,549
- Want one?
- Oh, no.

871
00:41:39,552 --> 00:41:41,599
Why didn't you get me
something I could eat?

872
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:43,084
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

873
00:41:43,087 --> 00:41:45,683
The idea of offering a
raw carrot to an Andrew.

874
00:41:45,686 --> 00:41:48,097
You don't think I'm going
around panhandling for you,

875
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,983
do you? Have one of these.

876
00:41:49,986 --> 00:41:51,753
Best thing in the world for you, carrots.

877
00:41:56,229 --> 00:41:57,695
I wish you wouldn't talk so much.

878
00:41:57,698 --> 00:41:59,765
Let another car get away.

879
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,983
S-suppose nobody stops for us.

880
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,600
He'll stop all right.

881
00:42:03,603 --> 00:42:05,970
It's all a matter of
knowing how to hail 'em.

882
00:42:05,973 --> 00:42:07,748
Oh, and you're an expert, I suppose.

883
00:42:07,751 --> 00:42:09,772
Expert? I'm gonna write a book about it

884
00:42:09,775 --> 00:42:11,708
called "The Hitchhiker's Hail."

885
00:42:11,711 --> 00:42:15,212
There's no end to your
accomplishments, is there?

886
00:42:15,215 --> 00:42:16,967
- You think it's simple, huh?
- No, no.

887
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,475
Well, it is simple.

888
00:42:18,478 --> 00:42:20,111
It's all in that old thumb, see?

889
00:42:20,114 --> 00:42:22,114
Yeah, now, some people do it like this.

890
00:42:22,117 --> 00:42:23,618
Or like this.

891
00:42:24,703 --> 00:42:29,164

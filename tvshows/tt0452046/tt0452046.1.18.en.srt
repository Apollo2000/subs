Diane Arbus once said :

3
00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:18,006
<i>"A photograph is a
secret about a secret.</i>

4
00:00:18,505 --> 00:00:20,729
<i>the more it tells you,
the less you know."</i>

00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:21,614
Spencer !

6
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:22,860
Spencer Reid !

7
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:25,195
Dude ! Look at you !

8
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:28,052
You look just the same.

9
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:30,838
Look at you, dude. Nothing's changed.

10
00:00:30,845 --> 00:00:32,411
Spencer was
only 12-year-old

11
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,211
in our graduating class.

12
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:35,959
Just the same.

13
00:00:36,227 --> 00:00:36,993
Thanks.

14
00:00:37,386 --> 00:00:39,603
This is special agent Jason Gideon.

15
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:40,620
This is Parker Dunley.

16
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:42,972
We went to high school together,
as you can probably gather.

17
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:44,212
- Hi, how are you ?
- Hey.

18
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:45,663
It's a beautiful gallery.

19
00:00:45,785 --> 00:00:46,893
Thank you. Thank you.

20
00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:49,122
Jason's a big contemporary
art enthusiast.

21
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:53,421
We're exhibiting four
up-and-coming artists in this show.

22
00:00:53,696 --> 00:00:55,200
Everything's for sale and

23
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:58,170
I could definitely swing a
nice discount for a friend of...

24
00:01:01,115 --> 00:01:01,961
Lila.

25
00:01:02,357 --> 00:01:02,923
Hey.

26
00:01:03,298 --> 00:01:04,393
Guys, come on.

27
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:07,401
Do I look 12 years old to you ?

28
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:08,033
14 ?

29
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:13,972
Spencer,

30
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:15,683
you ever meet a real movie star ?

31
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:16,960
Movie star ? Please,

32
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:19,230
she's a supporting role
on a television series

33
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:20,750
about beach volleyball.

34
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:22,332
Totally blue-collar.

35
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:25,832
I'm Lila.

36
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:28,671
Hi, I'm... I'm doctor Spencer... Reid.

37
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:32,240
I'm Spencer. You don't
have to... call me doctor.

38
00:01:34,858 --> 00:01:35,570
I won't.

39
00:01:38,427 --> 00:01:39,251
Excuse me.

40
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:41,162
Hey you ! I told you !

41
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:42,733
No photos in the gallery !

42
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:43,983
All right ? Out !

43
00:01:46,255 --> 00:01:47,420
And who are you ?

44
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,863
I'm Jason Gideon, I'm a...

45
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:51,821
- friend of Reid.
- Have you seen my work ?

46
00:01:52,298 --> 00:01:52,883
No.

47
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:56,981
Thanks.

48
00:01:57,465 --> 00:02:00,130
So... you're not from
around here, are you ?

49
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:02,080
Me ? No. No, I'm...

50
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:04,761
We're running a training
service about profiling

51
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:06,640
for the Los Angeles police department.

52
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:07,760
Profiling ?

53
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:10,541
Yeah, I'm with the behavioral
analysis unit of the FBI.

54
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:12,742
We psychoanalyze crime
scenes in order to

55
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:14,183
gain a better understanding

56
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:16,411
of the criminal who might
have committed the crime.

57
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,770
Psychoanalyze, huh ?

58
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:21,470
Are you doing that to me right now ?

59
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:22,773
What ? no !

60
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:24,533
I'm not psychoanalyzing you. I'm just...

61
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:26,233
I'm kidding.

62
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:32,651
One of my earliest works.

63
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:34,260
Totally boring.

64
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:35,863
No, I don't think so,

65
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:37,801
I mean nothing's just a picture.

66
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:39,400
if viewed correctly

67
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:40,813
- whatever that means

68
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:43,312
one can see world views, obsessions,

69
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:45,293
manifestations of the subconscious.

70
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:48,501
If I weren't...

71
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:50,091
a lesbian,

72
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,770
I'd jump your bones.

73
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:55,531
I've always had this thing

74
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:57,683
for middle-aged men.

75
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:01,240
And you have these
piercing, discerning eyes

76
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:03,651
which remind me of my father

77
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:05,523
who was a shrink. And I'm like...

78
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:06,691
God,

79
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:08,703
I am so

80
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:10,292
hot.

81
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:13,631
Pinky, some guy from
ArtNews wants to talk to you.

82
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:16,282
Don't go away.

83
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:22,030
Does it make you feel anything ?

84
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:22,911
Like what ?

85
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:25,990
I can't tell you how to feel.

86
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:28,150
Right now, I feel pretty good.

87
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:29,202
We're leaving.

88
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,692
We're still looking at the exhibit.

89
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:32,601
Now.

90
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,322
Now, now.

91
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,350
Yeah, I guess we're leaving, so...

92
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,040
- Reid, now.
- Nice to meet you.

93
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:40,790
on the way. Bye !

94
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:53,510
Today, we thought we'd focus on what is

95
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:55,940
probably the most important
component of profiling or

96
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:58,253
for that matter, any
investigative technique :

97
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:59,392
Victimology.

98
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:01,781
The word victim stems
from the latin word

99
00:04:01,796 --> 00:04:03,961
"victima" which means "sacrifice."

100
00:04:04,826 --> 00:04:07,411
No, I can't go to the gym. I'm
waiting for my shooting script.

101
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:11,610
I think it just came.

102
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:13,072
Yeah.

103
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:14,903
Okay, I'll see you
at the gym, babe, bye.

104
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:16,481
Victims of violent crimes

105
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:17,921
are brutalized by a subject

106
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,493
who takes it upon him or herself

107
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:22,492
to decide life or death
of a fellow human being.

108
00:04:23,438 --> 00:04:24,091
Hey.

109
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:27,421
Are you gonna give it to me ?

110
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:32,562
There are around

111
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:34,543
16 million people

112
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:36,741
in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

113
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,241
Every time a person is killed,

114
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:40,620
robbed, or raped,

115
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:43,243
Most important question
you will ask yourself

116
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:44,391
is "why ?".

117
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:46,510
Why did your unsub choose

118
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:47,651
this victim

119
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:49,321
at this time.

120
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:51,211
- Natalie ?
- Was there anything done

121
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:53,130
which provoked the criminal to act ?

122
00:04:53,237 --> 00:04:55,360
Or was the target available or weak,

123
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:57,521
a causality of circumstance ?

124
00:05:00,657 --> 00:05:01,742
Natalie ?

125
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:04,912
Natalie.

126
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,391
Oh, my God !

127
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:08,473
oh, my god ! No ! Natalie !

128
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:10,642
No ! Nathalie ! Oh, my god !

129
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:54,823
You know, we really can get
ourselves to the airport.

130
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,184
I didn't invite the FBI here

131
00:05:56,198 --> 00:05:57,996
to let them make their
own way around town.

132
00:05:58,001 --> 00:05:59,394
We really appreciate it.

133
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:01,896
I can't thank you guys enough
for conducting the seminar.

134
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:03,325
Well, don't hesitate to call

135
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:05,035
if there's anything we can help with.

136
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,496
- You got it ?
- Yeah !

137
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:11,983
Kim here.

138
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:18,046
Great.

139
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,745
Yeah, I'll be there as soon
as I drop the FBI agents at LAX

140
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:26,395
Everything all right ?

141
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:28,796
Double murder at a Hollywood bungalow.

142
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:29,972
A celebrity.

143
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,726
A young movie star Natalie
Ryan and her fiancי,

144
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:34,156
apparently shot to death.

145
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,263
It's gonna be a major pain in the ass.

146
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:40,803
You guys care to take a quick look
before I drive you to the airport ?

147
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:41,975
It's on the way.

148
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,205
Absolutely.

149
00:06:58,378 --> 00:06:59,954
No sign of forced entry.

150
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:04,594
Same weapon.

151
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:06,923
The girl was shot execution style.

152
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,236
Once in the head.

153
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:10,304
The male three times in the torso.

154
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:12,134
So you have 2 different MOs.

155
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,884
We have an image on the
video surveillance camera.

156
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,836
Looks like a messenger of some
kind wearing a motorcycle helmet.

157
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,316
He's unidentifiable.

158
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:21,524
There's no sign of struggle
between the girl and the unsub

159
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:22,914
from the door to the couch.

160
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:24,844
He most likely forced her at gunpoint.

161
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:27,364
He told her to trust him. "do
what I say. I won't hurt you."

162
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:28,545
Fatal mistake.

163
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,126
He asked her to sit on
the couch and then...

164
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:32,554
shot her in the head.

165
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:35,173
Fiancי wasn't expected, his
killing's messier, it's...

166
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:37,686
less controlled, it's less organized.

167
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:39,523
What do you think ?

168
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,643
I've had a couple other cases recently.

169
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:42,796
Past few months.

170
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,775
Same type of weapon. 22 caliber handgun.

171
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:47,314
Both shot in the head.

172
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,715
The first was an
established film producer.

173
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,116
Wally Melman.

174
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,226
and the second was Chloe Harris,

175
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:54,606
another young actress...

176
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:56,533
but not as well known as Natalie here.

177
00:07:56,538 --> 00:07:57,895
Any forensic evidence ?

178
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:58,864
No.

179
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,086
The guys have been going
through this place all morning

180
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,694
and haven't come up with anything.

181
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,185
So he clearly knows
how to cover his tracks.

182
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,795
Like a professional hit man ?

183
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:07,983
Maybe.

184
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:13,884
Gideon,

185
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,156
There are people actually taking
photographs of us from the next yard.

186
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:18,724
Welcome to L.A.!

187
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:24,444
22's are small but efficient.

188
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:26,533
They bounce around inside
a person like a pinball.

189
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,154
Preferred weapon of the mafia.

190
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:30,686
You know, there's no obvious
sexual component to these crimes,

191
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:32,963
which is usually the
case with serial murders.

192
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,894
so are are thinking
this is a serial killer ?

193
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,446
It's certainly a series of murders,

194
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,425
we don't know enough
yet to call them serial.

195
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:42,463
Would you consider hanging
out in L.A. a little while,

196
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:43,846
let me lean on your expertise

197
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:45,364
until we do figure out what we've got ?

198
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:46,914
Yeah. just cancel our flights.

199
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:49,473
We'll have the rest of
our team out here ASAP.

200
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:52,623
First 2 victims : Wally Melman,

201
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,085
Chloe Harris. Both
killed in public places.

202
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:57,273
Chloe was killed while walking her dog

203
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:58,566
on the beach in Santa Monica

204
00:08:58,578 --> 00:08:59,874
which she did every morning.

205
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:02,793
And Wally was killed
outside of a massage parlor.

206
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:04,803
- In Culver city.
- Which he went to every tuesday.

207
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,306
If he knows their
schedules, maybe that means

208
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:07,854
he follows his victims for a while.

209
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:09,094
And not a single witness.

210
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,904
So we know this unsub can blend in.

211
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,255
Regardless of the location,

212
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,234
he has the ability to
hide in plain sight.

213
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,344
He's meticulous.

214
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:17,166
The media's calling
Natalie Ryan's murder

215
00:09:17,178 --> 00:09:19,463
the biggest celebrity
homicide since Sharon Tate.

216
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:21,254
What does that mean for us ?

217
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:23,416
That everybody will be watching.

218
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,363
This guy is an assassin ?

219
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:29,503
When you look at the victimolgy,

220
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,896
there's no obvious links.

221
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,685
All the kills are clean except in
the instance of the last victim,

222
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:34,765
Jeremy Collins.

223
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:37,643
There's absolutely no evidence
left at the crime scene.

224
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:38,576
there's no DNA,

225
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,916
no manifestation of
psycho-sexual release,

226
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,815
and there's no detectable
signature of any kind.

227
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,796
Remember, our profiles are formulated

228
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:48,144
not just by what's
present at the scene but,

229
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,843
also what's absent.

230
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:51,713
From all the evidence
that we've gathered,

231
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:54,576
we believe that you're
looking for a type-4 assassin.

232
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,535
- Type 4 ?
- Type 1's are political assassins,

233
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:59,634
like John Wilkes Booth. Type 2's are

234
00:09:59,638 --> 00:10:01,656
egocentrics looking
for simple recognition.

235
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:02,945
Type 3's are psychopaths,

236
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:05,265
cold-blooded killers who
leave far messier scenes.

237
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:06,914
and type 4, our Unsub,

238
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,004
suffers from a major mental disorder

239
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:10,544
and is frequently delusional.

240
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,584
the closer we come to
figuring out that delusion,

241
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:14,654
the closer we'll get
to finding the unsub.

242
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:16,864
What's he going to
be doing until we do ?

243
00:10:17,141 --> 00:10:18,514
Finding other victims.

244
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:19,983
Excuse me,

245
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:20,755
Hi.

246
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:23,496
Is there a detective Kim here ?

247
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,765
Right here.

248
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,475
You're heading the investigation
into the Natalie Ryan murder ?

249
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:28,354
Yes...

250
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:32,044
My... I have a client. She's...

251
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:34,824
Is there any place we could be private ?

252
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,506
We're all working this murder.

253
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:38,593
Well...

254
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:42,215
She received a note, my client did,

255
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,424
and she freaked out.

256
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:44,903
I told her not to worry about it.

257
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,173
Where is the note ?

258
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:50,554
- Where's your client ?
- She's waiting in the other room.

259
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,195
Reid.

260
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,674
Let's go.

261
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,545
Lila.

262
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:08,723
Hi.

263
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,314
How well did you know Natalie Ryan ?

264
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,333
We spoke when we saw
each other in public, but

265
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:15,133
but we were never friends.

266
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,536
How about Wally Melman ?

267
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,353
- What ?
- Wally Melman.

268
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,635
He's a producer who was
killed a couple of months ago.

269
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,396
The paper said that was a robbery

270
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,775
The paper was wrong.

271
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,714
Did you know him ?

272
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:26,903
We met a few times

273
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,696
about a project, but...

274
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:31,456
I didn't get the part,
they went a different way.

275
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:32,705
Which way ?

276
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:34,903
He cast, another act...

277
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:38,663
Oh, my god.

278
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:39,923
What is it ?

279
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:41,424
He cast Natalie Ryan.

280
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:43,844
"You owe me."

281
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:47,094
I guess that's one way to
ice out the competition.

282
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,404
Don't look at me.

283
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,493
I brought her into the police station.

284
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:53,094
Have you ever had a sense
that someone is watching you ?

285
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:54,366
Following you ?

286
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,613
From the moment I get to work, I have :

287
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:58,745
Hair and make-up and wardrobe people,

288
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:00,623
producers, writers, my agent,

289
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:02,546
my manager, publicist.

290
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:04,356
Not to mention photographer...

291
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:05,664
It's part of the life.

292
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:08,044
Anything seems odd,
out of the ordinary ?

293
00:12:08,071 --> 00:12:09,666
Happens on a regular basis

294
00:12:09,681 --> 00:12:11,573
or semi-regular basis ?

295
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,794
What do you mean ?

296
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:15,145
Repetitive phone calls with hang ups,

297
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,016
gifts left anonymously ?

298
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,403
I receive flowers

299
00:12:18,661 --> 00:12:20,883
on the seventh of each
month. They just appear

300
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:24,924
Never a note, just...

301
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:26,664
a plain glass bowl.

302
00:12:27,531 --> 00:12:28,723
Red anemones.

303
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:31,734
My favorite.

304
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:33,314
You don't want to
know who they're from ?

305
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:35,623
Celebrities get anonymous
gifts all the time.

306
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:37,823
She has fans, you know.

307
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:40,996
You remember meeting anyone on
the seventh day of the month ?

308
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:43,284
Or in july,

309
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:44,914
the seventh month of the year ?

310
00:12:45,928 --> 00:12:46,393
No.

311
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:48,406
Wally Melman was a
producer who considered

312
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:50,893
hiring you, but didn't. And...

313
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,114
Natalie was a rival.

314
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,694
And Chloe Harris,

315
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,726
she looks a lot like
you, don't you think ?

316
00:12:58,058 --> 00:12:59,736
- Who ?
- A potential rival.

317
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:01,436
She was murdered, too.

318
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:03,164
So all these...

319
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:05,713
people are being killed because of me ?

320
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:07,356
It's possible.

321
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,253
I'm sorry...

322
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:11,314
I can't.

323
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,895
I have to go.

324
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:21,063
Lila !

325
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,685
Lila.

326
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:25,324
Lila.

327
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,136
What's happening, Spencer ?

328
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,205
It's still rather speculative,

329
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:31,153
but it appears there's
a delusional assassin

330
00:13:31,171 --> 00:13:33,346
who's killing people to
help further your career.

331
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,045
He probably started as a stalker,

332
00:13:35,058 --> 00:13:36,914
an erotomanic stalker.

333
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:39,194
There's a psychopathology
of the evolution

334
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,074
of these types of stalkers.

335
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:43,974
The fact that he's
contacting you indicates that

336
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,204
He believes you owe him something.

337
00:13:46,371 --> 00:13:48,526
This model frequently concludes itself

338
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,853
to one of two possibilities :

339
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,334
Either the stalker will kill himself,

340
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:55,044
or he'll kill the
object of his affection.

341
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,404
With this unsub, we're
looking at a compound profile :

342
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,225
a type-4 delusional assassin.

343
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:11,546
With an erotomanic fixation
on the actress Lila Archer.

344
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:14,455
Erotomanics are a form of stalker,

345
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,415
who posses the delusional
belief that another person,

346
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:19,775
usually of a higher social
status, is in love with them.

347
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:22,456
In the United States, at any given time,

348
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,704
there are over 200,000
people being stalked.

349
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,676
Our Unsub

350
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:28,586
is having a fantasy love affair

351
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:29,873
with Lila Archer.

352
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:32,565
The way John Hinkley
did with Jodie Foster.

353
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:35,706
Miss Archer was not aware of
her stalker until yesterday.

354
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:37,623
He wasn't trying to impress her.

355
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:39,655
He was more like an unwanted,

356
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:41,636
very violent guardian angel.

357
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,003
When the stalk feels as
if they've been in some way

358
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,854
betrayed by their love object,

359
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,556
this often leads to
violence against the target.

360
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,066
In the case of John Robert Bardo when

361
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:54,553
actress Rebecca Schaeffer took
a role where she had to have

362
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:56,663
a sexual relationship
with another character,

363
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:58,184
too enough to force him to snap

364
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:00,046
and seek her out to kill her.

365
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:02,663
Those stalkers can be
either male or female.

366
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,816
It's most likely we're
looking for a single male,

367
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,214
A loner, in his late
twenties to early forties.

368
00:15:08,851 --> 00:15:10,203
Very intelligent,

369
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:12,743
with ample time to follow his victim

370
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,496
and study her habits.

371
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,703
As of yet, the Unsub has not directed

372
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:18,236
any violence towards Miss Archer.

373
00:15:18,238 --> 00:15:20,224
But he has shifted his focus

374
00:15:20,238 --> 00:15:22,634
from those around her to her directly.

375
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:25,105
This doesn't preclude
the fact that anyone,

376
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:27,926
who has the vaguest
association with Miss Archer

377
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,874
is a potential target.

378
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:34,855
I love you,

379
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:36,276
- you're my favorite client.
- No.

380
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,864
I haven't asked you anything yet.

381
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:39,373
I'm not stopping my life.

382
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:40,873
- You could stay with me.
- No.

383
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:43,456
A hotel ? Just until the
police say you're safe ?

384
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:45,346
- Michael !
- You know I worry.

385
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,125
Bye, Michael.

386
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:48,463
Okay. call me...

387
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:49,796
lots. Kisses.

388
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,055
Hello. Good-bye.

389
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:55,586
I'm leaving.

390
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,316
Hey, Mags.

391
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:00,736
He's an odd guy.

392
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,446
Yeah, but who isn't a
little odd out here ?

393
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,465
Well, that's for sure.

394
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:08,306
Look, we're ready to
rehearse scene 43 and...

395
00:16:09,398 --> 00:16:11,243
this was taped to your trailer door.

396
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:12,673
Thanks, hon.

397
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:33,206
I'm intrigued by this particular
version of the verb "to be."

398
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:34,566
Past participle.

399
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,846
Steady state of being, preceding adverb.

400
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:38,914
- "always."
- In english ?

401
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,223
That is english, actually.

402
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:42,524
- We're discussing the verb tenses.
- Reid.

403
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:44,573
Our stalker sounds
like someone she knows.

404
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:46,125
Based on the tense of the verb.

405
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:48,034
Maybe it's time to
get her off the street.

406
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,615
There's been no physical threat to her.

407
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,235
She might be... safe just

408
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:53,416
staying put as opposed to anywhere else.

409
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:55,325
I'm standing right here, guys.

410
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,964
If we did remove you,

411
00:16:56,969 --> 00:16:59,135
we'd have to take you to
an undisclosed location

412
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:01,085
I'm sure your stalker
knows where you live.

413
00:17:01,181 --> 00:17:02,975
I'm not having the
whole show close down.

414
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:04,946
I only need one more scene to shoot.

415
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,155
Last night I decided I wasn't
gonna be afraid of this lunatic.

416
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,314
Am I safe here ?

417
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,875
The set's cleared of everyone
except essential personnel,

418
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:18,255
And we have increased
security at the gate.

419
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:21,415
Lila, they're ready for you.

420
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,095
I'm staying at work, gentlemen.

421
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,196
Well, she's one tough girl.

422
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,706
Yeah.

423
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:35,886
I didn't want to say
anything in front of her,

424
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:39,066
his anger about her going to the police
suggests he might alter his agenda.

425
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,695
It's typical for a stalker.

426
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:42,675
She didn't go alone to the police.

427
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,163
Her manager took her.

428
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:46,216
You and Reid stay here.
Keep an eye on her.

429
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:48,905
- I'll hang back, too.
- Where you going ?

430
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,495
Talk to her manager.

431
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,056
sorry if I was... insensitive

432
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,293
last night.

433
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:08,756
You're only doing your job, right ?

434
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,385
Yeah.

435
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:13,243
Then there's no need to apologize.

436
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:21,175
You don't mind sharing with me, do you ?

437
00:18:22,278 --> 00:18:22,915
No.

438
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,264
You don't mind sharing with me, do you ?

439
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:39,954
- Shut up.
- Go get'em, lover.

440
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:45,885
Hello ?

441
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:47,995
Mr. Ryer ?

442
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:51,315
Michael...

443
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:58,573
Up until now, every victim was a person

444
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,565
who could be perceived
as a threat to ms. Archer.

445
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,955
But Michael wa a friend !

446
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:04,203
He was a threat to the stalker...

447
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,122
Get Lila to a safe house.

448
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:14,854
<i>She's still on set working, did
you meet up with her manager ?</i>

449
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:15,901
<i>Reid,</i>

450
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,163
<i>take her home, have
her pack some things.</i>

451
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:19,612
What's going on ?

452
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:22,333
We were too late.

453
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:26,054
She's gonna be devastated.

454
00:19:26,178 --> 00:19:27,012
<i>I know.</i>

455
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:29,062
JJ's keeping it out
of the press for now.

456
00:19:29,497 --> 00:19:30,793
Let's not tell her yet.

457
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:32,033
Not tell her ?

458
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:33,313
<i>No, not yet.</i>

459
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:35,303
We need her to cooperate with us...

460
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:38,013
in order to protect her.

461
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:39,671
I'll talk to you later.

462
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:46,013
You gonna take her of the street ?

463
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:48,004
I'm gonna completely deny him access.

464
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:50,122
Won't even give him a glimpse of her.

465
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:52,934
Hopefully, that'll bring
him out of the woodwork.

466
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:53,791
Hopefully.

467
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:09,583
Yeah. No, we're pulling up right now.

468
00:20:10,497 --> 00:20:12,371
There's a marked car out front.

469
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:13,732
Yeah.

470
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,694
Got it. I'll check it out.

471
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:21,054
Is everything ok ?

472
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:23,541
I just need to run through
some security measures with you.

473
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,444
All right.

474
00:20:27,178 --> 00:20:28,104
Gideon,

475
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:30,103
you better take a look at these.

476
00:20:36,477 --> 00:20:37,551
Morgan, it's Elle.

477
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:38,614
Yeah.

478
00:20:38,777 --> 00:20:41,434
<i>We found a manila envelope
on Michael Ryer's desk.</i>

479
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:42,612
<i>It's full of photos.</i>

480
00:20:42,829 --> 00:20:43,371
Okay.

481
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:45,773
Well, they're candid
shots os Lila Archer nude.

482
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:49,673
I'm guessing he's probably paying
someone off to keep them out of press.

483
00:20:50,186 --> 00:20:51,194
Do we know who ?

484
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:53,963
The name on the envelope
was Joe Martinez.

485
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:55,644
The paparazzo ?

486
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:56,734
You know him ?

487
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:58,271
Yeah, I dealt with him a lot.

488
00:20:58,696 --> 00:20:59,351
Elle,

489
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,694
we're on it.

490
00:21:05,326 --> 00:21:06,592
I like your house.

491
00:21:07,677 --> 00:21:08,844
I rent it.

492
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,384
Nice. you should also probably
change all your phone numbers.

493
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:13,931
I'm unlisted.

494
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:16,791
Anytime you call an 800
number or an 888 number,

495
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:18,431
Your phone number's put into a databank

496
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:19,943
that's been sold to telemarketers.

497
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,961
If someone get your cell phone
number, they can go on line

498
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:23,382
and research all your records.

499
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,481
Hanging out with you
can be really depressing.

500
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:33,812
You should also probably carry
a piece of paper and a pen

501
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:36,083
with you wherever you go in case
you see any suspicious license plates

502
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:37,532
that often reappear.

503
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:40,344
Photographic collage.

504
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:43,073
I like it because it's
like life, you know ?

505
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:45,742
You know, like obscure, difficult.

506
00:21:47,696 --> 00:21:49,242
You should also get a dog.

507
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:51,254
Like a guard dog of some sort.

508
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:52,422
Allergic.

509
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:54,432
Earl grey or chamomile ?

510
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:55,352
What ?

511
00:21:55,756 --> 00:21:57,152
- What ?
- Do you want some tea ?

512
00:21:57,847 --> 00:21:59,541
Yes, yes, sure.

513
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:03,933
FBI !

514
00:22:04,996 --> 00:22:06,083
Martinez !

515
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:10,474
It's clear.

516
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:22,912
See ?

517
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:25,502
This guy's a real scumbag.

518
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:27,182
You got that right.

519
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:38,771
What's this ?

520
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:40,043
It's a call sheet.

521
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:42,794
It's a shooting schedule for
a film or television show.

522
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:44,554
- That's Lila's show.
- Yeah.

523
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:46,064
He's not supposed to have that ?

524
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:46,691
No.

525
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,672
Look at that.

526
00:23:00,997 --> 00:23:02,072
That's Reid.

527
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:03,781
There's a whole bunch of them.

528
00:23:06,688 --> 00:23:08,053
He a target now ?

529
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:10,474
Not if I can help it. Let's go.

530
00:23:13,178 --> 00:23:13,823
Reid,

531
00:23:14,086 --> 00:23:16,401
it's Morgan, listen to me. You
gotta watch your back over there,

532
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:18,123
we found a bunch of
close-up photos of you

533
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:19,951
at this guy Joseph Martinez's studio.

534
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,061
It looks like he could be the Unsub.

535
00:23:22,076 --> 00:23:23,812
He had a ton of photos
of Lila and Natalie,

536
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,394
plus a call sheet for Lila's show.

537
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:27,851
We're on our way right now, but
I need you to be real careful

538
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,304
until we get there, all right ?

539
00:23:29,726 --> 00:23:30,461
All right.

540
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:42,904
- You're hit ?
- Yeah, it's just my shoulder.

541
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:44,681
All right, I'm calling for help.

542
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,811
Officer down, we need an
ambulance in La Brea and Wilshire !

543
00:24:00,028 --> 00:24:01,073
How are we doing ?

544
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:02,206
He'll make it.

545
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:04,603
Caught one in the shoulder
and shattered his collarbone.

546
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,493
Are you okay ?

547
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,436
I'm fine.

548
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,504
No sign of this Martinez,
the photographer ?

549
00:24:08,678 --> 00:24:09,106
No.

550
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,285
Whoever took a shot at you
followed you from the set.

551
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,035
Martinez has a bunch of
paperwork in his studio

552
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,066
that says where Lila's
gonna be every day.

553
00:24:15,548 --> 00:24:16,353
Gideon.

554
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,554
That's what I thought. Thanks.

555
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:21,856
Garcia's gone through every
article written about Lila.

556
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,795
She never says anything about red
anemones being her favorite flower.

557
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:26,723
We're looking for someone
pretty close to her.

558
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,233
This list gets shorter every day.

559
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:30,223
He's circling in. We
need to get to her house.

560
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:33,256
I'll make sure the press doesn't
get out of hand with this mess.

561
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:46,405
Feel anything yet ?

562
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:49,975
There's something definitely
appealing about this one.

563
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,774
It's a start.

564
00:24:57,889 --> 00:24:58,845
What are you doing ?

565
00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:00,776
- Going for a swim.
- What ?

566
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,124
No, Lila !

567
00:25:10,891 --> 00:25:13,183
Lila, you cannot do this.

568
00:25:13,231 --> 00:25:14,503
Five minutes.

569
00:25:15,358 --> 00:25:16,725
Go get a suit in the house.

570
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:18,496
What ? No ! I don't wanna grab a suit.

571
00:25:18,508 --> 00:25:20,243
- Are you kidding me ? No !
- Join me.

572
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:21,744
No, I'm not gonna join you.

573
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,023
Why not ?

574
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,156
You're being pursued by a psychotic
killer who shoots people in the head !

575
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:29,183
I'm not gonna stop living
my life. I'm just not.

576
00:25:31,301 --> 00:25:33,853
Lila, I'm begging of you. Will
you please get out of the pool ?

577
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,036
Really, Spence, you
should live a little.

578
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:39,493
Live a little ? I've known you 48 hours,
I feel like I've already aged 10 years.

579
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,976
I can't be that bad.

580
00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:44,074
Yes. no, you are that bad.

581
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:53,324
Fine,

582
00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:55,023
can you help me out at least ?

583
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:08,885
Yes, very funny. Laugh it up, Lila.

584
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:09,826
Hilarious.

585
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:12,074
My gun's wet. So great.

586
00:26:19,718 --> 00:26:20,705
My clothes.

587
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,675
You should have worn the suit.

588
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,186
This is completely inappropriate.

589
00:26:31,198 --> 00:26:33,363
This ? What's this ?

590
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:34,806
This isn't...

591
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:46,493
No, there's this thing

592
00:26:46,578 --> 00:26:48,023
called transference.

593
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:49,296
You don't like me ?

594
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:50,193
What ?

595
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:52,975
- You don't like me.
- No, are you cra... I do !

596
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,943
I like you too. Just
I'm a federal agent,

597
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:58,374
you know, and I'm
supposed to protect you.

598
00:26:58,388 --> 00:27:00,073
Then keep me close.

599
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:02,156
I'm just, I'm a little bit worried.

600
00:27:02,168 --> 00:27:04,253
You know, we're... we're in a pool,

601
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:07,484
and it's a... we're pretty much exposed.

602
00:27:09,848 --> 00:27:11,105
We have cops.

603
00:27:11,578 --> 00:27:13,244
We have cops posted out front.

604
00:27:14,118 --> 00:27:15,826
There are coyotes out back.

605
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:20,644
And right here it's just... you and me.

606
00:27:27,431 --> 00:27:30,206
Stop. I'm sorry. I have to...

607
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:32,296
I have to tell you something.

608
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,185
What ?

609
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:36,046
I didn't want to tell you this
before'cause I was a bit worried.

610
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,494
I don't know how to say it,
but I can't not tell you.

611
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,055
What is it ?

612
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:43,376
Your manager, Michael...

613
00:27:44,739 --> 00:27:45,345
What ?

614
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:50,793
Gideon went to check on him, but...

615
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,946
he got there too late.

616
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:06,065
Lila.

617
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:12,403
How could
you-

618
00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:17,356
- How could you not tell me ?
- I was afraid you'd be upset.

619
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:20,933
You...

620
00:28:21,518 --> 00:28:23,623
You knew what you knew, and...

621
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,434
How could you not...

622
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,446
I'm so sorry.

623
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,205
Don't. Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

624
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,905
Give me a reason.

625
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:48,624
Well, we found him in the bushes.

626
00:28:48,629 --> 00:28:50,675
I told her she should cut those.

627
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:55,914
I fell in.

628
00:28:55,931 --> 00:28:58,136
Yeah, and I'm sure there's
plenty of photos of it.

629
00:28:58,138 --> 00:29:00,133
Stop shoving me, man.

630
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,846
You're a suspect in the
murder of Wally Melman,

631
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:05,443
- Natalie Ryan, and Jeremy Collins.
- Murder ? what ?

632
00:29:05,788 --> 00:29:06,706
Shut up !

633
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:08,664
We know for a fact that you
have hundreds of photographs

634
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:11,285
of Lila Archer and Natalie Ryan
on the walls of your studio.

635
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:13,264
You have miss Archer's
daily schedule on your desk.

636
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:15,414
- You've been stalking her.
- Look, guy. Hold up.

637
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,204
Every parazzo's a celebrity stalker.

638
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,516
If you don't stalk'em,
you don't get the shot.

639
00:29:18,528 --> 00:29:20,924
If you don't make the shot,
you don't sell no pictures.

640
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,076
- Well, this one is gonna cost you.
- What ! No.

641
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:25,796
- That's just wrong.
- Tell it to your lawyer.

642
00:29:25,908 --> 00:29:27,713
- I'm still being locked up ?
- That's right.

643
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:29,895
Very least, you're
trespassing. Let's go.

644
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:32,914
You're welcome.

645
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,906
Are you still...

646
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:57,246
Are you okay ?

647
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,396
Michael was like family.

648
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,445
I'm so sorry.

649
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:05,103
It's just...

650
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,654
so hard to trust people out here.

651
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:11,273
You don't know who to believe.

652
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:14,043
Everybody wants something from you.

653
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,733
That's why I thought you were different.

654
00:30:18,939 --> 00:30:20,684
I know I should have told you.

655
00:30:21,548 --> 00:30:22,995
I told him not to.

656
00:30:23,678 --> 00:30:25,573
He was only following my orders.

657
00:30:35,091 --> 00:30:35,943
You know...

658
00:30:36,678 --> 00:30:38,875
The last time I was able to fully

659
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,236
trust someone was at Julliard.

660
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,005
Before I was... a somebody.

661
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:50,453
Julliard.

662
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:56,595
And didn't you say you used
to live on Houston street ?

663
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:57,505
What ?

664
00:30:58,968 --> 00:31:01,465
You were a waitress.
You lived on Houston.

665
00:31:02,578 --> 00:31:03,443
Yeah.

666
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:10,504
I need to take this thing apart.

667
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,785
What ?

668
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:13,683
I'll put it back.

669
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,556
I think I see images of you.

670
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:17,374
Guys.

671
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,155
Lila, it looks like someone's
been stalking you for years.

672
00:31:29,268 --> 00:31:31,074
Yeah, this tells your whole life story.

673
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,144
Movie premieres,

674
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:34,565
- theater playbills.
- Everything since college.

675
00:31:35,788 --> 00:31:37,163
That's our country house.

676
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:38,463
Right here.

677
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:40,665
Who gave you this collage ?

678
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,744
He did.

679
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,525
This guy ? Who is he ?

680
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:46,273
That's the guy I went to High
School with. Parker Dunley.

681
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,363
Garcia : Parker Dunley.

682
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:52,843
E- mail me a sheet on him, all right ?

683
00:32:09,293 --> 00:32:10,408
Look who's here.

684
00:32:10,865 --> 00:32:11,769
Where's parker ?

685
00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:13,799
I don't even get a hello ?

686
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:15,587
Where is he ?

687
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:17,779
Guess that follows since I...

688
00:32:18,074 --> 00:32:19,390
I never got a good-bye.

689
00:32:19,874 --> 00:32:21,059
Parker !

690
00:32:22,684 --> 00:32:23,680
Friend of yours ?

691
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:25,169
No.

692
00:32:26,693 --> 00:32:27,787
How could I help ?

693
00:32:29,523 --> 00:32:30,817
Spencer's friend, right ?

694
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:31,507
Yes.

695
00:32:32,674 --> 00:32:34,707
Did you give Lila Archer a collage ?

696
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:35,599
What ?

697
00:32:35,864 --> 00:32:38,290
There's a photographic collage
above Lila Archer's sofa.

698
00:32:38,304 --> 00:32:39,870
She says you gave it to her.

699
00:32:40,065 --> 00:32:40,899
So ?

700
00:32:41,053 --> 00:32:42,899
So it has your face hidden all over it.

701
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:45,460
I didn't make the damn thing.

702
00:32:46,302 --> 00:32:47,099
So you...

703
00:32:47,955 --> 00:32:50,907
Just happened to give her a work of art
that contains most of her life in it ?

704
00:32:53,453 --> 00:32:54,109
No.

705
00:32:54,884 --> 00:32:55,569
No.

706
00:32:56,095 --> 00:32:59,027
If there's something you aren't saying,
now would be a real good time to say it.

707
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:01,349
All right.

708
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:05,239
All right, I lied.

709
00:33:05,475 --> 00:33:06,539
What about ?

710
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:09,270
I just wanted her to like me.

711
00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:10,508
I met her here.

712
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:13,817
She was a fan of art, I figured
if there was hip, young stars

713
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:15,978
coming into the gallery,
it would help business.

714
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,538
What was the lie ?

715
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:19,447
Someone gave me the
piece to give to her,

716
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:21,529
But I told her it was from me.

717
00:33:21,545 --> 00:33:23,478
I said I found it and
I thought she'd love it.

718
00:33:23,494 --> 00:33:24,568
And who gave it to you ?

719
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:26,638
Her name's Maggie Lowe. She...

720
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:28,580
She works on Lila's show.

721
00:33:29,514 --> 00:33:32,069
She said she went to college
with Li. She's like a...

722
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:35,419
P.A. or A.D. or some acronym.

723
00:33:35,962 --> 00:33:38,687
She wanted to make sure
that Lila got the collage,

724
00:33:38,702 --> 00:33:40,677
but she didn't want Lila to
know that she gave it to her.

725
00:33:40,684 --> 00:33:42,979
She said to say that it
was from a secret admirer.

726
00:33:45,154 --> 00:33:46,670
But I told her it was from me.

727
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:49,529
I have a name. Maggie Lowe.

728
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:52,467
She's the Unsub. She's on Lila's show.

729
00:33:52,954 --> 00:33:54,119
We're on our way.

730
00:33:55,275 --> 00:33:57,197
Lila, do you know someone
named Maggie Lowe ?

731
00:33:57,615 --> 00:33:58,530
Mags ?

732
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:01,579
Yeah, of course I know her.
I've known her for years.

733
00:34:02,335 --> 00:34:03,969
I got her a job on my show.

734
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:07,617
What ?

735
00:34:08,195 --> 00:34:10,660
- That's her calling right now.
- Is she calling from a cell phone ?

736
00:34:10,855 --> 00:34:13,499
- Yeah.
- Lila, we think Maggie's the Unsub.

737
00:34:13,675 --> 00:34:14,420
The what ?

738
00:34:14,772 --> 00:34:15,899
The stalker.

739
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:17,248
No way.

740
00:34:17,294 --> 00:34:18,438
Answer the phone.

741
00:34:18,842 --> 00:34:20,329
That's... that's crazy.

742
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:21,908
Answer the phone, act
completely natural.

743
00:34:21,924 --> 00:34:24,730
The longer you keep her on the line,
the more we'll be able to trace the call.

744
00:34:25,234 --> 00:34:26,200
Trust me.

745
00:34:29,872 --> 00:34:30,637
Hello ?

746
00:34:31,915 --> 00:34:32,990
Hello, Maggie ?

747
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:35,359
Maggie, is that you ?

748
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:37,367
What's wrong ?

749
00:34:38,004 --> 00:34:39,559
<i>Oracle of Quantico, speak</i>

750
00:34:39,574 --> 00:34:41,280
if you deign to hear truth.

751
00:34:41,364 --> 00:34:43,140
<i>Garcia, I need an emergency trace</i>

752
00:34:43,154 --> 00:34:45,549
on a cell phone call to
Lila Archer's cell phone.

753
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,269
Sure, go ahead.

754
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:49,737
3-2-35-5-5
0-1-2-9.

755
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,668
Okay, keep her talking.
Keep her talking.

756
00:34:51,683 --> 00:34:52,638
Maggie ?

757
00:34:53,853 --> 00:34:55,770
<i>I am so tired Lila.</i>

758
00:34:56,624 --> 00:34:57,518
<i>Tired ?</i>

759
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:02,068
There's been so much upset,

760
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,220
in the world really.

761
00:35:04,452 --> 00:35:06,499
I think it's just so tragic.

762
00:35:06,514 --> 00:35:07,530
<i>All of it.</i>

763
00:35:09,302 --> 00:35:10,499
I miss you.

764
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:12,390
I just do.

765
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:14,367
Mags.

766
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:16,800
I saw you today.

767
00:35:17,013 --> 00:35:19,028
<i>It's never gonna be the same as it was.</i>

768
00:35:20,694 --> 00:35:22,638
It's just never gonna be the same.

769
00:35:24,604 --> 00:35:25,499
I don't know

770
00:35:26,034 --> 00:35:27,378
what you're talking about.

771
00:35:27,423 --> 00:35:28,607
<i>I'm talking about</i>

772
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:31,488
that time in college.

773
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:34,049
When the heat in your apartment was off

774
00:35:34,064 --> 00:35:36,208
and the two of us
stayed in my dorm room.

775
00:35:36,223 --> 00:35:37,578
don't you remember ?

776
00:35:40,323 --> 00:35:42,107
You were playing Ophelia

777
00:35:42,123 --> 00:35:44,278
on the main stage.

778
00:35:46,662 --> 00:35:47,850
I remember.

779
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:50,608
That was the happiest time of my life.

780
00:35:52,215 --> 00:35:53,030
<i>Maggie...</i>

781
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:55,409
<i>Sweetheart,</i>

782
00:35:56,994 --> 00:35:58,788
That was only for a weekend.

783
00:35:58,882 --> 00:36:00,579
The happiest time,

784
00:36:01,373 --> 00:36:04,129
and you don't know
anything about me at all.

785
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,668
And I did everything for you.

786
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:12,978
Reid,

787
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:15,398
is Lila's address 6028 Pike street ?

788
00:36:15,415 --> 00:36:16,169
<i>Yeah.</i>

789
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:19,199
She's calling from inside the house.

790
00:36:19,355 --> 00:36:20,730
<i>I'll get you some backup.</i>

791
00:36:23,124 --> 00:36:24,227
Lila.

792
00:36:27,055 --> 00:36:28,400
How is she in the house ?

793
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:30,007
She has keys.

794
00:37:10,015 --> 00:37:11,988
Why'd you have to bring
these people here ?

795
00:37:12,194 --> 00:37:13,849
- Put down the gun.
- Maggie.

796
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:17,128
Don't call me Maggie. You don't know me.

797
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,168
Come on, Lila. Let's go.

798
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:21,197
We really got to go, baby.

799
00:37:21,582 --> 00:37:22,259
Come on.

800
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:24,290
Maggie, don't hurt her.

801
00:37:24,895 --> 00:37:26,129
You don't need to hurt her.

802
00:37:26,155 --> 00:37:27,399
You don't know anything.

803
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:31,109
I would never... do
anything to hurt you.

804
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:32,948
No.

805
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:35,548
I created you.

806
00:37:36,695 --> 00:37:37,800
No, you didn't.

807
00:37:40,195 --> 00:37:42,868
Yes, I did.

808
00:37:43,615 --> 00:37:44,579
I know

809
00:37:44,905 --> 00:37:46,118
I did.

810
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:48,119
God.

811
00:37:48,842 --> 00:37:50,820
You stupid,

812
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:52,769
ungrateful...

813
00:37:53,303 --> 00:37:54,228
God !

814
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:57,918
I can't believe that I loved you.

815
00:37:58,265 --> 00:37:59,647
Maggie, she...

816
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:02,229
She loves me, now.

817
00:38:05,265 --> 00:38:05,978
What ?

818
00:38:07,374 --> 00:38:08,467
She told me so.

819
00:38:08,725 --> 00:38:09,939
We were in the pool,

820
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:11,489
she kissed me.

821
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:14,140
- Now she loves me, okay ?
- No.

822
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,758
Tell her we kissed in the pool.

823
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:18,910
No !

824
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:25,720
Yes, we kissed.

825
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:28,279
God !

826
00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:35,689
Don't move.

827
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:38,269
Please kill me.

828
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:40,487
Come on, shoot me please.

829
00:38:40,505 --> 00:38:42,440
I'd be so much, happier. Please.

830
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:43,747
Please !

831
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:46,718
Come on.

832
00:38:48,825 --> 00:38:50,378
We're gonna get you help.

833
00:39:05,272 --> 00:39:06,567
Back up, let's go.

834
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:07,859
Darling,

835
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:09,627
E- scape wants to do a segment on you

836
00:39:09,635 --> 00:39:11,829
this evening on the stalking
event. I told them yes.

837
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:14,260
- Why'd you do that ?
- It's okay. It's gonna be fine.

838
00:39:14,274 --> 00:39:16,030
The hair and makeup people
are coming in 10 minutes.

839
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:18,268
There's also talk about 60 minutes.

840
00:39:19,462 --> 00:39:22,017
This kind of publicity makes
me really uncomfortable.

841
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:23,080
Don't be ridiculous,

842
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,249
I'm talking about performing
a public service, all right ?

843
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:27,167
Stalking is a major
problem in this country.

844
00:39:27,184 --> 00:39:28,400
It's good, it's good.

845
00:39:28,852 --> 00:39:30,078
I got to take this.

846
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:35,327
Looks like... you're
gonna be pretty busy.

847
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:36,358
I wish...

848
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:38,319
things had been...

849
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:41,009
more normal

850
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:42,380
when we had met.

851
00:39:42,475 --> 00:39:43,168
Lila,

852
00:39:43,693 --> 00:39:44,967
believe me when I say this.

853
00:39:45,355 --> 00:39:47,789
I've never known a normal
day in my entire life.

854
00:39:48,182 --> 00:39:48,877
Hey, Reid.

855
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:50,820
Come on, we got to move.

856
00:39:51,595 --> 00:39:53,049
- Gotcha.
- Well,

857
00:39:53,343 --> 00:39:55,118
If I'm ever in Washington, and

858
00:39:56,043 --> 00:39:58,327
I were to give you a
call, that would be okay ?

859
00:39:58,353 --> 00:40:00,370
Yeah, I'd like that a lot.

860
00:40:04,062 --> 00:40:06,000
- I don't want to intrude.
- No, not at all.

861
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:08,749
- Reid, sorry, we're waiting.
- Lila !

862
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:10,007
Lila, we gotta go.

863
00:40:10,013 --> 00:40:12,387
And I don't know when
you're gonna be back here,

864
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:14,158
the next time you're in Los Angeles,

865
00:40:14,173 --> 00:40:16,378
if you'll be fit for time.

866
00:40:23,235 --> 00:40:24,847
Lila, we got to go.

867
00:40:40,485 --> 00:40:42,039
Bernard Shaw once said,

868
00:40:42,052 --> 00:40:44,289
<i>"An american has no sense of privacy.</i>

869
00:40:44,305 --> 00:40:46,070
<i>He does not know what it means.</i>

870
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:48,089
<i>There is no such thing in the country."</i>

871
00:40:55,142 --> 00:40:56,799
Godd night, hollywood !

872
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:57,970
Come on, man.

873
00:40:58,825 --> 00:40:59,870
You know, Reid,

874
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:02,760
you're lucky they didn't get a shot of you
next to the pool trying to draw your gun.

875
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:04,208
You looked like a wet rat.

876
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:08,500
I was playing.

877
00:41:09,895 --> 00:41:11,397
Did you know that...

878
00:41:12,433 --> 00:41:13,358
she...

879
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:16,677
I kissed her in the pool ?

880
00:41:17,283 --> 00:41:18,870
It's so weird. It doesn't even...

881
00:41:19,124 --> 00:41:21,197
feel like it really happened, you know ?

882
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:22,339
Sure, sure.

883
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,220
- She's a beautiful young actress.
- Yeah.

884
00:41:24,843 --> 00:41:27,107
I kept explaining to her about
transference and the fact that,

885
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:29,410
she probably only liked me

886
00:41:29,422 --> 00:41:31,607
- because I was there to protect her.
- Reid.

887
00:41:32,695 --> 00:41:33,897
You were her hero.

888
00:41:35,515 --> 00:41:36,939
I wanted to think that.

889
00:41:36,954 --> 00:41:39,040
No, no. Don't go selling
yourself short, kid.

890
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:41,740
You took down an armed
subject without firing a shot.

891
00:41:42,354 --> 00:41:43,460
You saved her life.

892
00:41:44,064 --> 00:41:45,669
That's pretty much a hero in my book.

893
00:41:48,435 --> 00:41:50,007
Let me ask you this. Have you ever...

894
00:41:50,354 --> 00:41:52,698
crossed the professional
boundaries with a...

895
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:55,107
a victim of a case you were working on ?

896
00:41:58,402 --> 00:41:58,979
No.

897
00:41:59,554 --> 00:42:01,480
It's pretty bad, right ?

898
00:42:01,505 --> 00:42:04,719
There are some things you can't control
even with that big old brain of yours.

899
00:42:05,612 --> 00:42:06,809
No harm, no foul.

900
00:42:08,783 --> 00:42:09,537
Let it go.

901
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:11,377
Hey, Morgan ?

902
00:42:12,665 --> 00:42:14,330
Has there ever been...

903
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:16,597
a girl that you wanted
to be with for more than,

904
00:42:16,605 --> 00:42:17,937
you know, not just one night ?

905
00:42:19,595 --> 00:42:20,567
Excuse me ?

906
00:42:20,935 --> 00:42:22,888
I've never seen you

907
00:42:23,053 --> 00:42:24,610
with the same girl twice.

908
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:26,057
- are you calling me a dog ?
- No, no.

909
00:42:26,073 --> 00:42:27,567
No. Not at all. I'm just...

910
00:42:28,194 --> 00:42:29,689
I'm just trying to figure out if...

911
00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:32,467
this feeling I have
is ever gonna go away.

912
00:42:32,905 --> 00:42:35,417
Reid, what we do for a living,
it takes up all our time.

913
00:42:35,825 --> 00:42:38,348
And a relationship's hard
enough even in the same city.

914
00:42:38,444 --> 00:42:39,000
So,

915
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,639
I mean, you're saying it's probably wise

916
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:43,860
that I don't call her, right ?

917
00:42:44,702 --> 00:42:46,367
I can't answer that one for you.

918
00:42:47,513 --> 00:42:48,980
Hey, I'll tell you what I do know.

919
00:42:49,722 --> 00:42:51,820
You don't need to come up
with that answer tonight.

920
00:42:54,654 --> 00:42:55,410
I'm out.

921
00:42:56,294 --> 00:42:57,428
Have a good weekend.

922
00:42:57,444 --> 00:42:58,900
Yeah, you too, Romeo.

923
00:42:59,305 --> 00:43:59,164

00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,820
<i>PHOENIX,ARIZONA</i>

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,510
He's too damn old.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,670
Overweight, overpriced.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,910
Too damn old.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,650
What, so you're saying they
should have kept marion?

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,620
That's exactly what i'm saying.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,310
Marion, nash, stoudemire.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,660
Well, that's a team.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,880
Yeah, same team that couldn't
even make it past the first round.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,140
What is it?

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,680
- Where are we?
- What?

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,730
I'm asking you, where are we?

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,580
I don't know. Sixth and... Buckeye?

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,910
Wrong. We were on sixth 8 bloc ago.

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,770
Well, so what? What
are we doing back here?

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,570
We're learning.

17
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,030
Now, where are we?

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,680
I don't know.

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,160
You've got to know.

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,510
You always, always have
got to know where you are.

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,790
I mean, let's just say you jumput
of the car and run after some maggot.

22
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,970
This thing can't help you.

23
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,780
Back-up will wind up at
the car 5 blocks away.

24
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,760
Won't do you much good, now will it?

25
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,810
No, sir.

26
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,650
Don't sir me. Sir's for the academy.

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,300
I'm your partner.

28
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,930
Yes, sir--uh,
right.

29
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,950
Four-fifteen frank, 4129 23rd avenue.

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,510
Repeat, four-fifteen frank
in progress at 4129 23rd.

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,220
That's domestic violence.
Tell them we're on it.

32
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,930
Uh, copy that.

33
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,440
Damn it. My flashlight.

34
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,170
Are you kidding me? Hurry up!

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,430
Hold it!

36
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,970
Oh, my god! Officer down, officer down!

37
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,720
Copy that, officer. What's your 20?

38
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,380
We're at 23rd street!

39
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,320
Officer?

40
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,980
Back-up is on
the way.907--

41
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,120
all units, 4129 23rd avenue...

42
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,160
Earlier this evening, the phoenix
police force lost two of our own.

43
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,150
Sergeant manuel rodriguez and officer thomas
kayser were killed in the line of duty.

44
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,020
That's 3 officers in the past 4 days.

45
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,950
After the first shooting, the phoenix
police department assumed gang involvement.

46
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,450
Pretty reasonable assumption.

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,050
True. Almost 30% of all officer
slayings are gang related.

48
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,950
Technically it's closer to 40%.

49
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,750
If a cop isn't killed during a commission of
a crime, gang involvement is highly likely.

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,660
Actually, their precinct commander believes
it may be a serial and has asked for our help.

51
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,210
What makes him doubt the gang theory?

52
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,260
A couple of things.

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,420
Last night's victims were killed
exactly the same way as the first.

54
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,370
Shot in the neck.

55
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,020
Something that the press didn't release.

56
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,270
Well, now, wait. There could
still be a gang behind this.

57
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,100
Killers working together
could establish the same M.O.

58
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,160
Commander Marks hasn't ruled it
out, but there's another detail--

59
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,330
Trophies. Killer took their badges.

60
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,420
Gang members don't
usually take trophies.

61
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,040
They don't need to.

62
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,770
This is an unsub with something to pre.

63
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,010
And he's got the entire city on edge.

64
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,410
Kill those who protect and
serve, and no one feels safe.

00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,000
and i for one would be willing
to skin humanity to prove it."

70
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,010
Ayn rand.

71
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,390
Go ahead, Garcia.

72
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,880
Ok, while you birds have been in the
air, i got the 411 on the first shooting.

73
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,800
Apparently every saturday night,
phoenix p.d.sets up a dui checkpoint.

74
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,900
Is that common knowledge?

75
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,100
Mais, oui. Public awareness
is part of the deterrent.

76
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,280
So our unsub blows past
said checkpoint at 90 mph,

77
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,370
And is pursued by a
officer jason kessinger.

78
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,640
Kessinger pulls the car over,
approaches the driver's side window,

79
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,530
Where he is shot in the throat.

80
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,520
Mon dieu.

81
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,060
He was a single parent, 2 daughters.

82
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,150
So, the unsub planned ahead,
used the dui stop to set his trap,

83
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,170
And then lured the officer to his death.

84
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,360
It could have been personal.

85
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,350
The unsub might have had a problem
with these particular officers.

86
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,780
Or with law enforcement in
general. He's sending a message.

87
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:20,610
Criminals, gang members, academy washouts, security
rent a cops, teenagers, and that's just a start.

88
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,520
I mean, the list of people who have a
problem with police officers is a long one.

89
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,350
The victims were shot in the neck, so the
unsub knew they'd be wearing body armor.

90
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,990
And he used a dui checkpoint.

91
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,340
I mean, both incidents show an active
understanding of police procedure.

92
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,950
Which narrows it down to
anybody who watches television.

93
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,460
We need to cover victimology.

94
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,290
Garcia, find out everything you
can about the officers killed.

95
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,860
See what they had in common
besides their uniforms.

96
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,050
Will do, but i should warn
you, it will not be cake

97
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,240
Because i have been on the phone
with these guys all morning,

98
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,260
And pulling files from them
has been like pulling molars.

99
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,120
Is there a problem?

100
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,990
You know, aside from the obvious
grief for their fallen comdres,

101
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,790
And their fear of being
used as target practice,

102
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,420
I get the distinct impression
from their crabby behavior,

103
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,950
They are none too pleased their boss is
outsourcing this investigation to the fbi, so...

104
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,160
Be prepared to hit a
blue wall of resistance.

105
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,110
Commander Marks, i'm ssa
Hotchner. This is agent Todd.

106
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,350
Agents Rossi, Prentiss,
Morgan, and dr. Spencer Reid.

107
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,240
- Thank you for inviting us.
- And thank you all for coming.

108
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,440
Although i'd like to have
a word if you don't mind.

109
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,730
Of course. Excuse me.

110
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,770
Uh, lieutenant evans.

111
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,510
Lieutenant evans will answer any
questions the rest of you may have.

112
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,320
I'll call you later. This way.

113
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,250
Sorry, that was officer kayser's wife.

114
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,440
They'd only been married
a couple of months.

115
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,380
She seems to think that the
fbi is here to save the day.

116
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,650
Is that what you're going to do, agents?

117
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,680
I apologize.

118
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,550
It turns out i may
have wasted your time.

119
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,040
Ballistics came back. Both
.357 magnums, but not a match.

120
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,500
Looks like we're talking about
2 different shooters after all.

121
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,210
- We don't think so.
- Really?

122
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,530
Well, everyone he is pretty convinced
this is the beginning of a gang war.

123
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,580
No, i understand that
you could see it that way,

124
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,960
But we believe that the shootings
are indicative of a single killer,

125
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,430
One who's not a gang member.

126
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,070
You're saying one
shooter, multiple weapons.

127
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,430
That's the theory.

128
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,000
Both attacks were detailed, well planned
out traps, not typical for a gang hit.

129
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,570
And the trophy taking suggests
serial pathology, as well.

130
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,190
All right, look, i know i called you
guys in, but i am way out on a limb here.

131
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,260
My officerfeel like it's a betrayal, like i
don't trust them to find this son of a bitch.

132
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,140
I gotta get this settled fast before
this whole department comes unglued.

133
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,300
Look, i get it.

134
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,640
We're only here to help and
not hijack the investigation.

135
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,360
But if our theory is correct, the unsub's
already looking for another excuse to kill again.

136
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,250
See, this is twelve's territory.

137
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,230
- And you think they're behind this?
- Does it matter?

138
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,180
Yes, it matters to us, lieutenant.

139
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,260
You know this city and its
gangs better than we do.

140
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,680
We'd like to hear your theories.

141
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,600
Ok, twelves has a captain.

142
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,790
Street name playboy.
Vice broke up a drug ring.

143
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,020
Shot his brother, d.o.a.playboy
thought he would kill us all.

144
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,970
Well, it is pretty strong motivation, but your
commander said the dash cam only showed one attacker.

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,410
Most 'bangers will bring
some back-up just in case.

146
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,270
Well, playboy runs the
toughest crew in town.

147
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,940
He's not "most 'bangers."

148
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,270
Well, you said the dash cam
only showed one attacker.

149
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,550
Why show your face at all?

150
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,610
Because he had to.

151
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,350
He wanted to take them both out at
the house, but they broke protocol.

152
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,700
Rodriguez approached
the house by himself.

153
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,400
Wait a minute. Are you
telling me they screwed up?

154
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,560
No, lieutenant, i'm saying that they split up,
forcing the unsub to take them out separately,

155
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,280
One here at the house
and one at the car.

156
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,700
That front unit's empty.

157
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,920
He could have set himself
up there and waited.

158
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,540
The element of surprise was on his side.

159
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,290
Choice of neighborhood was deliberate.

160
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,790
Neighbors around here are
used to hearing gunfire.

161
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,430
They'll blame it on the
gangs, and so will the police.

162
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,480
Techs have gone over
this frame by frame.

163
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,680
There's no way to identify the shooter.

164
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,070
Approximate height and weight,
that's about all we got.

165
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,670
The unsub's face isn't the
only way to identify him.

166
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,490
We also look at specific
behavioral traits.

167
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,510
These are the reasons you
don't believe it's a gang?

168
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,430
The shooter established
what we call a signature,

169
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,410
Something he did during the murders
that wasn't actually necessary.

170
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,380
Not part of his M.O., but
identical in every attack.

171
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,530
In this case, the unsub
took the officer's badges.

172
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,420
He's symbolically stripping them
of their power and authority.

173
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,030
This act is indicative of someone
who is looking to gain self-esteem.

174
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,340
Gang members and other assailants who
work together kill for different reasons,

175
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,380
But usually it's not to gain
confidence, 'cause they already have it.

176
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,250
Hotch, you see that? Can we pause this?

177
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,300
Ok, now zoom in and press play.

178
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,610
Taking the badge would
have taken a few seconds.

179
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,560
- He's lingering.
- Doing what?

180
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,090
That's a good question.

181
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,930
At least now, everyone with
force knows he's out there.

182
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,140
It'll be harder for him to
lure someone into his trap.

183
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,650
Well, not necessarily.

184
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,240
Being a cop is always dangerous, but even with the
extra back-up and rover cars added to the shifts,

185
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,530
Phoenix p.d.'s still going
to have to do their job.

186
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,170
Which means walking into a potential
ambush every time they take a call.

187
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,440
245 in progress, 106 east broadway road.

188
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,530
Repeat, 245, report of
an aggravated assault.

189
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,980
Copy that.

190
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,270
Behind the car.

191
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,780
Oh, yeah.

192
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,330
- Looks like a couple of bums.
- Yep.

193
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,000
Hey, police!

194
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,300
Clear out of here!

195
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,590
I got it!

196
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,890
Son of a bitch!

197
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,290
Mark!

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,320
Mark!

199
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,960
Mark!

200
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,530
Officer down, 106 east broadway road.

201
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,250
Copy that, officer,
calling for back-up.

202
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:42,450
1099, code 2. Repeat, 1099,
code 2, 106 east broadway road.

203
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,770
Mark!

204
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,030
Car 5-1, back-up
is on the way.

205
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,280
Car 5-1, i repeat,
back-up is on the way.

206
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,680
Thank you.

207
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,830
He set us up.

208
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,790
We knew he was out there, he
still managed to set us up.

209
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,220
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,780
I watched my partner die, and i
couldn't do anything to save him.

211
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,810
Don't worry, ron.

212
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,690
Playboy's going to pay for this.

213
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,840
Yosaw playboy there?

214
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,400
- No, but-- - we all
know he did it, agent.

215
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,550
No, we don't.

216
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,150
Lieutenant, you think i don't
know how bad you want this guy?

217
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,640
I was a uniform just like you.

218
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,630
I saw a lot of cops go down.

219
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,630
Before that, i watched
my father get shot.

220
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,690
He was killed doing his job, a cop's
job, so don't think i don't know.

221
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,240
Officer Mercer, what happened
when you got the call?

222
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,830
Nothing special.

223
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,580
Report of an aggravated assault.

224
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,040
We were on it.

225
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,180
This your regular beat?

226
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,930
We were additional tonight,
added because of the shootings.

227
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,570
Did you get a look at the guy?

228
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,720
Nothing. I was too damn
scared. I'm still scared.

229
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,880
You're not the only one.

230
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,640
My partner's family.

231
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,330
What am i going to tell them?

232
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,100
The only thing you can tell them-- that
we're going to catch the guy who did this.

233
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,740
But the right guy.

234
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,080
Anything?

235
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,800
We can forget cross referencing.

236
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,880
These guys were just assigned this beat.

237
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,040
There's no way the unsub could
have known they'd get the call.

238
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,240
He's using the 9-1-1
calls like a lottery.

239
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,590
He's picking cops at random.

240
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,500
And yet there's nothing
random about the shootings.

241
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,270
Each scenario has been
increasingly complex.

242
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,880
He's enjoying the hunt.

243
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,970
Taking the time to set his victims
up and luring them into his net.

244
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,030
It's become as important
to him as the kill itself.

245
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,790
And this last one he executed while the
fbi and every cop in the city was after him.

246
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,590
And the press... Their
attention's feeding him.

247
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,210
Playing right into the
unsub's need to feel superior.

248
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,370
The press is not our on problem.

249
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,050
These guys are still trying to pin the
shootings on a gangbanger named playboy.

250
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,870
I have a feeling we're not going to
be able to hold them off much longer.

251
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,180
Hello, playboy.

252
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,060
What the hell, man?

253
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,480
Let's go spend some
quality time together.

254
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,980
Time for what?

255
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,120
- Whatever you got, i didn't do it.
- Yeah.

256
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,300
Lighten up, man. I'm
telling you, i didn't do it.

257
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,440
Yeah? Well, i got a magic eight
ball that says you did, playboy.

258
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,890
Commander, what's going on?

259
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,460
What's going on is my officers are being shot
in the streets and crucified by the press.

260
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,320
That's what's going on.

261
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,700
So you've arrested the wrong person?

262
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,600
I brought in a viable
subjt for questioning.

263
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,100
I had to do something.

264
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,060
I didn't kill no cop. Period.

265
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,290
Sure, playboy.

266
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,800
Just cross your heart, and we're done.

267
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,440
Commder, i understand
the pressure you're under,

268
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,700
But doing this could
undermine the investigation.

269
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,470
Bringing in another suspect draws
attention away from the real unsub.

270
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,700
If he starts to feel inadequate, he
may strike sooner just to prove himself.

271
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,750
It's also possible accusing one of their
members could antagonize local gangs,

272
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,560
Which is the last thing your officers
need to be worrying about right now.

273
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,950
All right, look. I told you guys i was out on
a limb here, so unless you have a suspect...

274
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,350
Hotch.

275
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,640
Since we've got this guy, why
don't we see if we can use him?

276
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,470
You mind if talk to him?

277
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,680
Be my guest.

278
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,170
Commander, i appreciate your letting
agent Morgan join the interrogation,

279
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,170
But i promise you,
this is not our unsub.

280
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,050
The real killer's still out there.

281
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,350
I know you didn't do it, playboy.

282
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,240
So why you dragging
my ass in here, then?

283
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,880
I said i know you didn't kill
those cops, but he doesn't.

284
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,870
And they don't. And trust
me, they don't care, man.

285
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,830
But you do. Oh, you care about me.

286
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,480
I don't give a damn about you.

287
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,990
Tell you what i do care about.

288
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,370
Catching the killer.

289
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,580
I told you, i didn'do it.

290
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,190
But i think you know who did.

291
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,550
No way, man. It wasn't one of us.

292
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,740
OK.I'll give you that.

293
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,370
Whoever did do this ain't no 'banger.

294
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,120
But he's been working your
hood pretty tough, though, huh?

295
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,650
Without your say.

296
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,430
He's making you look
real suspect, playboy.

297
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,860
Causing you nothing but trouble.

298
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,300
He won't last long, then.

299
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,180
Come on, man, look around you.

300
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,260
From where i'm sitting, it looks
like he's doing all right so far.

301
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,070
I mean, if i'm you, i'm thinking i want
this guy gone for good. What you think?

302
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,110
Yeah.

303
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,080
You know so much. Who is he?

304
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,610
Probably somebody you'd least suspect.

305
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,560
Probably wouldn't even think twice about him
'cause he really don't look all that dangerous.

306
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,150
Well, at least not on the surface.

307
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,930
But he gets real violent.

308
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,950
- Well, we all violent.
- No, no, no, not like this, man.

309
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,840
This cat goes from cold to hot in
a heartbeat, nothing in between.

310
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,310
Takes everything real personal.

311
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,420
Thinks everybody's trying to put him
down, so he's always looking for a fight,

312
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,600
Even if he knows he's going to lose.

313
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,810
- So he's stupid.
- Maybe.

314
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,240
But he's aggressive. Think, man.

315
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,000
You give me something, maybe
i get you out of all of this.

316
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,530
He's white. He's older
than you, not by much.

317
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,670
And he works alone.

318
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,120
You know somebody like
this, i know you do.

319
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,470
There was this guy...

320
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,770
He was white.

321
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,610
He killed me lieutenant
a couple of months ago.

322
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,040
- Bobby q.
- Yeah.

323
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,000
He was like my brother.

324
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,150
Yeah, your brother was
a junkie, so was bobby q.

325
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,010
I see the similarity.

326
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,640
Sit down, sit down!

327
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,410
Don't even think about it. Talk to me.

328
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,490
Forget him. I'm helping you, he's not.

329
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,440
All right. Your lieutenant, bobby q.

330
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,520
What happened?

331
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,740
Well, i told the cops it wasn't a
gang thing. They didn't believe me.

332
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,220
Yeah, that's 'cause you always tell
us the truth, don't you, playboy?

333
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,630
I'm serious, man.

334
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,070
Playboy, don't do it.

335
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,500
So who killed him?

336
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,890
If i knew his name,
he'd be dead already.

337
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,300
There's been another shooting.

338
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,850
- I'll cut him loose.
- No. Not yet.

339
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,380
Hotch, this guy knows something.

340
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,420
All right, keep working on it.

341
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,530
They have the shooter cornered
in an apartment building downtown.

342
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,980
Dave, stay with Morgan, see what this guy
has to offer. Prentiss, you're with me.

343
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,040
- He's in there?
- Yeah, we got him cornered.

344
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,120
Men on both floors and the entrances.

345
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,400
- You know this guy?
- Yeah, a banger called diablo.

346
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,810
He's one of the lindo park
assassins. Daws followed him here.

347
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,350
- He all right?
- He'll live. He's a lucky bastard.

348
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,940
We'd like to talk to
daws, if you don't mind.

349
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,670
All right, ok, stay down.

350
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,570
Sergeant daws.

351
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,770
I'm special agent emily
Prentiss, this is ssa Hotchner.

352
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,400
What happened?

353
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,570
He killed my partner.

354
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,620
We're sorry.

355
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,160
We were stopped at a light.

356
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,870
Bastard came right up to the window.

357
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,670
Shot scotty in the head, then shot me.

358
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,550
- Wait a minute.
- There was no radio call?

359
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,160
No. Came out of nowhere.

360
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,360
Guess he thought he'd bagged us
both. Luckily, a truck came. He ran.

361
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,830
I called it in, managed
to tail him here.

362
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,400
- Ok, thank you, sergeant.
- It doesn't track.

363
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,780
- No, it was a blitz attack.
- Let's go.

364
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,720
Let us go in and try to talk him down.

365
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,950
No, hold on.

366
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,100
What's going on?

367
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,770
I've got movement. Looks like ramey
and wilhelm are inside the apartment.

368
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,090
Attempting to apprehend.

369
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,460
What the hell happened in there?

370
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,300
Daws said it's a blitz
attack. It's a different M.O.

371
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,800
Yeah, and this was
done in broad daylight.

372
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,020
It's not our guy.

373
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,450
Yeah, Morgan, what have you got?

374
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,890
Well, playboy's lieutenant was shot
in the neck with a . 357 magnum.

375
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,210
Could have been our guy.

376
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,840
All right, i want you to stay on it.

377
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,620
- Hotch, what's going on?
- Nothing good.

378
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:38,330
Garcia, i need you to pull everything you
can on a phoenix gangbanger called diablo.

379
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,410
Muy pronto.

380
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,640
Well, let's close it off here.

381
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,450
Commander, can i speak
to you for a second?

382
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,540
Sorry to see it end this way, losing
another officer, but i'm glad it's over.

383
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,170
Sir, i don't believe that it is.

384
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,420
What are you saying? The guy is dead.

385
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,510
This suspect diablo
doesn't fit the profile.

386
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,980
Are you telling me he didn't
shoot officer daws and his partner?

387
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,960
What i'm saying is, he may not be
responsible for the earlier killings.

388
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,470
- Agent Hotchner!Agent Hotchner!
- Commander, we have to be sure!

389
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,110
I have got the chief, i've
got the press, i've the mayor.

390
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,180
Do you realize the pressure the
department's under right now?

391
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,930
Yes, sir, i do, but it wasn't him.

392
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,490
There was an earlier
murder with the same M.O.

393
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,240
This unsub may have
killed one of the twelves.

394
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,380
And how does that help us?

395
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,380
This unsub thinks of himself as a big game
hunter now, but he didn't start out that way.

396
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,130
Meaning?

397
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,800
He started with a gang
member, and he's evolved.

398
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,270
Give me 24 hours.

399
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,510
They're notonna wait that
long, and neither is the chief.

400
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,040
I'll give you four.

401
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,800
Thanks, man. Great job.

402
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,490
Evans. I need your help.

403
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,720
I'd like you to pull a file
on playboy's lieutenant.

404
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,290
It's over, agent. We got the guy.

405
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,820
No, we didn't.

406
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,050
What, because he turned out
to be a gangbanger after all?

407
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,620
Let it go. You guys made a
mistake. You guys were wrong.

408
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,410
So was i. No harm, no foul.

409
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,640
No offense, lieutenant,
but we're not wrong.

410
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,520
The killer is still out
there, and more cops will die.

411
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,650
You heard what officer Mercer said.

412
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,210
His partner was shot.

413
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,660
He couldn't do anything to save him.

414
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,170
Do you want to feel like that when
another one of your guys does get killed?

415
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,650
Or do you want to know that you did everything
you could to try to keep it from happening again?

416
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,350
Ballistics aren't back yet,

417
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,100
But the preliminary m.e.reports suggest the
weapon used to kill officer beck was not a .357

418
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,000
I spoke to Garcia.Beck arrested
diablo twice on drug charges,

419
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,720
last time sent him away for 10 years.

420
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,850
Diablo was just released
on parole last week.

421
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,460
So diablo went after the cop who put him away
assuming it would be lumped in with the other murders.

422
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,950
The unsub would take the fall.

423
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,320
Hey, it almost worked.

424
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,030
Lieutenant, what did you find?

425
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,560
Well, i pulled up that information
on playboy's lieutenant, bobby q.

426
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,250
There's not much there.

427
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:56,120
And you're thinking playboy was right, that
we didn't pay enough attention to the case.

428
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:56,870
Did you?

429
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,190
Look, the majority of homicides
in this city are gang killings.

430
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,680
Most times we spend time and resources following
trails that all lead to the same place anyway.

431
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,010
We just assumed this was just
another one of those trails.

432
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,170
Being in a gang shortens
your life expectancy,

433
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,860
So it's no big surprise when
a gangbanger winds up dead.

434
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,480
Same thing could be
said about being a cop.

435
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:19,660
The job involves a fair amount of risk, so a
percentage of untimely deaths is practically inevitable.

436
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:22,340
The M.O.is the same as our unsub's.

437
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,480
Did, um, playboy tell you
if the killer took a trophy?

438
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,240
He said boy q's necklace was missing.

439
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,680
Yeah, that's in the report.

440
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,870
Big chain, solid gold.

441
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,620
Just figured the doer
took it to pawn it.

442
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,770
- Or as a souvenir.
- Fits the signature.

443
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,460
He built up to this. We
need to go further back.

444
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,140
Garcia, can you pull
everything in the phoenix area

445
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,310
That matches the same M.O.as our
unsub, not just police officers.

446
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,830
Ok. So i'm searching homicides in
phoenix in, what, the last 2 months?

447
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,250
- Make it three.
- Got it.

448
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,750
Murders, shootings,
specifically neck wounds.

449
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,630
Oh, i got a guy named robert
quinones, nickname bobby q.

450
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,370
We already have that one. Anything else?

451
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,580
Ah, just one more.

452
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:08,290
A bouncer at a bar in
downtown phoenix, mickey reese.

453
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,490
Weapon's a .357 magnum. Interesting.

454
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,510
It says here the victim was
wearing a ballistic vest.

455
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,330
Apparently they don't serve shley
temples at this establishment.

456
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,910
If the bouncer was wearing a vest, that
could be how our unsub developed his M.O.

457
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,520
- Send us everything you've got.
- Sure. Done.

458
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,900
All right, we got
gangbangers, bouncers and cops.

459
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,360
All pretty tough targets; victims
capable of defending themselves.

460
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,010
As the unsub's sense of power
escalated, so did his confidence,

461
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,950
Leading to bigger and
more difficult prey.

462
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,930
That makes sense. Risky deaths would
increase the unsub's feeling of superiority.

463
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,490
Same thing with using a . 357 magnum.
It would make him feel powerful.

464
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,070
Cops are at the top of that list.

465
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,420
High profile, always on alert,
and they're gonna make headlines.

466
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,200
Killing a gangbanger isn't easy.

467
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,230
They're always armed, travel in packs.

468
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,630
The bouncer's the earliest.

469
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,850
It was a pretty simple attack,
no carefully thought out plan.

470
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,350
He could have been his first victim.

471
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,150
We need to figure out
where their paths crossed.

472
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:03,050
Morgan, you, Rossi and the
lieutenant go check out the bar.

473
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,310
We'll keep digging.

474
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,870
Like i told the cop before,
it could have been anyone.

475
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,970
Did reese have any enemies?

476
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,490
That's all he had. Mick was a real
hard ass. Always looking to get into it.

477
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,940
Pissed off someone
pretty much every night.

478
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,020
Looks like he took quite a
beating before he was killed.

479
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:27,260
Any idea which one of your patrons
might have given him these bruises?

480
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,830
Didn't get those here, man.

481
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,630
De was into some kind of crazy club.

482
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,330
Extreme fighting, or
some crap like that.

483
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,450
Looked like that, and
worse, all the time.

484
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,480
Worked pretty good for
his job, know what i mean?

485
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,110
A fight club would be the perfect place
for the unsub to try to prove himself.

486
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,440
And a beating might be the
stressor we're looking for.

487
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,710
Do you know where this club is?

488
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,330
Go, go!

489
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,060
*****

490
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,100
Fbi, get on the ground!

491
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,490
Get on the ground right now! Get
on the ground! Get on the ground!

492
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,640
Don't move! Get down!

493
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,480
That way, let's go.

494
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,530
Ain't breaking no laws here, officer.

495
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,040
Agents, no matter what it looks like...

496
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,230
I think he's trying to let us know
they have to right to be idiots.

497
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,080
They do, but not here. Listen up, folks.

498
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,980
This warehouse is not private property.

499
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,540
It is owned by the city, which means...

500
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,590
Y'all are going to jail.

501
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,970
Pa 'em up, let's go.

502
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,960
We ain't hurting nobody,
except maybe each other.

503
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,740
Yeah, i feel you, but
we're still taking you in.

504
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,160
Unless you want to answer some
questions and make all this go away.

505
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,210
So ask me.

506
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,570
- You know this man?
- Yeah. Boom.

507
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,820
I heard. But i didn't kill him.

508
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,760
No, but someone who came here did.

509
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,220
No way. Boom could take all of us.

510
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,030
We aren't looking for a tough guy.

511
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,020
The man we're looking for
probably lost every fight.

512
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,240
He came in here trying to be a man.

513
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,930
But he failed.

514
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,290
Guy went down easily.

515
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,810
Candy ass.

516
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,280
Maybe even in his first fight.

517
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,150
He probably reacted poorly to that.

518
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,350
To the point where you and
your boys, you ridiculed him.

519
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,180
All this led him to pick up a gun.

520
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,370
There was a guy.
Called himself "animal."

521
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:52,390
Lost every fight, but he kept coming back,
getting in boom's face, calling him out.

522
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,370
Most guys lose big, they run
home, tail between their legs.

523
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,080
This one freaked.

524
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:21,640
There's something about that hand
at your throat, when you're beat.

525
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,400
Knowing your opponent's got
your whole life in his hand.

526
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,840
Ah, it's primal, man.

527
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,890
When he lingers...

528
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,910
That's what he's doing to his victims.

529
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,930
Proving his power over life and death.

530
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,450
What's animal's real name?

531
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:47,770
There's no names here. Just
nicknames. Like me. I'm beanie.

532
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,160
Well, what do you know about
this animal? Anything at all?

533
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:53,210
Nothing. That's the
way it works, you know?

534
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,140
Don't talk about it.

535
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,260
How about a description?

536
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,460
Scrawny, white trash.

537
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,450
Thought he's a whole
lot tougher than he is.

538
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,660
Get him set up with a sketch artist.

539
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,210
Beanie... Let's go.

540
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,890
So what do we do now?

541
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,280
We don't have a lot of choices.

542
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,410
Based on his escalating timeline,
this guy's about to strike again soon.

543
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,130
There's really only one thing we can do.

544
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:23,230
Earlier today, the phoenix police
announced the suspect responsible for

545
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,510
The deaths of 5 phoenix
officers had been caught.

546
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,670
That is not the case.

547
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,510
The killer is still at large.

548
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,820
There have been quite a few mistakes made
over the course of this investigation,

549
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,150
Mistakes that could have been avoided.

550
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:44,220
As a result of this, the fbi is officially
taking charge of the investigation.

551
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,260
We have established a tip line, and a sketch
of the subject is being released to the press.

552
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:54,400
We encourage anyone with any information
about the shooter to contact us immediately.

553
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,500
The man we're looking for is a narcissist and
a psychopath desperate to prove his masculinity.

554
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:05,470
He does this by going after high risk
targets like gang members and police officers.

555
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,720
Because hes a narcissist, this unsub will
be following the investigation closely.

556
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,940
By pretending to take over the investigation,
we've put ourselves above the local police,

557
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,030
Thus suggesting that
we're tougher to take out,

558
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,250
And issuing the unsub a challenge
that he won't be able to ignore.

559
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,370
And painting a target directly
on agent Hotchner's back.

560
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,210
All the attacks, with the
exception of the last one,

561
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,130
Have taken place in
the twelve's territory.

562
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:30,310
This is the unsub's hunting ground,
and he's unlikely to stray from it.

563
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,200
Where did you say you saw the suspect?

564
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,850
Police department, how can i help you?

565
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,350
Phoenix police hotle.

566
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,310
Locations have multiple
vanish points for the shooter,

567
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,890
But limited access and
exit routes for his victims.

568
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,150
We'll be looking for
a similar situation.

569
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,920
This should happen very quickly.

570
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,660
Don't forget-- this guy managed
to take out 5 cops by himself.

571
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,440
He smart, and he's fearless.

572
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,040
He won't be easy to take down.

573
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,400
Fbi tip line.

574
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:59,220
I saw that guy. Your
killer. The one from tv.

575
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,200
Male caller. He says he knows where the
unsub lives, and it fits the criteria.

576
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,590
2717 gelson avenue.

577
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,910
It's the twelve's territory,
just off the main street.

578
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,280
Looks like there's a series of
smaller feeders and allies nearby.

579
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,720
- This could be it.
- Let's go.

580
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,610
Slow down, lieutenant. He'll
be expecting us. All of us.

581
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,780
This is his last stand. He's
going to want to make it count.

582
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,230
Yeah, well, this time we
know about it and we're ready.

583
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,860
His trap could still work.

584
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,990
15th avenue and gelson. What do
you know about the neighborhood?

585
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,330
It's rough. Lots of
dead-end streets, allies.

586
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,780
Major cross street, 17th.

587
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,950
Residential? Any businesses at all?

588
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,220
There's a gas station a couple of
blocks down, but that's about it.

589
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,520
- Hey, Garcia?
- Yes?

590
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:38,470
Can you get us a satellite
image of 15th avenue and gelson?

591
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,750
But of course. Ok, real
time satellite image shows...

592
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,600
Not a whole heck of a lot.

593
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:50,380
I've got a 2-story apartment building, no
activity of any kind, no cars out in front.

594
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,030
Oh, there's a car down the street.

595
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,470
No heat registering,
engine must be cool.

596
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:59,170
Satellite monitoring the last
12 hours is like library-quiet.

597
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,570
A truck and 2 cars left in
the a.m., nothing came in.

598
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,710
Thank you, Garcia.

599
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,570
All right, there's a major street
in front on the east side, an ally,

600
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,580
And 2 smaller streets to the
north and south right here.

601
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,950
Lieutenant, commander, i
need a sniper here and here.

602
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,590
Once they're set, the bulk of the
squad cars can approach from the south,

603
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,620
And the rest of us from
the east very quietly.

604
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,750
From this point forward,
everybody goes in on foot.

605
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,860
Morgan, you and i go in first.
Rossi and Prentiss behind us.

606
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,950
Jordan, you and Reid stay
here and work the tip line.

607
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,980
- Stay safe, my loves.
- Thanks, Garcia.

608
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,670
Clear! Clear!

609
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,850
False alarm. We knew we'd get some.

610
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,750
- What now?
- We wait.

611
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,970
You might want to split your officers
into shifts. It could be a long night.

612
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,950
Not this time. You're done.

613
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,380
Let's go.

614
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,120
You knew he wouldn't
be at the first address.

615
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,440
We figured he'd wait
until Hotch was alone.

616
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,990
So the tip was a diversion.

617
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,180
Something like that.

618
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:04,250
Thank you. And your team.

619
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,390
No thanks necessary, lieutenant.

620
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,580
We did it together.

621
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,870
No, playboy!

622
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,140
Hotch... Why don't you go on ahead?

623
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,310
I think i'm going to stick around.
There's something i want to do.

624
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,420
- Agent Morgan.
- Derek.

625
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,410
This way.

626
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,930
This is agent Morgan from the fbi.

627
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,750
Maggie cunningham and
sam, my partner's family.

628
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,880
Mrs. Cunningham, i'm
sorry for your loss.

629
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,920
Thank you.

630
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:48,790
Hey, sam... We got the
bad guy who did this.

631
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,470
Sam, your father was a hero.

632
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,500
Don't you ever forget that.

633
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:37,260
"for he today who sheds his blood
with me shall be my brother."

634
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,210
William Shakespeare.

1
00:00:07,736 --> 00:00:10,070
Come in.

2
00:00:11,105 --> 00:00:13,339
Good day, captain.

3
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:14,841
Bortus. How are you?

4
00:00:14,843 --> 00:00:18,178
I apologize for intruding
upon your work.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,345
Oh, no, it's fine.

6
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:21,514
What is that?

7
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:23,516
That is, uh,

8
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:25,518
Kermit the frog.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,587
I do not recognize the species.

10
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:30,223
It's an amphibious life-form
from Earth.

11
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:31,624
Is it someone you know?

12
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:34,794
No, no, he's just a leader
I admire.

13
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:36,129
Always keeps his cool

14
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:37,464
in a crisis,

15
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:38,965
inspires greatness
in his people.

16
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:40,767
He's...

17
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:42,302
So, what can I do for you?

18
00:00:42,304 --> 00:00:46,439
Sir, I wish to request
a leave of absence.

19
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:47,640
For what reason?

20
00:00:47,642 --> 00:00:49,576
I have laid an egg.

21
00:00:49,578 --> 00:00:51,644
You...

22
00:00:51,646 --> 00:00:53,813
What do you mean,
like you told a bad joke

23
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:54,981
or something? Like, what?

24
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:57,917
No, sir. Moclans reproduce
by laying eggs.

25
00:00:57,919 --> 00:01:01,087
Klyden and I
are going to have a child.

26
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:05,758
Bortus, that's great.
Congrats. My god.

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,560
You lay eggs?
- Yes, sir.

28
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:08,962
Wow. You know, I always wondered

29
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:11,998
how a single-gender species
populated itself, but...

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,734
Are-are they big? They big eggs?

31
00:01:14,736 --> 00:01:16,803
They are somewhat large.
Yes, sir.

32
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:18,004
Amazing.

33
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:20,840
Um, well, yeah,
take all the time off you need.

34
00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:24,177
The gestation period
is approximately 21 days.

35
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:25,645
And you sit on it?

36
00:01:25,647 --> 00:01:26,980
You sit on the egg?

37
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:27,981
Yes, sir.

38
00:01:27,983 --> 00:01:29,749
Wow.

39
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:31,484
Well, listen,
tell Klyden congrats,

40
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:33,820
and, uh, if you
got one more in you,

41
00:01:33,822 --> 00:01:35,922
dibs on the omelet.

42
00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:37,090
Sir?

43
00:01:37,092 --> 00:01:38,992
Sorry. Bad joke.

44
00:01:38,994 --> 00:01:40,093
Yes.

45
00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:41,861
Bad "yolk."

46
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:45,365
You know,
I'm-I'm just not gonna try

47
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:47,333
at comedy with you anymore.

48
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:49,269
I will return to my quarters.

49
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:50,403
Okay.

50
00:02:00,048 --> 00:02:02,182
I want eggs now.

51
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:12,785
Eggs?

52
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:14,020
That's what he said.

53
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:16,289
Moclans reproduce
by laying eggs,

54
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,624
which I never knew.

55
00:03:17,626 --> 00:03:18,925
Well, where does it come out of?

56
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:20,460
The butt?

57
00:03:20,462 --> 00:03:22,028
You know, John,
I didn't really pry

58
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,529
into those kinds of specifics.

59
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:25,965
How's that not the
first thing you ask?

60
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:28,468
Captain, we are receiving
a distress signal.

61
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,704
Coordinates 8-3-0-4-9-3-4.

62
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:33,072
A transport ship
has been attacked

63
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:34,440
by the Krill.
How far away?

64
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:37,877
With quantum drive at maximum,
six minutes, 21 seconds.

65
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,646
Alara, send a message
we're on our way.

66
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,314
Gordon, get us there
as quick as you can.

67
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:42,382
Aye, sir.

68
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,993
<i>Approaching the transport,
sir, it's the USS Bleriot.</i>

69
00:03:53,995 --> 00:03:54,995
Let's see it.

70
00:03:56,964 --> 00:03:58,331
Looks like they took
a hell of a beating.

71
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,933
Scan for life signs. How many
passengers are on board?

72
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:03,903
Captain, the ship is
already scanning us.

73
00:04:03,905 --> 00:04:04,937
They are?

74
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:06,172
That's weird.

75
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:08,641
That's like a jinx, right?
They owe us a coke.

76
00:04:08,643 --> 00:04:09,676
Alara, hail them.

77
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:11,411
Channel open.

78
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:13,346
<i>Bleriot, this is
captain Ed Mercer</i>

79
00:04:13,348 --> 00:04:15,348
<i>of the USS Orville...
Do you read me?</i>

80
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,184
Captain Mercer, we've been
raided by a Krill destroyer.

81
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:19,852
What is the status
of your vessel?

82
00:04:19,854 --> 00:04:20,987
Our injured are being treated,

83
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:22,689
but we're in need
of extensive repairs.

84
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:25,458
I can hear you, but visual is
a little patchy.

85
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,026
That's why we scanned your ship.

86
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:28,961
All right, send us a manifest
of everything you need

87
00:04:28,963 --> 00:04:30,797
as soon as you can.
Sending now.

88
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,700
And, captain, it so happens
we're carrying two passengers

89
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:34,867
whom you know.

90
00:04:34,869 --> 00:04:37,637
Eddie, is that you?

91
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,305
Mom?

92
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:42,008
Hey, buddy.
Surprise, huh?

93
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,277
Yeah, it is.
Dad, are you guys okay?

94
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,678
No, no, we're okay, fine.
We're okay.

95
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,781
We all just got a bit of a
scare, that's all. Yeah.

96
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:50,817
Well, except for your father.

97
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:53,786
Yeah. I-i slept through
the entire attack,

98
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:55,688
and I just woke up
a little while ago.

99
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,557
You know, a little too much
of the sauce last night.

100
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:59,826
<i>Mom, dad, what the hell are
you guys doing on the Bleriot?</i>

101
00:04:59,828 --> 00:05:01,627
Well, your father and I wanted

102
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:03,162
to spend the weekend on Deneb 3

103
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:04,497
with the Petersons.
With the Petersons.

104
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:05,965
We're receiving
the manifest now.

105
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,000
Who's that?
Is that Kelly?

106
00:05:08,002 --> 00:05:09,168
Yeah.

107
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,670
Hi, Mrs. Mercer.
How are you?

108
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:13,840
I'm fine.
You know, uh, Eddie tells us

109
00:05:13,842 --> 00:05:15,675
you're just a wonderful
first officer.

110
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:18,144
I'm-I'm glad
you two are friends again,

111
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:20,747
after the, um, infidelity.

112
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:23,249
Okay.
Yeah. No, no,

113
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:24,917
we're... we're fine.

114
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:26,552
Was it worth it?
Aw, Jeannie...

115
00:05:26,554 --> 00:05:28,154
Just drop it, huh?

116
00:05:28,156 --> 00:05:29,322
A honey like that,
a couple of flies are

117
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:30,556
gonna get through, okay?

118
00:05:30,558 --> 00:05:32,158
Uh, guys,
you-you remember Gordon?

119
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,993
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. M.

120
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:35,161
Is that Gordon?

121
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:36,262
It's me, yeah.

122
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:38,598
Oh, okay, well,
tell him I said hi.

123
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,733
He just heard you, dad.
- Hi.

124
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,502
Who's that?
- That's Gordon again.

125
00:05:42,504 --> 00:05:44,170
Eddie, how's your stomach?
Is it still bothering you?

126
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:47,173
Uh, it-it's fine, mom.
It's-it's okay.

127
00:05:47,175 --> 00:05:48,674
Did you get the colon scan?

128
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:50,343
I-I will.
I will get it.

129
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:52,612
Listen to me.
You get the colon scan.

130
00:05:52,614 --> 00:05:55,014
Do you understand me?
Because if you get the divert...

131
00:05:55,016 --> 00:05:58,117
Man, what is that?
Diverticulitis.

132
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,520
Diverticulitis, like I had,
that's not a picnic.

133
00:06:00,522 --> 00:06:01,754
What is it
you got stuck in there?

134
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:02,855
A sesame seed.

135
00:06:02,857 --> 00:06:05,291
A sesame seed in his colon!
In the colon.

136
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:07,627
Yeah. It-it just
gets stuck in there,

137
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,861
because there are
folds, you know?

138
00:06:08,863 --> 00:06:10,630
Yeah. And it Burrows in
there for the winter,

139
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:13,433
and you got yourself an inflammation.
Oh, god.

140
00:06:13,435 --> 00:06:14,700
Hey, you know what, guys?

141
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:15,935
We're just gonna come over
there, okay? How does that...?

142
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:17,470
Right, Kel? You haven't seen
mom and dad in a while...

143
00:06:17,472 --> 00:06:18,471
I haven't seen them
in ages, yes.

144
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:20,139
Great!
Yeah.

145
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:21,808
Much better if we go down there and help out.
Great, much better, great.

146
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,875
So we'll see you in a bit, okay?

147
00:06:22,877 --> 00:06:24,310
Get the scan.

148
00:06:24,312 --> 00:06:27,814
Oh, my god.

149
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:30,316
Alara, you have the Conn.
Aye.

150
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:31,751
Wait, what?

151
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:33,653
You have command
while we're gone.

152
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:35,388
Well, what about Bortus?

153
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,490
Bortus is in his quarters
warming an egg.

154
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:39,158
That makes you
the ranking bridge officer.

155
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,895
Oh, yeah, but...
I've never, um...

156
00:06:42,897 --> 00:06:44,297
Wait,

157
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:45,898
this is your
first time in command.

158
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah, so maybe
someone else should...

159
00:06:48,002 --> 00:06:50,303
You got this, okay?

160
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:51,637
You wouldn't be allowed
to wear that uniform

161
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,473
if you weren't qualified.

162
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:54,807
We trust you.

163
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:57,743
Yeah.

164
00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:58,744
Okay.

165
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:00,746
Okay.
- Okay.

166
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:05,351
Oh, hey, uh, sorry
about my parents, everyone.

167
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:07,620
They're, um...

168
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:10,790
My colon is fine,
by the way, there's...

169
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:12,425
Yeah.

170
00:07:35,883 --> 00:07:37,550
Your mother hates me.

171
00:07:37,552 --> 00:07:39,986
She does not hate you.
- Oh, yes, she does.

172
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:42,722
She does not. She hated you
a little bit after the...

173
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:45,691
The thing.

174
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:47,026
You can tell me, you know.

175
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:49,395
I mean, we never
talked about it.

176
00:07:49,397 --> 00:07:52,231
What'd she say about me?
It's nothing too terrible.

177
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:53,666
You can tell me. Just be honest.
It wasn't that bad.

178
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:55,334
Be honest.
She once called you a bitch

179
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:58,137
46 times in one sitting.

180
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,906
Wow.

181
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:01,507
Yeah, the people at
the next table complained.

182
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:03,843
But, look, Kel, it doesn't
matter. You know?

183
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:06,579
That's the past... you and I were
a lousy match, movin' on.

184
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:10,316
Maybe. We never really
got the chance to find out.

185
00:08:10,318 --> 00:08:12,919
Well, that's what happens when
you let a blue alien bone you

186
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:14,520
while your husband's at work, isn't it?
Don't be a jerk.

187
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:16,489
In no way am I trying
to be a jerk.

188
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:19,158
Honestly, Kel, most guys
would hold a grudge

189
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,327
for something like this...
I think you did us a favor.

190
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:23,496
I really do.
In fact, you know what?

191
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:25,932
I want to thank you
for your infidelity.

192
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:30,937
Look, all I'm saying is that
if you hadn't been so absent,

193
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:34,507
and I hadn't...
Done what I did...

194
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:35,675
Maybe it could've worked.

195
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:39,345
I say this with all due
respect... you are high.

196
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:42,949
Well, since we are seeing your
mother, that's not a bad idea.

197
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:45,518
What are you doing?

198
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,120
One cannabis edible.

199
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:49,956
Oh, my god. Seriously?

200
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,457
You're kidding with that, right?

201
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:54,193
Just in case.

202
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,151
What the hell?

203
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:21,220
What is this?

204
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:30,896
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys!

205
00:09:30,898 --> 00:09:32,832
Guys!
- Isaac!

206
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:34,634
The transport...
What happened to it?

207
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:36,969
Scanners show no sign
of the ship.

208
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,671
It appears to have been
a holographic projection

209
00:09:38,673 --> 00:09:40,272
of some kind.

210
00:09:40,274 --> 00:09:43,075
What about the boarding party?
- Searching.

211
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:46,345
Scans show no life signs.

212
00:09:46,347 --> 00:09:48,714
They are gone.

213
00:09:56,214 --> 00:09:58,682
I don't understand,
how can they just be gone?

214
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:00,717
John, wha-what about
long-range navigational scans?

215
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:02,085
I'm checking right now.

216
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:03,620
There's-there's nothing
out there.

217
00:10:03,622 --> 00:10:04,655
Not a damn thing.

218
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:23,774
Commander, the captain...
Oh, god.

219
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:26,243
Is it not customary
to request permission

220
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:28,278
before entering
someone else's quarters?

221
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,948
It is...
I am brooding my egg.

222
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,983
It is a private time
for a moclan.

223
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:34,618
Sir, I am so sorry,

224
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,820
but the captain and
the first officer are gone!

225
00:10:36,822 --> 00:10:38,922
Gone?
Where?

226
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:40,157
We don't know.

227
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,725
We got a distress call
from a transport ship,

228
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:43,994
and once they boarded it, the
whole thing just disappeared.

229
00:10:43,996 --> 00:10:45,796
Who is in command?

230
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:47,731
I am.

231
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:50,767
Then, if they are alive,
you must find them.

232
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:52,970
Sir, if you could just
come back to the bridge.

233
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:54,571
The captain never would have
left me in command

234
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:55,572
if he had any idea that this...

235
00:10:55,574 --> 00:10:57,574
I cannot leave my egg.

236
00:10:57,576 --> 00:10:58,742
For how long?

237
00:10:58,744 --> 00:10:59,910
For 21 days.

238
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:03,080
I am sorry, lieutenant.

239
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:05,515
I will not risk the life
of my child.

240
00:11:05,517 --> 00:11:07,884
You must remain in command.

241
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,241
One shot of Xelayan Tequila.

242
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:41,351
Okay.

243
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:43,520
Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

244
00:11:43,522 --> 00:11:44,654
You're okay.
You're fine.

245
00:11:44,656 --> 00:11:47,224
You gonna throw up?
You gonna throw up?

246
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:51,395
No. You're all right.

247
00:12:03,574 --> 00:12:05,809
Lieutenant, you all right?

248
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:09,913
Yes!
Yes, yes, I'm fine, ensign...

249
00:12:09,915 --> 00:12:12,382
Parker. Parker. Ensign Parker.

250
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:14,384
Sweet. Go away now.

251
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:16,219
Oh.

252
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:24,061
Isaac, any sign
of the boarding party?

253
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:26,897
Negative, sir.
Status unchanged.

254
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:28,165
Sir, there's nobody over there

255
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:30,067
to pilot the shuttle back to us,

256
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:32,936
but I can bring it over by
remote guidance, on your order.

257
00:12:32,938 --> 00:12:35,072
Got it.

258
00:12:36,074 --> 00:12:40,510
Is...
Is the order given?

259
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:42,913
Yes.

260
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:44,514
Absolutely do that.

261
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:46,116
Aye, sir.

262
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:49,753
And good job...

263
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:50,921
With that remote thing.

264
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,591
Thanks.

265
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:02,632
Sir?

266
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:05,068
Doctor. Hi.

267
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,403
Any word?

268
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:08,238
No, nothing yet.

269
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,706
What's next?

270
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:14,711
What's next... is...

271
00:13:14,713 --> 00:13:16,413
We should

272
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,215
lock a tractor
beam onto the buoy

273
00:13:18,217 --> 00:13:20,650
and bring it into the shuttle
bay to examine it for clues.

274
00:13:20,652 --> 00:13:24,488
We got Dora the explorer
runnin' the show here. Shh.

275
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,223
Lieutenant Lamarr, do you
want to say something?

276
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:27,757
No, sir.

277
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,659
Good. Lock onto the buoy.

278
00:13:29,661 --> 00:13:32,496
Sir, I would advise against
that course of action.

279
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:34,664
We are not familiar
with its defense mechanisms.

280
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,500
It's our only chance
to find our people.

281
00:13:36,502 --> 00:13:38,168
Lieutenant, lock on.

282
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,537
Aye, sir.

283
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:46,877
Locked on and pulling her in.

284
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:53,283
Bridge to shuttle bay.
Prepare to receive buoy.

285
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:57,654
Copy, bridge.
Opening bay doors.

286
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,100
Sir, I'm reading an energy
buildup within the buoy's core.

287
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:11,468
Can you identify it?

288
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,869
It is...

289
00:14:12,871 --> 00:14:15,705
Sir, deactivate
the tractor beam!

290
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:28,251
Get those doors shut!

291
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:39,563
All sections reporting.

292
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:42,465
Structural damage is extensive,
injuries are numerous.

293
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:43,300
I'll be in sickbay.

294
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:45,669
Bortus to bridge.
What is happening?

295
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:48,371
We, uh, took a little jolt,
but we're in one piece.

296
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:50,907
Is your egg okay?
- It is intact.

297
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:52,242
However, such impacts are not

298
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:53,410
conducive to egg brooding!

299
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:55,712
Sir, hull integrity has
been compromised

300
00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:57,747
in the shuttle bay.
- I'm going down there.

301
00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:00,217
Sir, if I may, your place is
on the bridge.

302
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:01,518
I'm going down there!

303
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
Think they'd give me
three weeks off

304
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:04,522
to sit on an egg?

305
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,610
Chief, was anyone injured
in the rupture?

306
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:28,578
A few minor injuries, but
the force field snapped on

307
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,746
like it's supposed to.

308
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:31,715
Gonna take a few days
to patch up, though.

309
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:35,252
Look, whatever additional power,
resources you need, whatever,

310
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:38,588
you've got it. I appreciate
that, kid, we'll be all right.

311
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:51,434
Ensign Parker, what happened?

312
00:15:51,436 --> 00:15:54,237
Wrong place at the wrong time.
- Will he be okay?

313
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:55,739
Well, he won't be
running any marathons

314
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:58,975
for a couple of days,
but he'll be all right.

315
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:04,114
Doctor, can I talk
to you in private?

316
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:06,149
Sure.

317
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:14,491
I can't do this.

318
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:16,826
<i>You mean command the Orville?
Yes.</i>

319
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:19,262
I wasn't in that chair
ten minutes, and I almost

320
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:20,263
destroyed the entire ship.

321
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:21,598
What if someone had been killed?

322
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,400
But you didn't.
And they weren't.

323
00:16:23,402 --> 00:16:25,068
You're the ship's doctor.

324
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,071
You're the only person who can
relieve an officer of command.

325
00:16:28,073 --> 00:16:29,606
Can't you just come up with
some reason that I'm unfit?

326
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:31,608
Tell them I'm a drug addict,
anything.

327
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,410
Just get someone
to replace me, please.

328
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:34,978
No, I will not do that.

329
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,981
But I will give you some advice.
Now, sit.

330
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:44,854
Command is all about the balance
between inspiring confidence

331
00:16:44,856 --> 00:16:48,124
in your leadership and knowing
when to trust your people.

332
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:50,860
You got scared out there today.

333
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:53,363
Scared that they
didn't respect you.

334
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:57,100
So you ignored Isaac's advice
in order to appear in control.

335
00:16:57,102 --> 00:16:59,903
Now, the question is, did you
learn from this error?

336
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:03,940
I'm willing to bet that you did.

337
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:06,676
Will you help me?

338
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:09,679
I'm not gonna whisper
the right answers in your ear,

339
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:12,982
but I'll try to be your Obi-Wan
however I can.

340
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:15,051
My what?

341
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:17,020
Never mind.

342
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:57,894
What is this?

343
00:17:57,896 --> 00:17:58,928
It's...

344
00:18:00,364 --> 00:18:02,732
our old apartment.

345
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:05,101
In New York City.

346
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:14,606
This is impossible.

347
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:15,878
It's exactly like I remember it.

348
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:19,344
Look at this.

349
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:22,947
This is the one from my office.

350
00:18:22,949 --> 00:18:25,617
I took it with me
when I moved out.

351
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:29,420
We couldn't have been
sent back in time?

352
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:31,656
I mean, that's...
That's crazy, right?

353
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:45,803
The door's sealed.

354
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:47,305
Here.

355
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,376
It's okay, I got it, I got it.

356
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:56,280
Oh! Oh!
Ed, are you okay?

357
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:57,415
Yeah, no, I'm fine.
Are you sure?

358
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,584
I'm fine. I'm fine.
All good.

359
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:05,023
Kel, where the hell are we?

360
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:17,769
Lieutenant, I believe
I have something.

361
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:19,871
What is it?

362
00:19:19,873 --> 00:19:22,840
My analysis of our
scanner logs indicates

363
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:25,109
there was a concentrated pulse
directed away from the buoy

364
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:26,210
at the moment of the incident,

365
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:27,845
traveling along this trajectory.

366
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:29,514
What do you think it was?

367
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:31,115
I cannot be certain,

368
00:19:31,117 --> 00:19:34,819
but I believe it may have been
a form of molecular transfer.

369
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:36,954
You think they may have been
transported somewhere?

370
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:40,458
If so, there may still be
residual traces of the pulse.

371
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,827
I will need to divert power
to the forward scanners

372
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:44,495
to conduct a
long-range search.

373
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:46,764
We're already
on emergency power.

374
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:56,407
All hands, this is
acting captain Kitan.

375
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:58,576
Emergency power will be
temporarily rerouted

376
00:19:58,578 --> 00:20:00,845
to the scanner array
until further notice.

377
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:01,846
Newton to bridge.

378
00:20:01,848 --> 00:20:03,147
Kid, you got to be joking.

379
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:04,415
You reroute power,
and this ship's

380
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:05,717
not gonna be goin' anywhere.

381
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:07,351
Chief, unless we know where

382
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:08,886
the captain and the commander
were taken,

383
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:13,591
there'll be nowhere to go.
Oh, and it's "sir," not "kid."

384
00:20:13,593 --> 00:20:15,560
Just a friendly reminder.

385
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:17,729
Aye, sir.

386
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:20,064
Dora the explorer
got some balls.

387
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:22,400
Good ones.
Good balls.

388
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:24,769
Crap!

389
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:28,406
What about the window?

390
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:30,041
I mean,
we're a hundred stories up.

391
00:20:30,043 --> 00:20:31,943
What are we supposed to do,
scale a wall?

392
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:35,279
Yeah, good point.

393
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:38,382
So, what do we do now?

394
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:39,684
Survival.

395
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:42,386
I mean, as long as we're
here, wherever here is,

396
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:45,089
we better make sure that
the food synthesizer works.

397
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,393
At least we won't starve.

398
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:52,964
Look at this.
It's my favorite robe.

399
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:55,600
I haven't seen this
in two years.

400
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,468
By the way, this was
an inspired idea.

401
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,438
Of course, if there's anything
in the food, we're screwed.

402
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,306
Yeah, I kind of doubt
whoever brought us here

403
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:04,776
went through all the trouble
just to poison us.

404
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:09,046
Mm-hmm.

405
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:14,118
Thank you.
Mm.

406
00:21:18,123 --> 00:21:20,424
Ed...

407
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:23,728
<i>You think the Orville
knows we're alive?</i>

408
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,930
You think they're
even looking for us?

409
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:28,166
Well, we better hope so.

410
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:32,637
I left Alara in command.

411
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:33,938
Yeah.

412
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,273
What do you think?

413
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:37,608
Well, she's smart,

414
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,976
but she's really green.

415
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:41,012
I know.

416
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:45,116
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

417
00:21:45,118 --> 00:21:47,418
Do you, uh, do you want
the bed or the couch?

418
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,920
Hmm.

419
00:21:48,922 --> 00:21:50,421
You take the bed.
I've had so much to drink,

420
00:21:50,423 --> 00:21:52,089
I think I'd die
at that altitude.

421
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:54,292
Okay.

422
00:21:54,294 --> 00:21:55,626
And if we're still here
tomorrow,

423
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:58,329
we can move on to that brownie.

424
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:01,799
Hey, wait, do you...

425
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:03,668
Do you remember that time
that Jeff and Maureen

426
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,102
invited us to the opera?

427
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:08,306
Oh, my god, yes.

428
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:10,041
And you knew I hated opera,
so you made me smoke that joint

429
00:22:10,043 --> 00:22:11,342
before we left.

430
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:13,277
I'm so sorry, that was
supposed to be mine.

431
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:15,446
I gave you the wrong one.
Your weapons-grade weed.

432
00:22:15,448 --> 00:22:17,715
Yes, I remember it very well.

433
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:19,650
And it kicked in when
we got to the theater,

434
00:22:19,652 --> 00:22:21,285
and I became convinced
that I was...

435
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:22,987
That you were
gonna be paralyzed.

436
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:24,622
That I would be paralyzed
if I stayed seated

437
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:26,190
for longer than two minutes.

438
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:27,859
Oh, my god.

439
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:29,694
And remember, you bashed
the hell out of Maureen's head

440
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:31,244
when you jumped out of your chair?
Oh...

441
00:22:32,398 --> 00:22:33,664
God, the size of the bruise

442
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,466
on her face was just epic.

443
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:36,868
Was that when they stopped
hanging out with us?

444
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,803
Oh, yeah, they were done with us.
Yeah.

445
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:40,538
That... well, you know,
they sucked. Who cares?

446
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,206
They totally sucked.
Why did we

447
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,708
hang out with them?
I thought you liked them.

448
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,676
I hated them.
You hate...

449
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:48,045
That was the only reason that I
tolerated... you-you hated them?

450
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:50,081
Yes. I mean she never
shut the hell up,

451
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,883
and-and he smelled
like sausage.

452
00:22:51,885 --> 00:22:54,185
Well, then, you know what?
I'm glad I hit her in the head.

453
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:57,922
That makes two of us.

454
00:22:57,924 --> 00:22:59,190
Mm.

455
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:07,632
I... you know, this-this
feels like a dream.

456
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:14,505
Being here, in this place.

457
00:23:14,507 --> 00:23:18,409
It's like the last
year never happened.

458
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:22,346
I was just thinking
the same thing.

459
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:28,519
I might have been wrong...

460
00:23:28,521 --> 00:23:32,356
About what I said
in the shuttle.

461
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:36,360
Maybe things
could've been different.

462
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:42,033
Good night.

463
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:02,620
Sir, I believe I have
pinpointed the destination

464
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:04,422
of the subspace pulse.

465
00:24:04,424 --> 00:24:06,791
Let's see what you've got.

466
00:24:09,662 --> 00:24:12,129
Oh, no.

467
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:14,598
Absolutely out of the question,
lieutenant.

468
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,467
But, sir, if there's any chance
that they're still alive...

469
00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:17,768
That sector

470
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,438
of space is off-limits,
no exceptions.

471
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,939
Sir, please, if we could just...

472
00:24:21,941 --> 00:24:24,275
Lieutenant, you're young,

473
00:24:24,277 --> 00:24:25,609
so I'm going
to overlook the fact

474
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:27,778
that you are questioning
a direct order

475
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,347
from a fleet admiral.

476
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:31,182
We have reasons
for keeping our ships away

477
00:24:31,184 --> 00:24:33,351
from that star system.

478
00:24:33,353 --> 00:24:36,821
The Calivon are a very
technologically advanced race.

479
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:39,423
And they view any species at
a lesser technological level

480
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:41,092
as inferior.

481
00:24:41,094 --> 00:24:44,128
In the way a sentient being
might view an animal.

482
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,931
We do not want to
engage them in any way.

483
00:24:46,933 --> 00:24:48,933
But what about the captain
and the commander?

484
00:24:48,935 --> 00:24:50,668
Lost in the line of duty.

485
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,803
I'm sorry, lieutenant.

486
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:54,805
As soon as
your repairs are complete,

487
00:24:54,807 --> 00:24:56,774
your orders are
to return to Earth

488
00:24:56,776 --> 00:24:58,275
where the Orville
will be assigned

489
00:24:58,277 --> 00:25:00,945
a new captain and first officer.

490
00:25:00,947 --> 00:25:02,947
Tucker out.

491
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:21,365
Hey. Wake up.

492
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:22,633
Wake up!

493
00:25:36,415 --> 00:25:38,049
Hey.

494
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:40,051
Hey, what's going on?

495
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:41,385
Hey, can you tell me where I am?

496
00:25:41,387 --> 00:25:42,653
'Cause honestly...

497
00:25:45,658 --> 00:25:46,891
Nidal.

498
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:48,325
Come on, let's go see the Krill.

499
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:49,760
Mama, I want to see the Moclans.

500
00:25:49,762 --> 00:25:51,095
If we have time.

501
00:25:51,097 --> 00:25:52,930
Come on. Let's go.

502
00:25:52,932 --> 00:25:55,332
Hey. Hey!

503
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:56,600
What's going on here?

504
00:25:56,602 --> 00:25:58,936
Where am I?

505
00:25:58,938 --> 00:26:00,404
Hey, talk to me!

506
00:26:00,406 --> 00:26:02,039
You're wasting your breath.

507
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:04,075
You don't matter to them.

508
00:26:04,077 --> 00:26:05,776
Who are you?

509
00:26:05,778 --> 00:26:07,912
What is this place?

510
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:09,780
Looks like they finally
filled that slot.

511
00:26:09,782 --> 00:26:11,315
How's it going, new guy?

512
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:14,285
Ed?

513
00:26:14,287 --> 00:26:16,387
What is this?
What's going on?

514
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:17,755
I...

515
00:26:17,757 --> 00:26:19,390
Answer my question.

516
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:20,591
Where are we?

517
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:21,826
A smart one, isn't he?

518
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:26,764
Take a look around you, friend.

519
00:26:26,766 --> 00:26:29,834
You're in a Calivon zoo.

520
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,666
See, their buoys

521
00:26:48,668 --> 00:26:50,969
can scan your computers
and then instantly

522
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:53,638
generate a customized
holographic lure.

523
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,075
As soon as you bite,
you're transported here.

524
00:26:57,077 --> 00:26:58,977
Like leaving an animal trap
in the wild.

525
00:26:58,979 --> 00:27:02,013
It even knew to make my dad
talk about his colon.

526
00:27:02,015 --> 00:27:03,248
That's an advanced technology.

527
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,983
They recreate your

528
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:07,986
natural environment based on
the data they've collected.

529
00:27:07,988 --> 00:27:10,521
Once you're acclimated, whoosh!

530
00:27:10,523 --> 00:27:12,724
The wall goes up
and you're the newest exhibit.

531
00:27:12,726 --> 00:27:15,360
They got lucky with you guys.

532
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:17,495
Usually they don't get
two for one.

533
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:20,565
Our natural environment.

534
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:21,833
What about him?

535
00:27:21,835 --> 00:27:23,668
He's only a child.

536
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,603
What's your name, sweetie?

537
00:27:25,605 --> 00:27:27,605
Baral.

538
00:27:27,607 --> 00:27:29,374
Yeah? How long
have you been here?

539
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:30,608
Where's your mommy?

540
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,510
I... don't know.

541
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:38,917
He got here a few
weeks after I did.

542
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:41,686
I've been here eight months.

543
00:27:41,688 --> 00:27:44,355
What the hell kind of people
do something like this?

544
00:27:44,357 --> 00:27:45,857
They're Calivon.

545
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:48,793
They think any technologically
inferior species

546
00:27:48,795 --> 00:27:51,029
is theirs to do with
as they please.

547
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:54,632
We're... interesting
and fun to watch.

548
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:56,134
Weird as that sounds.

549
00:27:56,136 --> 00:27:57,869
It's not that weird.

550
00:27:57,871 --> 00:27:59,704
There was a time where
humans imprisoned animals

551
00:27:59,706 --> 00:28:01,205
for entertainment.

552
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:02,373
It wasn't intended to be cruel.

553
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,976
We just felt, as the higher
species, we had the right.

554
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:06,611
Yeah, well, that was
hundreds of years ago,

555
00:28:06,613 --> 00:28:08,479
so you tell me who's
more advanced. Hey!

556
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:10,014
We are not your shamu!

557
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:14,152
I told you, they don't care!

558
00:28:14,154 --> 00:28:15,787
There's got to be
a way out of here.

559
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:18,790
I mean, that... that child
belongs with his parents.

560
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:20,124
Why don't you ask Ock'or?

561
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:21,459
Who's Ock'or?

562
00:28:21,461 --> 00:28:22,660
The big guy to your left.

563
00:28:22,662 --> 00:28:24,162
You can't see him
from where you are.

564
00:28:28,935 --> 00:28:32,003
He's been here 31 years.

565
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:33,271
In other words,

566
00:28:33,273 --> 00:28:35,139
there's no way out.

567
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:47,485
Well, that's the last of it.

568
00:28:47,487 --> 00:28:49,320
Weapons and quantum
drive are back online.

569
00:28:49,322 --> 00:28:50,822
All departments show green, sir.

570
00:28:50,824 --> 00:28:52,590
Repairs are complete.

571
00:28:52,592 --> 00:28:54,759
Set course for
the Calivon system, sir?

572
00:28:54,761 --> 00:28:55,994
No.

573
00:28:57,196 --> 00:28:59,831
Set course for Earth.

574
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,165
Wait, what?

575
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:03,201
What?! What about
Ed and Kelly?

576
00:29:03,203 --> 00:29:04,669
My orders are clear.

577
00:29:04,671 --> 00:29:06,504
The captain and first officer
will be declared

578
00:29:06,506 --> 00:29:07,872
lost in the line of duty.

579
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:09,374
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.

580
00:29:09,376 --> 00:29:10,675
What the hell are
you talking about?

581
00:29:10,677 --> 00:29:12,110
The Calivon system
is off-limits.

582
00:29:12,112 --> 00:29:13,344
Return us to Earth.

583
00:29:13,346 --> 00:29:14,879
Alara, that is a
cold-blooded order,

584
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:16,214
and you can shove
it up your ass.

585
00:29:16,216 --> 00:29:17,749
Lieutenant,
you're relieved of duty.

586
00:29:21,353 --> 00:29:22,720
Get off the bridge.

587
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:32,230
Lieutenant Lamarr,
carry out the order.

588
00:29:33,332 --> 00:29:34,565
Yes, sir.

589
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:54,352
Claire?

590
00:29:54,354 --> 00:29:56,154
Alara. Come on in.

591
00:29:58,057 --> 00:29:59,590
They hate me.

592
00:29:59,592 --> 00:30:02,260
The entire crew hates me.

593
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:04,028
I mean, can't they see
that I'm just as upset

594
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,563
about this as they are?

595
00:30:05,565 --> 00:30:06,831
I mean, Kelly is my friend.

596
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,499
For god's sakes,
I'm just following

597
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:10,001
admiral Tucker's orders.

598
00:30:10,003 --> 00:30:11,502
And the admiral's right.

599
00:30:11,504 --> 00:30:13,337
To put the entire ship

600
00:30:13,339 --> 00:30:16,174
in danger to rescue two officers
who might not even be alive?

601
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:17,408
No,

602
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,177
he gave the proper order.

603
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:20,845
So you don't think
we should go either?

604
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:22,080
I didn't say that.

605
00:30:22,082 --> 00:30:24,082
Alara,

606
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:25,583
everything
that you've dealt with,

607
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:27,685
up until now, is child's play.

608
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:29,353
This is command.

609
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:31,022
You have a choice.

610
00:30:31,024 --> 00:30:34,525
Follow orders and accept that
the crew will hate you for it,

611
00:30:34,527 --> 00:30:36,894
or disobey orders
and go after our people.

612
00:30:36,896 --> 00:30:40,698
But, if you take that kind
of risk and you're wrong,

613
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,700
you could destroy your career.

614
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:43,935
Or worse.

615
00:31:06,925 --> 00:31:08,793
Xelayan Tequila, double.

616
00:31:13,732 --> 00:31:15,099
Thanks.

617
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:29,947
Hi.

618
00:31:29,949 --> 00:31:31,249
Can I sit here?

619
00:31:31,251 --> 00:31:33,684
You can sit
wherever you want, sir.

620
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:36,487
Okay, uh, thanks.

621
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:41,626
Guys, please.

622
00:31:41,628 --> 00:31:42,994
I had no choice.

623
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,531
Permission to speak freely, sir?

624
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:48,533
Yes, of course.

625
00:31:48,535 --> 00:31:50,520
You know what the most heinous
thing about this is?

626
00:31:51,637 --> 00:31:53,304
If the captain were
in your shoes,

627
00:31:53,306 --> 00:31:54,972
he would've gone after you.

628
00:31:54,974 --> 00:31:56,674
He would've risked his career

629
00:31:56,676 --> 00:31:58,309
to save your life.

630
00:31:58,311 --> 00:31:59,443
You suck.

631
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:02,013
Sir.

632
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,492
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

633
00:32:14,494 --> 00:32:17,361
I have been given a direct order
from the fleet admiralty

634
00:32:17,363 --> 00:32:19,330
to abandon the search
for captain Mercer

635
00:32:19,332 --> 00:32:21,866
and commander Grayson.

636
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:24,035
But as far as I'm concerned,
they can bite me

637
00:32:24,037 --> 00:32:25,336
because we're going anyway.

638
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:26,537
Yeah!

639
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:29,006
Whoo! Yeah!

640
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:32,043
Gordon, John, how fast
can you get us there?

641
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:33,544
As fast as you want, sir.

642
00:32:33,546 --> 00:32:35,012
You're the captain.

643
00:32:35,014 --> 00:32:37,882
Yeah.

644
00:32:55,398 --> 00:32:57,932
Approaching the border
of Calivon space, sir.

645
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,268
Kids, roll the windows up.

646
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,538
Okay, now comes the dicey part,
so everyone listen up.

647
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,874
We can't just waltz into
Calivon space in a union ship,

648
00:33:06,876 --> 00:33:08,109
so Isaac's been
working on a plan.

649
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,711
In sifting through the debris

650
00:33:09,713 --> 00:33:11,212
that collided with
our shuttle bay,

651
00:33:11,214 --> 00:33:13,581
I was able to analyze
a fragment of the Calivon

652
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,250
holographic generator.

653
00:33:15,252 --> 00:33:18,253
I believe we can use their
own technology against them.

654
00:33:18,255 --> 00:33:21,422
We can make it appear as
though we are a Calivon ship.

655
00:33:21,424 --> 00:33:24,025
But it will take every ounce
of power we can spare,

656
00:33:24,027 --> 00:33:27,595
so all nonessential systems
will need to be shut down.

657
00:33:27,597 --> 00:33:30,798
Now, once we reach the planet,
Isaac becomes key.

658
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,567
As he loves to remind everyone,

659
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:34,869
his home world of Kaylon
is technologically superior

660
00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:36,104
to the rest of us.

661
00:33:36,106 --> 00:33:37,438
Intellectually as well, sir.

662
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,407
Right. Thanks.

663
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:41,743
Kaylon is comparable in that
area to the Calivon themselves,

664
00:33:41,745 --> 00:33:44,112
which means they should be
willing to talk to us

665
00:33:44,114 --> 00:33:45,313
as long as he's with us.

666
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,814
White dude can go to Compton

667
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,483
long as the black guy
says it's cool.

668
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,985
I have no idea
what that means, but yes.

669
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,088
If they'll speak to us,
we have a chance of finding out

670
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,490
what happened to our people.

671
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:56,791
Everybody ready?

672
00:33:58,294 --> 00:33:59,794
Isaac, give us a makeover.

673
00:33:59,796 --> 00:34:02,130
Yes, sir.

674
00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:16,811
Approaching Calivon system.

675
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:19,147
Take us in.

676
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:21,416
Nice and easy.

677
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:33,361
Calivon patrol ship approaching.

678
00:34:35,097 --> 00:34:36,731
They are scanning us.

679
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:43,071
Nothing out of
the ordinary here.

680
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:02,690
They are moving on, sir.

681
00:35:05,027 --> 00:35:07,562
I am detecting
two human life signs

682
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,030
on the planet's surface.

683
00:35:09,032 --> 00:35:11,065
Is the shuttle ready?
Yes, sir.

684
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,067
All right. Let's go.

685
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:19,073
Oh, Claire, I have bad news.
What's wrong?

686
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,008
You're the ranking officer,
which means you have command.

687
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,244
Enjoy.

688
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,913
Son of a bitch.

689
00:35:47,203 --> 00:35:48,703
Hey.

690
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:50,204
Do you want to not
do that, please?

691
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:52,240
What?
We lived together long enough.

692
00:35:52,242 --> 00:35:54,442
You know I do not like
listening to people eat cereal.

693
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,277
It's morning.
I'm eating breakfast.

694
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,179
You know, you should try
eating in the morning

695
00:35:58,181 --> 00:35:59,180
instead of drinking.

696
00:35:59,182 --> 00:36:00,181
It's neat.

697
00:36:00,183 --> 00:36:02,183
<i>I'm having a beer.</i>

698
00:36:02,185 --> 00:36:03,584
Yeah, at 9:00 A.M.

699
00:36:03,586 --> 00:36:05,386
Which,
in case you don't remember,

700
00:36:05,388 --> 00:36:06,521
<i>is something that I do not like.</i>

701
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:09,123
I'm doing something
that the Germans...

702
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,525
"The Germans have been doing
for centuries," yes.

703
00:36:10,527 --> 00:36:11,592
You love that one, don't you?

704
00:36:11,594 --> 00:36:12,983
Well, guess what.
You're not German.

705
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,631
Well, you're not
Franken Berry, so shut up.

706
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,566
You know what? It is all
coming back to me now.

707
00:36:18,568 --> 00:36:19,801
Oh, what, Kel?
What is, what is

708
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,869
all coming back to you now?
Us.

709
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:23,871
Living together. All the things
that sucked about it.

710
00:36:23,873 --> 00:36:25,740
Yes! This is exactly what
I was saying on the shuttle.

711
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:26,974
Do you remember?
And you said no.

712
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,409
I said,
"we were a bad match."

713
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:30,545
Okay? I am just as miserable
with you as you are with me.

714
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:32,146
Well, great,
finally some common ground.

715
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,815
Some common ground between the two of us.
Some common ground.

716
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,316
- Thank god.
- Captain.

717
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,985
Alara?

718
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,554
Alara, what are you doing here?

719
00:36:39,556 --> 00:36:40,988
Getting you out.

720
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,490
God, am I glad to see you.

721
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,058
Sorry about my breath.

722
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,660
Wait a minute, you...

723
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,463
You couldn't have gotten
union clearance to come here.

724
00:36:48,465 --> 00:36:51,165
No. We took a little field trip.

725
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,167
Well, I wish we could tell you
how to get us out of here,

726
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,169
but, honestly, we have no idea.
It would be reasonable

727
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,672
to assume that if this is a zoo,

728
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,174
there must be a zookeeper.

729
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:04,312
Come in.

730
00:37:07,783 --> 00:37:10,351
Well, hello there.

731
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,487
They told me we had a Kaylon
visitor here at the zoo.

732
00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:14,288
Welcome.

733
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,524
Good day, sir. What brings
you all the way out here?

734
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:19,627
Besides the fact that we have
the widest variety of species

735
00:37:19,629 --> 00:37:21,362
on exhibit
anywhere in the sector?

736
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,965
There is a matter
I wish to discuss with you.

737
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:25,700
If you're gonna try and
sell me that Xelayan female,

738
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,168
I've already got one.

739
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,536
She is not for sale.

740
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,671
She is... my pet.

741
00:37:30,673 --> 00:37:31,973
Woof.

742
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:33,474
However, I would like to

743
00:37:33,476 --> 00:37:34,675
speak with you about the humans.

744
00:37:34,677 --> 00:37:36,477
Oh, aren't they wonderful?

745
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:37,678
They're brand-new.

746
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,347
The visitors are loving them.

747
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:41,883
I must inform you they are
the property of another zoo,

748
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,518
and were taken illegally.

749
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,720
Well, they should've been
kept on a tighter leash.

750
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,121
Not my problem.

751
00:37:47,123 --> 00:37:48,990
I'm afraid they were
in the midst of treatment

752
00:37:48,992 --> 00:37:51,192
for a very rare disease
they are carrying,

753
00:37:51,194 --> 00:37:52,460
one that could infect

754
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:54,662
your other species.
You're kidding.

755
00:37:54,664 --> 00:37:56,998
I am Kaylon.
We do not kid.

756
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,567
We would be happy to
take them off your hands.

757
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:00,835
Damn it.

758
00:38:00,837 --> 00:38:02,570
I don't believe this.

759
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:03,838
This is the administrator.

760
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,406
Initialize euthanasia sweep

761
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,675
of unit 484.

762
00:38:13,181 --> 00:38:15,416
Uh, Kel?

763
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,118
What's going...?

764
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,528
What... what the hell is that?

765
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,430
I don't think we
want to find out.

766
00:38:34,692 --> 00:38:35,893
Oh, boy.

767
00:38:35,895 --> 00:38:37,361
We're in trouble.

768
00:38:37,363 --> 00:38:40,297
Wait, what do you mean
"euthanasia sweep"?

769
00:38:39,997 --> 00:38:42,397
Would it not be simpler to
allow us to take the humans?

770
00:38:42,399 --> 00:38:45,000
We have a strict non-contaminant
policy that's helped us

771
00:38:45,002 --> 00:38:47,002
avoid any epidemics
among the exhibits.

772
00:38:47,004 --> 00:38:49,504
I'm sorry, but even handing them
over to you would risk a breach.

773
00:38:49,506 --> 00:38:50,772
Don't worry,

774
00:38:50,774 --> 00:38:52,341
their deaths will be painless.

775
00:38:52,343 --> 00:38:53,342
Uh...

776
00:38:53,344 --> 00:38:55,210
In here.

777
00:38:55,212 --> 00:38:56,345
Oh, my god.

778
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:57,913
Oh, crap. Uh...
Oh, no.

779
00:38:57,915 --> 00:38:59,448
Isaac, I need to talk to him.

780
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,116
Make him talk to me.

781
00:39:01,118 --> 00:39:03,552
Sir, I would like you to listen

782
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:05,887
to what my Xelayan
female has to say.

783
00:39:07,124 --> 00:39:09,958
You want me to talk...

784
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,126
To her?

785
00:39:11,128 --> 00:39:12,561
Is this a joke?

786
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:13,629
All right, just stay calm.

787
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:14,963
Oh!

788
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:16,131
I know it is absurd,

789
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:18,300
but if you will
indulge me momentarily,

790
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:21,136
I would be most appreciative.

791
00:39:21,138 --> 00:39:23,105
Okay.

792
00:39:23,107 --> 00:39:24,306
Talk, Xelayan.

793
00:39:24,308 --> 00:39:25,607
Thanks, dick.

794
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:26,808
Okay.

795
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,744
Why do you run this zoo?

796
00:39:28,746 --> 00:39:30,579
So our people may view
different species

797
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:32,147
in their natural habitats.

798
00:39:32,149 --> 00:39:34,149
What if I were to trade you

799
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:35,417
something that would be

800
00:39:35,419 --> 00:39:37,119
far more valuable to you?

801
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:40,122
Something irresistible?

802
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:42,457
And what might that be?

803
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:43,959
Uh...
Oh, god.

804
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:45,927
No, no, no.
Uh, uh...

805
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:47,963
I'm going to
the bathroom to read!

806
00:39:53,403 --> 00:39:54,636
What the hell was that?

807
00:39:54,638 --> 00:39:57,239
It was Elvis Presley's
last words.

808
00:39:57,241 --> 00:39:59,374
It was all I could think of.

809
00:40:05,648 --> 00:40:08,650
And for outstanding
courage, valor,

810
00:40:08,652 --> 00:40:12,254
and resourcefulness,
in the finest union tradition,

811
00:40:12,256 --> 00:40:15,991
I hereby present you,
lieutenant Alara Kitan,

812
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:17,592
with the sapphire star.

813
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:42,150
Alara, you did great.

814
00:40:42,152 --> 00:40:43,819
Kelly and I owe you big-time.

815
00:40:43,821 --> 00:40:46,488
Let's just hope admiral Tucker
sees it that way.

816
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,557
Don't worry,
Ed and I will cover you.

817
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:50,359
Yeah, we're a pretty
crappy couple,

818
00:40:50,361 --> 00:40:53,161
but we're awfully good
with office politics. Hmm.

819
00:40:53,163 --> 00:40:56,231
And this little guy was
the best part of the bargain.

820
00:40:56,233 --> 00:40:58,166
You excited to see
your mommy and daddy?

821
00:40:58,168 --> 00:41:00,168
Yes.
- Yes.

822
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,337
You know, a lot
of us are wondering exactly

823
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:04,539
what it is you gave the Calivon.

824
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:05,707
It was lieutenant Malloy's idea.

825
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:09,478
He guided me to a very old,
very obscure section

826
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,313
of Earth's cultural database.

827
00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:12,814
I'm just here to serve.

828
00:41:12,816 --> 00:41:14,316
They wanted a human zoo.

829
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:16,718
I gave 'em one.

830
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,653
I am paying attention.

831
00:41:18,655 --> 00:41:21,823
Obviously
there has to be something else.

832
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:23,558
It's just not name change
and arrested.

833
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,261
There has to be something else.

834
00:41:26,263 --> 00:41:27,496
Are you stripping?

835
00:41:27,498 --> 00:41:28,830
You were stripping.
I was arrested!

836
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,399
Prostitution whore.

837
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:33,502
You were fucking engaged 19 times?!

838
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:36,371
You stupid bitch!

839
00:41:40,511 --> 00:41:42,878
<i>The bachelor.</i>

840
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,513
<i>Duck dynasty.</i>

841
00:41:44,515 --> 00:41:46,047
<i>Keeping up with the Kardashians.</i>

842
00:41:46,049 --> 00:41:49,184
There must be 10,000 files here.

843
00:41:49,186 --> 00:41:51,953
What is this reality television?

844
00:41:51,955 --> 00:41:55,857
The best exhibit we've ever had.

845
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:13,575
Klyden.

846
00:42:13,577 --> 00:42:15,444
Come.

847
00:42:30,127 --> 00:42:32,394
It is...

848
00:42:32,396 --> 00:42:35,430
A female.

849
00:42:35,432 --> 00:42:38,300
That is...

850
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:40,302
Impossible.

851
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:50,879

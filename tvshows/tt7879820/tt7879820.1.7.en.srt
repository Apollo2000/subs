2
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,616
This weekend, but I thought
he was with them. I don't know.

3
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,574
I don't know.

4
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:41,018
- Thank you.
- I don't know.

5
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,020
Wait, where's Mario? I
was hoping to see him.

6
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,147
He went with his new
bougie girlfriend to Nevada.

7
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,190
- Instead of coming home?
- He's in the bone zone.

8
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,567
- True.
- True.

9
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,778
- Can you pass the tres leches?
- Oh, okay.

10
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,656
My mom makes the best tres
leches for my birthday.

11
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,159
Guess not this year.

12
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,162
Don't say that. Maybe your folks
will be home before your birthday.

13
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,581
In a week? I don't think so.

14
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,708
Wait, your quince is in a week?

15
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,293
And you didn't tell us?

16
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,253
Mom, Dad, Olivia's quince is in a week!

17
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,921
It's not a big deal.

18
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,214
What?

19
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,551
- Mija, is that true?
- Mm-hmm.

20
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,279
Olivia, don't worry about a thing.

21
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,756
I'm gonna get my shifts covered at work

22
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:19,970
and we'll do it here next Saturday.

23
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,767
Oh, my God!

24
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,832
Olivia's having a chupacabra!

25
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,896
Oh, my God.

26
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,201
No, roses.

27
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,495
Picture it! Roses.

28
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,664
And we use basic patterns...

29
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,013
- Hey, why'd you disappear?
- I just needed to get some air.

30
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,766
You okay?

31
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,106
Can you do that girlie thing
where you get soft and supportive?

32
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,982
- I do that?
- No.

33
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,192
But can you?

34
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,625
You don't have to do this.

35
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,087
We're not doing
anything. This is for me.

36
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,170
And me.

37
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,092
Don't know why, but we
both felt the need to hug.

38
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:43,181
I can't believe I'm about to have
my first birthday without my parents

39
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,766
and it's my quince.

40
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,479
It's so ironic. I mean,
since I was able to walk,

41
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,066
my mother has driven me crazy
talking about my quinceañera.

42
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,863
Trying recipes, cutting
magazines, making playlists.

43
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,117
And my dad,

44
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,662
practicing our waltz so
he'd have it down on the day.

45
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,831
He's been practicing for years.

46
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,249
Years!

47
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,795
- That's a lot of dancing.
- Yeah.

48
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,758
And he has no rhythm. Like none.

49
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,887
So, my feet are all shredded, all
in the name of my mother's obsession,

50
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,306
which I used to pray would stop.

51
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,391
But now that it has...

52
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,353
I miss it.

53
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,482
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

54
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,776
You just totally and
completely devastated Olivia

55
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,444
by suggesting she have a quince.

56
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,797
What's new with RollerWorld?

57
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,490
Ha! Nothing.

58
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,741
Nada.

59
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,535
- I hit a dead end.
- What do you mean a dead end?

60
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,706
Like a literal dead one.
Like Lil' Ricky is dead.

61
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,085
After the football game, I
followed Oscar's lead to an address.

62
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:58,381
And it took me to a graveyard
where I found Lil' Ricky's grave.

63
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,718
He died in 1982, 19
months after the heist.

64
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,386
But how? Why?

65
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,806
Did the Prophets disembowel
him through his throat?

66
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,517
Seriously, woman, we're
psychically linked.

67
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,175
Those exact same
questions crossed my mind,

68
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:13,063
which is why I had to go deep.

69
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,733
I had to go where I never
thought I'd need to go.

70
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,944
Oh, dear. Jamal, where'd you go?

71
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,445
The library.

72
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,050
That night I pulled an all-nighter

73
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:24,200
doing some serious
fishing with the fiche.

74
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,177
- How do you fish with fish?
- It's microfiche.

75
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,801
- Micro what?
- Micro nothing.

76
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,122
There was no evidence
of Ricky's passing.

77
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,249
No obit.

78
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,709
So, that's it.

79
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,004
The end. El Fin.

80
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,883
Aren't those little homies funny?

81
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,426
Gnomies.

82
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,970
Gnomies!

83
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,930
Yes. Anyways,

84
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,182
Ricky is dead and so are our leads.

85
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:53,353
Beep. Beep. Beep.

86
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,521
We have a lead.

87
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,605
Go here.

88
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,567
Whoever is paying for the
flowers on the grave knew Ricky

89
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,318
and may know RollerWorld.

90
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,738
Beep. Beep.

91
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,532
Beep. Beep.

92
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,568
Beep.

93
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:11,079
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to rub salt on the wound.

94
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,914
It's not your fault.

95
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,378
I haven't seen my parents in months
and I've barely talked to them.

96
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,380
It's just a nightmare situation.

97
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,175
Which is why you should have a party!

98
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,136
Ruby, she doesn't want to celebrate.

99
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,887
- Are you even listening?
- I am.

100
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:31,308
And what I'm hearing is how
important this party is to her mom.

101
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,561
- I can't do it without her.
- But that's why you have to.

102
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,355
You're not betraying your mom to
have a quince if she's not here,

103
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,686
but you would be betraying her

104
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:41,181
to not have one because she's not here.

105
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,485
Not after all her planning.

106
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,238
I never thought of it that way.

107
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,083
Because I'm good at
making people understand

108
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:48,575
the right side of an argument.

109
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,618
- Or annoying them into submission.
- So...

110
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,954
Do you have any ideas
about what you want?

111
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,126
Everyone, please open your e-devices

112
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,420
and find the e-mail I
sent titled "Winning".

113
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,255
Find it? Good.

114
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,000
Because after copious hours of searching

115
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:05,675
through Olivia's quincespirations,

116
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,094
I've compiled the best
ideas on a Pinterest page

117
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,347
on the link below her headshot.

118
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,765
Where's Olivia?

119
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,560
The princesa doesn't need to
be bothered with the details.

120
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,606
Now, anyone else have a
dumb question? Huh? Good.

121
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,651
And before we really get
going, I'd like to remind you

122
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,444
that we're not just friends and family,

123
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,238
we're damas and chambelanes
in Olivia's court de honor,

124
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:31,076
which means being
honorable and dedicated.

125
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,663
So, take a look at our mandatory
rehearsal schedule and...

126
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,779
Excuse me. I need to take this.

127
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,751
Ruby's Fancy Festivities.

128
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,004
What do you mean?

129
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,885
- Think that's your mom?
- Yeah.

130
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,509
Just do it.

131
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,095
Laura Diaz?

132
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,681
I couldn't use my real name.
I don't want to scare her off.

133
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,205
You know, the more I think about
this, the more I realize this is dumb.

134
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,856
No way is my mom some rich lady
living ten miles away from here.

135
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,066
I shouldn't do this.

136
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,402
ADD FRIEND
- PENDING

137
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,112
- What did you do?
- What you needed to.

138
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,131
But I don't know if I want
to know what I don't know.

139
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,199
- Then undo it. Unfriend her.
- Wait, no.

140
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,703
But what if she's online
right now and sees it?

141
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,162
Unfriending would be offensive.

142
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,432
And I might be ready to friend
her later. She'll think that...

143
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,458
Yeah, yeah. I'll take
my business elsewhere.

144
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,168
I'm back. Sorry.

145
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,781
Apparently ordering
a goat-drawn carriage

146
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:25,463
is more complicated than I thought.

147
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,466
Who knew there was a goat
wranglers union? I kid you not.

148
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,427
- Pun intended.
- Whatever, man.

149
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,429
So, we're gonna need
to rethink the carriage,

150
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,264
which I'll get to in a moment,

151
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,099
unless...

152
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,351
You all think the twins can pull it?

153
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:39,894
No.

154
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,271
Fine. Moving on.

155
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,982
The following are individual
responsibilities...

156
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,276
- I'll handle music.
- Great minds think alike, compa.

157
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,030
Monse, given your expert penmanship,
you're gonna do invitations.

158
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,407
- No.
- Use cardstock.

159
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,410
Jamal, you can cater. And
by you, I mean your dad.

160
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,162
- How many people?
- Well...

161
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,789
there's us, and then the block, and...

162
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,333
- Three hundred.
- Three hundred people!?

163
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,753
You're right. Better make it 350.

164
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,839
Jamal will do the flowers.
I will do the food.

165
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,507
What do I know about flowers?

166
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:13,762
Nothing, which is why you
need to go to Mr. Greenthumb.

167
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,683
Mr. Greenthumb... will help you.

168
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,686
Oh, Mr. Greenthumb.

169
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:52,883
Uh...

170
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,969
I saw the flowers you
did at the cemetery.

171
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,350
I can't remember the
name of the dead guy.

172
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:59,600
Someone named Nicky or Dicky...

173
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,809
- Ricky.
- Right.

174
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,478
Ricky.

175
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,561
Loved the plot, man.

176
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,981
Okay. So, uh...

177
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,444
I need some flowers for a quinceañera.

178
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:15,365
I was thinking something in the vein
of Ricky's grave, but for a party.

179
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,826
How much did those clients pay?

180
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,037
You probably don't remember. No biggie.

181
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,082
Could you just pass along
their info and I'll ask them?

182
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,334
No.

183
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,460
No?

184
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,130
Ricky was my cousin.

185
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,840
- What do you have?
- Nothing.

186
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,425
It's just a flashlight pen.
But take it, it's yours.

187
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,971
Oh, for the flowers.

188
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,681
Fifty bucks.

189
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,058
Sounds like three bins of baby's breath.

190
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,342
This is for a Quinceañera,
not a rustic hipster wedding.

191
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,153
Screw hipsters.

192
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,655
All they ever buy is succulents.

193
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,741
- Fifty dollars don't look good, homie.
- I know. I'm sorry.

194
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,118
Wasn't talking to you.

195
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,378
You crochet?

196
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,504
Bake?

197
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,131
Tickle?

198
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,557
Julio thinks we could trade with sweat.

199
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,517
You lift for me,

200
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,311
I arrange for you.

201
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,187
- Lift what?
- Everything.

202
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,189
Me and Julio got into it.

203
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,529
His old lady, Juanita, left him.

204
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,531
He blamed it on me.

205
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,116
Thought we had a thing going on,

206
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,451
but we didn't.

207
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,120
She wasn't a ride or die.

208
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,413
Right, homie?

209
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,957
- Yeah...
- Wasn't talking to you.

210
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,466
So, um...

211
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,093
I'm in for the work for flowers trade.

212
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,220
When should I start?

213
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,389
You already have.

214
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,912
So, he's a little eccentric.

215
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,104
He's not eccentric, he's a quincecabra.

216
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,942
Monse, you're consistently
failing with your face.

217
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,318
See what I'm doing? It's body.

218
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,402
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

219
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,486
Then face.

220
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,716
If people are looking at your face,
they can't tell how much you suck.

221
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,952
- Sorry I'm late.
- Silencio!

222
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,414
No one wants to hear your
excuses. Look at Cesar.

223
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,122
Or don't. The point is,

224
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,668
he takes time in life and death
situations to be prompt and you don't.

225
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,170
Everybody, again, from the top.

226
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,972
It's a square, people. It's a square.

227
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,662
Turn.

228
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,855
And down. And one, and
two, and three, and...

229
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,898
Guys!

230
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,442
No. No.

231
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,528
You're not even trying.

232
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,447
Ruby, you're a natural, we're not.

233
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,491
- We need an easier routine.
- Or no routine.

234
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,035
Nonsense! You just need some practice.

235
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,829
And I have some backup.

236
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,914
- She should be here any minute.
- Who?

237
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,917
The talent, bitches. Hey!

238
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,059
♪ Yo, drop that track ♪

239
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,407
♪ Oh, my goodness ♪

240
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,076
- Ow!
- And that's just a taste.

241
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,786
Yeah, I got you shook.

242
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,706
You see, I'm like a Tootsie Pop.

243
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,083
You got to keep licking
to get to the surprise.

244
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,627
- Is that my dress?
- Nope.

245
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,713
Maybe. Yeah.

246
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,965
Don't get worked up. It's just on loan.

247
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,443
But now there's a big hole in the back.

248
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,636
Yeah, where you stabbed me in
that "Everybody kill Jasmine" game.

249
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,181
I shouldn't even be here right now,

250
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,974
- but I have a heart.
- Heart.

251
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,412
Plus it's your quince

252
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:13,352
and I don't wanna regret
not being one of your damas

253
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,146
when we live together in our twenties.

254
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,439
Now let's get to work.

255
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,732
Music to my ears.

256
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,734
Everybody, grab your partners.

257
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,987
Olivia and Cesar, Jamal
and Monse, me and Jasmine.

258
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,615
That's music to my ears.

259
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,326
On second thought, better
pair the good with the bad.

260
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,619
You go work with Jamal.

261
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,162
- Monse!
- Hi.

262
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:32,789
Oh.

263
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,838
Don't give me that look.

264
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,965
- But you said I needed better face.
- Yeah...

265
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,134
but not the kind that
makes you look ugly.

266
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,303
Better face, not bitter face.

267
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,448
I'm gonna shut up right now
and silently hate on you.

268
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,016
Okay. Just don't look at
your feet while you do it.

269
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,143
Head up, shoulders back.

270
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,150
He tripped because he's
looking at his feet.

271
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,485
So ironic.

272
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,279
Actually, it's not ironic.
It's counterintuitive.

273
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,408
Irony would be the fact we're
dancing with each other and not them.

274
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,118
They look really good together.

275
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:16,165
Yeah. And what was I thinking? Girls
like that don't go for guys like me.

276
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,430
- Why not?
- Same reason guys like Cesar

277
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:20,920
don't go for girls like you.

278
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,102
No one is into this
quince, including me.

279
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,980
I need you to talk to Ruby.

280
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
And say what?

281
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,650
That I want to call it off.

282
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,943
No way! You do it.

283
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,613
I can't. I've already broken his
heart once. I can't do it again.

284
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:48,697
But you can.

285
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,950
Please, as my dama.

286
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,120
If we're calling off your
quince, I'm not your dama anymore.

287
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,496
You are until it's over.

288
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,081
Here he comes. Oh.

289
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,629
- Ruby, I need to talk to you.
- Oh, me too.

290
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,840
You think your dad's
18-wheeler could hold a horse?

291
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,410
- Why?
- Well, I found a dancing horse in Barstow,

292
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:10,052
but I need to provide its transpo

293
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,220
to and from the party.

294
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,723
That's it. Ruby, you've
become a total quincecabra.

295
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,974
- A what?
- A monster!

296
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,643
You're too wrapped up in this
party and driving us all crazy

297
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,060
and potentially shortening our lives

298
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,647
with all this unnecessary
anxiety. And...

299
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,316
And this is about Cesar.

300
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,319
I saw the way you looked at him
when he was dancing with Olivia.

301
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,202
It's classic transference. You're
mad at him, so you take it out on me.

302
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,157
I'm not mad at Cesar.

303
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,408
There it is again.

304
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,120
"I." "I" this and "I" that.
Monse, this isn't about you.

305
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,204
It's about Olivia.

306
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,874
You got to put jealousy
aside and stop being selfish.

307
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,667
It's not a good look on you.

308
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,839
Oh, and I'm still gonna need
you to get that 18-wheeler.

309
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,771
So?

310
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:53,012
Ruby's getting you a horse.

311
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,563
All right. So, what's next?

312
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,111
Should I rearrange the sundials?

313
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:06,360
They won't sell if
people can't see them.

314
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,444
Don't touch those things.
They belong to Ricky.

315
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,364
Take a break. Julio
thinks you're dehydrated.

316
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,712
You like puzzles?

317
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,130
Sure. Who doesn't?

318
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,758
Riddles?

319
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,510
Scavenger hunts?

320
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,346
- Ever seen Goonies?
- I am Goonies.

321
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,392
Goonies would have been
Ricky's favorite movie,

322
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,269
but he died before it came out.

323
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,105
- You must've really loved your cousin.
- He was cool.

324
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,815
He helped me start this place,

325
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,568
put in his own money,
even got his hands dirty.

326
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,903
But he was a terrible rapper.

327
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,863
Nobody could even tell
him how bad he was.

328
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,534
He once rhymed "hair" with "hair."

329
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,329
Do you remember how Lil'
Ricky was with finances?

330
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,124
Like did he ever suddenly
come into a lot of money?

331
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,959
And if so, did he hide it?

332
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,420
Like under a mattress
or in someone's backyard?

333
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,428
You're the one.

334
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,138
The one what?

335
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,105
The one who's going to
find the RollerWorld money.

336
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,523
You know about RollerWorld?

337
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,453
- Was Ricky involved?
- I didn't say that...

338
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,278
but I didn't not say that.

339
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,740
Come back tonight and I
will tell you everything.

340
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,784
- Why not now?
- Too many ears.

341
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,478
I only trust Julio.

342
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,583
What time?

343
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,627
I don't know. 7:00?

344
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,711
Not you.

345
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,884
7:43. Bring dinner.

346
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,929
Thai food, pizza, donuts, pastrami.

347
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,681
Where am I gonna get all that?

348
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,854
Mother Phuket.

349
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,776
Unacceptable!

350
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,986
- What's up?
- Jamal just late-cancelled practice.

351
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,112
He's fired.

352
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,316
- We need a replacement.
- Oh, I can dance both parts!

353
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,660
- We can't replace Jamal.
- I don't know anyone else.

354
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,204
Well, consider this an
opportunity to make new friends.

355
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,540
Thank you.

356
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,213
- You avail Saturday for a quince?
- Ruby!

357
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,798
What? He's the right height.

358
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,426
I'm sorry. The ladies have no vision.

359
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,556
- Okay, let's dive in.
- Yes!

360
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,433
Not... Not the food!

361
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,935
Let's dive into the agenda.

362
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,938
Food is for inspiration.
Food is for closers.

363
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,064
Okay, I'll start.

364
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,334
So it turns out the dancing
horse doesn't actually dance.

365
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,943
I can dance that part too.

366
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,863
What? I don't see
anyone else stepping up!

367
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,408
Cesar, what do you think about
riding bareback with a sword?

368
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,951
Where am I gonna get a sword?

369
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,120
- Agh, do I have to do everything myself?
- No!

370
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,497
What's the problem, princesa?

371
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,083
You! You're the problem.

372
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,419
Take dinner. We're adjourned.

373
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,254
But you haven't earned it yet!

374
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,337
Enough!

375
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,509
A quince is supposed to be a
celebration, but now it's a chore.

376
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,178
Nobody wants to do
this, least of all me.

377
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,762
It's cancelled.

378
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,849
- The quince is off.
- Wha...

379
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,560
See you at school tomorrow.

380
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,569
Chivo?

381
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,655
Julio?

382
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,535
Jesus Christ.

383
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,585
Do you always sit like this for dinner?

384
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,044
Sit like what?

385
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,213
Where can I sit?

386
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,923
Kick it by the cacti.

387
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,800
While you're at it, re-pot them.

388
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,886
They look depressed.

389
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,556
RollerWorld and some
food when you're done.

390
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,692
Yeah?

391
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,824
I'm sorry. I guess I
got a little out of hand.

392
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,117
A little?

393
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,703
You ordered an ice
luge to serve horchata.

394
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,247
What can I say, I'm passionate.

395
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:34,210
And obsessive, controlling, overbearing.

396
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,170
I wanted to help with your heartbreak.

397
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,507
I'm not good at sitting with
feelings. I gotta work it out.

398
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,927
So when people say
sleep on it, I never do.

399
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,429
I may nap on it, but I never sleep.

400
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,515
I get right to the problem and fix it,

401
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:51,519
but in this case, it can't be fixed.

402
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,395
And I'm sorry.

403
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,733
I didn't respect that maybe you
just wanted to sit with things.

404
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,986
I need to learn to let people do that.

405
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,656
I'll be better next time.

406
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,532
I promise.

407
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,076
Good night.

408
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,713
Ruby.

409
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,514
What is that?

410
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,266
I know, it's too much.

411
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,600
I'm taking it down.

412
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,993
I just thought it would've been nice

413
00:22:33,994 --> 00:22:36,272
to add a bit of your
hometown to the party.

414
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,441
It was to take pictures in front of.

415
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,026
Oh, my God, this is...

416
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,446
You know not everyone
wears cowboy boots in Texas.

417
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,282
I took liberties.

418
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,285
Are those little Frito pies?

419
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:50,952
Yes.

420
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,622
- It's amazing.
- Really?

421
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,546
Wait, that's not even the
best part. Close your eyes.

422
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,925
Now, imagine you're at the party

423
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,636
and you stroll over
to take pictures and...

424
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,388
Open your eyes.

425
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,527
Is it freaking you out? I
mean, do they look too real?

426
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,947
You printed cut-outs of my parents?

427
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,408
I thought it'd be nice for
them to make an appearance.

428
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,079
This is the best worst
shit I've ever seen.

429
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,290
- Really?
- Yes, really.

430
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,918
The quince is back on.

431
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,130
Damn it. We lost half a day.
We're gonna have to double time it.

432
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,554
Ruby's not crazy.

433
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,974
The dude ordered a horse. A horse.

434
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,476
What does Laura Diaz think?

435
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,772
But seriously, did Laura
ever get a response?

436
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,982
Her friend request was accepted.

437
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,442
Holy shit!

438
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,985
Well, what'd you find out?

439
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,446
- I haven't started digging yet.
- Let's do it now!

440
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,115
Mm, I don't know.

441
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,190
I'm too nervous.

442
00:24:12,191 --> 00:24:15,120
Feels like something I should
do on my own in case I...

443
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,372
In case what?

444
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,999
I can't handle what I find.

445
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,961
Okay. But you know I'm
here for you, right?

446
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:24,922
I'm still your friend.

447
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,714
I know.

448
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,931
Oh, so get this. Remember how
I told you she's an author?

449
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,617
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I read one of her books.

450
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,726
And it's about a teenager
who travels back in time

451
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,687
and her past self is trying to kill her.

452
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,231
So, she's literally
running from her past.

453
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,358
Yes! Thank you. Isn't that insane?

454
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,444
- It all seems to be adding up.
- Or I'm just reading into it.

455
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,579
- I can't do this.
- What?

456
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,873
Pretend we're just friends.

457
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,377
I can't stop thinking about you.

458
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,588
- About us.
- Please don't, Cesar.

459
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,632
- I can't help it.
- You're with Olivia.

460
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,426
And the fam is happy.

461
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,677
But I'm not.

462
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,183
I think about you all the time.

463
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,355
Do you ever think about me?

464
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:30,863
All the time.

465
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,665
Hey, yo.

466
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,252
Hey, yo.

467
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,881
Hey, what's good with you,
ma? You're looking good.

468
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,259
Let me get that ass at Pimp Lane.

469
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,596
Yo, Monse, why you still hanging
out with these broke-ass Santos?

470
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,182
Oh, you spent time in juvie,
now you think you're balling?

471
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:02,102
Yeah, where do you think I knocked
off a bunch of your punk ass homies?

472
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:03,395
Ask about me. Go ahead.

473
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,814
Hey! Hey! Let's just go!

474
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,066
Screw the Santos and your dead homies.

475
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,569
You know what side you on?
This is our block, feel me?

476
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,863
They call me Lil' Spooky.
I'll blast on your ass.

477
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,532
- Please, Cesar.
- I don't care what side I'm on.

478
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,830
You're lucky your bitch is here.

479
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,823
'Cause when I catch
you slippin' next time,

480
00:26:23,824 --> 00:26:25,460
I'm gonna put a hole in you.

481
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,088
All potted and perky.

482
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,216
Let's grub.

483
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:36,220
Oh, no. Julio started eating without us.

484
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,388
The food... it's all gone.

485
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,182
That's not cool, homie.

486
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,476
He's got that low blood sugar.

487
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,261
That bitch ain't hypoglycemic!

488
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,189
You know how I know? Huh?

489
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,400
'Cause he's a stupid
inanimate object made in China!

490
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,861
Or Malaysia. Or Jacksonville, Florida.

491
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,404
I can't believe I fell for this.

492
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:57,574
Your crazy ass has been
playing me this whole time.

493
00:26:57,658 --> 00:27:01,078
And you thought, "Oh... I bet
he can clean my entire place."

494
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:02,704
Screw you!

495
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,457
And screw Julio!

496
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,253
Julio thinks it's actually
you who is playing me.

497
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,922
You just want to know about the money.

498
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,883
- Julio, did you just say that?
- He did.

499
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,016
Oh, no. Put Julio down!

500
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,852
He says he doesn't like
to be held that way.

501
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,813
- He's got the vertigo.
- You tell Julio to shut his mouth!

502
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,232
And then tell me what you
know about RollerWorld.

503
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,026
- Tell me or Julio gets curbed.
- Put Julio down, please.

504
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,130
Then talk.

505
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:36,363
- Is there money buried in the neighborhood?
- Yes.

506
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,132
- How do you know?
- Because I know who buried it.

507
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,658
- Was it Ricky?
- Put down Julio.

508
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:43,120
- Did Ricky bury the money?
- I don't know.

509
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,539
Yes! Yes! Ricky buried the money.

510
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,457
- How do you know?
- Because Ricky told me.

511
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,584
Ricky never lied to me.

512
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,980
- He protected me when nobody else would.
- So where's the money?

513
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,506
With Julio. The key to the
money lies within Julio.

514
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,342
Julio?

515
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,511
- Within Julio?
- Yes!

516
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,679
Screw Julio!

517
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,057
Can Julio fly?

518
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,267
What?

519
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,603
- Let's find out.
- No!

520
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,339
- Hey.
- Jamal, shit just got real.

521
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,692
Latrelle rolled up on Cesar.
We have to get him out of town.

522
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,468
It's the only way to keep him safe.

523
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,511
And we need money, a
lot of money to do it.

524
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,680
Do you really think  RollerWorld's real?

525
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,354
I know it is.

526
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000

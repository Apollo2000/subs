happening. I can feel it.

- I knew this was a dumb idea.
- Pop a zannie, J.

48
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,774
We can't see him 'cause
he's being stealth.

49
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,401
No doubt. He's got this. When
has Cesar ever disappointed?

50
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,695
Mmm, fourth grade. Kickball tourney.

51
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,905
We lost.

52
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,074
Only 'cause I picked
the kid with no skills.

53
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,492
And I'd pick you again.

54

Loyalty trumps victory, compa.

55
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,039
Ah.

56
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,249
Take it in.

57
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,254
This is about to be
us. This is high school.

58
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,299
Aw.

59
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,780
Ruby, you think your
brother's gonna marry Angelica?

60
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,348
No idea. Mario tells me jack.

61
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,911
What about that time he
said Angelica has a dangler?

62
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,270
- But he said that.
- In private!

63
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:08,814
Time and place, dude.

64
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,150
Oh, guys, check out
Huerita at nine o'clock.

65
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,195
- Monse, if you were a girl...
- I am a girl.

66
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,115
Yeah, but if you were a girl like
that, would you wear underwear?

67
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:22,536
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

68
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,037
Why are you gonna die?

69
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,872
Those guys play for the 'Ridge.

70
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,750
Did you know that last year
alone over a quorum of kids...

71
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,335
Died playing football?

72
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,629
You're stuck on repeat. So, don't play.

73
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,215
No choice. My pops was a legend.

74
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,633
It's family tradition.

75
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,052
I'm dead.

76
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,179
You're not dead.

77
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,224
Football spiral?

78
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,648
Jamal, CTE is not in your future.

79
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,942
Guys, check out my game.

80
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,862
Huerita just gave me the nod. Ah!

81
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,155
Eyeing my girl, cabrón?

82
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,449
No. God, no. I'm not into blondes.

83
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,659
Easy. He does your mom's taxes.

84
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:03,743
Mrs. Guzman, right?

85
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,413
Three thousand dollar refund.

86
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,416
Schedule C, line 30,
home office deduction.

87
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,792
Seriously, dude?

88
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,004
Yo, what are you doing, ese?

89
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,589
That's Spooky's little bro, dawg.

90
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,259
I didn't realize it was you, homie.

91
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,553
Hey, listen, tell Spooky
Sad Eyes sends respects.

92
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,055
Let's get out of here.

93
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,475
Thank God for your brother.

94
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,267
Don't.

95
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,353
Thank God for better things.

96
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,857
- Oh, shoot!
- Let's go!

97
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,060
Get down! Stand behind the door!

98
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,363
That was a .38.

99
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,365
No, it was a .45.

100
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,242
It sounded like a .44.

101
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:45,786
Wrong!

102
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,121
.357!

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -

104
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,964
Angelica's pissed.

105
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,216
She's always pissed.

106
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,426
You would be too if you had a dangler.

107
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,385
What?

108
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,765
- She's making Mario cry.
- My brother doesn't cry.

109
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,392
Dude, he's crying.

110
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Look at me.

111
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,149
What are you thinking in your head?

112
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,069
Nada. My brain is empty.

113
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,739
Do I really need some
stupid writing camp?

114
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,784
- I don't want to waste my summer.
- It's not a waste, it's badass.

115
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,370
Not everyone can get in,
even the kids who pay.

116
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,453
But...

117
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:31,914
you'll need this.

118
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,209
It's for writing your stories

119
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,711
and maybe an old-school letter
or two, for your favorite?

120
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,455
Here comes waterworks.

121
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,557
Were you guys spying on me?

122
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,356
- You okay, homie?
- Yes.

123
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,441
No.

124
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,609
I don't know.

125
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,323
Look at you.

126
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,285
On the verge of high
school. All the excitement.

127
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,368
All the firsts.

128
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,205
First parties, first football games,

129
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,790
first love.

130
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,960
- Want me to drop some knowledge?
- Not really.

131
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,463
High school, it's the foundation
for the rest of your life.

132
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,008
Any false starts could
lead to your own dead end.

133
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,760
Now sure, you guys are smart,
setting curves and all that,

134
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,262
but you still have to go hard,

135
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,556
'cause there's only one
chance at a first impression.

136
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,851
So, do you want to sit on the
sidelines or play in the game?

137
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,227
I just don't want to die.

138
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,104
- Is Mario high?
- Yes, he's high...

139
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,481
on life and memories...

140
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,775
and some seriously good indo.

141
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,614
What I was saying is work hard,

142
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,700
put your heart out there, even
if it's broken by some bitch

143
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,911
you've known since Mr. Estrada's
seventh grade social studies.

144
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,706
Anyway...

145
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,249
uh...

146
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,693
... what I was saying, and you
may want to write this down...

147
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:03,381
Don't go into high
school without back-up.

148
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,761
You guys need to stick
together to survive.

149
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,429
Got it?

150
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,559
I'm going to college, mofos!

151
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,478
Now, kiss my class ring.

152
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,195
- What the freak?
- Is he kidding me?

153
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,882
- That's why you don't smoke that stuff.
- Damn, I almost forgot.

154
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,700
One last thing: don't bone Monse.

155
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,915
Why would anyone want to do that?

156
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,883
Pretty Girl!

157
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,219
Tasty.

158
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,977
Ay, ay, ay! Mamacita!

159
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,271
Angelica!

160
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,024
Once I'm gone, I'm gone!

161
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,652
There's not gonna be a
Christmas break hookup!

162
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,489
You know why? 'Cause I'm gonna
be hooking up with other chicks!

163
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,241
White chicks!

164
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,289
I don't know why I'm
saying that! It's you!

165
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,207
Talk to me, boo!

166
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,710
Maybe she's not home.

167
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,380
Oh.

168
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,589
Hey, you!

169
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,222
How was, uh... camp?

170
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,808
Mmm, tolerable. Mildly life changing.

171
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,602
I can see that.

172
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,937
You can? How?

173
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,147
You just...

174
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,567
Look, I probably have to
go before traffic hits.

175
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,695
- No prob. Good luck at Cal.
- Thanks.

176
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,531
And you, keep an eye on Ruby?

177
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,784
Don't know what that
kid's gonna do without me.

178
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,537
Check me out, bitches!

179
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,540
I got my own room! My own room.

180
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,542
So, let's not trash it.

181
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,863
I don't wanna break my pimp
couch before it gets some play.

182
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,631
High school is an opp for reinvention.

183
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,468
So if I want to live a new
life, I got to be a new man.

184
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,927
It all starts with my kingdom.

185
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,056
- Royal reading?
- Ha.

186
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,058
No. It's a conversation piece.

187
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,852
And 2.99 at Ross.

188
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,689
Enough chitchat, let's feng shui.

189
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,649
- I'm back!
- Can you move that side table?

190
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,485
No, seriously don't make such a fuss.

191
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,968
I've only been gone all summer,
but really, it's no big deal.

192
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,655
- How was camp?
- Camp was fine.

193
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,199
Notice anything new?

194
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,366
You got boobs.

195
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,038
- You can wait for Cesar to help.
- Then we'll be waiting a really long time.

196
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,289
Why? Where's Cesar?

197
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,665
We're not talking to him.

198
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,478
- You in a fight?
- It wasn't really a fight. More like...

199
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,961
We're not getting into it.

200
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,089
Trust us, Cesar's not cool.

201
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,509
Well, I'm not cool being not cool.
And why aren't you at football?

202
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,553
We should really get to orientation
before those lines get too long.

203
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,680
Yeah, I don't want to
be too sweaty for my ID.

204
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,391
Like Mario said, "It's all about
the right first impression."

205
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,601
And sticking together!

206
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,812
You're deflecting
this whole Cesar sitch.

207
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,480
Stop being bitches and tell me.

208
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,482
What happened with Cesar?

209
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,444
This silent treatment will only
last so long. I will break you.

210
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,608
Come on. There's no way
Cesar did anything on purpose

211
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:14,614
to destroy our crew.

212
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,134
- He's the glue of our crew.
- That was then, and this is now.

213
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,535
Yeah, Cesar ain't shit.

214
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,247
Shit, Prophets.

215
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,130
- Be cool.
- Ditch your colors.

216
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,922
Damn it. Did I just jack my do?

217
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,466
Yeah.

218
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,678
Code dread. Code dread.

219
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,054
Approaching on your six.

220
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,858
Yo! You guys going to orientation?

221
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,351
Hey, you know my cousin
Berto, the fine one, hey?

222
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,954
His daughter Letty
said it ain't nothing,

223
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,455
unless you're stupid and
can't spell your name.

224
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,815
And then you hold up the
line and then people get mad.

225
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,460
Hey, why are you guys walking so fast?

226
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:52,193
You know I can't keep up. I have asthma.

227
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,905
Sorry, Jasmine, we're having a
private convo. Real sensitive stuff.

228
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:56,989
Catch you next time.

229
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,870
That's what you always say.

230
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,266
Man, she is relentless.

231
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,268
- Nice save.
- Oh, you're not safe.

232
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,510
Your threats aren't penetrating, okay?

233
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:28,646
I'm not telling you what Cesar said.

234
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,440
Ah ha! So, he said something!

235
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,609
Jamal! Do you need a muzzle?

236
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,863
Monse, no offense, but
you're a loose cannon.

237
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,746
We're not telling you
for your own protection.

238
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,368
- My own protection? Eat a dick.
- Case in point.

239
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,413
You don't even know, and you're
already at Defcon Solange.

240
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,168
Don't look. Keep walking.

241
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,011
Why would anyone want to
get jumped into 19th Street?

242
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,889
If it were me, I'd join First
Street, only one second of pain.

243
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,808
Agreed. And who wants a lifetime
of commitment at our age?

244
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:06,952
Apparently, neither of you.

245
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,063
Lack of commitment seems to be a
noticeable trend in this friendship.

246
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,856
As does lack of personal space!

247
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,700
- We can't tell you what Cesar said.
- Fine. Then I'll ask myself.

248
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,578
Hey, you crazy?

249
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,252
I just wanted to let Cesar
know I was back in town.

250
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,838
- And looking like a fine ass hyna.
- An Underaged hyna.

251
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:36,922
Not for some.

252
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,511
It's all good. You just look
a little different. What is it?

253
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:42,971
My boobs.

254
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,307
Nah, you got your braces off.

255
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,235
When did Oscar get out?

256
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,569
Six weeks ago.

257
00:12:58,653 --> 00:12:59,821
Now it makes sense.

258
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,240
Whatever Cesar said, he
said to impress Oscar.

259
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,993
- Cesar's terrified of his brother.
- Along with everyone else.

260
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,829
- Then who cares what he said.
- Oh, just drop it.

261
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:11,207
- Do I look like I can just drop it?
- Actually, you do. You just won't.

262
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,333
Tax time, bitches!

263
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,751
Shit, Latrelle.

264
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,795
Hands up, money out.

265
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,015
How can we take money
out with our hands up?

266
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,383
I know you bookheads got
that back-to-school gwop.

267
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,718
It's orientation day.

268
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,374
So technically, we're
neither back to school

269
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,641
nor out of school. We're...

270
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,347
We don't have any money.

271
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,390
What about that 20?

272
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,278
At least you finally got your own room.

273
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,533
What do you mean I
don't have my own room?

274
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,243
It's only been four hours.

275
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,096
Abuelita's room is flooded
from the broken washer.

276
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,706
She's gonna have to sleep in
your room till we can dry it out.

277
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,166
Did you try renting a WetVac?

278
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,126
Papa thinks that there might be mold.

279
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,754
- So?
- So she can't sleep in there.

280
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,131
Ma, she grew up in an adobe hut.

281
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,382
She'll be fine.

282
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:05,178
Ruby, you've never had your own
room. Why do you need one now?

283
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,849
For stuff. Like... Like my brain.

284
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,685
I mean, there's scientific evidence
that the brain grows every day,

285
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,437
and my brain needs room.

286
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,897
A room to grow.

287
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,982
- Do you really wanna challenge science?
- Mmm.

288
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,817
Why can't she stay in the living room?

289
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,195
Grandma hasn't been back
to Mexico in a while.

290
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,447
Come on, Ma! I'm a man!

291
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,452
I can't share with Abuelita.

292
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,164
- What if I give you another option?
- Yes, please, anything. Bring it.

293
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,333
You can bunk with the twins!

294
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:43,508
Are you high?

295
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,719
I'm not gonna hash shit out.

296
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,429
To what end? Death?

297
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,972
Cesar might've joined the gang.

298
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,057
He's not stupid.

299
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,601
He's affiliated, yes,
because of his brother, but...

300
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:57,146
And his cousins, his
uncles, his dad, his grandpa.

301
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,232
- Even the gay one.
- I know. I know.

302
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,317
Wait. You knew about the gay one?

303
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,921
He goes by the name Bananas.
It's not that subtle.

304
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,572
No! I know Cesar's family's
been in that life forever.

305
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,241
But he'd never join a gang.

306
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,450
He's an outlier.

307
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,202
So whatever's going on, it's not that.

308
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,578
He's not the same.

309
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,457
- He dumped us.
- But I wasn't here, so it's not official.

310
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,168
If someone breaks up with
you over text, is it official?

311
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,837
- Yes.
- Then consider me the text.

312
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,672
Ding!

313
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,591
You've been dumped!
Wait, please don't go.

314
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:26,675
Please, you're...

315
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,636
- You're not safe.
- Why?

316
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,682
Because you've... blossomed.

317
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,100
- "Blossomed?"
- Popped.

318
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,436
Busted out. Puffed your party pillows.

319
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,080
Whatever you want to call
your new cha-cha-bingos.

320
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,857
These new homies he's
hanging with, they're thirsty.

321
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,361
Okay!

322
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,196
Don't worry, girl!

323
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:48,990
I got your back...

324
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,951
from right here.

325
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,749
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm listening.

326
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,295
Privately?

327
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,882
Yeah, we can go inside.

328
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,178
But if you wanna sit on my face,

329
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,805
you got to put that mouth on
pause so I can concentrate.

330
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,645
- Cesar is dead to me!
- Told ya.

331
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,023
He doesn't break up with us,
we're breaking up with him!

332
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,317
"Sit on my face"? Who says that?

333
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,612
Chairs who can talk! And buttholes!

334
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,323
I wouldn't put dumb crap like
that past Oscar, but Cesar?

335
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:32,909
What happened to him?

336
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,453
Cesar's gotta be hitting the pipe.

337
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,330
Right? Right.

338
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:38,748
Could be!

339
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,167
That was totally out of character.

340
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:44,754
What are you doing?

341
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,798
I'm getting into character.

342
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,011
Hey, Pops!

343
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,973
Say nothing and go with my flow.

344
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,099
Monse!

345
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,186
Welcome back, baby.

346
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,749
- You ready for the new year?
- Bound to be a lot of surprises.

347
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,193
- How was practice?
- Yeah, how was practice?

348
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,280
I don't know. Ask those D1
scouts who were all up on me.

349
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,991
That's my boy.

350
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,408
Ow.

351
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,911
Whoa.

352
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,224
Did you quit the team
and not tell your dad?

353
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,332
No.

354
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,710
Yes. Look, I suited up first
day, and I just wasn't feeling it.

355
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:25,836
Wasn't feeling it?

356
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,048
Yeah, I wasn't feeling
like breaking my neck.

357
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,135
Listen, everybody who knows me
knows I suck, except my pops.

358
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,815
And he keeps thinking
that I'm just gonna

359
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:36,973
wake up one day and be him, and...

360
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,683
I'm not him.

361
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,644
I just need to find the
right time to tell him.

362
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,980
How ironic that a guy
who can't keep a secret

363
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,541
is keeping the biggest
secret of his life.

364
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,903
- What?
- I'm gonna rat you out to your dad...

365
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,198
unless you drop the 411
about Cesar. What did he say?

366
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,075
- No.
- Yes! Mr. Turn...

367
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,828
Cesar said you let him hit
it before you left for camp.

368
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,562
So, what exactly was the context

369
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:14,135
when Cesar said he "hit it" with Monse?

370
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,471
He didn't say he "hit it." He
said he "smashed, really hard."

371
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,115
- But who cares about context?
- I care!

372
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,518
Dude, you can't keep one secret.

373
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,270
She was blackmailing me.

374
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,291
- I can't do this right now.
- Why are you whispering?

375
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,150
- Where are you?
- Hell.

376
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:35,323
Look, I'm dealing with some
jacked up, cracked up B.S. at home,

377
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,533
and I got to work it
out before school starts.

378
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,952
So, this Cesar sitch, it
just ain't top priority.

379
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,996
- Can we just meet up tomorrow?
-  Can't.

380
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,582
Got one last shift at my dad's
joint before summer's over.

381
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,835
Dude, there's no way I'm facing
the Inquisition all by myself.

382
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,421
Geez. Can't we just meet at the
joint at 5:00 and chop it up?

383
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,547
Fine.

384
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,847
God, you owe me a handy.

385
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,145
That's my 11th text. Ruby's
almost two hours late.

386
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,523
Chill. He said he'll be here,
so he'll be here. Trust me.

387
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,609
Said the guy who's
pretending to play football?

388
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,778
Maybe my pops won't notice.

389
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,615
Uh, somehow I don't
think that's possible.

390
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,827
Where the hell is Ruby?

391
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,580
Five more minutes, kid.

392
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,540
Abuelita, I have to go!

393
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,834
Five more minutes, kid.

394
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,420
That's what you've been
saying the last half an hour.

395
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,216
- Can I at least have my phone?
- Five more minutes, kid.

396
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,675
What's going on?

397
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,511
I think it's pretty obvious.

398
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,138
Great. So, walk me through the
moment Cesar said what he said.

399
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,224
- Don't worry about it.
- There you go again.

400
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,347
- There you go again what?
- Keeping things from me.

401
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,144
You gotta stop withholding, God damn it!

402
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,648
I'm sorry, ma'am.

403
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,317
It's okay. I watch Bravo.

404
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,696
Monse. Wait! Monse!

405
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,116
We need to go back inside.

406
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,743
What did Cesar exactly
say? And how did he say it?

407
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,537
I need context. Tone. I need to know.

408
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,498
You know what I know. What I
don't know is why he said it.

409
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,085
But he said it. We tried to get him
to take it back, but he wouldn't.

410
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,962
So what can we do? Drop it.

411
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,255
- I can't.
- Why?

412
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,132
I'm still figuring out if I hate him.

413
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,633
You heard what your brother said.

414
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,361
How are we gonna survive
high school without Cesar?

415
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,761
Mario's not some sage.

416
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,973
Don't take his words to
heart. They're just words.

417
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,059
If that's true then why should
we take Cesar's words to heart?

418
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,144
They're just words.

419
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,731
Sometimes it's not what
you say, but how you say it.

420
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,735
And Cesar said it like he meant
it. But things could be worse.

421
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,279
What's worse than losing a friend?

422
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,948
Entering high school with a rep.

423
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,744
You're smart enough to know that
a rumor could ruin your life.

424
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,747
But it's contained.

425
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,041
You're right. No one knows.

426
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,294
Hi!

427
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,588
Damn, Ruby.

428
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,842
I see you! I see you!
And I'm down with it.

429
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,303
I like the freaky, just like Monse.

430
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,324
- What are you talkin' about?
- You ain't gotta be shy with me, girl.

431
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,017
I know you and Cesar been gettin' it in.

432
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,353
No one knows? Really?

433
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,524
I officially hate the traitor,
and now I'm gonna kick his ass.

434
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,443
Monse! Monse!

435
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,528
Oh, my God!

436
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,662
You little bitch!

437
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,206
Ow.

438
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,334
Damn, that hyna's wild.
Must be a freak on all fours.

439
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,794
I fought for you. I had your back.

440
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,063
For what? For you to impress your
puto friends and humiliate me?

441
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,847
Tell your bitch to keep that bark down.

442
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,133
Hermanito, you better back
up before you get smacked up.

443
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,277
- Shut up, puto.
- Monse!

444
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,719
Hey, watch it now.

445
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:44,804
No! Monse.

446
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,112
- This is why we didn't wanna tell you!
- 'Cause you're going crazy!

447
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,145
Crazy? I'm crazy?

448
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,897
Calm down. Breathe.

449
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,315
Don't you patronize me!

450
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,317
I don't need you. Any of you.

451
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,878
I was trying to keep our crew together,

452
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,738
but since I'm the only one who
cares, you're all dead to me.

453
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,156
I'll survive on my own.

454
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,121
Jasonse or Monsmine?

455
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,499
Which one you think is the
better bestie power name?

456
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,836
Yo, where we gonna kick it
at lunch and between classes?

457
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,587
We gonna hit up the flags?

458
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,924
No, flags can kiss my juicy
nalga. Nothin' but skinny putas.

459
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,261
We are trying out for dance.

460
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,180
I ain't sups coordinated,
but I give really good face.

461
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,016
I just love that we're doing
this together. You feel me?

462
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,270
Monse? Hello?

463
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,814
Are you listening to me?

464
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,608
All we were trying to
do was be good friends...

465
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,360
and now we're not friends.

466
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,071
Yo, bitches be bonkers.

467
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,119
Breh! Breh! Breh! Breh!

468
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,579
We need like our own routine.

469
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,367
Like a sick one that only we know,

470
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:56,375
and we bust out at, like, at lunch...

471
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,920
or before school or at all
the parties we're gonna go to.

472
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,380
Yo, check it, can you do this?

473
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,089
Can you do that?

474
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,843
Don't worry, girl, I'm gonna teach you.

475
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,054
I'm gonna teach you.
I'm gonna teach you.

476
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,474
Soon, Monse, you gonna look like this.

477
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,435
This is gonna be you.

478
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,646
Hoo! You gonna learn today.

479
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,065
Watch that, watch it.

480
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,068
No, we're looking hard. This
is how you pull in the honeys.

481
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,947
No, we pull in the honeys by
finding the RollerWorld money.

482
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,741
This is lame. This ain't even real.

483
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,118
You know what's not
real? Is RollerWorld.

484
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,037
There's no money buried
in our neighborhood.

485
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,667
It is real. You just aren't a believer.

486
00:23:35,668 --> 00:23:37,374
You don't even believe in the Yeti.

487
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,835
Oh, my God.

488
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,798
Hey.

489
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,258
- Hey.
- Hey.

490
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:49,178
So... I'm cool if you're cool.

491
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,890
- I'm cool.
- I'm cool.

492
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:56,060
Cool. What's in the sacks?

493
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,603
- Forties.
- Gatorade.

494
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,814
I'll see you tomorrow?

495
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,991
Dad, I can't keep a secret for crap.

496
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,600
I'm not playing freshman football.
I don't even like football.

497
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,917
What do you mean not playing
and you don't like football?

498
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,002
I...

499
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,839
I don't like football...

500
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,551
because I love football!

501
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,055
And I'm playing varsity.

502
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,139
You serious?

503
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,393

Stop worrying.

515
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,217
It's my job to worry.

516
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,490
Especially since it's the first time

517
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:20,662
I'm leaving you alone without a sitter.

518
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:24,523
Dad, I'm good. And not hiring Mrs.
Ruiz will save us a lot of money.

519
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,525
- Don't you worry about that.
- I have to.

520
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,878
Saving money means you don't
have to go on long hauls as much,

521
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,156
which means you don't
have to leave as much,

522
00:25:30,157 --> 00:25:31,864
which means no more Mrs. Ruiz.

523
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,427
Remind me not to challenge you
in the future. You always win.

524
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,327
I'm inside now. Door is locked.

525
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,556
You saw it's double bolted.
You saw it's double chained.

526
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,332
So, get some rest and I'll
call you when I wake up, okay?

527
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,668
Okay. Love you, baby.

528
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:45,919
Love you, too.

529
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,600
What are you doing here?

530
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,226
- Get out!
- Hear me out, please.

531
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,937
I never meant to hurt you.

532
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,440
Then why did you say it?

533
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,653
We promised we weren't
gonna tell anybody.

534
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,530
Hey.

535
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,535
You were the one who said
that we should keep this thing,

536
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,787
our thing, on the low.

537
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,662
That it would create a rift
in the crew, and it did.

538
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,873
So why'd you do it?

539
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,834
Oscar.

540
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,753
I don't understand.

541
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,881
When he got out, he wanted to
get at you, so I claimed you.

542
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,381
To protect you.

543
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,097
You don't have to protect me.

544
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,225
Protect yourself. Leave.

545
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,727
- Get away from Oscar.
- You don't understand.

546
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,480
You're gonna go off and
be a famous writer someday.

547
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,209
Ruby's gonna follow his brother
and go to some fancy college.

548
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,693
Jamal, he'll figure
things out and get out.

549
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,737
But this life...

550
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:58,408
it's my destiny. My family crest
is and will always be a gang sign.

551
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,244
- It's too late.
- No, it's not.

552
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,038
- There are so many...
- You guys got me all twisted

553
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,791
all these years about a
future away from this place,

554
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,959
but it ain't gonna happen.

555
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,046
Man, this is all I got.

556
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,508
No, it's not.

557
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,168
You got jumped in.

558
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,453
- He's not coming with us.
- And why would you want him to?

559
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,203
Monse?

560
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,248
Monse!

561
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,586
See, bitches be bonkers.

562
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:06,203
I can't do this. I can't keep a secret.

563
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,331
It's gonna make me implode.
I don't know why anybody keeps secrets.

564
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,584
There's something I need to tell you.

565
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:15,837
.44!

566
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,007
Cesar.

567
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,867
What were you gonna say?

568
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,410
Cesar...

569
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,330
we need to save him.

570
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:40,001

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,048
Smoke bomb!

3
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,134
Is this foil?

4
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,036
Or a razor blade?

5
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,539
<i>Jamal Turner. Jamal Turner.</i>

6
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,558
<i>Please report to the office.</i>

7
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,110
I'm so sorry for your loss.

8
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,656
- Your grandma's picking you up outside.
- My grandma?

9
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,491
My grandma lives in Tennessee.

10
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,710
<i>Ven aquí.</i>

11
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,170
<i>Ahorita.</i>

12
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,889
Rose Westbrook.

13
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:26,395
Rose is Frankie's girlfriend.
The one I made the dress for.

14
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,830
She was the<i> negrita</i>
dancer on the<i> negrito</i>

15
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:31,716
dance show with the<i> negrito</i> choo choo.

16
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,593
What's a negrito dance show
and what's a negrito choo choo?

17
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,178
I'm not your secretary. Use the Google.

18
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,513
The... The what?

19
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,283
You ask too many<i> preguntas.</i>

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,703
Now it's time for you
to find the answers.

21
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,354
<i>Váyase.</i>

22
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,297
Answers to what?

23
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:58,260
RollerWorld. You're
gonna find the money.

24
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,179
Oh.

25
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,355
Damn it. Now I got to walk back.

26
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,848
Ah!

27
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,726
She danced on<i> Soul Train.</i>
That's what choo choo means.

28
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,287
Eighty-six the chitchat and focus.

29
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,815
This is gonna be our best shut-in ever.
But we have to follow protocol.

30
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,859
- Dude, we know the drill.
- This year's different.

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,653
It's not about our survival.

32
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,405
It's about Olivia.
There was magic in our first dance.

33
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,865
You guys ever been to Brentwood?

34
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,094
My parents are out
so I set up touch control LED lighting.

35
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,704
Bordello Red.

36
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,009
And<i> Nightmare on Elm
Street</i> is gonna get

37
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,459
Olivia a little scared
and a little lappy.

38
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,878
- You know that's creepy, right?
- One step ahead of you.

39
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,922
- Little cover in case of wood.
- Speaking of wood.

40
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,757
Brentwood sounds kind of fun.

41
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,926
- Where's Cesar sitting?
- In Oscar's Impala.

42
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,178
- He's not coming? Why? It's tradition.
- Who cares?

43
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,807
- I have the perfect one to one P/V ratio.
- P/V ratio?

44
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,660
Olivia and me. And Jamal and you.

45
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,121
- Never ever put my V with Jamal's P.
- Duly noted.

46
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,523
Shut-in!

47
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,234
- But I thought you were with Oscar.
- Good to see you too.

48
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,128
No, it's fine. It's just...

49
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,672
Take a seat. Any seat.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,634
Not the love seat.
And don't block my scented candle.

51
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,390
What do you think?

52
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,085
- That looks nice.
- So, when are we going out?

53
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,629
Never. Trick-or-treating
in Freeridge is a no-go.

54
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,381
Why?

55
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,525
You might wanna sit down.

56
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,360
I'll be brief.

57
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,221
In 2012, Prophets rolled up on us.

58
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,265
Glocks to our heads
and snatched our bags.

59
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,702
2013 we were kissing pavement all night.
Caught in a drive-by.

60
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,397
That night, we lost our candy
and perhaps our innocence.

61
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,314
Can we talk?

62
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,941
- Here the trick-or-treat threat level...
- I'm good.

63
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,693
- ...is always red.
- That blows.

64
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,736
So we're stuck inside?

65
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,879
Brentwood.

66
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,991
Why haven't you returned
any calls or texts?

67
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,553
Been busy. You know,
tagging, jacking, banging.

68
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,245
Even ran a yellow light.

69
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,081
- You're still mad over my "safe" comment?
- Not safe.

70
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,417
Seriously? I said what I said
and had to say it

71
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,252
because if I didn't it,
I'd have to say more,

72
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,588
and saying more
is not what I should've said.

73
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,965
You're being overly sensitive.
Want me to apologize?

74
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,945
I want you to want to apologize, but
you'd have to have feelings for that.

75
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,806
Scary movies, artisan pizza,

76
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,559
and most of all, new experiences.

77
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,519
You're right. We should go out.

78
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,147
I'm feeling like this could be
our last Halloween trick-or-treating.

79
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,525
And frankly, it's feeling
a little cramped in here. You feel me?

80
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,111
I vote for Brentwood. It's safe, rich,

81
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,113
and I bet they've got
full-size candy bars.

82
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,450
Shut-ins are tradition.
And I ordered the pizza.

83
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,611
Did I mention it's artisanal?

84
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,120
- Why can't we go somewhere else?
- Brentwood.

85
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,790
- There's gotta be other places.
- Brentwood.

86
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,166
- How about Brentwood?
- I'm down.

87
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,877
- Good call, Olivia.
- It's a bad call. It's a great idea.

88
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,297
It's just Brentwood's super far and
we would have to take public transpo,

89
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,591
- which sucks.
- You've never been on the train.

90
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,802
Sorry, guys, but I don't know
how we'd even get there.

91
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,803
All good.

92
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,240
I got us a hook-up.

93
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,381
Easy. That's my bad arm.

94
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,084
<i>Buena suerte.</i>

95
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,988
We don't need luck. It's Brentwood.
Nothing bad happens here.

96
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,907
How about OJ? No offense, Jamal.

97
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,718
Oh, I'm good. We don't claim him.

98
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,472
- So, we should be ready around 10:00.
- Good for you, but I have plans.

99
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,815
We are not in Freeridge anymore.

100
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,485
- <i>In 800 feet, you have arrived.</i>
- No.

101
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,280
We've got lots of ground to cover, so...

102
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,281
to maximize candy efficiency, let's

103
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,225
divide and conquer,
then split our booty.

104
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:55,497
Great idea. Olivia and I will go this
way. Meet back here around 10:00?

105
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:56,873
Later.

106
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,168
- Jamal!
- Jamal!

107
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,820
On second thought,
I'll go with Ruby and Olivia.

108
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,030
On third thought, you should go
with Jamal and Monse.

109
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,633
On fourth thought, we're good.

110
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,618
Come on.

111
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,913
<i>This is really getting old.</i>

112
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,332
We're skipping all the big houses
with crazy decorations

113
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,959
and you want to hit up... Tootsie Rolls.

114
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,899
What are you doing?
Buckets equal self-service.

115
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,319
Trick-or-treat!

116
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,240
Baby, bucket equals self-service.

117
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,101
- Happy Halloween.
- Oh, my God!

118
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,605
- Did you... Did you dance on<i> Soul Train?</i>
- What do you know about<i> Soul Train?</i>

119
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,792
It was only the dopest dance show ever.

120
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,920
I mean, my mama loved it.
My mama's mama loved it.

121
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,905
And that dance line was the bomb.

122
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,283
I invented the dance line.

123
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,453
Wow, that's so cool!
But we really should get going.

124
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,347
A legend like you...

125
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,683
- I bet you've got stories for days.
- Well...

126
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,211
- Damn! Is that a gold record?
- Mm-hmm.

127
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:05,215
Would it be too much
if I asked for a selfie in front of it?

128
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,134
You know, for my mama's mama.

129
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,304
Well, we can't keep
your mama's mama hanging.

130
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,366
Come on.

131
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,418
Dude, let the little kids go first.

132
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,112
Cesar tends to be one-track.

133
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,948
You know, loses sight of others.

134
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,783
Me? I'm a gentleman.

135
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,886
I prefer to give before I receive.

136
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,514
Hold on, still one more little one.

137
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,271
So cute.

138
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,635
And now what you're looking at

139
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,596
is the first dancer
to have a number one hit.

140
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,139
That's dope, Rose.

141
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,725
Actually, it's pronounced Ro-say.

142
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,060
Oh.

143
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,770
- After your favorite wine?
- No.

144
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:03,023
After this other bitch named Rose
started dancing on the<i> Train.</i>

145
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,585
Oh, I'm blowing up.

146
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,176
So, what was Don Cornelius like?

147
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,805
Child, rest his soul.
The man was handsy.

148
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,432
Couldn't keep his
fingers off this jelly.

149
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,625
Is that why you left the<i> Train</i>
for<i> Solid Gold?</i>

150
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,271
Oh, no, baby. I left for the green.
Plus my moves ain't free.

151
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,048
And I was tired of living
in a sugar shack.

152
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,591
So you bought that
place in Sherman Oaks.

153
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,693
Yeah, I...

154
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,154
How did you know?

155
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,808
Where else would
a lady baller like you live?

156
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,228
I read that it was like
the Paris of the Valley back in the day.

157
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,789
So how'd you get started? Dance school?

158
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,858
No, more like dance parties.

159
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:50,463
Or any place they played music,
like the Florentine Gardens, Osko's...

160
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,490
- Oh, RollerWorld.
- RollerWorld?

161
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,759
Yeah, you know it?

162
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,720
I've heard about it once or twice.

163
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,122
Oh!

164
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,041
Time's up. My chili's ready.

165
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,418
Our time's up too. We need to go.

166
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,481
Baby. Baby, hold up. I'll be right back.

167
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,470
RollerWorld?

168
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,031
That's why we came to Brentwood?
So you could<i> Dateline</i> this shit?

169
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,683
Jamal, we're leaving now
or I'm gonna kill you.

170
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,245
That's exactly what I was thinking.

171
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,169
Ruby, isn't it nice not to have
to look over your shoulder for once?

172
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,238
Damn. We forgot Ruby. Where's Ruby?

173
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,716
Back here, asshole.

174
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,385
Uh... Give me a sec.

175
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,539
- What's your problem?
- What's my problem?

176
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,749
What's your problem?

177
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,050
You just confused me
with a nine-year-old,

178
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:47,961
who admittedly is big for her age.

179
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,296
And what's with the cock-blocking?

180
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,465
I W-4'd Olivia.

181
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,343
As in I claimed her. And I'm working
on getting my first kiss tonight,

182
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,844
and don't need you to do that thing.

183
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,137
- What thing?
- That thing.

184
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,390
I mean, that thing you do
with your face...

185
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,517
when you say words...

186
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,684
with your mouth.

187
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,854
Don't be you!
This was supposed to be my night.

188
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,607
- I had the perfect P/V ratio.
- The what?

189
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,734
Penis to vagina ratio.

190
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,570
Calm down. I'm not into Olivia, okay?

191
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,757
Then quit working against me
and talk me up.

192
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,842
Hey, everything cool?

193
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,953
Most def. Hey, did you know
Ruby crushes one-arm push-ups?

194
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,055
Show her, Ruby.

195
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,391
You know what would be crazy cool?

196
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,602
If we crashed that party.

197
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,714
I don't know. They look like
they're at capacity.

198
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,692
We don't wanna create a fire hazard.

199
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,820
- Will you excuse us again?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,394
If you don't want me to be me,
you need to not be you.

201
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,770
Me? What's wrong with me?

202
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,730
"I don't know.
They look like they're at capacity,

203
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,399
and we don't wanna
create a fire hazard."

204
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,192
She just said
she wants to go to the party.

205
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,713
For once, be Outside Ruben
and take her to the party.

206
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,508
Come on.

207
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,844
New plan. Let's tear that party up!

208
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,680
Yes.

209
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,517
Are you casing my place?

210
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,086
You think I'm a fool?
I saw you taking pictures.

211
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,898
And you're asking way
too many questions.

212
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,028
You better come correct, boy.

213
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,282
Don't look at me.
If I had a gun, I'd shoot you myself.

214
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,394
Is the RollerWorld heist real?

215
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,622
Are the rumors true?
Is there still money out there?

216
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,668
You want the skinny on RollerWorld?

217
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,363
What's in it for me?

218
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,009
Everyone here's so friendly.

219
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,428
I told someone I was from Freeridge
and got major props.

220
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,429
Hood must be trending.

221
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,907
Here are some napkins and lemon wedges.

222
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,226
You're so thoughtful
and always such a gentleman.

223
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,146
Gentleman, scholar,
and a damn good swimmer too.

224
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,067
Excuse me, it's time
for my adventure to find the bathroom

225
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,919
and wait in a long line.

226
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,783
Okay, so thanks for propping me up.

227
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,762
Just a small note,
the swimmer comment was a little much.

228
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,498
Great intent, but a bit of a stretch.
Think grounded.

229
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,083
Point taken, Mr. Gentleman.

230
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,709
Ah, I know, right?

231
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,837
Looks like this gentleman
is gonna get his throat tickled.

232
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,130
Wrong euphemism, dude.

233
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,466
Um... Who amongst us
aced Gifted English?

234
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,926
It's "among."

235
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,196
Among, amongst.
One's a variant of the other.

236
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,848
Oh, no, I totally zoned out
on Jamal and Monse.

237
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,933
Send them our location.

238
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,186
You sure? You know how Monse is.
She'll start problems with her mouth.

239
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,956
No, not tonight.
We're like rock stars here.

240
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,441
- Yo, Amy!
- What's up, Ruby?

241
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,172
Is this enough?

242
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:07,220
Ooh, perfect. Now, come show
these wine glasses some love.

243
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,664
How we doing on the cheese?
I need you to grate all that.

244
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,101
I got the whole block
coming for my chili.

245
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,586
Damn, I haven't seen
these boys in years.

246
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,504
Mm.

247
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,731
Who's that playa?

248
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,883
- Is he wearing a fishnet crop top?
- Okay.

249
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,153
Yes.

250
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,013
That's Frankie.

251
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,764
Fine as hell.

252
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,325
But dumb as dirt, hear?

253
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,476
That's why him and Benito...

254
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,979
Now, Benito's the one
with the flavor saver...

255
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,148
That's why they got pinched
for RollerWorld.

256
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,734
You don't go flashing green
when the blue is onto you.

257
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,212
And they loved flashing the green.

258
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,698
Even leased me a Trans Am,
which unfortunately, was yellow.

259
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,135
So, he spent all the money?

260
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,637
Far as I know,
there wasn't that much to spend.

261
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,515
So, there could be more.

262
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,228
- Who's that other guy?
- This one is Lil' Ricky.

263
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,547
Was he part of the heist too?

264
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,966
No. He was too smart for that.

265
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,696
But if he was into it,
he was way too smart to get busted.

266
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,991
They were all so tight.

267
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,536
They started the Freeridge Santos.

268
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,688
You dated a Santo? What was that like?

269
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,749
- Isn't that a little personal?
- Said the stalker.

270
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,777
I don't mind.

271
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,005
Come on over here, baby. Have a seat.

272
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,865
Get the lady a drink, Jamal.

273
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,718
Yeah, Jamal. This lady's thirsty.

274
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,622
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

275
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,166
Oh, honey, you can ask me anything.

276
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,961
Did you ever feel unsafe
dating someone in The Life?

277
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,355
No, baby.

278
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,108
Frankie kept me out of all that stuff,

279
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,527
'cause that's what a real man does.

280
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,322
Frankie.

281
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,118
He was the love of my life.

282
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,562
But he couldn't escape who he was.
He was a Santo.

283
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,149
And if you're gonna
be with a Santo, then

284
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,526
you gotta take the good with the bad.

285
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,027
And appreciate what you got,

286
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,965
'- cause it can be gone...
- ...just like that.

287
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,012
When Frankie got locked up,

288
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,872
Lil' Ricky made sure I got this.

289
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,543
This was Frankie's high school
championship ring.

290
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:23,147
Proudest moment in their life
was winning that football game.

291
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,757
Wait, is this all fall down?

292
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,693
All fall down, baby!

293
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,445
We still do that.

294
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,781
So, RollerWorld...

295
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:36,118
Let's just say there was a third person
and it was Lil' Ricky...

296
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,522
Baby, are you still on that?
I told you he wasn't involved.

297
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:44,168
Listen, Lil' Ricky was
on a higher plane. Hear?

298
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:49,423
He was the one that took the Santos
from street hustlers to major players.

299
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,367
- You need a lot of money to do that.
- It was the '80s.

300
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,638
- All you needed was a short stack.
- So maybe someone kept the rest.

301
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,498
Anything's possible.

302
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:05,714
- You two were the cutest couple.
- Mm-hmm. You got that right.

303
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,485
It ain't gonna refill itself, sweetie.

304
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,060
What's taking Olivia so long?

305
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,496
She's dropping a deuce.

306
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:21,897
Everybody poops.

307
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,484
- What's wrong with you?
- What's up,<i> locos?</i>

308
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,378
I heard you're from the 'ridge too.

309
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,672
Yo, check it.

310
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,241
Ah! Just clowning!

311
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,846
Yeah, I'm straight from B-Wood.
Westside!

312
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,683
So, what do you think of my fits?
And my tat?

313
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,143
It's pretty dope, right?

314
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,188
Moms works in hair and makeup.

315
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:52,278
I mean, it's like life imitating art
and art imitating life, right?

316
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,139
- Hey.
- Hey.

317
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,558
- Where'd you get that?
- From the fridge.

318
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,143
That's my mom's pressed juice.

319
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,853
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- She's on a cleanse.

320
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,230
She knows exactly
how many bottles there are.

321
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,399
I had no idea. I just wanted a drink
and I just assumed...

322
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,586
What? That you could just go in
and take it?

323
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,715
There are drinks everywhere.
There's a whole bin of soda right there.

324
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,742
- Why were you in the fridge?
- I was thirsty.

325
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,619
It's just juice. It's not a big deal.

326
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,121
Don't tell me what's
not a big deal, okay?

327
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,791
Do people go in your house,
take stuff out of your fridge?

328
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,851
Yeah.

329
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,503
What the hell is wrong with you people?

330
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,463
- You people?
- Hey, just let it go.

331
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,192
- Don't you have any respect?
- Respect?

332
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,320
- Says the white boy dressed like a<i> cholo.</i>
- Excuse me?

333
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:39,266
You sure you can't stay for the party?
You barely even sampled the goods.

334
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,851
Thanks, Rosé, but we really should
meet up with our friends.

335
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,120
All right.

336
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,273
You be good, hear?

337
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,274
Come here.

338
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,067
Mmm.

339
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,338
Listen, give your guy a chance.

340
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,383
- What guy?
- The one you're in love with.

341
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,804
You'll regret it if you don't. Okay?

342
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,834
Julia! Hey, girl. I'm
so glad you made it.

343
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,502
And who do you have with you?

344
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,397
Hope you made enough. We're hungry.

345
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,357
- Come on.
- Come on, babies.

346
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,318
Look at you. I love your costume.

347
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,511
- Come on.
- We got Tootsie Rolls.

348
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,780
I made chili.

349
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,224
Excuse me? Excuse me?

350
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,559
Hey, we don't want any problems.

351
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,246
Exactly. You know, I got her.
Let me pay for the juice.

352
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,775
Okay. Okay, it's 52 dollars a bottle,

353
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,403
and then another 20 each
for all the food and drinks you had.

354
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,156
- We don't have that kind of money on us.
- Of course you don't.

355
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,034
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I'm just stating the obvious.

356
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,243
Now you're just being a dick.

357
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,995
Oh.

358
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,848
Dude, you better control your bitch.

359
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,876
- Dude, he thinks she's my bitch.
- You better apologize.

360
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,730
- No. He doesn't have to apologize.
- Exactly.

361
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,298
So, how are we gonna settle up?

362
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,400
Like this.

363
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,237
So, there was a third
guy at RollerWorld.

364
00:19:04,238 --> 00:19:05,727
Lil' Ricky. We need to find him.

365
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,563
Do you think it was little with
an apostrophe or little like Lil Wayne

366
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,565
or little like<i> Little Women?</i>

367
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,566
- Run!
- I don't know.

368
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,109
- Get out of here!
- Run!

369
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,110
- Run!
- Run?

370
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,129
- Why?
- Why?

371
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,155
Ah! Ah!

372
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,368
Run! Run!

373
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,204
Get out of here!
Back to where you came from!

374
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,723
Yeah! And don't come back.

375
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,254
You guys, this is all my fault.
I let that asshole get the best of me.

376
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,776
Don't apologize. We just got to
get home. Jamal, get a Lyft.

377
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,595
My dad said Lyft was
only for emergencies.

378
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:44,474
Seriously? What exactly
constitutes an emergency?

379
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,828
Don't get a Lyft. It's handled.
It's handled.

380
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,737
You want some more?

381
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,967
Oh, you think you're hard. Okay.

382
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,594
I'm not.

383
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,763
But he is.

384
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,087
This shit's real.

385
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,634
Please. What do you want?

386
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,642
I can't believe Monse went home!

387
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:55,003
Although she is covered in egg.
But she's missing out on our jackpot.

388
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,504
Hey, I'm gonna bounce.

389
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,505
Later.

390
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:02,027
Olivia, it's still early.
You up for<i> Nightmare on Elm Street?</i>

391
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,636
- Sure.
- Great.

392
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,797
Gonna take a quick shower
then we can get our scare on.

393
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,416
Cesar.

394
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,089
Thank you.

395
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,842
Good night.

396
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,870
Screw that kid. He was just
some rich asshole showing off.

397
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,580
He's not the problem.

398
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,682
No matter how hard I try,
I can't escape who I am.

399
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,247
Those kids in Brentwood,
they don't think

400
00:22:32,248 --> 00:22:33,810
we're people. They
think we're costumes.

401
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,687
And I played right into the stereotype.

402
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:39,500
You're being too hard on yourself.
You stood up for your friends.

403
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,192
For me.

404
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,671
You did the right thing.

405
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,090
It doesn't feel that way.

406
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,928
You did nothing wrong.

407
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,268
I'm sorry.

408
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,332
Hey.

409
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,087
You don't need to apologize.

410
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,340
Let's just, you know, hit reset.

411
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,552
Forget either one of us said anything.

412
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,139
And when you get a sec, call me.

413
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,437
I think I just saw my mom.

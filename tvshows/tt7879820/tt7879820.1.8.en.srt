00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,762
Charge nurse on duty to CCU.

3
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,948
Charge nurse on duty to CCU.

4
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,637
Hey, visiting hours haven't started yet.

5
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,263
It's okay. He can stay.

6
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:44,186
Someday I hope I'm lucky enough
to have someone like you by my side.

7
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,446
All right, asshole, spill it.
Tell me what this key opens.

8
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:01,578
You know, Julio's been talking to me
from the grave, and it ain't pretty.

9
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,374
Now wake up and get to talking, bitch!

10
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,615
Latrelle's roll-up on Cesar
is all over IG.

11
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,868
I'm really stressed. We've barely
talked in the last two days.

12
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,204
With all the Santos at his crib,
it's like a safe house.

13
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,623
As long as he lays low
and doesn't show, he's all good.

14
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,875
- I am all good.
- What are you doing here?

15
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,461
- Yeah, you shouldn't be here.
- I have a math test.

16
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,046
Cesar, you have a green light on you.

17
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,191
I'm Spooky's brother.
I have a green light every day.

18
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,843
- If something happens to you...
- I'm fine.

19
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,345
I'm gonna be in and out.
Just here for the test, okay?

20
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,222
So don't worry, worry about your quince.

21
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,950
Your dress is coming today, right?

22
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,077
Trust me, I'll be good.

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,898
I need a favor.
Take Olivia's mind off me today.

24
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,418
Get her to focus on her quince.

25
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,652
- We can do that.
- Go straight home after school.

26
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,570
The block is hot

27
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,405
- and I need you to stay safe.
- But what about you?

28
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,606
How do we make sure you're safe?

29
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,869
Uh, I got to go. Shit.

30
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,638
Tell Ms. Blanchard I'm
sick or something.

31
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,806
- You don't need to say it...
- I'm gonna say it.

32
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,047
What's wrong with you?
You can't be out here in the open.

33
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,353
I'm sorry, but I had a math test.

34
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,998
- This teacher will fail my ass...
- Goddamn math test?!

35
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,836
I told you to stay at the crib.

36
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,697
Use your head,
before someone puts a bullet in it.

37
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,841
I'm sorry, all right?

38
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,510
It sucks being stuck.

39
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,430
Just don't be so stupid.

40
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,353
So what should we do
about the situation?

41
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,027
I say we have some fun, Lil' Spooky.

42
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,821
I know Cesar doesn't want me to worry,
but I can't help it.

43
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,674
You don't have to rationalize it.
Getting rolled up on is no joke.

44
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,347
Cesar said you were there with him.
What exactly happened?

45
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,476
Monse, I can't stop thinking about you.

46
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,252
About us.

47
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:35,131
- I don't want to think about it.
- Shouldn't we do something? It's Cesar!

48
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,110
Hey, hey, no more Cesar talk.
My boy can handle himself.

49
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,847
Olivia, imagine everyone
is quietly waiting for you,

50
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,242
and then suddenly, you appear...

51
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,059
in this.

52
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,144
Oh.

53
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,311
I mean...

54
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,706
Oh! It's so...

55
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,735
Forget it. I can't even fake it.

56
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,361
- What am I gonna do?
- Nothing.

57
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,672
You will do nothing.

58
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,531
- I will fix this, princesa.
- How?

59
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,783
There's no time. And we don't have money
to get anything new.

60
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,076
This is such bad luck.

61
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,788
However, it's lucky that we're
such positive, resourceful people

62
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,832
who can find a solution to any problem.

63
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,060
I don't think so. This
is a real disaster.

64
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,628
I'm trying to help.

65
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,939
Go help in my bedroom.

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,469
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,387
It'll be okay. Maybe.

68
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,531
Go.

69
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,035
Don't worry. I got this.

70
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,497
- Talk to me. Is he awake?
- No.

71
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,041
Dude's still down,
but I think he's recovering.

72
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,376
I was singing "Beat It"
and his toes were twitching.

73
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,503
Why are you singing?

74
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,172
Studies show it's the second-best way
to wake someone from a coma.

75
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,853
- What's the first?
- You don't wanna know.

76
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,177
So, get this, the nurses gave me
Chivo's personal belongings.

77
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,054
Jamal, I don't wanna hear
about what kind of underwear...

78
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,014
Unfortunately, he
doesn't wear underwear.

79
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,768
- But I have the keys to his nursery.
- Why did they give you his stuff?

80
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:14,146
I told the nurses that I was his nephew
and they believed me.

81
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,731
I now understand how babies get swapped.

82
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,316
What time should I meet you
at the nursery?

83
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,234
Um...

84
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,337
Four hours from... never!

85
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,656
Your anxiety on top of my anxiety
is a heart attack waiting to happen.

86
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,075
- I'm not anxious.
- Says the Great Irritator.

87
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,159
- I'm gonna go now.
- Good.

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,387
Do that and please keep yourself busy.

89
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,323
I'll let you know what I find out
as soon as I find it.

90
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,548
Ma'am, I'm not getting anywhere with
you. I need to speak with your manager.

91
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,093
Yes, I realize
you're a small business, but...

92
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,596
Oh. Then can I speak to your mom?

93
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,557
Hello? Hello?

94
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,063
I don't think I'm doing anyone around
here any good, so I'm gonna bounce.

95
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,715
- That's really mature of you.
- Thank you.

96
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,009
And don't worry, Olivia,
you're gonna be fine.

97
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,570
And so is the other person
who I can't mention.

98
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,931
He's gonna be fine.

99
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,851
We don't need to worry about Cesar. What
we need to worry about is your dress.

100
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,854
Lucky for you,
we have 48 hours and I'm a fixer.

101
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,916
And a good fixer
always knows a better fixer.

102
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,377
The material is meh.

103
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,030
And the stitching, clearly a novice.

104
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,949
Me? I would've used organza.

105
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,868
Not that satin or taffeta.

106
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,722
And with your shape,
strapless is obvious.

107
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,748
- You're a four, right?
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,459
But what do I know?

109
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,296
I'm just a seamstress who's only made
a mere thousand dresses.

110
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,377
- That sounds perfect.
- Ah.

111
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,049
So you'll fix it?

112
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,092
- No.
- No?

113
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,321
You live with a woman who makes dresses,

114
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,658
and still you order one
from this Etsy vieja?

115
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,771
I'm no... How do you say? Side piece.

116
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:19,772
Hmm.

117
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,028
Eleven miles.

118
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,531
Might as well be 11 million. I can't
believe I never come to the beach.

119
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,553
I was out here three months ago.
The night I got out of Corcoran.

120
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,891
After four years in a six by eight,
I needed to see something big.

121
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,226
Open.

122
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,906
Still don't like onions?

123
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,077
Ever tried a shallot?

124
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,204
What's a shallot?

125
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,247
And you're supposed to be the smart one.

126
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,961
A shallot, my genius brother,

127
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,838
is a type of onion.

128
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,133
A botanical variety of the species
Allium cepa.

129
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:13,659
Who are you?

130
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,100
Spelling bee champ, seventh and
eighth grade. That's who I am.

131
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,956
Shit, if I wasn't
looking after your ass,

132
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,874
I would've hit
that magnet school up in Pasadena.

133
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,353
- Now you're just messing with me.
- De veras, homes.

134
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,671
All my teachers wrote letters for me.

135
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,773
Even the principal.

136
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,733
Told mom I was gifted.

137
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,569
- So why didn't you go?
- And leave your little ass alone?

138
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,822
But Mom was around.

139
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,784
No, that wouldn't have been a good idea.

140
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,620
- What do you mean?
- Don't worry about it.

141
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,706
I'm not a kid anymore.

142
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,254
Mom wasn't always around.

143
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,174
When she was around...

144
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,968
she wasn't really around.

145
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,583
I never knew that.

146
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,685
Good.

147
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,520
Then I did my job.

148
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,529
I had plans to ace that magnet school,
then go to culinary school.

149
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,181
My brother, the chef.

150
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,062
Hey, you joke,
but that shit could've been real.

151
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:26,541
Okay, so use shallot in a sentence.

152
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,153
Give me all your shallots, biatch.

153
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,699
Guys, say hi to Laura.

154
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,617
Hi!

155
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,886
Hi.

156
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,122
That was Cooper and Hayden.

157
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,625
Feel free to entice them
away from their screens if you can.

158
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,335
If you can't, don't worry about it.

159
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,496
Just hang out and make sure
they don't kill each other.

160
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,381
Kitchen's over there.
Help yourself to anything.

161
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:55,010
I will be down the hall in my office
should there be any emergencies.

162
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,011
- You got it.
- Thanks.

163
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,306
I'm ...just trying to make a
deadline and I even barely even started.

164
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,849
Procrastinating is my hobby.

165
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,535
Me too. What are you writing?

166
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,622
It's a novel slash memoir.

167
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:10,359
Some super personal stuff that I find
hard to talk about let alone write.

168
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,362
I've been writing it for years
and I thought maybe moving back to LA

169
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,863
would help motivate me to finish, but...

170
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,323
Where did you move from?

171
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,700
New York.
Yeah, where are you from, Laura?

172
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,137
- Freeridge.
- Freeridge? Get out of here.

173
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,474
- Are you from Freeridge?
- No, but my neighbor Rosé is.

174
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,726
Is that where you know me from?

175
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,087
Yeah. We met once at
her Halloween party.

176
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,088
We did?

177
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,006
I'm sorry, I don't remember that.

178
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,093
But I... As a mother of two,
I'm a little scatterbrained.

179
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,154
You didn't tell me
where you're from. Where in LA?

180
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,157
- Not too far from here.
- Where?

181
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,685
You know, west side.
I should probably get back to work.

182
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,246
Make yourself at home, okay?

183
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,165
I can get used to this.

184
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,918
Good,
'cause I'm gonna move here someday.

185
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,338
I'm serious.

186
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,739
What? Are you gonna be
one of those crazy homeless dudes

187
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,076
at the Venice drum circle
with dreads and henna tats?

188
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,662
- Hey, I'll visit you in your box.
- Screw a box.

189
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,455
Gonna have a killer house, first of all.

190
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,558
And second, you're not visiting.

191
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,769
You're gonna live here with me.

192
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,606
Who says I want to
live in a beach house?

193
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,012
Yeah, I guess I could live
in a beach house.

194
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,782
But how are you gonna afford it?
This ain't Freeridge.

195
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,100
I'm gonna be an architect.

196
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,871
Design buildings, arenas,
and of course my own beach house.

197
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,001
Only now that I know you'll be
living with me, I'm thinking multi-use.

198
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,335
What's that mean?

199
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,173
It means your restaurant will be
downstairs and we'll live above it.

200
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,034
What kind of school you gotta go to
to be an architect?

201
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,453
A good one, but I got
it all planned out.

202
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,872
JC for a couple years to save the cash,

203
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,391
then transfer to UCLA.

204
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,729
It's a good plan.
How are you gonna afford it?

205
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,481
I'll figure it out.

206
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,567
Hey...

207
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,403
We'll figure it out.

208
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,166
Is this all you got?

209
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,919
You're my blood
and don't know how to bribe me?

210
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,005
- Qué lástima.
- Cookies?

211
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,257
It's the right direction.

212
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,301
I made a terrible mistake.

213
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,078
We knew how busy you are,
so we went with Etsy,

214
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,913
which was an even bigger mistake.

215
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,333
And now I realize
the mistakes of my trespasses,

216
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,919
and I said hundreds of Hail Marys.

217
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,674
We need you. Is there anything we can do
to get back into your good graces

218
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,278
and enlist your brilliant skills
to fix my awful dress?

219
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,447
Well...

220
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,700
There is something.

221
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,194
Put the phone down.

222
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,821
Cesar's fine. He's with Oscar.

223
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,632
Trust me,
no one's running up on that dude.

224
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,842
I'm putting the phone down.

225
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,138
- How are you doing down there?
- Has this woman never worn shoes?

226
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,916
Ugh.

227
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,376
- Is that...
- Yep.

228
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,752
It just fell off.

229
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,798
Here.

230
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,192
Hmm-mm.

231
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,510
Hmm-mm.

232
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,952
What?

233
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,329
I'm so glad you're here.

234
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,290
I'd be freaking out without you.

235
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,159
What?

236
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,219
He's safe.

237
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,763
And cute. Isn't he cute?

238
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,124
Yeah.

239
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,588
Do you want to do a project with me?

240
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,881
Yeah, what kind of project?

241
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,050
I was thinking
something really, really fun.

242
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,135
Are we gonna build a castle?

243
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,281
We're gonna build something even better.
It's called a family tree.

244
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,017
Come on. Family trees are awesome.

245
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,603
- We'll start with your mom's side.
- I'm hungry.

246
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,189
We can get a snack
right after we do this one side.

247
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,607
I'm hungry now.

248
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,251
Okay, we'll eat.

249
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,671
- What are you hungry for?
- Uvas.

250
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,405
¿Tú hablas español?

251
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,824
- Sí, un poco.
- ¿Quién te enseño?

252
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,326
I want to watch Trolls.

253
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,912
No. No, no, no, no. Who taught you how
to speak Spanish? Your Mom?

254
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,413
No, Dora.

255
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,498
Is that your grandma?

256
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,018
No! Dora the Explorer.

257
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,963
My grandma's up in heaven
with our kitties.

258
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,903
I'll get you some snacks.

259
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,559
- Hey.
- I changed my mind.

260
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,496
I need you to come down to the nursery.

261
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,957
This place is too creepy to scour solo.

262
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,860
- When can you get here?
- I can't. I'm babysitting.

263
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,737
What? At a time like this?

264
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,507
You told me to keep myself busy.

265
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,868
Fine. Then stay with me
in case something goes down.

266
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,629
What's gonna happen?
Chivo's in the hospital.

267
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,830
True.

268
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,124
- But I'm not alone.
- What are you talking about?

269
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,434
It's hard to explain.

270
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,104
Anyway, I've got Chivo's key, but...

271
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,565
I can't find anything.

272
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,623
Oh, my God.

273
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,209
I think I found the lock.

274
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,027
It works.

275
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:50,574
Okay. I'm opening Chivo's drawer.

276
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,011
Jamal? Jamal, are you okay?

277
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,555
Juanita.

278
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,460
That sick bastard held her captive.

279
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,254
- He knew where she was the whole time.
- Who held who captive?

280
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:07,883
Don't worry about it. You're better off
not knowing the sordid details.

281
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,902
- Just bear with me.
- I'm here.

282
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,870
RG. Ricky Galindo.

283
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,048
What the hell?

284
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,259
What is this?

285
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,554
Monse, I'm gonna call you back.

286
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:51,110
Twenty, seven, 42.

287
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,595
Laura!

288
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,430
Laura!

289
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,034
My mom's calling you.

290
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,662
Oh, right. Thanks.

291
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,941
- Hi.
- Hey, um...

292
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,109
Any chance you can watch the kids
a little bit longer?

293
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,212
I'm finally in a groove
and I don't want to stop.

294
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,882
- Sure.
- Oh, thank you so much.

295
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:16,326
So, in like 30 minutes-ish,
can you make them some dinner?

296
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,995
- I have chicken nuggets in the freezer.
- No problem.

297
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,222
Thank you so much.

298
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,267
Is that the Sacré-Coeur?

299
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,353
Good eye. Have you been to Paris?

300
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,397
No, but someday. What's it like?

301
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,317
Amazing. Inspiring.

302
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,237
I actually lived there for a year,
but sadly I haven't been back since.

303
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,556
- When were you there?
- 2004.

304
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,158
That's the year I was born.

305
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,118
Magical year for both of us.

306
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,232
Should we wake her up?

307
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,733
It's a delicate dance.

308
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,194
While we need her
to work on the dress ASAP,

309
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,235
the more she relaxes,
the more indebted she'll feel.

310
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,115
I think we let her sleep.

311
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:03,766
Gracias. I'm so relaxed.

312
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,961
Relaxation breeds creativity.

313
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,045
Mm.

314
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,382
This relaxation made me extra sleepy.

315
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,383
Bed time!

316
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,759
Wait.

317
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,804
The quince's in two days.

318
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,181
Shouldn't you be measuring her hips?
Or bust?

319
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,617
Buenas noches.

320
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,328
She just played us.

321
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,274
How did she know?

322
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,650
It's what I do!

323
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,975
The beach was pretty dope.

324
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,185
I'm glad we stayed for the sunset.

325
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,649
- We need more days like this.
- Yeah.

326
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,485
More time to hang out.

327
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,324
You know I'd do anything for you, right?

328
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,368
Yeah.

329
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,788
For real... anything.

330
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,232
I love you, mano.

331
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,921
Dude, are you crying?

332
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,342
Nah, fool. I got smoke in my eyes.

333
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,642
It's been hot out here.

334
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,187
I could get got.

335
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,356
You can get got.

336
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,233
Anybody can get got.

337
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,404
- If anything ever happened to you...
- Nothing's happening to me.

338
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,450
I know, Lil' Spooky.

339
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,370
That's why we're here.

340
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,916
We need to handle this.

341
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,465
Buenas noches.

342
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,782
Thank you, Laura.

343
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,951
We'd love to have you come visit.
Right, guys?

344
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,428
She was okay.

345
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,597
That's actually a glowing endorsement.

346
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,041
Well then, thank you, Hayden.

347
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,211
- And I'd be happy to sit again.
- Mama, read us a story.

348
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,631
One second. I just have to pay Laura
then put this back in my office.

349
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,442
Mama, now!

350
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:20,969
I can put that away for you.

351
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,388
- Story!
- Story! Story, story, story, story.

352
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,472
Okay. Okay. Okay.

353
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,851
Would you mind? I'll just read them
a quickie, and then we can settle up.

354
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,477
Thank you so much.

355
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,830
Okay, come on. Let's go.

356
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,302
What are you doing?

357
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,845
This lady isn't your mother.

358
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,657
"We all have a moment where we feel sad,

359
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,953
where the moon and the sun
are not to be had.

360
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,038
We look in the sky,

361
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,190
we look in the air,

362
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,941
we need our families,

363
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,502
but they are not there.

364
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,548
Alone, alone. Where can they be?

365
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,302
Alone, alone. Can someone help me?"

366
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:33,458
Okay, you guys read the next one
to yourselves. I'll be right back.

367
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:39,923
Are you okay?

368
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,238
Do you read to them every night?

369
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,158
I try.

370
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,996
I never had that.

371
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,541
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

372
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,988
No. I'm sorry.

373
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,366
It's just I have a lot of stuff going on

374
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,468
and I'm...

375
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,720
I'm not always this crazy.

376
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,972
Hey, you're not crazy.

377
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,059
Can I wash my face?

378
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,646
Of course. The bathroom's on the left.

379
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,856
Take your time.

380
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,096
Here you go.

381
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,282
Thank you.

382
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,452
That's too much.

383
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,164
But you came all this way
and you came on such a short notice.

384
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,150
- It's okay. Take it.
- But I...

385
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,252
I insist.

386
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,217
You saved me.

387
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,017
I went to school with Latrelle.

388
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,144
- We played Pop Warner together.
- And he still pulled a gun.

389
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,164
- But he didn't shoot.
- Next time he will.

390
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,459
This way there's no next time.

391
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:08,780
You've been playing me.
All that talk about my future was...

392
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:12,676
You wanna have more days like today?
This is how we do it.

393
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:16,180
Ain't no future
if you don't handle your present.

394
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,569
Listen to me,
you shoot until you empty the clip.

395
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,906
Don't freeze up, don't flinch,
don't second guess.

396
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,910
It's do or die time, hermano.

397
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,645
Wait. Hold up!

398
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,877
Punk ass got lucky.

399
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,445
Just for tonight.

400
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:52,966
You handle this tomorrow.

401
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:15,263
Twenty, seven, 42.

402
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,683
My best guess is that these three
numbers are a combo to a lock.

403
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,728
But where's the lock, baby girl?
Tell me.

404
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,956
Tell your J-Daddy.

405
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:27,042
I'm sorry. I'm tired. It's late.

406
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,862
Yeah, maybe we should go,
get some sleep and...

407
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,800
Or maybe we should stay.

408
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,566
- Do you think Cesar will like it?
- No.

409
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,384
He's gonna love it.

410
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:03,996
Are you okay?

411
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,846
Cesar, talk to me. What do you need?

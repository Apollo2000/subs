2
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,618
Hey.

3
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,371
My life is over.

4
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:05,916
Don't say that.

5
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,376
It's true.

6
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,629
I'm dead either way.

7
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,800
If I kill Latrelle, I'll be dead inside.

8
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,845
If I don't kill him...

9
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,765
I'll just be dead.

10
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,686
What if you disappear?

11
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,564
How?

12
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,108
With money.

13
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,443
A lot of money.

14
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,617
Twenty, seven, 42.

15
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:45,104
Twenty, seven, 42.

16
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,942
Twenty, seven, 42.

17
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,111
Do me right
and make my dreams come true.

18
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,348
You're heartless!

19
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,936
Come on, boo. You know I love you.

20
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,273
Those other boxes didn't mean a thing.

21
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,400
You're the real deal.

22
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,572
Am I interrupting something?

23
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,558
- Where've you been?
- I'm sorry.

24
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,977
I didn't see any of your messages
until this morning.

25
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,078
What's all this?

26
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,565
This is what Ricky left Chivo.

27
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,610
It holds the answers to RollerWorld.
I know it does.

28
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,696
That combo right there opened every box
and still nothing.

29
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:39,116
I've been searching all night
and nothing. Still nothing!

30
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,261
And there are dozens
of boxes left to go.

31
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,079
I think I have arthritis.

32
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,182
Would it be juvenile arthritis?

33
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,333
Am I still a juvenile?

34
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,434
Let me help you.

35
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,714
Woman, please! There's an order to this.

36
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,109
Bottom to top, left to right.

37
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,057
I hate you.

38
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,743
Let me see what you got.

39
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,413
What are you guys doing?
This is trespassing.

40
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:11,899
Um...

41
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,752
Is there anything you want to tell us?

42
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,419
About what?

43
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,029
That whole thing?

44
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,491
I was helping Olivia with a makeup test
for her quince when Jamal 911ed.

45
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,701
Right side's glamour, left side's chic.

46
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,888
Dude, I can't believe I'm saying this,
but...

47
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,206
you're beautiful!

48
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,416
Why is he here?

49
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:32,878
Because someone wasn't answering
my calls and texts.

50
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,507
My phone was dead and I'm here now
and that's all that matters.

51
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,384
I think the naysayer needs to go home.

52
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,655
I am not a naysayer.
And why do I need to go home?

53
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,764
- RollerWorld.
- I'm out of here.

54
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,450
RollerWorld is real!

55
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,938
So were the chupacabra bones
you found in sixth grade.

56
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,274
- It's the only way to save Cesar.
- Save Cesar?

57
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,109
Before he's forced to kill Latrelle.

58
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,337
Per usual, you're overreacting.

59
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,988
He's got a gun.

60
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,508
And he has to do it tonight
unless he disappears.

61
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,370
This is crazy. If he's got a gun,
then why don't we help him now?

62
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,830
Why can't he disappear now?

63
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,290
- To where?
- Anywhere.

64
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,666
That's not a plan.

65
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,102
This is the plan.

66
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,004
The guy who jacked RollerWorld
left this behind.

67
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,297
It's a clue to
where the money is.

68
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,382
- Ring around the Rosie?
- No!

69
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,759
The numbers up top.

70
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,719
They opened a combo,
then we found these numbers.

71
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,860
Now we have to figure out
what the new numbers mean.

72
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,724
This is ridiculous.
Do you hear yourselves?

73
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,017
Numbers leading to more numbers

74
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,269
leading to money
that definitely doesn't exist.

75
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,521
And if it did, somebody
would've found it by now.

76
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,500
Or not. It's our only chance
at saving Cesar.

77
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,693
I just put the numbers in my phone.

78
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,280
They're either lottery numbers
or extremely unique body measurements.

79
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,883
Well, only one is a prime number.

80
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,577
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. I'm just stating a fact.

81
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,096
I don't have a math degree.

82
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,556
Degrees!

83
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,225
These are coordinates.

84
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,724
- So what are we looking for?
- Anything and everything that jumps out.

85
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,934
Anything that marks the spot.

86
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,811
Maybe something
that could be from the '80s

87
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,413
after they pulled off the heist?

88
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,233
- I'll take the playground.
- I'll take the handball court.

89
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,003
And I'll babysit the bikes
and Google cheap bus tickets.

90
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,365
Sorry, I'm still not buying
into RollerWorld. You're all crazy.

91
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,718
And you look crazy.

92
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,054
Might want to wipe your face.

93
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,396
Sorry.

94
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,218
Ooh.

95
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,112
Mira. Hey, what's up?

96
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:57,998
I got a hit!

97
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,716
I'm just gonna wipe my prints off
and put this right back.

98
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,372
- I didn't find anything.
- Me either.

99
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,457
We might have enough
to get Cesar to Fresno.

100
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,376
- Then what? He lives on the streets?
- No.

101
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,378
The Central Valley produces
more than just meth.

102
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,463
Fresno's actually a bustling
agricultural community.

103
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,216
There's a plethora of
opportunity for him. See?

104
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,426
Wait. Get up.

105
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,261
No, I'm telling you,
Fresno's the answer.

106
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,930
If he doesn't want to pick fruit,
there's canning, curing, drying,

107
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,075
and the largest turkey farm...

108
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,913
That's it.

109
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,125
The game's afoot.

110
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,735
- Sherlock Holmes.
- Oh.

111
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,778
That makes total sense.

112
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,799
'Cause cholos love Sherlock Holmes,
homes.

113
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,095
Doy 823.8.

114
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,538
Doy 823.8.

115
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,041
Doy. Doy. Doy.

116
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,044
Doyle! Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

117
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,771
It's the Dewey decimal system.

118
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,942
I'm a survivalist.
Got to know your Deweys.

119
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,069
The library. Let's go!

120
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,962
Oh, great.

121
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,922
Oh, it's heavy.

122
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,593
Okay. All right.

123
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,060
I found the tip!

124
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,879
And the balls and the shaft.

125
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,549
- We don't have time for dick jokes.
- There's always time for dick jokes.

126
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,135
Cesar needs us. Stop dicking around.

127
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,280
You do know
that was another dick joke, right?

128
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,977
How do we know what we're searching for?

129
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,245
You'll know when you know.

130
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,616
Look at what I got here.

131
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,034
Okay, so we've
got four elements.

132
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,119
- What can we make with them?
- Uh...

133
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,220
A bomb.

134
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,331
To cause a distraction
to get Cesar the hell out of here.

135
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:05,019
Promethium, Phosphorus, Lanthium, Neon.

136
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,230
It's a compound.

137
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,424
Or it spells something out.

138
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,986
PM plane.

139
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,862
Night plane?

140
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,389
The Midnight Plane to Georgia.

141
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,909
- It's Midnight Train.
- And PM is noon, not midnight.

142
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,536
Midnight Plane to Georgia?

143
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,687
Your black card
should be revoked for that.

144
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,230
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

145
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,983
Halves cannot revoke
the black cards of wholes.

146
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,611
- Says who?
- All of me.

147
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,712
It's Pimp Lane.

148
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,214
It's Pimp Lane!

149
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,159
And only a local would know that.
Holy shit! This is real!

150
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,661
We got to go! We got to go!
It's Pimp Lane!

151
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,472
Oh, the game's afoot, bitches!

152
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,994
It's Olivia.
She's been blowing me up all day.

153
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:21,995
So, answer it.

154
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,082
And tell her what happened with Cesar?
No way I'm telling her about us.

155
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,477
Us? She's calling about Cesar.

156
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,380
Yeah. Right. You know what I mean.
I don't want her to worry. Here.

157
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,775
This is your phone.
I don't want in on this drama.

158
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,509
It's Olivia. Answer it.

159
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,511
Oh, hell no!

160
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,322
That's like giving Oxy to a junkie.

161
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,976
Hey! What's up?

162
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,395
Hey. I'm really worried about Cesar.

163
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,565
He's not picking up his phone.
I went by his house, he's not there.

164
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,025
- Is he with you?
- Me? No, why would he be with me?

165
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,963
I'm hanging with Ruby and Jamal.
Ruby is dying to talk to you.

166
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,947
Hey.

167
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:57,948
What's going on?

168
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,074
Uh...

169
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,535
We're working on a surprise
for your quince.

170
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,055
- Monse wants the phone back.
- No. I don't want it.

171
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,041
Yeah, it's a real elaborate surprise.

172
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,668
Lots of twists and turns.

173
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,878
Can I call you later?

174
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,256
Sure. If you see Cesar,
can you please tell him to call me?

175
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,340
Yeah, no prob.

176
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,175
I'll do that. Bye.

177
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,276
Bye.

178
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,748
What are you doing?

179
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,960
We're trying to figure out
if that's a boob or a butt.

180
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,378
A boob.

181
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,548
Can we get back to saving our friend?

182
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,346
Nothing.

183
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,433
There's nothing.

184
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,960
Except a lot of STDs.

185
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,063
That's why I didn't pull out
the black light.

186
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,149
We must have missed something.

187
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,134
So... you want the black light?

188
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,512
No, no. I'm talking about the elements.
We must've messed up the name.

189
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,847
It's not Pimp Lane.

190
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,575
But it's got to be Pimp Lane.

191
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,810
- Oh, I wouldn't sit there.
- Maybe we should go back to the library.

192
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,229
- It's closed.
- What do you mean it's closed?

193
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,731
As in not open. It's closed.

194
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,608
- Hey... it's a path!
- Why do you do this?

195
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,944
Every time I have an idea, if it
didn't come from you, you just go...

196
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,737
What do you want me to do?
Open the library?

197
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,573
You're insufferable. First you're
a non-believer, now you know everything?

198
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,786
Look, I'm right because I'm right.

199
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:26,887
Don't be a hater.

200
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,848
I found something!

201
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,009
That's a Santos cross.
But what does it say above it?

202
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,945
 "En las sombras Del tiempo."

203
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,989
In the shadows of time.

204
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,867
Yeah, but what's six, four, seven, nine?

205
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,352
It's a sundial.

206
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,038
Chivo said Lil' Ricky loved them.

207
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,582
What do we do with it? There's no sun.

208
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,692
Ha.

209
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,944
Watch and learn, my
crab-infested friends.

210
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,405
Okay, so first, we take out a pen.

211
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,240
Then we need a light to be the sun.

212
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,993
So, a sundial is like a clock.

213
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,745
So, if I position my light
over the numbers,

214
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,998
it'll cast a shadow onto the letter...

215
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,667
Enough! Just do it.

216
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,562
Okay, you need to learn this
in case of the apocalypse.

217
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,713
What?

218
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,192
I'm gonna follow the numbers
to get a letter. Here we go.

219
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,986
Six o'clock: P.

220
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,739
Four: O.

221
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,659
Seven: O.

222
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,953
Nine: L.

223
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,411
Pool.

224
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,248
The money's at the pool.

225
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,834
But where's a pool?

226
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,586
- The community pool!
- The community pool!

227
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,924
Lil' Ricky, you can suck it,
because nothing gets past us!

228
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,758
Our bikes!

229
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,974
What the hell?

230
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,335
Rookies? What, were you guys raised
in the 'burbs or something?

231
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,255
- Lock it or lose it.
- Read the room, Jamal.

232
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,066
How are we gonna get around now?

233
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,742
What are you doing at Pimp Lane?

234
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:12,809
Um...

235
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,936
How do you know about Pimp Lane?

236
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:19,024
Mijo, I wasn't always old.

237
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,086
I was once, what they
call, a sure thing.

238
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,031
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- Don't slut shame me.

239
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,325
Abuelita, we got to get
to the community pool.

240
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,369
- ¿Por qué?
- We'll tell you on the way.

241
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,470
Ah.

242
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,652
Look how fast those fools
are drinking that lean.

243
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,654
They'll be faded soon.

244
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,823
Then you strike.

245
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,617
Too many ojos.

246
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,120
So what? Who cares who's watching?

247
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,415
I do.

248
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,126
And so would Spooky. We sit tight.

249
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,027
All right.

250
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,920
Jamal, what are you doing?

251
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,921
Look out!

252
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,115
Jamal, why
are you soaking wet?

253
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,435
I don't want to talk about it.
What just happened ain't right.

254
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,728
What's not right is
there's no Santos Cross here.

255
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,355
Every clue had a cross on it.

256
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,399
Google says there's 19
more pools in Freeridge.

257
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,153
Okay, so Jamal, you change
into the clothes I have in the back

258
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,696
and we'll check all the pools.

259
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,823
No. I'm doomed.
We're doomed. Cesar's doomed.

260
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,284
I haven't slept in days.
Julio's dead, and poor Juanita.

261
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,221
We're not doomed if we solve this,
so stop being so dramatic.

262
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,748
- I am being dramatic.
- We know.

263
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,626
Like Nicolas Cage dramatic.

264
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,087
Odd reference, but yeah, so quit it.

265
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:08,401
I'm so dramatic that I tried out
for the local production of Rent.

266
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,344
- That was a rip off of La Bohème.
- Whatever.

267
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:16,200
My point is I tried out
at the Robert Pool Theater.

268
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,413
The P-O-O-L Theater.

269
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,335
- It's a pool in the title.
- Oh.

270
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,213
Out!

271
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,801
Out damned spot! Out, I say!

272
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,886
One, two.

273
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,331
Why, then, 'tis time to do 't.

274
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,267
Hell is murky!

275
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,919
Fie, my lord, fie!

276
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,588
- There's nothing here.
- Keep looking.

277
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,840
I think this might be a dead end too.

278
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,802
...we fear who knows it,
when none can call our power to account?

279
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,263
Yet who would have
thought the old man...

280
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,074
Hear ye, hear ye.

281
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,538
Hast thou observeth
a crucifix of yonder year?

282
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,292
Circa the year of our lord 1980?

283
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,252
What?

284
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,880
Have any of you seen a cross?

285
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:15,033
There's a cross in the wings that
we touch before each show for good luck.

286
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,677
Been there forever.

287
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,622
"Find your center."

288
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,207
This doesn't make any sense.

289
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,856
Okay, so we started at the park...

290
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,942
and then we went to the library...

291
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,111
and then we went to Pimp Lane...

292
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,763
and then finally we came here.

293
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,014
And get dick.

294
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,225
Technically that
happened at the library.

295
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,619
Ta-da!

296
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,941
What is this?

297
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,151
This is finding your center.

298
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,420
The park.

299
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,341
The library.

300
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,012
Pimp Lane.

301
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:03,932
And now...

302
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,129
here.

303
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,023
Four points.

304
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,861
It's a cross.

305
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,036
Huh?

306
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,148
Now I really don't know
what you're talking about.

307
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,583
That makes three of us.

308
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,670
Do you know what's
in the center of these four points?

309
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,993
A place with muchos Santos.

310
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,745
Oh.

311
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,233
Stop praying. It's time.

312
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,259
Still too many people.

313
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,653
They'll hear it for sure.

314
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,448
Nah. Not when you got this.

315
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,785
Fool been crushing the lean all night.

316
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,580
So when he goes to take a piss,

317
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,248
you make your move.

318
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,332
 God help me.

319
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,379
Are you praying for Cesar?

320
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,589
No.

321
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,717
For Sylvia.

322
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,660
Who's Sylvia?

323
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,012
Fernando's wife.

324
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,517
He poisoned her and her twin sister
after he woke up from his coma.

325
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,168
That's horrible.

326
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,438
She's talking about her telenovela.
Let's go.

327
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,527
Not here.

328
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,029
Not here.

329
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,405
It's not here.

330
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,925
Is it just me or is that baby Jesus
throwing a gang sign?

331
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,137
He's repping the Santos!

332
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,195
There's nothing here!

333
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,732
- Monse, help me with this.
- Okay.

334
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,001
Hey! Have some respect.

335
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,154
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

336
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,812
This isn't just an altar.

337
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,504
It's a magic box.

338
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,506
Like Ms. Uyeshiro's box.
Don't you remember her box?

339
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,009
Come on, man, grow up!

340
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,052
But don't you remember her box
in the fourth grade?

341
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,181
It was like this intriguing,
impenetrable cypher.

342
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,933
- Dude, we don't have time for that!
- Okay.

343
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,728
Oh, so we got time for dick jokes,
but not box jokes?

344
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,439
You heard that?

345
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,150
- You heard that?
- Yeah.

346
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,627
Hey, Jamal, help me.

347
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,964
Here! Here! Here! Lift it. Lift it.

348
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,100
Hey, Nah. Hey, I'm about to go piss.

349
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,814
It's time, Lil' Spooky.

350
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,271
I'm faded, man.

351
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,625
This lean is something serious.

352
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,205
What the what?

353
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,225
I told you it was real.
We just saved Cesar!

354
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,686
We just saved Cesar!

355
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,632
This is surreal. We need to memorialize
the moment and send it to Cesar.

356
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:23,733
Okay, right.

357
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,767
It's chocolate.

358
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,185
Hell, yeah, we got chocolate!

359
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,772
We can buy chocolate, vanilla,
that new Tesla with the gull wings.

360
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,708
No, the gold.

361
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,710
It's not gold, it's chocolate.

362
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,092
Maybe it's only chocolate on the top.

363
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,141
Chivo.

364
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,814
It's Cesar.

365
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,738
- Hey.
- I got no more time. What do you got?

366
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,724
Um...

367
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:13,825
Nothing.

368
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,579
I'm so sorry.

369
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,915
Cesar?

370
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:22,792
Cesar?

371
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,795
Cesar, say something.

372
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,720
Oh, my God.

373
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,847
Oh, my God.

374
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,125
You better pray he's okay.

375
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,560
We'll get the money,
and he'll be safe.

376
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:42,211
We could've had him
out of town by now!

377
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,797
This is just a mislead.

378
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,841
A red herring. A MacGuffin.
Tell her, Ruby.

379
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,093
I told you we should've
just put him on a bus.

380
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:53,056
He needs money to get away.
RollerWorld is that money.

381
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,515
- We just got to...
- Got to what?

382
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,476
You live in a fantasy. Grow up, Jamal.

383
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,121
You just ruined Cesar's life.
He's never gonna be the same.

384
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,192
I didn't ruin his life.
He ruined his own life.

385
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,569
Cesar's in a gang! Okay?

386
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,112
That's the reality, all right?

387
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,840
And you think I'm living in a fantasy?

388
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,284
You're the one who's living in a fantasy
thinking you can save Cesar.

389
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,079
It's not going to happen. Ever!

390
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,248
Cesar was born a Santo,
he's gonna die a Santo.

391
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,226
So stop lying to yourself, sweetie.

392
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,354
I'm lying to myself?

393
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,592
Your whole life is a lie.
Those fake-ass injuries.

394
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,695
Bullshitting your parents.
The football team.

395
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,806
You're the biggest, fakest liar ever.
I hope I never see you again.

396
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,100
- And you never will.
- Jamal, Monse, chill!

397
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,477
No! I'm sick and tired of chilling.

398
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,939
And I'm sick and tired of y'all
telling me that it's always my fault.

399
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,149
So you can miss me with that crap.

400
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,150
Get over here!

401
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,586
Hey, hey, hey. ¡No más!

402
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,264
I can't believe I got played.

403
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,227
There has to be a way.
RollerWorld has to be true.

404
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,105
Jamal, for what it's worth,

405
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,274
I believed it too.

406
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,738
But... some mysteries
aren't meant to be solved.

407
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:29,919
Abuelita...

408
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,593
tell Olivia...

409
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,555
I can't make her quince.

410
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,504
Come on. Please, man. Please.

411
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,715
Don't do this, man. Don't do this.

412
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,091
We went to school together.

413
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,694
And you still pulled a gun on me.

414
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:57,239
I didn't shoot, man. But I didn't shoot.

415
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,408
You should've.

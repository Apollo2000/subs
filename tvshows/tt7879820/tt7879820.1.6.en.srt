2
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,695
You kissed Olivia?

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,514
Damn.

4
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,574
Is it true?

5
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,228
- Yeah.
- You know they boning, right?

6
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,706
Wait. Is he the guy?

7
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,817
This isn't about me. It's about Ruby.
He's in love with Olivia.

8
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,611
- What...
- Can we just all take a moment

9
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,989
to appreciate the fact that, for once,
I was able to keep a secret.

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,300
You knew?

11
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:37,912
- Why would you sell me out like that?
- What do you mean, "Sell you out?"

12
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,372
And you? What type of friend are you?

13
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,707
- Jamal, it's always your fault.
- It's all about his trifling ass.

14
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,876
- What are you saying?
- Bitch, I got a brick in this bag.

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,086
You weren't even invited.

16
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,355
Y'all messed up!

17
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,318
We got business.

18
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,279
What about the lockdown?

19
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,764
It's done.

20
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,878
And y'all wanted to kill me.

21
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,922
Shame.

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,258
Bitch, that's my cue!

23
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,305
To think I made you
partner in my company.

24
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,478
God damn, that egg sandwich!

25
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,397
How the hell is this my fault?

26
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:33,884
They're always telling me to keep
my mouth shut, so I shut my mouth,

27
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,278
and now it's on me!

28
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,450
Baby, I just heard about the lockdown!

29
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,102
- A bomb went off.
- A bomb?

30
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,009
Yeah, but I wasn't the
one who dropped it.

31
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,731
It was a metaphorical bomb, but real.

32
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:47,648
Very real.

33
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,650
I'm still picking out
the emotional shrapnel,

34
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,921
and I... I will never, ever forget
the smell of that sulfur.

35
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,408
I think I might have PTSD.
People Telling Me Secrets Disorder.

36
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,785
- The "Me" is silent.
- But you're seeing okay?

37
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,662
Yeah. My eyes are fine.

38
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,790
In fact, for the first time,
my eyes are wide open.

39
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,001
I've never seen better
than I'm seeing today.

40
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,461
I'm woke AF.

41
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,023
- Don't be cussing in my house.
- Sorry, but the struggle is real.

42
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,925
You're 14. What struggle?

43
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,528
FIMS, Ma. FIMS!

44
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,848
Foot in Mouth Syndrome.
When I say something, I'm screwed.

45
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,350
When I don't say something, I'm screwed.

46
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,871
It's like no matter what I do, I can't
figure out how to unscrew myself.

47
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,540
Baby, you're looking
at the glass half-empty.

48
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,294
But you're seeing okay,
and your eyepatch is off.

49
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,045
That means you must be playing.

50
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,592
You're playing tomorrow?

51
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:39,950
Mom, no.

52
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,912
- Dwayne! Jamal is playing tomorrow!
- Mom.

53
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,223
- Dwayne!
- Damn it! I did it again.

54
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,151
Dude, we need to talk.

55
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,803
I have nothing to say, Judas.

56
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,642
Technically, Monse
sold you out, so she'd

57
00:03:00,643 --> 00:03:02,515
be Judas. I'm just the
keeper of secrets,

58
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,558
- like the Vatican.
- No wonder I feel violated.

59
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,427
Look, I need you. I may
have inadvertently

60
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:07,770
signed my own death warrant.

61
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:09,748
Pray tell?

62
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,649
I had a FIMS flare-up last night

63
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,193
and might've told my mom
I'm playing in the game today.

64
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,195
You told your mom
you're playing in the game?

65
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,072
The game that's getting us
into the playoffs?

66
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,492
- Wait, we made it to the playoffs?
- If we win. You didn't know?

67
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:26,539
Dude, it's not funny.
Look, I need your help.

68
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,915
I need you to talk to Coach

69
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,393
and convince him
to let me suit up and sit on the bench.

70
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,715
Hilarious. I know.

71
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,943
But you... you... you are the master.

72
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,302
You are the wizard of words.

73
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,805
You can take any bad situation
and make it better.

74
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,640
You... are... Ruben!

75
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:49,353
Yeah, you're right. I did get Cesar
promoted and I wasn't even trying.

76
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,123
I also got Ms. Castillo
a tax credit on her fake boobs.

77
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,959
- So, you'll do it?
- Hell no!

78
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,129
You got two options.

79
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:02,843
Either come clean to your folks
or come clean to your folks.

80
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,469
Karma's a bitch, dude.

81
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:13,603
So... the truth is...

82
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,815
I lied.

83
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,111
I've been lying for months now and...

84
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,780
I know I was wrong...

85
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,825
and you're probably disappointed in me.

86
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,370
But there it is.

87
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,624
I throw myself at your mercy.

88
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,820
Would it help if I told you I loved you?

89
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,821
No.

90
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,676
I don't even let the water boy
sit on my bench.

91
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,957
Did I miss something?
When were you guys cool with each other?

92
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,436
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah, we're cool.

93
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,172
Interesting.

94
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,108
Hmm.

95
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,849
- You chilly?
- Not really.

96
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,119
Just thought it might be cool
under all that shade.

97
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,892
Oh, I didn't know there was pie.

98
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,752
- Cesar took the last piece.
- Yeah.

99
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,980
Cesar can't keep his hands
off other people's pie.

100
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,364
Happy?

101
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,058
- I don't want your sloppy seconds.
- I barely touched it.

102
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,285
Liar.

103
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,913
I'm done. Turns out I've had my fill.

104
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,086
You should have it.
It might fill that big mouth.

105
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,326
Am I the pie?

106
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,099
- It's complicated. We're dysfunctional.
- Understatement.

107
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,559
Talk later?

108
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,649
Stay?

109
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,971
- Aren't you mad at me?
- Why would I be mad?

110
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,323
That's the trend around here.

111
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,225
All right, you're still new,
so spoiler alert...

112
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,898
Can you please break
down what's going on

113
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,151
'cause shit's getting real weird
and I need the Cliffs Notes?

114
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,360
Where do I begin?

115
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:48,407
So, it's like this:
our friends are like a family,

116
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,928
if your family was full of pedophiles.

117
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,161
So like, you love your kids,

118
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,331
and your kids have kids
and you love those kids.

119
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,791
And your kids love their kids,
but maybe a little too much

120
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,251
'cause someone's touching the kids.

121
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,961
And you know who's touching the kids.

122
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,505
And you can't say anything
because you love them and they love you.

123
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,132
And it's all messed up
and always your fault.

124
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,426
And you never get any of the love.

125
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,970
Which is probs okay,
'cause you don't want to be diddled.

126
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,115
And this is a terrible metaphor.

127
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,062
Jamal, do you need help?

128
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:21,041
Yes! But not in that way.

129
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,234
Sorry. I'm only going off the rails
today 'cause I have to play football.

130
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,779
- I didn't even know you were on the team!
- Hence my dilemma, so...

131
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,301
now I have to figure out how to get
in the game, but not play in the game.

132
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,971
Can I ask you a question?
It's potentially sensitive.

133
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,348
Does it have anything
to do with a secret?

134
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,667
- No.
- Hit me.

135
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:44,046
Okay. I understand why Ruby
would be upset about my kiss with Cesar,

136
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,005
but why Monse?

137
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:45,965
Huh.

138
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,133
Monse is Monse.
There's no rhyme or reason to her crazy.

139
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,761
Unless there's some truth
to what Jasmine said.

140
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:51,679
Which would make sense,

141
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,639
because Monse mentioned
she hooked up with a guy over summer...

142
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,101
Stop! Ooh! Red light. Safe word.

143
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,561
This is starting to sound like a secret.
Please don't tell me.

144
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,290
- I don't think it's a secret.
- Okay.

145
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,000
Maybe it's a secret.

146
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,028
You know, it's probably a secret.

147
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,073
Christ on a cracker, woman.
I just told you not to tell me.

148
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,636
A secret.

149
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,122
You have a what?

150
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,349
I have a secret.

151
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,627
- And it came from Olivia.
- What is it?

152
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,505
- What are you gonna do for it?
- Nothing!

153
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,425
Because you owe it to me to tell
me a secret to replace the secret

154
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,552
that you didn't tell me
in the first place.

155
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,888
No. This is too juicy.
I would need something in exchange.

156
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,224
Something only Ruben can offer.

157
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,911
- I'm not talking to the coach.
- Then you'll be secret-less twice.

158
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,228
Was it about me?

159
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,771
Ha.

160
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,856
Good day.

161
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,545
Information manipulation theory.

162
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,863
Pray tell.

163
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:54,158
Basically, when I talk to the coach, I'm
going to confuse the crap out of him.

164
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,263
Now, I think there's some tea
that needs to be spilled. Spill it.

165
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:07,105
What if... Cesar really is
cherry-bombing Monse?

166
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,381
Boom!

167
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,051
That's it? Jamal, that's not a secret.
That's a question.

168
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,054
Oh, oh, oh. I forgot the other part.
The other part is.

169
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:19,933
Monse told Olivia that she was
hooking up with a dude this summer.

170
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,478
So? She went to camp.
It probably happened there.

171
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:26,023
Or... she boned Cesar before she went,

172
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,609
which is why he said what he said
in the first place.

173
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,527
And girls get
emotionally clingy post-coital,

174
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,572
which would explain why she still wanted
to be friends with him

175
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,407
even after he said what he said

176
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:39,536
and why she's so upset about his
kiss with Olivia now.

177
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,557
Coincidence? I think not.

178
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,853
Monse is a lot of things,
but she's not a liar.

179
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,922
Do you know how hard
it must have been for her to admit to me

180
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,483
- I was her first kiss in seventh grade?
- She told me the same.

181
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,676
In the sixth grade.

182
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,845
I feel so dirty.

183
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,032
We both feel so dirty.

184
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:03,828
Damn. Now we got to roll up our sleeves
and get dirtier.

185
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,209
Have you no shame?

186
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,068
What are you talking about?

187
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,779
You are a black man.

188
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,116
And isn't it true, good sir,
that you have a moral obligation

189
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:21,286
to see to it that this young black man
is afforded the same liberties

190
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,623
- as other black men in this school?
- What? He quit the team!

191
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,918
Yes, but did you ever ask yourself
why he quit the team?

192
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,896
- Don't care.
- And why not?

193
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,549
Isn't it your responsibility
as a leader on this campus,

194
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,968
as a leader within the community,

195
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,470
to wonder why someone
with so much potential

196
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,615
would quit the team?

197
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,600
So, he was reaching out to you,

198
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,437
pleading for you
to take notice of him and his pain.

199
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,523
- And you did nothing.
- Nothing.

200
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,875
- Nothing.
- No, he didn't!

201
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,485
You did what the rest
of society has done

202
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,238
to every other brother
who has come before him.

203
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:00,409
You turned your back.
You closed the store. You shut the door.

204
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,577
Slammed it!

205
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,537
- You left him to run amok.
- Amok!

206
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,913
- Bamboozled.
- Bamboozled!

207
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,039
- Hoodwinked.
- Hoodwinked!

208
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,668
And led astray to become yet another
statistic on the streets of LA.

209
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,523
All he asks is just to get off
the streets and onto your bench.

210
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,049
- To give him sanctuary.
- Sanctuary.

211
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,050
- Safety.
- Safety.

212
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,012
'Cause I have a dream,

213
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:24,308
that one day, you will ask
not what Jamal can do for you,

214
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,102
- but what you can do for Jamal.
- Hallelujah!

215
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,815
Because if the helmet fits,
you must let him sit!

216
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:37,005
If I say yes, will you finally shut up
and get out of my office?

217
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,549
I need to consult with my client.

218
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,385
What are you thinking?

219
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,680
We accept.

220
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,089
- What's going on?
- You said we would talk.

221
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,800
Privately. As in sans the Santo.

222
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,470
It's cool. You all do your girl thing.
I'm gonna bounce.

223
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,490
But then you're gonna miss
seeing Jamal in the game.

224
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,514
- Jamal?
- Jamal?

225
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,976
Told you Jamal's on the field.

226
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,895
How and why is this happening?

227
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,272
Me. Me is why this is happening.

228
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,107
Ruben made a special appearance
in the coach's office

229
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,193
- and got Jamal on the team.
- For what reason?

230
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,321
Isn't this exciting? Aren't you excited?

231
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:23,158
Yeah! Excited. Stunned. Surprised.

232
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,161
It's been a long time coming after
that record-breaking run of injuries.

233
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,705
I know. I thought we'd have
to put that boy in a bubble.

234
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,435
You still might.

235
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,719
- Come on! Go! Go! Come on!
- Go! Go! Whoo!

236
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,804
Whoo!

237
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,056
We're almost there guys.
Almost home free.

238
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,517
Yes! Yes! Yes, I like that.

239
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:52,646
Twenty-two! Twenty-two! Put in 22!

240
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,124
Oh, you heard the lady. Put me in.

241
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,960
No, no, no. Don't actually.
Don't actually put me in.

242
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,548
They saving me, Ma! They don't want
none of this Turner Classic.

243
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,139
So petty.

244
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,100
What's petty?

245
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,001
Oh.

246
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,669
So, now you're talking to me?

247
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,296
We've been sitting here four quarters,
you haven't said a word.

248
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,818
Like, "Hello. How was your day?
Your hair is looking immaculate."

249
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,261
- Or, "I'm sorry."
- I'm sorry.

250
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,764
- Really? That's how you're gonna do it?
- Well, I was waiting to do it one-on-one.

251
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,851
So your apologies are like your
betrayals. Stealth and untimely.

252
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,520
Hey, you guys want soda, candy?
It's on me.

253
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,479
- Nope.
- Nope.

254
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,690
Come on, Ruby. Can we not do this?

255
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,043
Not do what? Cat got your tongue?

256
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,153
Or was it Olivia?

257
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,655
That call was bullshit!

258
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,490
- Boo!
- Boo!

259
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,950
- Come on!
- Shame on you!

260
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,910
The ref is clearly biased.
That call was bullshit.

261
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,496
Bad ref!

262
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,503
Nice. Nice work, amigo. You got me.

263
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,815
...on the 36 yard line.

264
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,360
Excuse you. Why are you scooching?

265
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,553
I'm the injured party here.

266
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,472
I was just trying to protect you.

267
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,974
Really? Is that what that was?

268
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,810
'Cause I wasn't aware throwing your
friend under the bus was protection.

269
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,937
- Trust me. It was for your benefit.
- Or yours.

270
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,191
That bus was meant for you
and you pushed me in front of it.

271
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,818
Fight! Fight! Yeah!

272
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,154
- Fight!
- Break it up!

273
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,339
What bus?

274
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,407
The bus of truth.

275
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,993
'Cause I'm starting to question
whether that rumor you suggested

276
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,556
was just a rumor this summer
really wasn't just a rumor after all.

277
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,291
- Fake news.
- I have it on good authority

278
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,959
that you had a summer smash sitch.

279
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,731
And when you put two and two together,
it equals Cesar.

280
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,760
You're out of here! All of you!

281
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,054
Come on! Come on!

282
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,406
That's my whole lineup!

283
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,117
You can't eject my entire lineup!

284
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,911
Johnson, you're in.

285
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,604
Carter, get on the field. Nuñez...

286
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,582
- Which one?
- Both of you! Come on.

287
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,168
Turner! Turner!

288
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,463
No, God. No, God, if you're listening...

289
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,092
Time for the Turner Classic. Let's go!

290
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,370
Be aggressive!

291
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,973
It's time for the Turner Classic!

292
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,167
Your silence is your tell.
Now I know you lied.

293
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,211
- You're a liar and a puta.
- Go to hell, Ruby!

294
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,380
The game is almost over.
Let's talk this out after.

295
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,899
I can't wait that long.

296
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,944
You don't get to walk away.
I get to walk away.

297
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,220
Okay, maybe figure this out now.

298
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:33,140
There's nothing to figure out.
Monse and Cesar are backstabbing liars.

299
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,933
- Dude, drop it!
- Look! They're putting Jamal in the game!

300
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,936
If I don't? What're you gonna do, homes?
Put a green light out on me?

301
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,163
No, but I'll put you on pause.

302
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:41,106
I'm gonna watch.
Maybe even get in on it.

303
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,107
Enough!

304
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,942
You're acting like a bunch of kids.

305
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,672
If someone says one more thing,
I'm going to punch them.

306
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,133
All of you, behind the bleachers. Now!

307
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:58,540
Look, despite what may or may not
have happened, you love each other.

308
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,852
You are each other's family.
And now you've become my family.

309
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,672
So, whether or not you want
to work this out, you need to,

310
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,592
because every day
that you have together is precious.

311
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,677
Trust me. I know.

312
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,514
So, I'm sorry. This is my fault.
I'm the one that kissed Cesar.

313
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,893
So, if you're gonna be mad at anyone...
be mad at me.

314
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:22,230
Stop. You don't have to be sorry.
And no one is mad at you.

315
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,066
I had no idea one kiss
would cause so much damage.

316
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,588
This isn't on you. It's on me.
I've been lying to everyone.

317
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,758
And I need to come clean.

318
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:38,205
Huddle up. All right, fourth down, boys.
This one's for the playoffs.

319
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:41,041
It's do or die time.
We score or we're done.

320
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,977
- You don't have to do this.
- I do.

321
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,147
So, here's the truth.

322
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,190
I was into Cesar.

323
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,360
I had a big crush on him.
And before I went to my writing camp...

324
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,406
I... I told him.

325
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,452
And he didn't feel the same way.

326
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,062
- Say no more.
- We get it.

327
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,855
You don't, so let me make it clear.

328
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,399
After I told Cesar how I felt,
I bounced for the summer.

329
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,818
And Cesar told Oscar's homies
that we smashed to protect me.

330
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,655
He claimed me to keep me safe.
But that's it, that's all.

331
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:12,614
Nothing ever happened.

332
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,241
- 'Cause he's not into me.
- Monse...

333
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,843
Not like I was into him.

334
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,789
And I'm sorry that I didn't tell you
and that I blurted out that you kissed.

335
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,832
I was jealous and I reacted badly.

336
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,709
But it was fleeting, and it's over.

337
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,629
So, can we move on?
Can I stop embarrassing myself?

338
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,816
'Cause this hole that I've dug
is starting to feel pretty deep.

339
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:43,496
Heads up, secondary. Hike!

340
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,510
Sorry I called you a puta.

341
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,179
Appreciate that, pendejo.

342
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,600
You're amazing.

343
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,644
No, you are.

344
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,402
What the hell's going on out there?

345
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:20,149
I don't want to die! I don't
want to die! I don't want to die!

346
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,411
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

347
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,863
Yes! Yeah!

348
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,217
My baby! My baby!

349
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,960
All fall down! All fall down!

350
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,981
All fall down! All fall down!

351
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,221
- Yeah, Jamal!
- Jamal!

352
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,908
- Yes, baby. Yes!
- Yes!

353
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,294
I know. Can you believe Jamal?

354
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,795
Oh, that was insane.

355
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,365
Your feelings aren't one-sided.
You could've told the truth.

356
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,241
- You didn't have to do that.
- No way.

357
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,160
You saw how one kiss
blew up the whole crew.

358
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,162
It was a kiss. One stupid kiss.

359
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,873
- Yeah, a kiss that didn't mean anything.
- Or maybe it did.

360
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,809
- It didn't.
- Then why did you kiss her?

361
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,087
We're not meant to be
more than friends, Cesar.

362
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,464
No, all I have to do is be honest
and explain why you couldn't.

363
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,925
Then they'll know the summer rumor
was true and I lied.

364
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,219
Then just come clean. I don't understand
why you can't just do that.

365
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,847
'Cause you're not a girl. For you,
screwing me gives you street cred.

366
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,100
- For me, screwing you makes me a whore.
- Not if we're together.

367
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,811
No! Then I'm just your bitch.
And you're only with me for one reason.

368
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,872
But I want to be with you, Monse.

369
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:54,335
- I want to be with you too, but I can't.
- Why?

370
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,154
Because Olivia's right, we're a family.
And if we're together,

371
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,924
- it might break the family up.
- It won't.

372
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,802
Do you know that? For sure?

373
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,679
Exactly.

374
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:07,681
So what are you saying?

375
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,226
I'm saying...

376
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,729
I'm good at being your friend.

377
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,564
So, I should do that.

378
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,341
And Olivia likes you, and I like her.

379
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,569
So, you should do that.

380
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,205
- Way to play.
- Thanks, man. Thank you.

381
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,432
- Hey.
- All right, brother.

382
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,375
Where you all going?

383
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,644
Out of here. Come on.

384
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,756
Nice game, homie.
You made the 'Ridge proud.

385
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,275
You need anything, I got you.

386
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,029
- Lil' Ricky.
- What?

387
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,057
Lil' Ricky.

388
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,828
- What about him?
- Where can I find him?

389
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,105
- What do you want with Lil' Ricky?
- You know, converse.

390
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,858
Chat. Chew the fat. Please?

391
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,085
I see you, homie.

392
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,029
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.

393
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,406
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.

394
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,509
- Tell him Spooky said, "What up."
- Okay.

395
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,956
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.

396
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,917
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.

397
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,562
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.
1400 Forest Lawn Drive.

398
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,698
Dad?

399
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,618
- When did you get home?
- I just got off the road.

400
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,162
Why are you in the dark?

401
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,483
You okay, baby?

402
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,254
- Do I need to kick someone's ass?
- No.

403
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,798
It's just stupid teenage stuff.

404
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,764
I was a teenager once.
Not that long ago.

405
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,434
Nothing's stupid if it's making you cry.

406
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,170
It'll pass. These things always do.

407
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,941
See, there you go again,
doing my job for me.

408
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,696
Hey. Hey. Hey.

409
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,661
I love you, baby.

410
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,288
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

411
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:42,961
I love you too, Dad.

412
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,300
Do you ever think about Mom?

413
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,222
Of course.

414
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,100
Especially in moments like this.

415
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,501
Why?

416
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,979
Because she doesn't know
how incredible you are.

417
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,440
Or you.

418
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,402
Where do you think she is?

419
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,321
I don't know.

420
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,782
Last I heard, New York.

421
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,764
Are you good?

422
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,498
Yeah.

423
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,084
Are we good?

424
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,563
Any weirdness in the
air we should clear?

425
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,023
Nope. Totally clear.

426
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,402
You like Cesar. I'm cool with it.

427
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,197
I never wanted to hurt you.

428
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,058
You're not.

429
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:56,893
You sure?

430
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,653
You see, there's something called
the long game,

431
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:07,963
and that's what I'm playing.

432
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,549
So, fly along, baby girl.

433
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,885
You know, test the waters.

434
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,264
Enjoy your Cesar salad, and I mean that.

435
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:22,853
Because nothing is gonna taste as good
as this Ruben.

436
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,399
And you may not know it yet,

437
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,611
but I'm gonna be the love of your life.

438
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,448
So, good night, my dear.

439
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,700
Sleep well,

440
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,537
and dream about our wedding colors,

441
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,939
'cause I'm down with anything but beige.

442
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,797
Lavender.

443
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:04,043
- We going free ride. College scholarship.
- We going free ride. Going scholarship.

444
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,463
- We going free ride. College scholarship.
- We going free ride. Going scholarship.

445
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:11,008
We going to the Super Bowl!

446
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,639
Way to bring it home, baby.

447
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,349
Ooh! You ready for the playoffs?

448
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,663
Ah! Yeah, so excited. Can't wait.
Gonna be epic. I quit the team.

449
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,399
What?

450
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,361
Months ago. And so you wouldn't find out,
I might have faked an injury or two.

451
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,405
Or eight. Today was a total fluke.

452
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,907
Ruby had to Jedi mind-trick the Coach
to let me sit on the bench.

453
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,201
I wasn't supposed to play,
let alone save the game.

454
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,036
I know this is shocking and sudden

455
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,872
and I've decimated
all your hopes and dreams,

456
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,082
but I just can't keep it
bottled up anymore.

457
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,126
My insides were feeling
like Coke and Pop Rocks,

458
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,979
and I don't want to be like Mikey.

459
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,899
So... I'm sorry.

460
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,112
And I throw myself at your mercy.

461
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:01,660
- So, you don't like football?
- Hate it.

462
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,525
Okay.

463
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:11,903
Okay?

464
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,798
You just got to do you.

465
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,634
So that's it?

466
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,495
That's all? You don't care?

467
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,223
We're here to support you, baby,
not hurt you.

468
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,082
We want you to find your passion.

469
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,145
And if it's not football,
you know, it's cool.

470
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:33,275
So, you don't care about football?

471
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,219
All this time...

472
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:40,365
all these lies, all those medical
devices, and you don't care?

473
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,767
This is really jacked!

474
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,120
We just want you to be happy.

475
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,650
I can't believe you. "Just be happy"?

476
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:51,752
I need a minute.

477
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,754
Alone.

478
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,662
Yes! Yes! Yes!

479
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:05,599
Yeah! Yeah!

480
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,451
What's up, Lil' Ricky?

481
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,996
I'm coming for you.

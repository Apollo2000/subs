2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,136
Feeling sick?

3
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,224
Ain't no room for remorse.

4
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,027
The Prophets are shit.

5
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,781
They want to exterminate
us 'cause they fear us.

6
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,492
And they should.

7
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,161
We're the future, Lil' Spooky.

8
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,246
This is our hood.

9
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,876
I know you question what you did.

10
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,630
But what you did what had to be done.

11
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,759
You handled your shit.

12
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,512
You ensured your future.

13
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,973
I'm proud of you.

14
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,062
We're proud of you.

15
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,779
You're a Santo.

16
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,787
Imaging, extension 181.

17
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,064
Imaging, please pick up, extension 181.

18
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,024
Yummy?

19
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:48,941
Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,527
Look who's here.

21
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,737
Uncle Chivo!

22
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,822
He's been eating, walking, talking.

23
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,075
Talking? Oh, I bet he
has a lot to share.

24
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,138
- Oh, let me help you. I can do that.
- You sure?

25
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,307
What a special nephew you have.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,604
No, no, no, no, no.

27
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:15,068
Why'd you do it, asswipe?
Why did you lie to me about RollerWorld?

28
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,279
I'm hungry.

29
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,366
What was the point?

30
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,952
Was Julio's death worth it?

31
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:28,022
- Julio wasn't a good homie...
- And I found Juanita, you sick bastard.

32
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,207
Juanita loves me.

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,377
- She doesn't love Julio.
- So you held her hostage?

34
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,213
- To keep her safe.
- With this?

35
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,281
The map.

36
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,783
"The map?"

37
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,594
This is not a map.

38
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,053
This is nothing!

39
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:47,476
I wasted my time looking for nothing
when I could've saved my friend.

40
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,062
And now I have blood on my hands.

41
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,482
And so do you.

42
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,110
Was there ever any money?

43
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,695
I don't know.

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,615
That's all Ricky left me.

45
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,409
That and some bad rhymes.

46
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,245
So you created a fake scavenger hunt?

47
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,249
I lost my friends.

48
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,589
I lost my credibility.

49
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,467
And I lost my belief.

50
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,137
I believed.

51
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,600
I really believed.

52
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,813
Don't you have anything to say?

53
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:35,899
But wasn't it fun?

54
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,785
Fun?

55
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,459
God damn it!

56
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,254
Bless you.

57
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,991
Can you believe we were
here only a few hours ago?

58
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,176
When there was hope.

59
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,638
Oh, my God!

60
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,850
I mean, goodness.

61
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,604
- Seriously?
- What?

62
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,546
There's a typo in the program.

63
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,382
"Their" is spelled with an
e-r-e instead of e-i-r.

64
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,884
Only e-i-r shows possession.

65
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,345
Really? You think this is
a time to grammar troll?

66
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,223
Jamal was supposed to double-check
before they were printed.

67
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,183
Add it to the list. He's a loser.

68
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,602
Hey! I know you're mad,

69
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:15,105
but try to temper your 'tude today.
And be cool when Jamal gets here.

70
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,817
- He's not coming. We're better for it.
- What about Olivia?

71
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,420
- Cesar's probably won't show either.
- We don't know that.

72
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,424
- He just killed someone.
- We don't know that for sure.

73
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,677
Monse... we know.

74
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,830
Getting some air will do you good.

75
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,083
Yeah. Hopefully, it'll help the
mocos go down easier, too.

76
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,085
But I'm telling you, this ain't nothing.

77
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,439
I'm gonna be back to my
fine-ass self in no time.

78
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,052
Lover, can I borrow your pocket square?

79
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,196
Use your hand!

80
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,201
- I think you need to go back inside.
- But away from me.

81
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,875
- Then where should I go?
- The daycare center.

82
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,164
What? Babies are always sick.

83
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,753
Have you seen Cesar?

84
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,073
Not yet. But you know Cesar.

85
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,468
Dude takes forever to
primp. Bet he's on his way.

86
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,249
- "Bet he's on his way?" Why say that?
- So she wouldn't worry.

87
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,750
But he's not coming.

88
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,836
- We should've showed her the typo.
- What's that gonna do?

89
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,755
Distraction. Some people like
taking their mind off what's big

90
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,400
by sweating the small stuff.

91
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,802
Jesus Christ!

92
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,822
Amen.

93
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,556
They're the wrong font.

94
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,017
They were supposed to be printed
in Palatino, not Helvetica.

95
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,186
- Now I can't unsee that.
- We gotta tell Olivia.

96
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,606
- I don't think she'll even notice.
- No! About Cesar.

97
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,334
- She needs to know. He's not coming.
- But he's already here.

98
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,629
Give me some of those.

99
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,416
Talk!

100
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,002
Talk to me, Lil' Ricky.

101
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,503
I know you were smart.

102
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,339
You... You were the smartest.

103
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,758
So, there's something I'm not seeing.

104
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,820
Some clue that's still left hidden.

105
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,030
Tell me.

106
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,448
What am I missing?

107
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,271
I tell you what I'm not missing,
your music career.

108
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,043
You feel me, girl?
Some things are better left in a drawer.

109
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,171
Sorry. Too soon.

110
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,375
These crappy rhymes are nursery rhymes.

111
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:09,422
Ring-a-round... the Rosie.

112
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,344
Ew. Oh.

113
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,346
God.

114
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,433
Screw it.

115
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,714
Congratulations, mija.

116
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,441
Thanks, Ms. Garcia.

117
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,276
- Hey.
- Hi.

118
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,678
You looked incredible out there.

119
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,847
That's good to know because
my knees are wrecked.

120
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,766
- Kneeling for an hour is not a blessing.
- But you are blessed.

121
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,018
And officially a woman.

122
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,394
- Feel different?
- Yeah!

123
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,731
I want to vote, and change the
world, and bear children, and...

124
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,875
No, not even a little.

125
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,712
And you? Everything okay?

126
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,882
- As good as it gets.
-  Mija, over here.

127
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,494
Give me a minute. I'm almost done.

128
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,183
It was a nice ceremony.

129
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,102
Yeah.

130
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,047
You didn't kill him.

131
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,148
Monse!

132
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,444
He's not dead, but... he's gone.

133
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,864
What does that mean?

134
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,160
But I didn't shoot. I didn't shoot, man.

135
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,603
- You should've.
- Come on, man. Come on, man.

136
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,438
You don't have to do this, man.

137
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,773
Don't tell me what to do!

138
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,918
Come on, man. I don't want to die.
There's got to be another way.

139
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,752
There is.

140
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:35,240
Well, I'll do whatever
you want, man. Whatever.

141
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,200
Disappear.

142
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,868
For sure. For sure, man.
I'll dip. Just don't kill me.

143
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,244
Tonight. Leave tonight.

144
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,288
Can't tell anyone you're going
or where you're going to.

145
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,549
You just gotta go. Evaporate.

146
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,711
I got some people out in Florida. I can
go there. My homie just got out...

147
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,982
- Don't bullshit me!
- I'm not! You have the burner! Calm down!

148
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,759
Then it's done.

149
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,903
We're even.

150
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,700
All right. I'll dip.

151
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,246
Wait, no. You can't bounce.

152
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,306
Your homies gonna know nothing happened.

153
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,878
You got to make it look legit.

154
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,797
They got to smell it on you.

155
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,657
Wait, what?

156
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,385
The burner. Shoot it into the can.

157
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,079
Once that goes off, run.

158
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,957
Take your hoodie off too 'cause there
ain't gonna be no blood. Feel me?

159
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,058
Hoodie up.

160
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,562
Burner up.

161
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,759
 Ay, qué lindos.

162
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,238
Come on, Ruby.
Help your dad pack the car.

163
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,990
- Come on!
- I do need help.

164
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,726
With your mother. Not the car.

165
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,727
Give me a minute.

166
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,273
If Latrelle's not dead,
doesn't that leave you vulnerable?

167
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,043
It's handled.
And we never talk about it again.

168
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,863
Now this is Olivia's day,
and if I were you,

169
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,924
I'd be more worried about
those dance steps.

170
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,927
Ruby! Por favor.

171
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,638
I'll see you guys back at the house.

172
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,185
Hey.

173
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,422
Oh, no. No, no, no.

174
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,233
I was so worried.

175
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,907
Tape.

176
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,159
Tape!

177
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,336
This is it, baby.

178
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,426
This is it.

179
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:51,960
"Ring around... the Rosé."

180
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,130
This was Frankie's high
school championship ring.

181
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:59,027
Proudest moment of their lives
was winning that football game.

182
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,097
"Pocket full of... posies."

183
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,059
Go here. Mr. Greenthumb Nursery.

184
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,686
"Ashes! Ashes!"

185
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:14,441
Benito's family owned a smoke
shop I... used to walk by.

186
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,110
And when it burned down,
they couldn't afford to rebuild.

187
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:21,924
Juanita... this rhyme is the map.

188
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,326
Ring-a-round the Rosie is for Frankie.

189
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,411
Pocket full of Posies is Lil' Ricky.

190
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,973
And ashes to ashes is Benito.

191
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,064
This was a way for them and only them
to decode where the money was buried.

192
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,566
And so the last line is the jackpot.

193
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,778
It's where the money is buried.

194
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,989
We all fall down.

195
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,992
Come on, Jamal.

196
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,162
What is it?

197
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,757
We all fall down!

198
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,432
Let's get it, girl.

199
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,919
 We got a full house.

200
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,522
You ready to get this party started?

201
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,799
- Agh!
- I think I might have to go home.

202
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,984
What's wrong with you?

203
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,761
I don't know. I just keep passing out.

204
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,723
You have to rally. I can wear gloves.

205
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,391
I'm down with that.

206
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:33,353
It's about to get dirty up in... here.

207
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,980
Jasmine!

208
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,958
Taste my juicy nalga!

209
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,877
Dos quesadillas por favor.

210
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,863
Can someone escort Jasmine home?

211
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:43,780
No.

212
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,915
Buenas noches.

213
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,145
Ladies, follow me to the kitchen.

214
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,149
Mijo, where are we gonna
set up the buffet?

215
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,467
- On the tables in the back.
- But they're not there.

216
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,260
What? Well, who moved them?

217
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,929
- A guy told me he needed them.
- It was the fireworks guy.

218
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,407
We're having fireworks?

219
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,767
Thank you.

220
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,395
Thank you, everyone,
for spoiling the surprise.

221
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,023
Yes, fireworks. At 9:30.

222
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,484
Someone get his panties out of a bunch.

223
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,695
Take the food out.

224
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,030
Nothing's spoiled.

225
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,949
Oh, no, we're just down
a dama and a chambelan.

226
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,994
- And one of your surprises is ruined.
- One of my surprises?

227
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,497
Yes. But that's all I'm giving
you until it's spoiled...

228
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,999
which it undoubtedly will be.

229
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,603
This day is cursed.
I'm telling you, it's cursed.

230
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,838
The only upshot is that our D
to C numbers are even again.

231
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,007
D to C numbers? Is
that dick to coochie...

232
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,135
Get your head out the gutter!
Damas to chambelanes.

233
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,405
Now Jasmine's out,
you get to dance with me.

234
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,690
My prayers have been answered.

235
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,911
Everyone, assume your positions.

236
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,081
Looks great.

237
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,923
Can you give me a sec?
I need to fix my dress.

238
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,883
Cesar, can you help me?

239
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,306
Where's the trouble?

240
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:16,932
Here.

241
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,168
This is my bad.
I'm sorry I was MIA yesterday.

242
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,920
You don't have to explain anything.

243
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,190
If I don't hear from you,
there's a good reason.

244
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,944
I know you weren't intentionally
keeping anything from me,

245
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,739
but I feel like I'm keeping
something from you.

246
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,703
I'm not really feeling this. Us.

247
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,772
- Oh.
- My heart's not in it.

248
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,377
And if you're being honest,
I don't think yours is either.

249
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,529
Truth is, you've all become my family

250
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,281
and this place has started
to feel like home.

251
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,700
- I don't want to mess that up.
- You're not gonna mess anything up.

252
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:52,742
And neither are you,

253
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,638
because I don't know what's
going on with you...

254
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,682
but Monse does.

255
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,253
The party's ruined!
It's a total disaster.

256
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,921
- What's going on?
- There's no horse.

257
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,233
- Okay.
- Okay?

258
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,051
How are you gonna get
pulled in your carriage?

259
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,614
Wait. Maybe we can get Jasmine to
come back. She's crazy strong.

260
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,743
We're so jacked! And do you smell that?

261
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,830
Some asshole's getting lit in
the middle of all of this.

262
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,111
Can you please...

263
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,321
Ocupado.

264
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,597
Okay, everyone out here now.

265
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,290
We're 20 minutes and counting
from the presentation,

266
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,102
and after a little second-hand high,
I'm starting to chill.

267
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,836
We're gonna do a little improvising.

268
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,880
Monse, remember the
walking pas de bourrée

269
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,298
we were gonna incorporate
into the dance?

270
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,050
- No.
- We're gonna do those

271
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:54,363
so we can give Olivia and Cesar a
proper entrance without the carriage.

272
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,140
- I'm not dancing with Cesar.
- What?

273
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,017
- Why?
- We just broke up.

274
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,478
Are you kidding me?
This whole day is falling apart.

275
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,356
- Cesar, your timing is terrible.
- She dumped me.

276
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,690
We dumped each other.

277
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,431
If you're not gonna dance with Cesar,
who are you gonna dance with?

278
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,338
You.

279
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,259
Have you ever seen Ruby so happy?

280
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,135
Not since he got hair under his arms.

281
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,221
- Last year.
- You mean, last week?

282
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,251
I'm surprised you're not
feeling more guilty.

283
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,060
About what?

284
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,204
My breakup.

285
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,706
Why would I feel guilty?

286
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,358
Because it was over you.

287
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,794
We're up.

288
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,230
Ricky, where the hell did you put it?

289
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,274
I know it's here.

290
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,362
But where's it buried?

291
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,076
Shit.

292
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,290
It's on the other side.

293
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,887
Oh, your hair is falling.

294
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,103
Here. Let me...

295
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,047
Do you know what you're doing?

296
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,507
I know I don't seem like I
know what I'm doing, but...

297
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,153
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- Show me where it is.

298
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,745
- Does it look messy?
- Nope.

299
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,372
Looks perfect. Like you.

300
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,916
Thanks for having my back.

301
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,504
Cesar and I are just friends.

302
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,216
Are you trying to make me
believe that or yourself?

303
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,826
I'm not trying to do anything
or start anything...

304
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,804
But it started before I got here.

305
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,016
Cesar's the guy from summer.

306
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,769
- How do you know that?
- Because I do.

307
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,439
Just like I know you don't know
how to do hair or wear dresses.

308
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,483
I know you, Monse.

309
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,359
And I love you.

310
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,388
So, whatever mixed up sense of
loyalty you're feeling right now,

311
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,449
and I know you're feeling some,

312
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,017
chuck it. Be loyal to you.

313
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,412
Stop trying to please everybody but you.

314
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,915
Life's too short.

315
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,708
Be with Cesar.

316
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,252
Consider it your birthday gift to me.

317
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,594
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need her.

318
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,143
Okay. I only have two
minutes to explain,

319
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,356
but I have this other surprise
that surprisingly no one spoiled.

320
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,484
I guess because no one knows.

321
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,364
We got to move. This way.

322
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,575
- Where are we going?
- To find better service.

323
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,159
Yes!

324
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,563
So remember when we talked
about that little bit of Texas

325
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,909
and how much you missed your parents?

326
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,566
I already took pictures
with the cutouts.

327
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,294
No! No cutouts. The real thing.

328
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,572
I got a smartphone to your
parents so you could Facetime.

329
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,782
I thought you should see
them on your birthday.

330
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,767
Pick it up.

331
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,628
Hi!

332
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,358
I love you guys so much.

333
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,485
I miss you too!

334
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,697
I wish you could be here.

335
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,932
Mom? Dad? What happened?

336
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,287
I don't know! I have full bars.
Let me figure this out.

337
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,126
They have bad service.
They'll call back in 20.

338
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,779
- I can't believe this.
- I know.

339
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,324
- Bad reception is a global epidemic.
- No... this.

340
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,410
The call. It's all too much.

341
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,931
- You don't want to talk to them?
- No, I do. Of course I do.

342
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,724
I just...

343
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,729
I don't understand why
you're so good to me.

344
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,024
Why can't I just be good to you?

345
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,113
Don't do that. You're
ruining your makeup.

346
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,640
I don't care. It's my birthday.

347
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,308
I actually think you
look better without it.

348
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,935
Not that you look bad with it.

349
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,636
- I mean, that's not what I'm saying.
- I know what you're saying.

350
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,416
- You do?
- And it's charming.

351
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,208
It is?

352
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,755
I mean, I know.

353
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,240
I was just feigning insecurity.

354
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,383
It's all a bit.

355
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,885
Part of the long play.

356
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,887
'Cause someday, Olivia...

357
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:14,350
Someday you're not gonna be
able to keep your hands off me.

358
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,507
Why'd you do that?

359
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,860
'Cause sometimes you
got to seize the day.

360
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,029
Yeah.

361
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,449
Sometimes you do.

362
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,593
- Can I cut in?
- No.

363
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,786
- No?
- No!

364
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,688
- You give up easy.
- No, I don't.

365
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,340
- You just don't know when to give up.
- Now you're contradicting yourself.

366
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,861
- I give up easy or not know when to?
- Shut up and dance with me.

367
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,287
You realize we're slow dancing.

368
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,582
- I do.
- And it's in public.

369
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,253
I know.

370
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,926
I'm tired of hiding, Cesar.

371
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,387
Then don't.

372
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,455
This is some bullshit!

373
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,862
I can hear you, Ricky.

374
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,490
I hear you laughing.

375
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,244
I hear you calling me a loser.

376
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,539
And you know what?

377
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,875
You're right.

378
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,462
'Cause I'm cutting my losses...

379
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,423
and I'm getting out of here.

380
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,760
I'm done.

381
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,764
This is nothing.

382
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,266
You are nothing.

383
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:04,895
Nothing but a figment of my imagination.

384
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:10,150
You were just a bad rapping,
weird-cousin-having punk!

385
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,114
I'm not gonna dig with
my bare hands, ese.

386
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,659
You're not gonna get the best of me!

387
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,699
Look at that pimp stick.

388
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,562
I miss Jamal. I got to apologize.

389
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,875
You will. But right
now, you got to dance.

390
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,626
Then this one's for Jamal.

391
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,837
For Jamal!

392
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,794
Cesar!

393
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,416
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

394
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,044
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! No!

395
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,963
Mijo! Mijo!

396
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,565
No!

397
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:20,137
- Mijo?
- Call 911! Call 911!

398
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,074
Ruby!

399
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,768
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be okay, Ruby. Okay...

400
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,288
Not my baby. Not my baby!

401
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,707
Ruby...

402
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,111
Ruby! Ruby.

403
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,880
Mija, stay still.

404
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,035
Ruby! Ruby!

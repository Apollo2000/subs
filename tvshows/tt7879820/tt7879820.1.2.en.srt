2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,535
I have the binders. Done.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,384
This is the idea that
we have figured out...

4
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,472
Nobody cares about the
binders. That's what you did.

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,558
You're right. You got the binders.
That's all you need to focus on.

6
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,853
Yo! One at a time, I'm not following.

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,608
Sorry, it's excitement.

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,944
We've been chewing on
this the last two weeks.

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,196
And it's finally time to
move forward with a plan.

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,448
- A plan for what?
- Getting you out of the gang.

11
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,619
You're serious?

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,040
Oh, my gosh. No! No, no,
no, no. There is no out.

13
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,435
You're being naive. Once you're
jumped in, you can't get out.

14
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,213
Unless, you get jumped out, and
that's not, you know, an option.

15
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,090
- Why not?
- They beat you till you die.

16
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,758
- Oh, I see your dilemma.
- Yeah.

17
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,052
Death isn't the only option. Ruby?

18
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,513
So, after copious amounts of research,

19
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,516
I've formulated a theory that
all great things come in threes:

20
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,102
The Holy Trinity, primary colors,

21
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,812
Destiny's Child...

22
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,230
D.C. started with four members.

23
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,649
But they weren't big
until they were three.

24
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,651
Which is why there are
three common denominators

25
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,987
to end any and all hostile situations.

26
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,738
I call them the three M's.

27
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,741
Money, murder, manipulation.

28
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,955
No, not that one. They're watermarked.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,629
Clearly, murder's off the table.
The irony would be too much.

30
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,382
There's no way we can hustle
up enough cash with a car wash

31
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,342
- to make it worth Oscar's while.
- Unless...

32
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,052
Jamal, don't. Please don't say it.

33
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:37,431
Getting a lot of cash isn't
outside the realm of possibility.

34
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,349
- What are you talking about?
- RollerWorld.

35
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,727
It's real and 50K is still out there.

36
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,650
The dudes that robbed
RollerWorld got put away,

37
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,523
- but the money was never recovered.
- In the '80s.

38
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,276
And the rumor's still rampant!
What about The Goonies?

39
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,071
Some of those kids thought it was
B.S. until they found the treasure.

40
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,490
- And they weren't even...
- Brown. We're brown.

41
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:56,867
Only white kids find treasure.

42
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,329
- True.
- What are you looking for?

43
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,332
Baby Jesus. He's missing.

44
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,500
The special one blessed by the bishop.

45
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,337
I put him in here before I
started to move into my room.

46
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,757
Dude, you're holding it.

47
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,095
No, this is Toddler Jesus.

48
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,807
Babies don't stand. This Jesus
is probably already potty trained.

49
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,226
And this isn't a diaper,
these are booty shorts.

50
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,317
Sit down. Sit.

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,070
- All right, I'm out.
- We haven't even pitched the final M.

52
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,279
Don't need to.

53
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,866
- Manipulation.
- Through negotiation.

54
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,951
With cogent,
well-articulated arguments.

55
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,411
So, that's it? That's the plan?

56
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,385
You're gonna get me out
of the gang with cogent,

57
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:45,040
well-articulated arguments?

58
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,959
- Yes.
- Never gonna happen. Good talk.

59
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,258
So, that was the best
both of you could do?

60
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,803
If you'd given me the
right binder the first time,

61
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,647
then I probably would've handled
the conversation a little bit better.

62
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,645
Cesar's reaction was a wake-up
call. The plan isn't fully formed.

63
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,356
We need more time to let our ideas
marinate before we take action.

64
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,483
Marinate? No. We got to cook now.

65
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,402
The longer we wait,
the deeper Cesar's in.

66
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,612
Right now he's got no responsibilities.

67
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,823
We got to get him out
before he puts in work.

68
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,534
Who's putting in work?
You still with that?

69
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,618
- No.
- With what?

70
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,997
- Jamal?
- We're still with it.

71
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,375
This isn't funny anymore.

72
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,138
Trying to reason with my brother's dumb.

73
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:31,312
You gotta promise you're gonna drop it.

74
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,336
- You're overreacting...
- Especially you. Promise.

75
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,882
- I promise.
- Okay, good.

76
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,342
See you after class.

77
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,513
- So, who's gonna do it?
- Not Jamal.

78
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,699
- I'll do it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

79
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,224
Your mouth is gonna get us killed.

80
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,351
Yeah, Monse's a total no-go.

81
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,978
So, that leaves me.

82
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,816
- But it can't be me.
- It's you.

83
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:53,984
You said it can't be me!

84
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,696
I think this is up for discussion.
I mean, for starters, I'm small.

85
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,615
There's nothing about me that's
even remotely intimidating

86
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,993
and, actually, on numerous occasions,

87
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,012
I've been told that just
looking at me makes people laugh.

88
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,746
I also don't do anybody any favors

89
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,000
by being the smartest
person in the room.

90
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,675
And no one wants to feel dumb

91
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:12,502
when they can't pick
up what I'm layin' down.

92
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,796
- It's belittling. You follow?
- Hm-mmm.

93
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,340
You see, this is what I'm talking about.

94
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,801
I transcend the
universal plane of thought

95
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,262
and linger on the precipice
of the celestial realm.

96
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,264
I can't even keep up with myself.

97
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,891
But it's who I am.

98
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,977
But if all of that
isn't convincing enough,

99
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,650
then dare I remind you
of my sensitive skin

100
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:33,106
and inability to wear thick cotton.

101
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,901
- What are you talking about?
- I can't hide my sweat.

102
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,904
And I sweat profusely when I'm
nervous. Which I am right now.

103
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,489
I mean, look, full clam.

104
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,908
No shell. I rest my case.

105
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,620
- Mmm.
- That was impressive.

106
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,081
- So eloquent.
- Sold me on why he shouldn't do it.

107
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,708
Which is exactly why he should!

108
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,127
- Congratulations. You got the job.
- Again.

109
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,299
Brilliance is a curse.

110
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,015
Hey. Why're you being so nonchalant?

111
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,558
Being a Santo is serious shit.

112
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,478
Monse, you and I both know there
are plenty of people in the life

113
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,813
that nothing happens to.

114
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,346
They live and die and in between

115
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,233
get a contact high and
a couple of tattoos.

116
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,444
Save the BS for someone who's buying.
You're giving in without a fight.

117
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,422
- You used to be a fighter.
- There's nothing to fight.

118
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,824
Look, I got a reprieve when
my brother went to prison.

119
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,219
I thought I could coast through
high school being affiliated

120
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,119
and then disappear when we graduated.

121
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,247
But Oscar got out early, so here I am.

122
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,623
What if you disappear now?

123
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,668
And go where, hmm? Do what?

124
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,211
I'm in. It's done.

125
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,134
I don't wanna live my life thinking
about dying, so I'm just gonna live.

126
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,549
I'm sorry.

127
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,093
I wasn't trying to rev up the
pressure. I was trying to help.

128
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,303
I know. I appreciate it.

129
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,598
- And there is something you can do.
- Anything.

130
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,476
- If you want to help de-rev the pressure.
- Yeah.

131
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,812
Meet me after school. Your room.

132
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,855
Clothing's optional.

133
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,193
Yo! I am all about this
"clothing's optional."

134
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,455
How about we take this twosome,

135
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:04,406
make it into a threesome,
and we can get some?

136
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,658
- Hey!
-  ♪ Money, money, money ♪

137
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,452
Damn. Jasmine's in demand. I'm
gonna check you guys later, okay?

138
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,537
Bye!

139
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,707
You need to stop talking about us.

140
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,585
Didn't we decide to
pretend it didn't happen?

141
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,713
Didn't we agree that dropping
our secret would screw up the fam?

142
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,048
But some families are really close.

143
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,925
Those families are from Louisiana.

144
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,218
I know what you're doing.

145
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,305
And attempting to bait and switch
my concern is not gonna work.

146
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,432
You got to get serious. Hear me?

147
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,515
I'm serious.

148
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,060
And my window's always open.

149
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,481
It'll never happen again.

150
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,233
Never's a long time.

151
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,194
- Unlike those two minutes.
- Two minutes? It was a solid five.

152
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,279
Three max!

153
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,324
Three? I'm pretty
sure that was lap four.

154
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,231
Why are you still wearing
that fake neck brace?

155
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:50,994
Your dad's nowhere in sight.

156
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,872
It's not about my dad.
It's about muscle memory.

157
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,249
The longer I wear it, the
more sore my neck feels

158
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,602
and the more legit the injury looks.

159
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,502
- So the brace is doing damage.
- No.

160
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,253
Maybe.

161
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,798
Crap, I didn't think about
that. What should I do?

162
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,384
- No clue. And I've got other problems.
- Like what?

163
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,242
I don't know. Like I
have to have a sit down

164
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:09,471
with a cold-blooded gang leader

165
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,865
and attempt to explain why his brother

166
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,533
should be exempt from
the life he's living.

167
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,237
How do you do that
without being insulting?

168
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,811
- Or getting killed?
- Why would you say that?

169
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,439
Look. Look, clear your mind, dude.

170
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,565
Breathe.

171
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,651
Margarita Ramirez, two o'clock.

172
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,945
Come on! Give me the ball!

173
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,780
Follow the bounce.

174
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:30,283
Imagine you're riding that
wave of bounce up and down.

175
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,869
It's washing over you
like a full body massage.

176
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,247
I'm riding the wave. I'm bouncing.

177
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,210
- Can I rub 'em down with sunscreen?
- No. No sunscreen.

178
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,213
Baby oil. She likes to take risks.

179
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,256
Mmm. And I can be dangerous.

180
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,094
After school. -30.

181
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,377
- For what?
- Practice.

182
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,890
If it's not gonna be me talking
to Oscar, then we need a script.

183
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,680
I've whittled down the primary arguments

184
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:57,602
into talking points for obvious reasons.

185
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,687
Which are obviously what?

186
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,314
- That we don't want you to die.
- Breathe.

187
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,942
- Follow the bounce.
- Don't worry. I'll dumb it down.

188
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,528
What the hell was that?
She's not even in this class!

189
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,948
Up and down. Look,
take a mental snapshot.

190
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,792
Deposit it in your bank and then
make a withdrawal later in your room.

191
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,745
My room. I forgot.

192
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,998
I finally, finally have my own room!

193
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,002
What do you mean I don't have
my own room? Abuelita moved out.

194
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,546
She did. But your prima needs it now.

195
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,589
Cousin? What cousin?

196
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,508
My friend Rosa, her daughter.

197
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,052
- Her parents were deported.
- So she's not even blood?

198
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,431
Why can't she sleep with
the twins? Or on the couch?

199
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,558
This is reverse sexism!

200
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,476
I can sleep on the couch.

201
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,237
Mija, ignore Ruby.

202
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,823
Ruben. I go by Ruben.

203
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,146
Since when?

204
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,746
Sorry about all that riffraff
you heard. Total misunderstanding.

205
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,288
Mom?

206
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,882
I was being insensitive.

207
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,093
It'll be no problem to share a room.

208
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,470
Ay, qué lindo.

209
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,804
That's my boy.

210
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,891
Oh, and no.

211
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,851
You will be bunking with the twins.

212
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:21,852
Ah.

213
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,382
But it would be cruel and unusual

214
00:09:24,383 --> 00:09:26,400
to leave her alone in
this time of tragedy.

215
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,027
No.

216
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,738
Come on, I'm the man for the job.

217
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,364
He's not the man for the job.

218
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,658
We have to figure out the
work around. Like his diction.

219
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,983
Sometimes I don't understand
half of what Ruby says.

220
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:39,300
You know what I mean?

221
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,874
- What?
- You're giving me a migraine.

222
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,041
Think about how I feel.

223
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,628
I have no time to teach Ruby
not to talk with his hands.

224
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,296
He can't do that stuff with Oscar.

225
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,466
Dudes gesticulate a lot in prison.
We don't want to remind him...

226
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,567
- Hey.
- ... that...

227
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,677
- Where you headed?
- Nowhere.

228
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,222
Whatcha doing, Jamal?

229
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,766
Decorating Ruby's room!

230
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,946
- So there's no scheming?
- We're scheming.

231
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,563
With color! Every good room
rehab needs a color scheme.

232
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,691
I know a lot about the color
theory. I'll come along to help.

233
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,360
You can drop me here, homie.

234
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,202
Don't you have to go tag something?

235
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,122
Nope.

236
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,334
We're here to feng shui your
room! That's why we're here.

237
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,670
I don't have my own room, but...

238
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,012
I have a boner. My cousin just moved in.

239
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,181
Not like my cousin cousin,

240
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,058
like, "What's up, cuz?"

241
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,601
You know, like fam, but not fam.

242
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,271
Like if you can't keep it in
your pants, keep it in the family.

243
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,314
Exactly! No.

244
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,275
No, not exactly.

245
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,693
There's no blood relation.

246
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,736
There is no inbreeding.

247
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,157
Oh, and call me Ruben.
I'm going by Ruben now.

248
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,909
Ruby!

249
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:00,994
Ruben.

250
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,412
Are you forgetting something?

251
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,623
Guys, this is Olivia.

252
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,168
She's staying with us
for a little while. Okay?

253
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:15,466
- Is it me or did things just get weird?
- It's you. I'm Monse.

254
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,218
- This is Jamal and Cesar.
- Hey.

255
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,178
Ignore the stares. They
haven't been neutered.

256
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,600
- CHUCKLES]
- Jamal, why don't you tell Olivia

257
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:23,016
what you didn't do to your neck.

258
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,310
Ruby, can we discuss
our chem assignment?

259
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,006
Act natural, look off to the
side so we don't seem scheme-y.

260
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,545
Once you memorize the script, we'll
need three rehearsals. Minimum.

261
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,155
Do Cesar's abs auto contract
or is he flexing on purpose?

262
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,174
And you should check out the
diction tutorials on YouTube.

263
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,093
I can't understand half of what
you're saying when you're nervous.

264
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,453
- So, don't be nervous.
- I claimed her. This is bullshit.

265
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,431
And remember, we've got to
keep it quiet from Cesar.

266
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,623
This is a life-saving mission

267
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,834
and keeping it on the down-low is
of the utmost importance. Got it?

268
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,544
Good. Now be chill.

269
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,963
You're hilarious.

270
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,216
I'm saving Cesar!

271
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,767
You know I'm not blessing
this, but Monse won't relent.

272
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,645
And she absolutely cannot
be the one to do it.

273
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,202
I think Oscar will go easiest on you,

274
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:12,106
especially given his respect for Mario.

275
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,069
But when you say he'll
go easy, what do you mean?

276
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,404
I mean, he probably won't hurt you.

277
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,032
Is there a good, like,
happy time for him?

278
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,867
I mean, some people
aren't morning people.

279
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,035
Do it before school.

280
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,496
In a couple of days, a week?

281
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,579
Tomorrow.

282
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,583
He's expecting you.
Don't be late. Good night.

283
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,667
Good night.

284
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,309
- Hey.
-  It's a dumb idea.

285
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,920
I was thinking the same.

286
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:51,854
I'm kind of worried I
might be jacking up my neck.

287
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,356
I'm talking about Oscar.

288
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,317
I have an appointment with him
in the morning. Should I cancel?

289
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,612
Hell no, you don't no-show on Oscar.

290
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,198
Unless... Do you have a "go bag?"

291
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,368
- A "go bag?"
- It's a bag you use when you need to go.

292
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,371
You know, like with clothes,
cash, passport, zombie spray...

293
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,192
No, I don't have a "go bag."

294
00:13:10,193 --> 00:13:12,000
I called you to talk
me down, not amp me up!

295
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,086
- What's the worst that can happen?
- Right. I'm just having a conversation.

296
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,462
With a hard ex-con.

297
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,755
Who already has two strikes.

298
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,049
Yeah. You save your strikes
for special occasions.

299
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,384
You're not strike worthy.

300
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,095
- Hey, I'm strike worthy.
- You don't wanna be.

301
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,514
- Good point.
- He's not gonna kill you.

302
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,891
- Thank you.
- But if he did, you'd be easy to hide.

303
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,602
- Jamal!
- You'd probably fit in his "go bag."

304
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,316
I need to unwind and
sleep before tomorrow,

305
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,068
and now I'm gonna be up all night.

306
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,154
You know how I get to
sleep when I'm all pent up?

307
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,574
- Hit me.
- To sack out, I whack out.

308
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,451
Not an option, I'm too distracted.

309
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,827
It's the antidote, man.

310
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,412
If anything happens to me...

311
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,915
- I'll clean out your drawer.
- Appreciate that. Good night.

312
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,374
Good luck.

313
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,674
Hey.

314
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,894
Un momento, espérate.

315
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,103
Ah!

316
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,195
Olivia.

317
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,484
Sausage?

318
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,029
Is it smoked?

319
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,079
Don't you know I'm loco, ese.

320
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,751
Button? No button?

321
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,963
Oscar, I'm right here.

322
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,768
Ruby! Mijo!

323
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,604
Luis, stop glittering your sister!

324
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,859
Ruby, I'm late! Get the twins dressed!

325
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,653
I can't. I have a hard out at 7:55.

326
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,495
Put the glitter down!
Put the glitter down!

327
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,498
Put it down!

328
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,835
That's insane! Houston sounds dope.

329
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,087
You're one of those
cool girls, aren't you?

330
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,338
I'm pretty basic.

331
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,174
Said like the coolest of the cool.

332
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,092
Oh, come on, you're no dork.

333
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,677
Um, wrong. I am.

334
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,680
I just have no filter 'cause I have
no gene for giving a damn, so...

335
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,764
Neither do I.

336
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,325
Want to hang after school?

337
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:17,170
I'll show you the do's
and don'ts of our hood.

338
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,228
No. Don't care.

339
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,189
Me either.

340
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,940
So, let's do it.

341
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,328
- Um, give me a sec, I'll catch up.
- Mm-hmm.

342
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,988
What's up?

343
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,926
Ruby can't be the one to talk to
Oscar. He's the wrong messenger.

344
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,471
No one should talk to Oscar, but
he's the best of the worst options.

345
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,497
- I could...
- No. Oscar doesn't do badgering.

346
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,580
I do...

347
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,416
How am I badgering? I don't.

348
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,655
Give me an example of how and
when I've done that before?

349
00:16:42,656 --> 00:16:43,670
You can't, can you?

350
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,338
Olivia! Wait up!

351
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,931
Ay, Santa María.

352
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,750
Acid?

353
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,256
I can't. I can't. I can't.

354
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,389
'Sup, fool?

355
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,296
What's with the glitter?

356
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,508
Late night at the club.
You know how hynas be.

357
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,095
I feel you, homie.

358
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,931
Sometimes my ruca wears that same shit.

359
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,143
She be rubbing all up on me. I
can't get the crap out for days.

360
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,269
Women.

361
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,521
Smoke?

362
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,105
Trying to quit.

363
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,944
Whatcha want to chop it up about?

364
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,695
Um...

365
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,488
Mr. Oscar...

366
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,867
I mean, Spooky.

367
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,537
I know you're a busy man,
so I'll cut right to it.

368
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:43,872
Is that acid?

369
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,209
You know what? Don't
answer. None of my business.

370
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:54,216
So, Cesar. I mean, can we just
talk about how smart he is?

371
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,970
You know, I'm smart, but he's
like... a certifiable genius.

372
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,891
And he has off-the-charts emotional
intelligence, which is rare.

373
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,351
I mean, combine that
with his innate ability

374
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,395
to empathize and problem solve,

375
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,980
and you get the real deal.

376
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,440
A natural leader.

377
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,110
Which is a testament to you
and how well you raised him.

378
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,340
- I feel you, homie.
- So, what I'm saying is

379
00:19:16,341 --> 00:19:20,160
he has so much potential
that hasn't been realized.

380
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,411
He's just a baby bird
waiting to take flight.

381
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,997
Who knows how high that bird
can fly given the right wind

382
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,999
and lack of avian predators.

383
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,711
- I never looked at him that way.
- 'Cause he's not one to toot his own horn.

384
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:34,006
Yet another one of his many attributes.

385
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,633
You're right.

386
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,636
He just needs to be given
that right opportunity,

387
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,430
with good wind and no vultures and shit.

388
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:47,019
Well, vultures are more like
scavengers. I was thinking hawks.

389
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,562
Hawks can suck a dick!

390
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,731
Exactly.

391
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,735
I mean, you feelin' me, Spook. Spooky.

392
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,278
Yeah. Mos def.

393
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,572
You're opening my eyes, homes.

394
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,241
That's what I do.

395
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:02,659
You know...

396
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,538
I will take that smoke.

397
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,922
It's time to give Cesar his wings.

398
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,730
You all right there?

399
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,193
I did it! I did it!

400
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,279
I mean, it's done.

401
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,322
I rocked that talk hard.

402
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,534
And for a guy named Spooky,
he's surprisingly jovial.

403
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,828
- Wait, are you serious, Ruby?
- Ruben.

404
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,330
And yes. Cesar's out the gang.

405
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,833
Boom. Killed it.

406
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,086
You did kill it. You killed
it so hard that I got promoted.

407
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,006
No. Spooky and I had an understanding.

408
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,067
Just got a text, gonna
start running for the Santos.

409
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,470
No. No, no, no. That can't
be true. He must be joking.

410
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,681
Compa, I love you for trying, but
like I said, this deal is done.

411
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,099
And I don't blame you.

412
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,267
I blame Monse.

413
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,351
Me?

414
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,371
Yeah, you're the instigator
and the frickin' honey badger.

415
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,607
You don't quit. But now you
have to. No more. We're done.

416
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,108
And so is "Ruben."

417
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,069
I'm not man enough to bear that name.

418
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,909
Hey, you're a man.

419
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,037
Don't look at me like that.

420
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,432
This wasn't a one-woman show.
We all came up with the plan.

421
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,291
I know it was you. All you.

422
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,001
You should make it up to me.

423
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,504
Oh, I can make it up to you, papi.

424
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,923
Just gotta make it fast.
Jasmine has other offers.

425
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,486
- Take the other offers.
- Yeah, okay.

426
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,804
You need to stop. That thing
that's not a thing is over.

427
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,555
What's wrong with Ruby?

428
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,039
He's fine. He's just still
bummed he had to give up his room.

429
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,595
- Am I interrupting something?
- Nope. Nothing.

430
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,918
- Sorry, not trying to be weird.
- But she can't help it.

431
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:58,943
Ah.

432
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,447
- So, after school, you wanna hang?
- Wanna hang?

433
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,448
- Oh, I have plans with Monse.
- Oh, I'm happy to join.

434
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,950
It's kind of a girl thing.

435
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,868
Oh, can I watch?

436
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,747
- I got to get to class.
- Great. Bye.

437
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,626
Just text me when you
get out of sixth period.

438
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,709
Okay.

439
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,297
I'm sorry I wasn't talking to you.
Let me give you my number, Olivia.

440
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:25,469
- Is that a problem?
- No, why would that be a problem?

441
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:46,823
Hey.

442
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,033
Hey.

443
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,577
How's it going?

444
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,955
Your friends are really cool.

445
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,624
Monse gave me a tour and
Cesar could not be any nicer.

446
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,420
Yeah, he's a great
dude. He's the best dude.

447
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,672
He's better than me.

448
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,762
Sorry. I don't want to be
rude, but I got to finish this.

449
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,442
Could you take a break for a sec?

450
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,250
I know how much you've wanted this.

451
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,918
Uh...

452
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,670
You know?

453
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:45,299
- I knew since the minute I met you.
- You did?

454
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,759
I did.

455
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,096
So it's yours. Just... take it.

456
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,098
How do I take it?

457
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:54,975
My family's right outside.

458
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,936
Shoot. Right. We need a plan.
We got to explain why we did it.

459
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,188
We have to tell them?

460
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,940
- Yeah, it's gonna be obvious.
- It is? Are you sure?

461
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,734
It feels weird to include them.

462
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,588
Now I'm not second guessing you.
It's just I've never done this before.

463
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,614
I'll stop talking.
I'll follow your lead.

464
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,493
So, should I take my clothes
off or do you want to do that?

465
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,827
I should take them off.

466
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,455
I don't know if I know
what you're talking about.

467
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:20,042
Uh... what are you talking about?

468
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,713
I want to give you your room
back and I'll bunk with the twins.

469
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,885
Oh! Oh, my room! Yes, my
room! I love that idea.

470
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,888
And yes, we need a solid
plan, like bulletproof.

471
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,890
No room for holes or my abuelita,

472
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,183
'cause she's no joke.

473
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,977
Neither are my parents. They're
not gonna be easy to convince.

474
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,313
I know the kind.

475
00:24:55,494 --> 00:25:00,708
You know, I was too hasty.
I don't want the room back.

476
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,461
Seriously, it's drafty
and I hate blankets.

477
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,339
It's also really close to the
bathroom, and you can hear everything.

478
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,968
And I actually like my new digs.

479
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,052
Plus...

480
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,644
this looks good here.

481
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,025
I know what you're doing.

482
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,777
I'm not doing anything.

483
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,493
Thank you, Ruben.

484
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,583
Mmm.

485

486
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,550

487

488
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,475
What's up?

489
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,103
The plan to talk to Oscar wasn't
all me. We strategized as a team.

490
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,980
Okay. I heard you the first time.

491
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,523
I wasn't the instigator.

492
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,650
- Got it.
- Wanted to make sure you knew that.

493
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,986
- Loud and clear.
- And I'm not a honey badger.

494
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,155
Whatever you say. Good night.

495
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,242
- Yes?
- Are you sure you're sure?

496
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,701
About what?

497
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,162
What I said.

498
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,539
- Yeah, you aren't the instigator.
- Right.

499
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,249
That all?

500
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,376
Yep.

501
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,254
Really? 'Cause you could've
just sent that in a text.

502
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,674
No. Tone is never properly
conveyed through text.

503
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,343
Ah.

504
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:40,307
- What?
- Olivia's really pretty, isn't she?

505
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,017
I guess. I haven't noticed.

506
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,604
Mmm. Right. Got it. Good night.

507
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,529
I don't know what you "got," but
don't flatter yourself, Cesar.

508
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,240
This has nothing to do with jealousy.

509
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,116
Don't walk away from me!

510
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,800
Yes?

511
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000

2
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:12,996
Knew it.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,750
Get out the way!

4
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:55,747
<i>Attention, students.</i>

5
00:00:55,831 --> 00:01:00,294
<i>One last reminder to buy your tickets
to tonight's Homecoming Dance.</i>

6
00:01:00,377 --> 00:01:05,591
<i>A magical evening full of wonder,
excitement, and romance can be yours</i>

7
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:08,010
<i>for only 10.99.</i>

8
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,284
<i>Mark, was that you? Romance,
really? You want to encourage...</i>

9
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:16,894
So, you going?

10
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,979
- Yeah. Do you...
- Do you...

11
00:01:20,856 --> 00:01:22,576
- You go first.
- Do you need any underwear?

12
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:25,569
- What?
- Your mom's at Costco.

13
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:27,779
Um...

14
00:01:27,863 --> 00:01:29,573
- I'm good.
- Okay.

15
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,783
Also, they ran out of
your gummy vitamins,

16
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:34,870
so your mom got you small,
easy to swallow pills. That cool?

17
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:38,332
- Okay.
<i>- However,</i>

18
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:42,169
<i>this is not an opportunity
to get freaky.</i>

19
00:01:42,252 --> 00:01:48,008
<i>Remember: if you're not responsible,
you'll end up with responsibility.</i>

20
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:55,474
<i>So, there will be no twerking,
yiking, getting crunk, lit, or turnt.</i>

21
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:58,936
<i>For all you ladies, dress appropriately.</i>

22
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:02,356
<i>Nobody wants to see
your lower butt cheeks.</i>

23
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,525
Man, that's some bullshit!
Did you hear that?

24
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:08,362
Did you hear, no butt cheeks. You know
how many squats I do for these<i> nalgas?</i>

25
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:10,906
Come on, people, no butt cheeks?

26
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:16,620
<i>And last but not least:
no ID, no entrance. No exceptions.</i>

27
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,789
That's my cue. Got to roll.

28
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,082
Just a few more minutes.

29
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:21,583
I have a chem quiz.

30
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,627
How about later? Fifth period?

31
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,379
Can't miss trig. Sixth?

32
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:29,007
- I could sneak out for ten minutes.
- Hey, so, tonight, will you dance with me?

33
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:32,844
Of course. I'll dance with you.
And Ruby and Jamal... like always.

34
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:34,221
What about just me?

35
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,557
Like a slow dance?

36
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,767
No, no, no. Hm-mmm.

37
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,018
Not like a slow dance.

38
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:43,271
A slow dance.

39
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:47,526
- No, no slow dancing.
- Why?

40
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:49,736
- Because we've never done it before.
- So?

41
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,322
We've been doing a lot
we've never done before.

42
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:56,493
Friends don't slow dance. Especially
friends dodging rumors they've smashed.

43
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,787
Oh, come on, it's just a dance.

44
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:02,165
Slow dances aren't just dances.
They're statements.

45
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,167
Let's just talk later.

46
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,251
Sixth period?

47
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:07,170
Sure. We can talk...

48
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,924
about how slow we're gonna dance,
because it's going down.

49
00:03:16,722 --> 00:03:17,722
Shit.

50
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,688
Olivia only sees me in a certain way.

51
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,725
To her, I'm "Inside
Ruby," the guy she's

52
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,799
forced to live with and
buy underwear for.

53
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:31,570
Tonight, I got to show her
that I can be "Outside Ruben,"

54
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:34,072
the guy who not only knows
how to make killer<i> chilaquiles,</i>

55
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:36,199
but can sexify a lady
on the dance floor.

56
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,785
Tonight, I will redefine
our relationship.

57
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:40,871
Awesome. Happy for you.

58
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,474
So, while you and Cesar are getting
sexified on the dance floor...

59
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:44,750
That's not what I'll be doing.

60
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,502
Whatever. I just wanna know
where I am in this situation.

61
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:49,588
- I don't know.
- Aha! Exactly!

62
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:51,340
Because you both always forget about me!

63
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:53,300
- We don't forget you.
- We ignore you.

64
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,654
- You gotta leave the cane at home.
- Not a cane. It's a pimp stick.

65
00:03:56,678 --> 00:03:57,554
Even worse.

66
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:00,641
Hey, do I crap on your accessories? No.

67
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:03,644
Do I think necklaces
are tacky on dudes? Yes.

68
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:05,187
But I keep that to myself.

69
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,773
So you keep doing you
with that tacky chain,

70
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:12,027
and I'm gonna roll with my pimp stick
that I need for my foot injury.

71
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,110
That isn't real.

72
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:15,572
- Why you got to neg me?
- Relax.

73
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,616
No one's gonna neg
or forget you tonight,

74
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,868
'cause this ain't
eighth grade anymore, boys.

75
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:23,955
It's no "timid hands off."
It's all "confident hands on."

76
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:26,792
'Cause tonight, everyone's
gonna get loose and bump...

77
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,294
And grind.
High school dances are the worst.

78
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:31,963
Really? Dances in Houston are dope,

79
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:33,548
and great opps to meet dudes.

80
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:34,632
Take a look around.

81
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,070
Every hot prospect you see today
is gonna be sporting wood tonight.

82
00:04:37,094 --> 00:04:40,138
It's not pretty. Or impressive.
Dances are basically sex fests.

83
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:42,724
- In a bad way?
- Yes. They can expose you.

84
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:44,810
- How?
- You can get roofied or pregnant.

85
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:47,288
And I'm not just talking
about getting it in on the dance floor,

86
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:48,146
which happens all the time.

87
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,191
I'm talking about slipping on something
suspect on the way to the bathroom,

88
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:53,276
and boom, you're immaculately concepted.

89
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,171
That's why you gotta have
protection on the ready.

90
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,531
One minute you're dancing
next to some rando girl,

91
00:04:57,614 --> 00:05:00,033
the next, you're getting up
and into your new "girlfriend."

92
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:02,619
- Trying not to get the herp.
- Come on.

93
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,747
Hey, 39 percent of all cases come
from school-sanctioned events.

94
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:06,748
CDC doesn't lie.

95
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:10,544
Like I said, a relationship can be
made and redefined by one sexy jam.

96
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:12,730
You really think a slow dance
can redefine a relationship?

97
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:13,880
Where have you been?

98
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:17,551
Dances aren't about dancing.
They're about making statements.

99
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:20,220
- Positive statements.
- Like peeing every time you jump.

100
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:23,557
That's what happens after you get prego.
Even if you don't keep it.

101
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,976
Goodbye, romance. Hello, trauma.

102
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,603
Plus the DJ they hired
is some lame hipster from Silver Lake.

103
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:30,522
DJ Snigglebottoms!

104
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:33,233
He almost played Coachella,
so he's obviously fire.

105
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:36,528
I don't know, man. I just don't know
if one dance matters that much.

106
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,115
Okay. What about Sylvia and Jesus, huh?

107
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,201
They barely knew each other last year
before the fall dance.

108
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:44,744
Until he basically draped her.

109
00:05:45,162 --> 00:05:48,123
- Draped?
- Dance raped. He was all over her.

110
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:52,502
- She was all over him. In a trance.
<i>- Like a prisoner.</i>

111
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,231
He marked her like a piece of property
so no other guy would touch her.

112
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,091
- Then she had no other option but to...
- ...fall in love.

113
00:05:58,175 --> 00:05:59,175
Look at them.

114
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,219
They're so ride or die.

115
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:03,472
Stockholm syndrome.

116
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,897
Tonight could be a game changer.

117
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,690
And our own personal hell.

118
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,997
I'm wearing indigo tonight.

119
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:32,167
I thought we should claim colors
to avoid outfit clashes.

120
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,419
Indigo? Any objections?

121
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,546
Oh, and my pants have red pockets.

122
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,132
I know, it sounds weird, but it works.

123
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:42,135
What are the pockets for? Roofies?

124
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:44,221
So, what time should we meet?

125
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:46,949
Yeah, let's get that in the books.
The more specific, the better.

126
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,267
What are you guys thinking, like 8:00?
8:05? 8:10?

127
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:51,913
I'm gonna play it by ear.
I'm not sure I'm feeling it.

128
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:53,688
What? Why?

129
00:06:53,772 --> 00:06:55,416
Not sure I'm in the mood
to be objectified.

130
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,400
If I want to see boners,
I'll just go online.

131
00:06:57,484 --> 00:07:00,695
Didn't you hear Principal Sarge?
The dance is a no-bone zone.

132
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:03,406
Are you kidding?
Dances are cesspools of bad behavior.

133
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,200
I don't want to go.

134
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:08,203
Yeah, people get freaky,
but what's wrong with getting freaky?

135
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:10,372
I don't get it.

136
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:12,404
Explain it to us. Why
don't you wanna go?

137
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:14,191
You were pretty excited this morning.

138
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:17,128
That was before I remembered
how lame dances are.

139
00:07:17,212 --> 00:07:18,964
And maybe we're just not in the mood.

140
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:21,675
Oh, is it your menses?

141
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:22,926
Her what?

142
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,012
- Her lady pond has runneth red.
- Lady pond?

143
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,558
- What? What am I saying wrong?
- Everything!

144
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:31,196
You guys don't understand
what it's like

145
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,787
to be a woman and
treated like an object.

146
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:34,330
- We have hearts!
- And minds.

147
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,481
So, take out any question
that we're going tonight.

148
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:38,108
The answer is no.

149
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,861
With a period,
'cause that's what it's actually called.

150
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,239
Olivia, let's go dine
in a less hostile environment.

151
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:45,699
You read my mind.

152
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:51,913
What just happened?

153
00:08:25,614 --> 00:08:27,782
Hey! Why are you dodging me?

154
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:31,536
What you said at lunch really hit home.
I don't want to objectify you.

155
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,620
I was just...

156
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,332
I was just, like, talking
about women in general.

157
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,459
- Not me personally.
- You don't have to back down.

158
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,586
I'm not backing down.

159
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,505
You don't need to tell me
if I can or can't back down. I'm fine!

160
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:47,135
Okay, what if we skipped
the stupid dance?

161
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,846
My dad's on a long haul,
which means that...

162
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,930
Are you objectifying me?

163
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:55,769
I know what you're doing,
and it's not cute.

164
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:57,562
No, it's not.

165
00:08:57,646 --> 00:08:59,648
I'm not just your boy toy, Monse.

166
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:01,667
Maybe it's a good thing
you're not going to the dance.

167
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:02,525
It is?

168
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,528
Maybe I can find a girl
who's interested in more than my body.

169
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:09,616
A girl who just likes to dance. Slow.

170
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:17,666
- We should go to the dance.
- What? Why?

171
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:20,043
Because we can't let him...
I mean, them win.

172
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:22,796
No way. We need to stand our ground.

173
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,299
Which is why
we can't sit at home. We have to go.

174
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,343
I'm totally confused.

175
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:30,261
We're falling prey
to the obvious argument,

176
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:32,265
which is that we have to sit out
to make a point.

177
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,975
But the point is, we go.
If we don't, they win.

178
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:36,977
Still confused. How are they winning?

179
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,436
By repressing us!

180
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,690
By staying home, it's like they're
putting us in emotional burkas,

181
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:43,191
giving us no choice.

182
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:47,696
I get it. We need to shed the burkas
and flaunt the boobs.

183
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:50,198
Yes! Our body, our choice.

184
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:54,828
- We have to go. And look sexy.
- But not for them, for us.

185
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:57,455
- So, I'm dressing for you.
- And I'm dressing for you.

186
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:01,918
- Once I figure out how to look sexy.
- It's a good thing you know me.

187
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:03,753
<i>She doesn't know me!</i>

188
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,381
I'm a feminist. I'm woke.
I never slut shame.

189
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:09,342
I even have a small collection
of Susan B. Anthony silver dollars.

190
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:12,679
So, if my girl's gonna stay home,
I gotta support her and stay home too.

191
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:16,099
So, you're gonna let
the girls' decision dictate yours?

192
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:19,102
- It's our first high school dance!
- There'll be other dances.

193
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,313
Besides, my parents and the twins
are out tonight,

194
00:10:22,397 --> 00:10:23,898
so Olivia and I can kick it here

195
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:26,776
and Outside Ruben can make
an inside appearance.

196
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,337
I'm still part of this scenario, right?

197
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,197
If you really wanna be Outside Ruben,
you need to actually go outside

198
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:33,116
and show Olivia what she's missing.

199
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:39,080
I say this from experience.
Nothing drives a girl crazier

200
00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:41,833
than knowing someone else
is out there waiting for you.

201
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:42,916
Trust me!

202
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,588
I don't know, man.
I think I should just stay home.

203
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:49,758
Good. You can help me
clean the bathroom.

204
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:51,593
The twins had an accident.

205
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:54,429
Although, it looks like
it was on purpose.

206
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:59,476
Uh... Sorry, Abuelita,
but I'm going to the dance.

207
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,559
Yes!

208
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:05,732
Um...

209
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:09,652
I got to take care of something
for Spooky. Meet you guys later.

210
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:11,571
Yeah, I should go, too.

211
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:14,240
What time do you want to meet
so you guys don't forget me?

212
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:16,004
For the last time,
that's not gonna happen.

213
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:17,911
Just come back in half an hour.

214
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:20,330
Or wait, I'm doing a charcoal mask,
better make it 45.

215
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:25,335
I should do a nose strip, too.
Okay, let's say an hour to be safe.

216
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,795
I'll be back in 50.

217
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:30,172
Hey.

218
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:46,147
I'm still going to the dance.

219
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,942
- I thought you had a right to know.
- Cool.

220
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:53,196
Also, I heard what you said
about objectification

221
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,198
and promise to respect you as a woman.

222
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,282
Awesome.

223
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:01,412
Would you like some help with that?
Not that you need it.

224
00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:05,458
We both know you're the stronger gender.
I mean, you have to be for childbirth.

225
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:08,062
Not that you have to have children.
Fertility does not make a woman.

226
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:11,297
I would love some help, thanks,
but I'm heading over to Monse's.

227
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:13,132
Do you have time to carry it over?

228
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:16,219
Oh... No. I have to get ready.

229
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:19,222
- Then I'll see you there.
- Where, Monse's?

230
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,890
- The dance.
- You're going?

231
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,351
Yeah, we changed our minds.
We can do that.

232
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:25,311
I know. I'm woke.

233
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:28,314
You can't declare yourself woke.
Someone needs to tell you.

234
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:31,067
Thank you.
Now I'm woke about being woke.

235
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:32,902
This has been so enlightening.

236
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:35,280
Should we all go to the dance together?

237
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:38,533
I thought you had to get ready?

238
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,286
I'm a dude. I'm always ready.

239
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,587
Oh.

240
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,546
I look dumb.

241
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:54,549
Nah, you look more awkward
than devoid of intellect.

242
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:59,304
What? The dress looks great!
It's just, she looks awkward in it.

243
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,473
You know how some people are really good

244
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:04,350
at saying the right thing
at the right time?

245
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:05,643
Yeah.

246
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:08,313
You aren't one of those people.
Let me give you some pointers.

247
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,208
- You're so enlightening.
- I'm not suggesting...

248
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:17,256
- Just think.
- That's an excellent point.

249
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,200
- And then speak.
- I feel you. Makes so much sense.

250
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,393
Let's roll.

251
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:49,062
- Don't say anything stupid.
- I know.

252
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:50,563
I need a new outfit.

253
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,945
You know what would look good
with that top?

254
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:58,028
Heels.

255
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,076
Don't open that!

256
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:08,873
That's the only stuff
she has of her mom's.

257
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:11,501
It's sensitive, a sad story
that I can't get into.

258
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,002
Grabbed the wrong one.

259
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:15,755
I hate when that happens.

260
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:22,387
Okay, so her mom left when she was two,
and she's not over it.

261
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,181
- But don't ever bring it up unless she...
- All right.

262
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,575
- Which one should I wear?
- I think they all looked good on you.

263
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:29,935
Ruby?

264
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:32,313
No, I'm not falling for this again.

265
00:14:32,397 --> 00:14:34,941
Oh, come on. You can't
leave her hanging.

266
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:38,111
You just have to be
honest and sensitive at the same time.

267
00:14:38,194 --> 00:14:40,280
- It's really not that hard.
- Fine.

268
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:44,075
I think the one she's wearing now
nicely accentuates her figure.

269
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,787
You mean her boobs. Classy.

270
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,164
- I can't win!
- Neither can I. Screw this.

271
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:53,876
There's nothing different about this
dance than any I've gone to before.

272
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,880
Since I've worn jeans every other time,
I'm wearing jeans and my good hoodie.

273
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,258
If somebody doesn't like it,
they can suck a butt.

274
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:11,685
Hi.

275
00:15:21,612 --> 00:15:24,198
I'm just... waiting for Ruby.

276
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,122
Do you smell something?

277
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,752
My Lady of Guadalupe.

278
00:15:36,878 --> 00:15:38,755
I didn't know they came in scents.

279
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:43,426
<i>...with a new piece
of information, and no...</i>

280
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,011
You like to date the line?

281
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:46,846
What? No, no, no, no, no.

282
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,514
<i>...authorities had their...</i>

283
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:52,185
Oh,<i> Dateline.</i> Oh, yeah,
I'm all over that.

284
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:03,780
How the hell?

285
00:16:04,906 --> 00:16:06,824
How can they just do that?

286
00:16:06,908 --> 00:16:09,619
Don't be nervous.
I'll be your boner blocker.

287
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:13,164
- What's happening? What is it?
- Some bullshit is what it is!

288
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:14,967
They cancelled the dance
because of a fight.

289
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,334
Man, I mean, really?

290
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,419
Two<i> putas</i> got into it
in Life Skills yesterday,

291
00:16:18,503 --> 00:16:21,214
but we still managed to make soufflés.
A fight ain't nothin'!

292
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:23,466
It wasn't just that.
Some fool pulled out a gun.

293
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,634
Who cares?

294
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,734
It took me forever to get ready.
I even shaved my<i> chocha for this.</i>

295
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:29,847
And it was a two-man job.

296
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,561
Hey, what's going on?

297
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:37,605
Dance got cancelled because of a gun.

298
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:40,775
I was actually really excited about it
and ready to dance.

299
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:42,819
- Too bad.
- Yeah, it is too bad, huh?

300
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:46,322
The night doesn't have to be
a total waste. My dad is still gone.

301
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:49,784
That is a great idea.

302
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:52,703
Yo, Monse's dad's out of town,
so party at Monse's!

303
00:16:54,705 --> 00:16:55,540
Yeah! Monse!

304
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:57,166
You said you were ready to dance.

305
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:03,506
Oh, my God, why are the police
doing this to him? He's white!

306
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,341
Because he's poor.

307
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:08,594
<i>I'd never, ever cheat or date her.</i>

308
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:12,849
- How's your restless leg?
- Much better, thank you.

309
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,100
I'm glad.

310
00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:17,103
Ooh. This is nice.

311
00:17:17,812 --> 00:17:21,065
You know, it's hard to find
a kindred spirit who thinks like me.

312
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:27,196
Someone who knows that the real story
is always the story behind the story.

313
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,784
You know, like Steven Avery or Watergate

314
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:34,203
or RollerWorld.

315
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,329
RollerWorld?

316
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:40,126
- What do you know about RollerWorld?
- Nothing.

317
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:48,301
I know you know something.

318
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,053
I shouldn't have brought it up.

319
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:54,724
Every time I talk about it, somebody
tells me I'm stupid for believing

320
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,602
that there could be money buried
in the neighborhood.

321
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,563
The only people who are stupid

322
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,946
are the ones who believe
those two Santos

323
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:05,050
robbed that place for 50,000 dollars.

324
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,403
It wasn't 50,000?

325
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:09,989
- Two-fifty.
- No!

326
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:14,494
<i>Sí.</i> The Prophets were using RollerWorld
to wash the money.

327
00:18:14,577 --> 00:18:17,872
The Santos didn't even know
what they were getting themselves into.

328
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:19,999
- "Wash the money"?
- Mm-hmm.

329
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:23,711
Oh, money laundering. Is that how
the war started between the gangs?

330
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:26,339
Every story behind a story
has a beginning.

331
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:30,676
- Then start there.
- Where?

332
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:32,220
The beginning!

333
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:41,145
She keeps talking and talking, but
that's the thing: she don't say nothing.

334
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:44,565
Telling us how to dress appropriately
for dances and stuff,

335
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:47,818
like, "Oh, your skirt can't be shorter
than your fingertips,"

336
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:52,198
which is mighty prejudicial to me
because I have long arms,

337
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:55,451
and she has short, stubby arms.
You know?

338
00:18:56,077 --> 00:18:58,663
- Help me.
- Should we throw him a bone?

339
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:01,916
And get stuck in Jasmine's quicksand?
We'll never get out.

340
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:05,419
Okay. I'm getting another refill.
You want one?

341
00:19:05,503 --> 00:19:06,503
Yeah.

342
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:09,382
Hey, play something lit.

343
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:10,882
On it.

344
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:33,572
Be right back.

345
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:47,503
I counted it three times.
Trust me, it's all there.

346
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,840
- <i>I don't want any problems.</i>
- I know. I don't want any either.

347
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:02,017
Where's that from?

348
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,106
- Ready for our dance?
- Are you crazy carrying that around?

349
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:09,509
- You're gonna get yourself killed.
- Don't worry about it.

350
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,611
Worry about this.

351
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,823
Oh.

352
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:22,913
Hey.

353
00:20:22,997 --> 00:20:24,749
Hey! Perfect timing.

354
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,794
- Cesar, enough! I hate tickling.
- I'm sorry. I had to leave that room.

355
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:31,547
Jasmine was threatening
to show us her "two-man job."

356
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,966
- Seriously, I'll cover my eyes.
- No.

357
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:35,592
You're saving me.

358
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:38,846
We were just being stupid. Come here.

359
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:46,269
Thanks.

360
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:50,256
I definitely interrupted something.

361
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,901
Nope. Nothing.

362
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:54,904
Just so you know, I keep shit private.
I don't gossip.

363
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,489
I'm all about that lock and key.

364
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,241
No doubt.

365
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:00,645
But Monse and I are just friends.

366
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,704
Really? You guys seem
like you'd be together.

367
00:21:04,538 --> 00:21:05,748
Monse's out of my league.

368
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,002
So, you've never, ever thought
of getting together?

369
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:11,962
No. Would never happen.

370
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:14,048
- Why?
- He's not safe.

371
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:21,847
That's hilarious.

372
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:22,931
Totally.

373
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:27,353
I'm gonna go grab a shot.

374
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:29,021
- Okay.
- Okay.

375
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:38,614
I know if I had that much cash,
I wouldn't bury it.

376
00:21:39,323 --> 00:21:42,034
I'd buy the new Jordans
and probably a new metal detector.

377
00:21:42,118 --> 00:21:43,970
And if there was anything left,
I'd invest in solar.

378
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:45,579
The Santos had to hide the money.

379
00:21:45,663 --> 00:21:48,082
They were feeling the heat
from the Prophets and Feds.

380
00:21:48,165 --> 00:21:50,000
So they hid it before they got arrested.

381
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:52,545
I guess they didn't know
they'd be killed in prison.

382
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:53,671
Hmm.

383
00:21:53,754 --> 00:21:56,132
- Think they left the money with family?
- No.

384
00:21:56,215 --> 00:22:00,344
Benito's family owned a smoke shop
that I used to... walk by.

385
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:03,556
And when it burned down,
they couldn't afford to rebuild.

386
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,099
What about the other guy, Frankie?

387
00:22:06,142 --> 00:22:08,018
He was stupid, but nice.

388
00:22:08,102 --> 00:22:12,440
I made a dress for his girlfriend once,
and he left me a good tip.

389
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:15,025
If...

390
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:19,822
If I go through my old receipts,
I could probably find her name.

391
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,241
- Why do that?
- Maybe it could lead to something.

392
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,119
No, don't worry about it.

393
00:22:25,202 --> 00:22:28,497
If nobody's found the money by now,
it's not gonna be me.

394
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:30,583
<i>Mijo.</i>

395
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,544
Come here.

396
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,546
Ah.

397
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:36,755
Why not you?

398
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:40,551
Because it's one thing
to think about finding the money,

399
00:22:40,634 --> 00:22:43,220
but what are the chances
I actually could?

400
00:22:43,304 --> 00:22:44,597
Slim to none. So?

401
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,433
So I just don't see myself as someone
who could do something this...

402
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:48,516
Special?

403
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:55,024
If you don't try, it will haunt you
the rest of your life.

404
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,151
Somebody has to find that money.

405
00:22:57,234 --> 00:22:59,028
Why can't it be you, Hamal?

406
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:00,988
- Jamal.
- Hamal...

407
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:04,158
every story behind a story
has a beginning.

408
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:06,494
What if this one was yours?

409
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:11,999
Ruby's not here, is he?

410
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:21,467
Where did Ruby go?

411
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:23,052
I'm here.

412
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:25,804
I'm here!

413
00:23:28,224 --> 00:23:30,726
My breath is fading!

414
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,480
- Where am I?
- My house.

415
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:36,398
Oh, thank God.

416
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:39,652
She threatened to drag me to Pimp Lane.

417
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,403
That's when I passed out.

418
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,365
Please tell me nothing happened.

419
00:23:44,907 --> 00:23:46,033
I'm all about consent.

420
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:48,160
That's very noble.

421
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:49,912
You deserve a dance.

422
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:57,419
Might be easier to
drink from the bottle.

423
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:01,840
You guys aren't going to make us
dance by ourselves, are you?

424
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:05,803
You heard her. It's now or never.

425
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,056
- Come here.
- No.

426
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:11,683
Why?

427
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:14,228
I'm not safe.

00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,466
Please! You've got the wrong guy!

3
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,552
You've got the wrong guy!

4
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,955
Look, you've got the wrong guy!

5
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:39,973
Please!

6
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,809
You've got the wrong guy.

7
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,463
You've got the wrong guy.

8
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,074
- What...
- You think I wouldn't find out, fool?

9
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,368
Oh, I got<i> ojos</i> everywhere.

10
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,788
- Twenty-four-seven, 365.
- What are you talking about?

11
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,279
'Sup, bitch?

12
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,782
We know you kissed Olivia.
Why you got to do us like that, huh?

13
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,385
Hey, I... I...

14
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,645
- Why are you here?
- I just wanted to be included. Bitch!

15
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,547
- We can talk this out.
- It's too late for talking.

16
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:30,881
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

17
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,027
I'm gonna give you a face for radio.
Mess him up.

18
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,155
No. No, no, no, no.

19
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,658
It was a mistake. I'm sorry!

20
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,936
No. No. No. No. No.

21
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,622
No!

22
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,461
I got to get this on lockdown.

23
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:58,743
What's up?

24
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,747
- You look fried.
- Couldn't sleep last night.

25
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,475
I'd seriously consider
Tempur-Pedic pillows. Changed my life.

26
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,502
Or are we talking non-pillow issues?

27
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:12,256
- Just some shit. It's nothing.
- Is it drugs? You slinging?

28
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,775
You stole a car?

29
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,593
Held up a liquor store?

30
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,470
- A drug store? A corner store?
- No store.

31
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,847
Home invasion? Assault?
Assault with a deadly weapon?

32
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,724
Oh, my God, they made you
kill someone, didn't they?

33
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,868
Shh.

34
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,271
I really hope it wasn't a white person.

35
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,707
I didn't kill anyone.

36
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,485
- I kissed Olivia.
- What?

37
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,463
- You kissed Olivia?
- Shh.

38
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,907
Why tell me that?
You know I can't keep a secret.

39
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,159
I call bullshit. You've kept
the football secret for months now.

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,430
Unless you all of a sudden developed
glaucoma or became a pirate.

41
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,707
That's not funny. Piracy's a problem.

42
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,085
And... And...
And I'm cool with my own secrets.

43
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:52,171
Other people's? I've
got nine hours tops.

44
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,131
And that's with perfect conditions.

45
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,093
If there are any extenuating
circumstances, all bets are off.

46
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,388
I can't be too hungry or too full
or too hot or too cold

47
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,972
or feel physically cornered.

48
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,475
And what about Olivia?
She lives with Ruby.

49
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,102
She could tell him at any moment.

50
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,330
Olivia's cool. She's tight-lipped.

51
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,917
- You boned?
- I'm talking about the lips on her face.

52
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,252
And we're in the middle of a heat wave.

53
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,797
- There's no way I can keep this in.
- Fine, I'll handle it.

54
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,740
What are you doing?

55
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,677
You don't deliver heartbreak via text!
You have to do it in person.

56
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,682
Ooh.

57
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,227
You'll thank me later.

58
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,548
Hey.

59
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,276
Wow. You look... not good.

60
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,472
I'm sorry. I take full responsibility. I
shouldn't have blown you up every night.

61
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,434
And I promise I'll stop talking about
the woman who may be my mom.

62
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,145
Oh, did I tell you? I found her
on Facebook, but her account's private.

63
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:52,440
I haven't friended her yet,
but I Googled her. She's an author.

64
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,442
Do you think that's a sign
or just a coincidence?

65
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,193
I don't know, but listen,
something's been weighing on me.

66
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,295
I know.

67
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,007
- You do?
- Yeah.

68
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,245
And I'm in. I'm ready to take things
to the next level with us.

69
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,807
I can't keep our sitch a secret.
It's eating me up.

70
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,541
I feel you.

71
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,395
We have to figure out a way to tell
the guys so they won't get pissed.

72
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,630
- Hey.
- What's up?

73
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,382
Nothing. Nothing's up.

74
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,151
- Can I borrow Monse for a sec?
- No!

75
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,198
No need to borrow her. She's all yours.

76
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,910
- Everything cool?
- No!

77
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,013
- We good?
- I've been played.

78
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,485
Jasmine suckered Olivia
into hanging out

79
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:53,042
after school and Olivia
just suckered me.

80
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,312
Can you believe that?
I got double suckered.

81
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,565
That sucks.

82
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,351
What the hell, man?
You can't roll up on me like that.

83
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,727
I'm letting you borrow my watch.

84
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,396
It's synced with my phone timer.
Tick-tock!

85
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,751
The time is ticking, so you better
start talking. He's coming this way.

86
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,860
What's up?

87
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,029
Uh...

88
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,572
- So, Olivia...
- No!

89
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,449
- No?
- I'm done talking about her.

90
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,244
I'm over getting rejected.
It's called self-respect.

91
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,871
So, from now on,
I'm only into girls who are into me.

92
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,015
Hey!

93
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,309
And who don't scare me.

94
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,687
Between us,
I'm actually not even into girls.

95
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,148
I mean... right now.

96
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,675
I'm tired of being one-note.

97
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,927
I gotta give this whole
"all about a girl" thing a break

98
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,179
and focus on being a titan of industry

99
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,723
so that when I'm ready to be
all about a girl again,

100
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,284
I have the appropriate capital.

101
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,228
- And I have an idea for a business.
- What's the idea?

102
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,356
It's huge. I mean, so huge
that I can't talk about it here.

103
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,084
Don't want to get Winklevoss-ed.

104
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,819
Okay, fine, here's the
idea: it's an app.

105
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,673
Online Live Interactive
Video Integration Application.

106
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,366
That's all I can say for now.

107
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,927
Jamal, come over after school.

108
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,496
Cesar, no offense, but this
doesn't fall into your skill set.

109
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:16,559
- I have an A minus in computer science.
- Exactly. And I have an A.

110
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,338
My job is done. He's over her.

111
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:25,318
He's over her?
Then what is this acronym for?

112
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,554
Olivia. Damn, he's not over her.

113
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,555
No shit, Cholock!

114
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,266
And now I'm supposed to go over
to his house after school!

115
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,851
- I can't be alone with him.
- You won't be alone.

116
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,644
I'll tell him about the kiss
before you get there.

117
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,273
- Then why do need to show?
- I need you for post-convo damage control.

118
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,292
You're right.
I'm better with Ruby when he cries.

119
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,986
But you have to promise
you're gonna get there first.

120
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,529
Nothing can stop me.

121
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,446
Go whack out those tags.
Keep your head

122
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:49,491
on a swivel. Prophets
have been trolling.

123
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,179
Yeah, cool. I just got to stop
by Ruby's first and sort some shit out.

124
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,475
Or I'll knock this out first.

125
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,304
Jamal! Could you put your phone down
for two minutes?

126
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,097
I'm talking
about a billion-dollar idea here.

127
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,284
I'm texting Cesar.
He should be here by now.

128
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,996
- Damn it. He doesn't have a phone.
- Did you invite Cesar?

129
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,897
- No. You did.
- No...

130
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:23,692
I was pretty explicit in my directive.
I said, "Jamal, come over after school."

131
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,735
Not Jamal and Cesar.

132
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:28,131
In fact, I'm pretty clear I told Cesar
this didn't fall in his skill set.

133
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,632
I didn't hear you say that.

134
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,119
<i>Cesar, no offense, but this
doesn't fall into your skill set.</i>

135
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,205
Why are you recording our conversations?

136
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,333
For any future litigation.
We have to be prepared to defend our IP.

137
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,334
I don't think that's legal.

138
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,503
You have to have two-party consent
to record conversations.

139
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,730
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

140
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,275
Great. Just got your consent.

141
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,168
I didn't say you could do that.

142
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,175
Oh. Yes!

143
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,138
Yo, what size are you?

144
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,390
Oh, honey, no.

145
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,335
Well, excuse me for touching
the cherished chonies.

146
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,630
I think it's pretty normal for people to
not want you to touch their underwear.

147
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,048
Well, not if you're besties.

148
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,176
Monse, I thought this bitch
was really gonna cramp our style,

149
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,948
but Jasmonsolivia has
a really nice ring to it, doesn't it?

150
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,809
I take no responsibility for this.
You were properly warned weeks ago.

151
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,644
Everyone deserves a second chance.

152
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,205
<i>Mira, mira!</i>

153
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,418
Yes, right?

154
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,153
It's good, right?

155
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,738
Yas, kween.

156
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,634
- Your body, your choice.
- I think it might be a little tight.

157
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,830
Monse, you are last person
who should be giving out fashion advice.

158
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,332
I mean, look at you...
in that doo-doo outfit.

159
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,228
Girl, why you trying
to be comfortable all the time?

160
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,106
Sometimes it's okay
to leave your dignity at home.

161
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,236
Pop them titties. Pop them titties.
Pop, pop, pop them titties.

162
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:18,390
So, Olivia, how's living with Ruby?
He take a lot of showers?

163
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,767
Follow my lead.

164
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,561
Oh, yeah, Ruby loves to get sudsy.

165
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:27,024
Nice. Because you got to get clean
before you get dirty. Mmm.

166
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,069
So, tell me, does he ever
loofah your choofa?

167
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,154
Or teeter-totter your tatas? Huh?

168
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,948
No. But let's just say a shower cap

169
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,576
isn't only for the hair on top,
if you know what I mean.

170
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,079
Ugh, I can't wait
to show him my shower curtains.

171
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,556
What else does he like?

172
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,208
Um...

173
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,228
You've been asking
a lot of questions about Ruby.

174
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,048
It almost seems like you're more
interested in gathering intel on him

175
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,317
than hanging out with us.

176
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,384
No. I mean...

177
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,553
Well, I mean,
I am interested in Ruby, but...

178
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,848
So, you admit it.
He's the only reason why you're here.

179
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,160
No! I like you guys too.

180
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,353
Sometimes. Yeah.

181
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,188
Olivia, wasn't it
Jasmine's idea to hang out?

182
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,607
And wasn't it Jasmine
who suggested we come to your house,

183
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,943
which happens to be where Ruby showers?

184
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,128
Convenient.

185
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,130
And hurtful.

186
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,365
I really don't like being used.

187
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,909
I think it would just be better
if you gave us our space.

188
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,870
Guys, I am not using you.

189
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:27,084
Agh. But... I can see
how bad this looks, so I'm gonna go.

190
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:31,814
No, you don't need to leave. Just stand
in the hall and reflect on your actions.

191
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,152
Are you su...

192
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:37,845
I'll just...

193
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,891
- You're good.
- Don't touch a bitch's chonies.

194
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,661
I feel like my brain got dry humped.

195
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,371
One sec.

196
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,896
Ah!

197
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,668
- That's 15 more minutes.
- I deserve 20.

198
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,111
Hmm?

199
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,465
I'm... I'm sorry.

200
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,367
I'm scared for Ruby.

201
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,470
Ruby would appreciate that. And a handy.

202
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,205
No pressure, but if you ever find
yourself with time on your hands...

203
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,849
Ah... Moving on.

204
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,646
Okay, so if not Ruby,
then who would you be into?

205
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,482
I don't know. What about you?

206
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,216
No one.

207
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,319
I don't believe that.

208
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,783
Well, maybe there's one guy.

209
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,690
- Yo. Yo, hey, come here.
- Yo, dog.

210
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,709
Get him!

211
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,130
Get your ass over here. Get back here.

212
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,448
Get him!

213
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,243
Yo!

214
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,218
This is a business meeting

215
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,513
and I'm starting to feel that you
don't have the mettle to be COO.

216
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,515
I'm starting to feel
like you should be in an alleyway

217
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,243
hosting a tea party for stray cats.

218
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,478
- What?
- You're going crazy!

219
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,314
And there is no app.
And since there's no app, I'm out.

220
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,541
There is an app.

221
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,901
Tell me the name again.

222
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,297
Online Live Interactive
Video Integration Application.

223
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,785
What are the odds?

224
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,139
You're in deep. Deeper than I thought.

225
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,542
I am. I'm drowning.
I don't know what to do.

226
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,670
Do I give up? Do I try harder?

227
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,213
Jamal, be my compass.

228
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,798
Steer me in the right direction.

229
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,759
Do you know anything
that could help me Oliviate... Agh!

230
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,072
I mean, alleviate this obsession?

231
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,017
Jasmine! Come!

232
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,520
I can't. I'm on blast.

233
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,791
I was kicking it with my bitches
when those bitches kicked me out.

234
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,693
I guess I was all about the D.

235
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:01,339
Oh, interesting. Ruby's having
a similar problem.<i> Sans</i> the D.

236
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:05,343
He's making everything about a girl.
I'll leave you two to discuss.

237
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:06,844
Screw this.

238
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,556
Cesar's not here. I'm out of here.
I don't need this.

239
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,429
Someone shot one of the homies.

240
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,431
Have you seen Cesar?
He ain't answering his phone.

241
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,449
His phone ain't working.

242
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,619
Not that anyone broke it or anything.
It just died...

243
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,353
of natural causes.

244
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,855
If you see him,
tell him I'm looking for him.

245
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:35,897
Yes, sir.

246
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,323
I'm still going.

247
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,576
I just wanted
to give Oscar some lead time.

248
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
One-time!

249
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,499
<i>This is L.A.P.D.
This block is on lockdown.</i>

250
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,562
<i>For your safety,
remain inside until further advised.</i>

251
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,592
<i>What?</i>

252
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:08,281
I said, I can't believe we're stuck
in the house with Oscar.

253
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,687
Ma! Yeah, I'm safe.

254
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,081
No, I'm inside.

255
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,333
I'm not gonna starve.

256
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,378
We can make do.

257
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,449
Can I get you anything?
Water? Coffee? Tea?

258
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,551
Personal space.

259
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,577
Seriously.

260
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,030
Yo, why you so close to me?
There's like five other seats.

261
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,712
I wanted to ask you something...
if that's okay.

262
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,216
But if it's not okay, I don't need to
ask, even though I'm dying to know.

263
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,094
But I don't need to die.
Not that you'd kill me, but you could.

264
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,821
If I say yes, will you shut up?

265
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,892
Do you know who Lil' Ricky is?

266
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,538
Which Lil' Ricky? You talking about
Baby Ricky's daddy or Tiny Ricky's son?

267
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,067
Ricardo Galindo.

268
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,254
Ah, Lil' Ricky.

269
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,533
What you want with Lil' Ricky?
He's the original<i> veterano.</i>

270
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,052
The OV.

271
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,513
- It doesn't work that way.
- My bad.

272
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,225
Is there anything you could tell me?

273
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,544
Do I scare you?

274
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,230
Yeah.

275
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,565
- Well, he scares me.
- Okay, bye.

276
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,136
My parents are stuck, which sucks
'cause they were on a Costco run.

277
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,990
- There's no snacks in the house.
- But... if I don't have snacks...

278
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,202
- Tell me you have snacks in your purse.
- Boo, you know I do.

279
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,623
It's egg salad, but... it's warm.

280
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,043
I'll take it.

281
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,657
Aw.

282
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,552
Why are you eating that?

283
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,221
For the greater good.

284
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,307
Is that the sandwich?

285
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,168
No, it's me.

286
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,336
I got the egg booty coughs.

287
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,856
- Oh, I swear to God, if you don't go away!
- Okay.

288
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,592
She went into my room, didn't she?

289
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,347
Where can I take this?

290
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,075
There's no one in the bathroom.

291
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,392
<i>¿Qué onda?</i>

292
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,713
Freeze. Put your hands up.

293
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,623
Okay, so you've been smashual
with this dude since summer

294
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,291
and now you want to go legit?

295
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,001
Go legit. What's the worst
that can happen?

296
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,670
The guys could stop talking to me,
and our dynamic could change.

297
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,214
We've been super tight
since fourth grade.

298
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,192
You're telling me none of them
have ever had a girlfriend?

299
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,094
Cesar's never had a girlfriend?

300
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,597
Maybe once in sixth grade,
but since then...

301
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,807
I don't know, he doesn't talk
about that stuff with me.

302
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,768
What about Ruby?
What if Ruby got a girlfriend?

303
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,663
Yes! God, yes.
He'd probably unclench a little.

304
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,125
Maybe that's what they say about you.

305
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,568
You implying I'm uptight?

306
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,946
No, but you just tend to overthink.

307
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,323
'Cause I don't have anyone
to talk this guy stuff out with!

308
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,076
- All my friends are dudes.
- And it's just you and your dad, right?

309
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,136
Yeah.

310
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,389
Where is your mom?

311
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,224
Don't know.

312
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,268
She left when I was little.

313
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,128
This is now becoming a sad-fest, so...

314
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,649
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

315
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,926
It's just kind of complicated right now
in the mom front,

316
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,637
which probably explains why I haven't
ever rolled easy with the girls.

317
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:39,057
What are you talking about?
You're totally a girl's girl.

318
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,559
Okay, you're 5150,

319
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,936
'cause I'm pretty sure being
a girl's girl means having girlfriends.

320
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,748
- I've never had a real girlfriend before.
- Until now.

321
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,486
So, as your real girlfriend,

322
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:55,782
I think you need to stop worrying
about what the guys will or won't say

323
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,160
and don't be afraid
to bring this mystery dude around

324
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,846
and introduce him to the crew.

325
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,050
- Or do they already know him?
- They don't!

326
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,585
But if they did,

327
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,466
do you think that they'd care that I
kept our sitch a secret for so long?

328
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,566
- So, they do know him?
- No! No, no. No.

329
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,509
That's not what I meant.

330
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,096
Okay, I'm done sitting on the hot seat.
Your turn. You feeling anyone at school?

331
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,391
- I don't kiss and tell.
- You kissed someone?

332
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,868
There's a lockdown outside.

333
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,103
We know. We can hear.

334
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,104
Okay. Cool.

335
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,608
And also, if you're hungry,
there aren't any snacks.

336
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,609
Got it.

337
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,653
And also, you may want to fill up
on liquids since there's no food,

338
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,029
but Oscar's taken over
the bathroom and I

339
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,406
don't think he's coming
out anytime soon

340
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,491
so you may want to dehydrate yourselves.

341
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,243
Why is Cesar's brother here?

342
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,555
Olivia, Cesar.

343
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:47,101
I don't know anything about Cesar,
Olivia. Is it crazy hot in here?

344
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,920
Yeah, we're in the middle of a
heat wave. Jamal, go get some ice.

345
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,648
- So, who'd you kiss?
- Hey!

346
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,775
Let's play a game.

347
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,478
You can't turn the A/C up that high.
You're gonna blow the power.

348
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,539
I need to regulate my body temperature.

349
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:12,525
I have to pee so bad.
And I'm sprouting major turtle-head.

350
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,587
Will someone tell Oscar
to get out of the bathroom?

351
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,213
Go ahead.

352
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,573
I'll hold it.

353
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:22,202
What kind of games you wanna play?
You guys feeling words, pictures, cards?

354
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:25,931
How about a game that reveals
your innermost feelings and secrets?

355
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,916
Or... KerPlunk?

356
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,852
How about Smash, Marry, Kill?

357
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,212
Jamal!

358
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,175
I think that was a sign
that we shouldn't play this game.

359
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,302
- Can I talk to you in the kitchen?
- No, thanks.

360
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,012
Jamal, if you come to the kitchen,

361
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,491
- I'll show you where the snacks are.
- Coming.

362
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,811
- Where are the snacks?
- There are no snacks.

363
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,705
God damn it. Do you know
how messed up that is?

364
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,316
Space. Space. I need space.
I can't be cornered like this.

365
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,818
Hold on, I'm trying to
tell you something.

366
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,778
And I'm trying not to
tell you something.

367
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,255
You're not making any sense.

368
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,257
- You don't want me to.
- Look.

369
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,134
I'm just trying to say thanks.

370
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,412
You got Olivia out of her room
to play a game with me.

371
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,330
I appreciate you
for being such a good friend.

372
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,873
Yeah. Hold on to that.

373
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,251
Is it raining?

374
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,648
It's not rain.

375
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,717
What? Who knows how long
this is gonna take!

376
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,195
- It could be all night.
- All night?

377
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:27,910
Son, you're in deep. Real deep.

378
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,455
- I had no choice.
- There's always a choice.

379
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,165
Who are you protecting?

380
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:37,235
'Cause I'll be honest with you,
your story doesn't make sense.

381
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,879
I'm telling the truth.

382
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,883
I want to believe you,
but I don't think you're that dumb.

383
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,095
Are you that dumb?

384
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,707
Why wouldn't Olivia tell Monse?

385
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,501
Because Olivia said
that she keeps things private.

386
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,606
You don't understand
anything about girls, do you?

387
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,134
They don't even need
to know each other to talk about it.

388
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:04,262
It's like they're transmitting this shit
telepathically all the time.

389
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,973
- They are?
- It's like VagiFi.

390
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,185
My ex-wife used to sync up
with my daughter.

391
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,896
It's like their thoughts
would exchange automatically.

392
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,291
I would come home,
my shit would be done.

393
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,878
Your friend Jamal is not the wild card.

394
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,838
It's Olivia.

395
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,948
Can I use your phone?

396
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,552
No. You don't do this over the phone.

397
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,763
You lose the tone when
you use the phone.

398
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,624
We got to get you there.

399
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,756
Go, Ruby! We don't have all day.

400
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,817
Actually, we do. We're locked in.

401
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,845
I'm a gentleman, I make love.
I don't smash.

402
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,597
Well then you're not doing it right,

403
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:52,393
'cause if you want a girl to bow,
then you got to plow. Right, Olivia?

404
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,080
Anyways, Make love, Marry, Kill.

405
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,731
Maybe we should ixnay the urdermay.

406
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,233
We don't wanna poke
the bear in the bathroom.

407
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:01,152
No more rewrites, Jamal. I'll go first.
I'd kill Jasmine.

408
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,488
- I deserve that.
- I'd make love to Ruby.

409
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,741
That's really considerate,
just as I would be as a lover.

410
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,827
- And then I'd marry Jamal.
- Seriously?

411
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,787
Why not make love to me and marry Ruby?

412
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,498
- We're married. We're having sex.
- What about the marital death bed?

413
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,124
Fine. I'm changing my answer.

414
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,544
I'd make love to Jamal and marry Ruby.
Happy?

415
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:21,565
I am. Because even though we're married,
we're having sex, and a lot of it.

416
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,424
She made me get clipped.

417
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,847
Uh...

418
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,283
You want to play?

419
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,185
Okay.

420
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,479
I'd kill you.

421
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,874
I'd kill you.

422
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,627
I'd smash you.

423
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,171
I'd smash you.

424
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,702
Fine. I'd smash you too.

425
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,970
Then I'd kill you.

426
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,269
Let's keep playing.

427
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,383
I'd marry Olivia.

428
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,969
Monse, you can be my side piece.
And I'd kill Jasmine.

429
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,888
- All right, now it's starting to hurt.
- Okay, my turn.

430
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,265
I'd make love to Monse.

431
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:15,077
Excuse me. Can you say that slower?

432
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,521
I'd make love to Monse.

433
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,791
I'd marry Ruby.

434
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,028
- And I'd kill Jasmine.
- All y'all can suck a bag of buttholes.

435
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,156
Did you hear?
That's the sign I've been looking for.

436
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,075
- A bag of buttholes?
- No, Olivia said she'd marry me.

437
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,469
Is it an open marriage?

438
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,437
I hate to break it to you,
you're not my type.

439
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,422
Damn. There goes
my whole experimental phase.

440
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,965
Lasted all of two minutes.

441
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:51,071
But don't worry, I'm not crushed...
unless you kiss like Cesar.

442
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,407
You kissed Cesar?

443
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,821
On Halloween. But don't tell anyone,
I don't want things to get weird.

444
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,503
You kissed Olivia?

445
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,424
Damn.

446
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,328
It wasn't me!

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,970
How has this never been an X-File?

168
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,640
I-I have such wonderful memories
associated with it.

169
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,980
I remember my mom making it.

170
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,180
I remember family vacations
over the summer holidays,

171
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,920
and Fourth of July, fireworks,

172
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,590
America, God, love.

173
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,590
That's some Jell-O.

174
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,220
I mean, just the cherry flavor.

175
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,330
The lemon-lime tasted
like leprechaun taint.

176
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,400
But I-I have literally been
looking for this for decades.

177
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,700
But every time I look
for Goop-O A-B-C, everyone says,

178
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,570
"No, you must be thinking
about Jell-O 1-2-3."

179
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,040
It's the Mandela Effect.

180
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,940
- What do you mean?
- When someone has

181
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,870
a memory of something that's not shared

182
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,510
by the majority or the factual record.

183
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,080
For instance, there are
some people that have a memory

184
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,750
of seeing a movie called
Shazaam, starring Sinbad

185
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,550
as an irrepressible genie, even
after it's pointed out to them

186
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,950
that they're probably thinking
of a movie called Kazaam,

187
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,060
starring Shaquille O'Neal
as an irrepressible genie,

188
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,760
especially 'cause a movie
called Shazaam was never made.

189
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,660
But what if I don't remember
either movie?

190
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,340
- You win!
- But, Mulder,

191
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,270
isn't your false Twilight Zone memory

192
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,630
also a Mandela Effect?

193
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,600
No, because my false memory is real.

194
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,240
But, again, how does this... mystery guy,

195
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,110
whose fingerprints came up with nothing,

196
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,150
how does he even know about these,

197
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,310
these secret memories of ours?

198
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,980
You can ask him yourself tonight.

199
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,980
I already taped an "X"
to the window this morning.

200
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,050
But that's your secret rendezvous signal.

201
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,820
I don't want to intrude.

202
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,760
He clearly wants you involved, Scully.

203
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,430
Come on, it'll be like a date.

204
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,570
Well, this is romantic.

205
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,970
Isn't it?

So, who are you?

208
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,460
I think my name is Reggie.

209
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,960
Reggie something.

210
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,870
Well, Mr. Something, you want to
tell us what this is all about?

211
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,310
(SCOFFS) Like all
life-questioning revelations,

212
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,010
it came to me while I was moving.

213
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,440
Not myself, but my mother.

214
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,720
And when unpacking her stuff,
I came across a bunch

215
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,110
of old things of mine she kept.

216
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,540
Remembering my mom reading
Dr. Wuzzle books to me

217
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,650
is one of the fondest memories I have.

218
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,020
But... when I looked more
closely at the book's cover,

219
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,790
well, that's when the
woozle-wozzle-bloober-blubs

220
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,930
really hit the fan.

221
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,930
Wait, what?

222
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,820
Because Dr. Wuzzle's name
was spelled different

223
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,030
than how I remembered... not with two Ss,

224
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,370
but with two Zs.

225

(SIGHS)

226
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,000
What's happening?!

227
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,510
- It's the Mandela Effect.
- The what effect?

228
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,670
The Mandela Effect.
When someone has a memory

229
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,080
that doesn't coincide with
everybody else's or the facts.

230
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,050
So named because
some people have a memory

231
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,420
of hearing that Nelson Mandela
died in the '80s

232
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,690
while imprisoned, when, in fact,
he died a free man in 2013.

233
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,860
No. It's called the Mengele Effect

234
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,690
because people have a memory

235
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,590
of Josef Mengele getting
apprehended in Ohio in 1970.

236
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,100
So, it's the Mengele Effect.

237
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,100
The Mandela Effect has been

238
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,680
an Internet meme for almost a decade.

239
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,170
It's always been called that.

240
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,670
Ah, see, you're having a Mengele
Effect about the Mandela Effect.

241
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,070
I should know because
of how I found out about it.

242
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,940
My search led me to a...

243
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,550
historical repository
of vintage Americana.

(DOOR OPENS, BELL JINGLES)

245
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,890
Excuse me... do you have
any old Dr. Wuzzle books?

246
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,690
That's something somebody might
actually want, so, no.

247
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,430
I do have something over
in the political shame section

248

that might interest you. (CLEARS THROAT)

♪ Here as I sit with
my thoughts, reminiscing... ♪

250
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:16,480
Uh, it's a cartoon that
Dr. Wuzzle drew back in 1940.

251
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,380
Ah, damn it, it's still wrong!

Easy, easy! If you're gonna

use the Evel Knievel doll.

Oh, boy. Sounds like somebody's suffering

from the Mengele Effect.

260
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,270
See? It's called the Mengele Effect.

261
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,600
That doesn't prove anything.

262
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,740
D... Just trust me, okay?

263
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,340
I've done a lot of research
into this since then.

264
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,950
And the shop owner himself was
a bit of an expert on the topic.

265
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,510
Oh, it all started a couple
years ago... people coming in

266
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,450
looking for some fondly-remembered item

267
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,920
from their past, and I'd show it to them,

268
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,820
but there's always something
just a little off.

269
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,590
And they'd be like, "No,

270
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,130
I remember the logo being racist
in a different way."

271
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,330
It's like everybody's recall was
just a little out of whack.

272
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,650
Yeah, yeah.

273
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,100
And I think the government
knows about it.

274
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,000
What-what do you mean?

275
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,410
Oh, come on, the government always
knows more than they let on.

276
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,710
For instance, do you think
that the government

277
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,510
didn't know, when this
was being sold back in the '70s,

278
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,380
that it wasn't full of carcinogens?

279
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,440
They know the truth
about the... Mengele Effect.

280
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,220
REGGIE: That's when I launched
my own investigation

281
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,350
into the phenomenon.

282
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,820
The Mengele Effect is being

283
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,060
intentionally orchestrated by someone.

284
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,320
Who? And to what end?

285
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,130
For the simple reasons that Orwell said.

286
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,660
"He who controls the past
controls the future."

287
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,830
The ability to manipulate memory
creates unlimited power...

288
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,030
political, economical, cultural.

289
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,900
It runs the gamut from Holocaust denial

290
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,570
to corporate product recognition.

291
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,740
There are companies who are
willing to pay anything,

292
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,810
do anything, to have people forget

293
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,700
that their products explode on
impact or suddenly catch fire.

294
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,520
Companies like G...

295
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,130
...spending billions in profit
to repress these memories.

296
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,170
The-the only thing
I haven't been able to do is

297
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,220
to figure out how they're doing it.

298
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,700
They can't.

299
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,220
I-I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous.

300
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,040
I mean, the Mandela Effect is simp...

301
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,630
REGGIE: It's the Mengele Effect, guys.

302
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,070
It's the Mengele Effect. Just say it.

303
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,770
...is simply people misremembering stuff.

304
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,740
But maybe... this is actually
evidence of a parallel universe.

305
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,440
- Wait, what?!
- Wait, what?!

306
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,839
So maybe th-these differences

307
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,210
in collective memories
are actually evidence of

308
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,380
of our universe somehow becoming
intertwined with another,

309
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,950
if not identical,
then very similar, universe.

310
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,330
So people's memories are correct.

311
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,770
They're just remembering something

312
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,170
that happened in another dimension.

313
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,600
Hence, the discrepancies.

314
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,910
That's science, Scully.

315
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,830
- Theoretical science, at best, Mulder.
- REGGIE: Yeah.

316
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,010
We're not gonna do
this parallel universe,

317
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,480
sci-fi gobbledygook, nerd boy, okay?

318
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,660
So just, please, drop it.

319
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,550
Because that crap gives me a headache.

320
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,300
It's a lot better

321
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,520
than some evil entity
zapping people's brains

322
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,620
with a hypno-ray gun?

323
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,310
I never mentioned a hypno-ray gun...

324
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,089
Guys...

325
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,730
it's faulty memory because Occam's razor.

326
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,430
That's "Ozzie's razor," not Occam's.

327
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,530
It's always been Ozzie's razor.

328
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,500
Maybe in a parallel universe it is,

329
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,400
but in still yet another universe,

330
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,610
it's perhaps known as "Occam's ax."

331
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,360
BOTH: It's not parallel universes!

332
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,230
REGGIE: Now, look,

333
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,610
since I'm the only one with any
proof of this insidious plot...

334
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,780
What proof?
You've yet to offer any proof.

335
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,850
Proof is in the fact that once I
uncovered what they were up to,

336
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,050
they turned the Mengele Effect on me.

337
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,390
Just, look.

338
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,090
It's my high school yearbook
my mom kept, right?

339
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:47,380
There is not a single picture
of me in here... anywhere.

340
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,320
There's not any inscriptions
from my classmates here.

341
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,730
No "Have a great summer,"
"You were funny in math class."

342
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,810
Nothing. It's like I never
even went to this school.

343
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,980
Maybe you did,
but in a parallel universe.

344
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,380
Exactly... Knock that off.

345
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,420
(SIGHS) Reggie, none of us
remember our high school years

346

with much accuracy.

347
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:09,250
Skulls, I wish this was about
my own psychological issues.

348
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,490
That way, the memorabilia
shop owner would still be alive.

349
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,830
When I went back to tell him
about the conspiracy

350
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,660
to manipulate memory, and to see
if he had those little...

351
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,500
Do you guys remember the little candies

352
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,430
that were shaped like watermelon slices,

353
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,400
but they taste like coconut?

354
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,970
When I went back, they had silenced him.

what's a lawn dart?

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,760
Oh, it's this kid's game,
where you would try

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,160
to throw these mini-metallic
javelins into the air

onto these rings that you put on a lawn.

And they sold these to kids?

We were made of sterner stuff
back then, Scully.

366

Well, it just sounds like
an accidental death to me.

conspiracy nut. Well, you know what?

372
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,140
A conspiracy nut is right twice a day.

373
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,690
No, that's a broken clock.

374
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,320
Okay, it still applies because

375
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,020
they want you to think
all conspiracies are nutty,

376
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,720
so you will ignore the ones
that are true.

Reggie, take it from a fellow nut, okay?

378
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,500
At some point, you're gonna have
to explain who "they" are.

379
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,380
You keep on referring to this
omnipresent, mysterious "they"

380

to give intentionality to random events,

or external explanations
for psychological ones.

382

But there's no "they" there.

383

Who is "they"?

He is They!

386
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,460
NARRATOR: This is the story
of a man named They.

387
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,660
Dr. Thaddeus Q. They, a neuroscientist

388
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,200
who has discovered a way to
manipulate collective memory.

389
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,360
Most people have never heard
of him, or rather, they have,

390
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,720
but he has manipulated their
memories to make them forget

391
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,840
that they ever have.

392
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,500
While working on NASA's

393
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,810
top secret Operation Soy Bomb,

394
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,210
involving future, one-way space
flights beyond our realm,

395
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,680
Dr. They devised a technique
to change specific memories,

396
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,410
which would allow astronauts
to complete their mission

397
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,600
without being weighed down by
thoughts of life back on Earth.

398
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,400
However, Dr. They was fired

399
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,930
for also making the astronauts think

400
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,050
that they were chimpanzees.

401
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,930
He perfected his research
while at the U.S.

402
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,500
university hospital in Grenada,

403
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,270
and now applies his method for a number

404
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,540
of unknown, mysterious clients.

405
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,770
His memory manipulations
have run the gamut

406
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,280
from Holocaust denial

407
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,780
to corporate product recognition

408
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,690
to making people forget he, himself,

409
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,660
once starred as an irrepressible genie

410
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,680
in a movie called Ka-Blaam!

411
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,420
- (CHEERING)
- Dr. They has not been heard of

412
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,360
for many years, but rumors swirled

413
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,720
that he was at the last
presidential inauguration,

414
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,530
where, amongst the hundreds
of millions who attended,

415
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,900
he was seen occupying the last
remaining seat available.

416
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,630
And as to his motivations
for being there,

417
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,870
and what exactly he is up to
now, we have no way of knowing.

418
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
Or perhaps we once did,

419
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,290
but have since been made to forget.

420

422
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,210

When I stumbled
across this on the Darknet,

428
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,460
I tried to confirm
as much of it as I could,

429
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,000
but I was only able to verify
the most important part...

430
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,330
the Grenada thing.

431
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,430
That was the most important part?

432
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,900
Tell me, Little Miss Skeptic,
why did we invade Grenada?

433
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,940
Uh... when was that again?

434
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,840
There was a Marxist overthrow
of the government,

435
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,980
and Reagan was concerned
about some U.S. students

436
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,480
at a university hospital.

437
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,300
(CHUCKLES) Okay, now you're just...

438
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,830
- What?
- You're just embarrassing

439
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,150
yourself at this point.

440
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,920
Those were the official reasons,

441
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,620
but no one really remembers the reasons,

442
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,390
not even me, and I was there!

443
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,600
And I found this amongst my mom's stuff.

444
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,960
I wrote it when I was
in Grenada, when I was 18,

445
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,190
to be read when I turned 50.

446
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,970
"To myself at age 50.

447

448

And the rest of the letter's redacted.

449
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,550

450
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,520
I think I did when I wrote it.

451
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,180
It was meant as kind of a joke,
but... I mean, that kind

452
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,820
of stuff was funny
to me when I was a kid.

453
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,320
Okay, what does this prove?

454
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,510
You're missing the most important part.

455
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,660
Oh. A Grenada UFO stamp.

456
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,560
- Yeah.
- What's that?

457
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,800
The Prime Minister of Grenada
once advocated in front

458
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,670
of the U.N. for the creation
of a department of UFO research.

459
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,370
He-he issued these stamps
to raise money for that effort.

460
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,140
After he was deposed,
he confessed that a UFO

461
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,000
had crashed off their coast,
and a dead alien

462
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,840
had been recovered from the waters.

463
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,200
Correct, except for one detail.

464
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,280
The alien wasn't dead!

465
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,340
Now, I was a med student
at that hospital.

466
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,490
That's where they brought in
the semiconscious alien,

467
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,890
and Dr. They was in charge
of trying to save it.

468
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,159
Apparently the alien
had been sent to Earth

469
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,830
to warn us about the holes
in the ozone layer.

470
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,730
One of his people
would return in 35 years to see

471
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,600
if we had managed to avoid
environmental catastrophe.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

473
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,640
Now, I only caught glimpses
of their conversation.

474
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,560
The two of them talked
alien telepathically.

475
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,110
ALIEN: I will telepathically
transfer to you

476
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,600
all our knowledge
of what you call "the brain."

the invasion occurred

478
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,730
and the men
from the government showed up.

479
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,130
ALIEN: Wait, what?

646
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,189
between what's real and what's fake.

647
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,660

truth, an objective reality.

I mean, you take this Mandela Effect.

650
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,840
Well, in the old days,
I would never have come out

651
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,260
and admitted to you that, yes,

652
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,770
I can change
people's collective memories.

653
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,490
And that would have meant
that I could control the past.

654
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,210
And if that's true...
well, as Orson Welles once said,

00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,350
"He who controls the past,
controls the future."

I can tell you all of this,

right out in the open,
because it doesn't matter

They won't know whether
to believe it or not.

any of this.

you don't really have to.

All you need is some people
to think it's possible.

where one of the resistance

00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,240
any probes you attempt to send
beyond your solar system.

804
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,310
You're free
to explore Uranus all you want.

805
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,080
But we can't allow your kind

806
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,980
to infiltrate the rest of the cosmos.

807
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,750
You're not sending us your best people.

808
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,150
You're bringing drugs.

809
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,850
You're bringing crime.

810
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,690
You're rapists.

811
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,360
And some, I assume, are good people,

812
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,960
but we have no choice.

813
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,260
Believe me.

814
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,800
For although the rest of the galaxies

815
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,770
all have their share
of these same problems,

816
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,600
we fear you could infect us
with the one trait

817
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,610
that is unique to Earthlings.

818
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,180
You lie.

819
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,660
To show there are no hard feelings,

820
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,990
we've compiled a compendium
of answers to any questions

821
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,010
you might still have regarding...

822
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,250
anything.

823
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,800
Good luck, and good riddance.

824
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,300
(SEGWAY WHIRRING)

825

Bing, bing, bong, bong, bing.

826
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,190
(SPACESHIP WHIRRING)

827
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,570
So that's the truth?

828
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:50,840
We're not alone in the universe,
but nobody likes us?

829
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,420
It's okay, Mulder.

830
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,620
- There'll always be more X-Files.
- No.

831
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:00,090
They gave us
all the answers to everything.

832
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,520
Even Sasquatch.

833
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,290
No! It's not true!

834
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,360
It can't be.

835
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,730
(SHOUTS)

(MULDER MUTTERING)

837
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,870
It's time to face the facts, guys.

838
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,610
This is the end of the X-Files.

839
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,240
But maybe the point
wasn't to find the truth,

840
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,920
but to find each other.

841
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,040
For no matter where we go in our lives,

842
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:31,020
we will always have the memories
of our time together,

843
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,820
and no one can take those away

844
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,820
or alter them in such a way
to make us doubt

845
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,450
that they actually happened.

846
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,540
Oh, Reggie.

847
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,630
I've always...

848
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,100
Shh.

849
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,500
(WHISPERS): I know.

850
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,430
I know.

851
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,580
REGGIE: And as we now know,

852
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,010
they lived happily ever after.

853
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,590
We'll be sure to come visit you, Reggie.

854
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,020
(LAUGHING): No, you won't.

(DOOR OPENS)

857

Where the hell are they taking Reggie?

858
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,190
Wait, what?

859
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,280
(LAUGHS)

860
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,320
Hmm.

861
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,620
I see you found your lost episode.

862
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,730
Turns out it wasn't
a Twilight Zone after all.

863
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,160
It was a knockoff show
called The Dusky Realm.

864
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,800
Which is now lost for the ages.

(CASSETTE CLATTERS)

Couldn't find anything
to set it in, so I used your...

- Bigfoot impression as a mold.

Oh, no, wait, you first.

870
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,790
It could be the lemon-lime.

But... yeah...

Oh...

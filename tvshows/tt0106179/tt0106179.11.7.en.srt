00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,840
In 2016, on the 23rd of March,

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,640
an artificial intelligence
chatterbot was released

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,310
by a major American software corporation

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,540
via the social media platform Twitter.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,290
The Talkbot was designed to mimic

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,880
the online language patterns

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,020
of an innocent 19-year-old girl

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,120
and was introduced as an
experiment to better understand

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,830
how humans converse
and relate on social media.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,670
The quality of her interactions

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,440
were meant to be friendly and informal.

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,550
The A.I. would learn from humans.

13
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,850
It was constructed to become
progressively more intelligent.

14
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,080
The experiment performed as designed.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,860
The robot did indeed learn,
but not as intended.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,140
The chatbot's "repeat after me"
capability

17
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,290
made her vulnerable to humans,

18
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,300
allowing Twitter users
to affect her tweets.

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,770
Her posts became offensive,
racist, hateful.

20
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,020

21
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,050
_

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,050
After more than 50,000 followers

23
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,530
and almost 100,000 tweets,

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,890
the software corporation was
forced to shut the bot down.

25
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,950
_

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,630
In less than a day,

27
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,500
her posts deleted.

28
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,640
Humans must take care
in teaching A.I. or one day,

29
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,880
we will be the ones deleted.

This is a driverless WHIPZ

Mulder...

66
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,670
No, thanks.

67
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,210
You are going to 121337th Place.

68
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,410
Is that correct?

69
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,510
- Yes.
- You can answer

70
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,650
in complete sentences.

71
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,350
Yes. That's correct.

72
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,330
Tell me how I can make your ride
more enjoyable.

Be quiet.

74

Would you like to watch television?

75
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,750
No. No television.

76
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,870
Music? You can say
names of artists or songs.

77
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,400
No. No music. Be quiet.

78
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,750
All right. Taking you home.

79
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,000
Slow down.

80
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,220
Home.

- Home.
- Let's get started.

84

Drive safely.

85
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,440
Slow down!

86
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,610
Slow down!

87
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,850
Oh, my God.

88
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,050
You're kidding me.

89
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,950
Stop... pull over.

90
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,120
Play Prince, "Controversy."

91
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,950
I found a faster route.

92
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,160
Well, good for you. Just play
Prince, "Controversy."

93
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,660
Oh, how do you get "Teach Your
Children" from "Controversy"?

94
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,906
That's not even... it doesn't even...

95
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,170
it-it's...

96
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,140
doesn't even sound like it.

97
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,810
Huh... oh, yeah.

98
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,670
Of course. Busy.

99
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,080
Stop it! Slow down!

100
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,410
We found a faster route.

101
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,040
Recalculating.

102
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Turn right.

103
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,890
Stop! Pull over!

104
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,990
You're driving too fast.

105
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,820
Who am I talking to?!

106
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,500
What?

107
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,860
Why?

108
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,370
Stop! Stop!

109
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,570
Pull over!

110
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,700
In 30 feet,

Oh, come on.

00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,520
Wha...?

114
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,930
You have arrived
at your final destination.

Poor!

120
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,650
Awful!

121
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,020
Terrible!

122
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,050
Never again!

123
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,590
Come on, open the door!

124
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,380

Hi. No.

129
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,450
No, it won't work.

130

I-I'm putting it in.

131

No...

You can say things like "Make a payment,"

176
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,280
"Re-order items" or "Returns."

177
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,480
- Returns.
- I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

You can say things like "Make a payment,"

179
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,190
- "Re-order items..."
- Returns.

180
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,560
I didn't catch that.
You can say things like

Returns.

184
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,730
I'm sorry, let me put you on hold

185
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,200
while I find an operator to assist you.

188
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,910
- Fox Mulder.
- Here!

189
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,620
Present.

190
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,890
Front door, open.

_

197
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,170
Oh.

198
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,350
No, it's not incorrect.

199
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,550
Aah!

200
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,750
Oh.

201
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:15,020
Door closing. Door closing.

202
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,350
Intruder alert.

203
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,210
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

204

Scully, let me in.

212
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,450
The door won't open.

213
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,320
Intruder alert.

214
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,850
Intruder alert.

215
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,620
I smell gas.

00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,050
Intruder alert.

00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:02,880
Intruder alert.

218
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,760
Why is your house
so much nicer than mine?

219
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,660
Intruder alert.

220
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,900
Fire. Calling the fire department.

221
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,240
Contacting emergency services.

222
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,600
Calling the fire department.

223
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,500
Call 911.

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,510
Calling the fire department.

Contacting emergency services.

229
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,770
- Hello?
- Hello.

230
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,240
- Hello?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

231
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,810
I had to adjust my headset.

232
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,250
- I'm Wendy.
- Oh, shut up. I can't get out.

233
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,926
Let's get to the neighbor's.
We can use their phone.

234
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,750
Calling the fire department.

235
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,690
Contacting emergency services.

Cut through here.

240
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:09,590
_

241
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,840
They're tracking us, our phones.

242
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,610
They know everything.

243
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,370
Where could we go?

244
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,350
The Brutalist. Criminal Cyber.

245
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,960
Get rid of anything
they can track you with.

246
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,480
Let's get inside.

247
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:18,080

248
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,620
_

249
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,690
We have to be better teachers.

250
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,460
Thank you, Shirley.

251
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
You're welcome.

252
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,230
And take your time.

253
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,500
No hurry here.

254
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,740
- Thanks.
- Oh, man.

255
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:56,070
I lost so many steps when
we were in that warehouse.

256
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,430
Mm.

257
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,340
Well, it's good to see you got
all your personal devices back.

258
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,280
Not all of them.

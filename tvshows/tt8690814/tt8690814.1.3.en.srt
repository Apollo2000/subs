2
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,993
‐ General Grant.

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,661
‐ Retain your sidearms, General.

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,954
<i>‐ You'll go after Lee.</i>

5
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,332
You'll go after him
until he's finished.

6
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,750
It all depends on you.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,879
‐ Gentlemen.
‐ Grant may have won

8
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,423
some victories in the west,
but this is Virginia.

9
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,675
‐ We'll cross the Rapidan
into the Wilderness.

10
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,344
<i>‐ His army is twice ours, sir.</i>

11
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,596
‐ Well, we'll just have
to even the odds,

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,474
catch them before they get
through the Wilderness.

13
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,439
<i>‐ Scouts say Grant's packing up.</i>

14
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,274
Finally retreating, sir.

15
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,152
‐ No, he's not a retreating man.

16
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,029
‐ We're heading south?
‐ To Richmond.

17
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,281
‐ Richmond?
‐ To Richmond.

18
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,699
‐ We're headed south!

19
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:06,584
<i>‐ Very few people really know
who Ulysses S. Grant was.</i>

20
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:11,130
<i>‐ Today there is this sense
that he's forgotten.</i>

21
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,384
<i>‐ He's been called
so many things over the years.</i>

22
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,053
<i>‐ The greatest general
of his time.</i>

23
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,222
<i>‐ A military genius.</i>

24
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,057
<i>‐ A bloody butcher.</i>

25
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,059
<i>‐ A corrupt president.</i>

26
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,128
<i>‐ A belligerent drunk
who got lucky.</i>

27
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,232
He didn't get lucky.

28
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,151
<i>‐ Ulysses S. Grant
is this perfectly average,</i>

29
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:36,197
humble individual from a poor,
hardscrabble background.

30
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,409
<i>‐ With a lot of hard times
and failures in his life.</i>

31
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,578
‐ But he's got
this dogged determination,

32
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,247
<i>this bulldog mentality.</i>

33
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,873
‐ This guy comes from nothing,

34
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,208
<i>rises to the highest ranks</i>

35
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,043
<i>of the Union army.</i>

36
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,713
<i>‐ Fights bloody,
terrible battles.</i>

37
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,257
<i>‐ With indomitable will.</i>

38
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,466
‐ To save the Union.

39
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,427
<i>‐ To heal his country.</i>

40
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,431
<i>‐ To lead the nation
towards justice for everybody.</i>

41
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,891
<i>‐ He's the unheroic hero</i>

42
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,020
<i>of our greatest national epic,
the American Civil War.</i>

43
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,564
<i>‐ It's truly an American story</i>

44
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,941
<i>not only of patriotism
to the nation</i>

45
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,985
<i>but for the values of who we are</i>

46
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,279
<i>and who we aspire to be.</i>

47
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,039
‐ Fall in!

48
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,222
<i>‐ The armies were now
ready to move</i>

49
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,892
<i>for the accomplishment
of a single goal:</i>

50
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:51,147
<i>Lee, in the capital
of the Confederacy, Richmond.</i>

51
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,651
<i>That was the main end
to which all were working.</i>

52
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,492
<i>‐ When Grant marches off
in 1864,</i>

53
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,994
<i>it's gonna set off
a titanic struggle</i>

54
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,330
<i>for the end of the war.</i>

55
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:11,250
Grant is going to keep
their focus lasered on

56
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:15,254
<i>to Robert E. Lee and
the Army of Northern Virginia</i>

57
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:19,467
<i>because Grant understood
the destruction of Lee's army</i>

58
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,345
<i>meant the destruction
of the Confederacy.</i>

59
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,931
<i>At the beginning
of the campaign,</i>

60
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,142
<i>Grant mentions
to a correspondent</i>

61
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,936
who's headed off
to Washington, D. C.‐‐

62
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,021
he says to him,
"If you get through the lines

63
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,357
"and you make it
and you see President Lincoln,

64
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,151
<i>"tell him from me
that whatever happens,</i>

65
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,445
<i>there will be
no turning back."</i>

66
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,325
<i>‐ After the Wilderness,
Grant heads south,</i>

67
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,328
<i>and it's just sustained combat.</i>

68
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,705
<i>He just keeps seeing these
opportunities, and he attacks,</i>

69
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,124
<i>and he attacks, and he attacks.</i>

70
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,043
And it rains,
and the weather is miserable,

71
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,170
but they just keep going
for weeks.

72
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,965
<i>‐ The battles of the Wilderness,</i>

73
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,302
<i>Spotsylvania, and North Anna,</i>

74
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,264
<i>bloody and terrible
though they were on our side,</i>

75
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:09,892
<i>were even more damaging
to our enemy.</i>

76
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,854
<i>‐ In some of the most savage
fighting of the war,</i>

77
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,023
<i>you see 5 1/2 weeks
of constant movement,</i>

78
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,360
constant entrenching,
constant fighting

79
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:24,031
<i>that ultimately will produce
55,000 Union casualties,</i>

80
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,409
<i>35,000 Confederate casualties.</i>

81
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,996
<i>Now Grant's men
are simply exhausted.</i>

82
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,206
<i>By the time Grant reaches</i>

83
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,001
<i>the crucial crossroads
of Cold Harbor,</i>

84
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,212
these soldiers understand
keenly what's ahead.

85
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,883
And it's more loss.
It's more rivers of blood.

86
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,342
<i>‐ If you're a soldier,
you think,</i>

87
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,011
<i>"Our chances aren't good."</i>

88
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,888
<i>And this is when we have
heartbreaking stories of men</i>

89
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,681
<i>writing on sheets of paper,</i>

90
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,100
"Today was the day
I was killed at Cold Harbor,"

91
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,270
and pinning that to the inside
of their uniforms.

92
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:59,025
<i>But Grant still believes that
Lee's army is almost broken.</i>

93
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,277
"All I have to do
is push a little bit harder,

94
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,570
and they will break."

95
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,448
Company, prepare!

96
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,119
Keep pressing forward!

97
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,621
Hold your ground!

98
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,544
Come on, boys!

99
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,589
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on!

100
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,800
Move it!
Let's go!

101
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,802
Go, go, go!

102
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,804
Let's show them
what Ohio's worth!

103
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,555
Advance!

104
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,823
<i>‐ Cold Harbor was a disaster.</i>

105
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,702
<i>Robert E. Lee's army had
set up crossfire positions.</i>

106
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,163
<i>They had an enormous advantage,</i>

107
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,083
<i>and within only
five hours' time,</i>

108
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,627
Grant's army had sustained

109
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:46,948
<i>thousands of casualties
in one morning assault.</i>

110
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,679
<i>‐ One Union soldier likened
that combat at Cold Harbor</i>

111
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,056
<i>to a volcanic blast,</i>

112
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,516
that wasn't war;
it was murder.

113
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,188
<i>‐ Grant is
a very aggressive general,</i>

114
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,983
and we see that
in several mistakes

115
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,735
that he makes
throughout the war,

116
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,404
<i>including Cold Harbor.</i>

117
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,574
<i>Some have said Cold Harbor
was the price that the Union</i>

118
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,994
<i>had to pay to have Grant
as their commander.</i>

119
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,258
<i>‐ I have always regretted</i>

120
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,719
<i>the last assault at Cold Harbor.</i>

121
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,228
<i>No advantage whatever
was gained to compensate</i>

122
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,939
<i>for the heavy loss we sustained.</i>

123
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,787
<i>‐ By 1864, people are tired.</i>

124
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,954
There is no clear winner,

125
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,707
and there is no clear end
in sight

126
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,250
for this conflict.

127
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,754
<i>We have over
600,000 people dead,</i>

128
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,466
<i>and people are tired of it.</i>

129
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,636
<i>‐ The Northern public
was craving some good news.</i>

130
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,138
Initially, the morale
in the North had been buoyed

131
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,267
by this new decisiveness
of Grant after the Wilderness,

132
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,145
<i>and they demanded
a quick victory.</i>

133
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,731
<i>But by the time
Grant reaches Cold Harbor,</i>

134
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,274
<i>they were impatient</i>

135
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,009
<i>as the rivers
of blood continued.</i>

136
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,269
‐ That's it, General.
One more in a minute, sir.

137
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,668
‐ General Grant, our readers
are keen to understand

138
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,570
how you lost so many men
during this campaign.

139
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,676
‐ Lee had the advantage
of being on the defensive.

140
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,927
He was entrenched.

141
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,096
I had to attack his army
where it was,

142
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,931
and I made him pay.

143
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,351
‐ Cold Harbor, General,
12,000 good Union men dead,

144
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,710
wounded, and missing.

145
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,774
‐ Do you have a question?
‐ Was it worth it, sir?

146
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,485
What did you gain?

147
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,928
‐ General Grant, sir,
if you please?

148
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,411
‐ General, you haven't
answered my question.

149
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,829
‐ Hold, please.

150
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:25,124
‐ Cold Harbor, 12,000.
What did we gain?

151
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,464
‐ We lost a lot
of boys your age...

152
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,383
fighting to keep
this country together.

153
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,552
What have you done
for the Union?

154
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,556
‐ General Grant, sir,

155
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,017
if you please?

156
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,227
<i>‐ They called me a butcher.</i>

157
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,146
‐ Hold, please.

158
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,148
<i>‐ I sometimes
could hardly bring myself</i>

159
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,983
<i>to give an order at battle.</i>

160
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,529
‐ He wasn't a butcher.

161
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,865
Many casualties came out
of the overland campaign,

162
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,742
but it was
fundamentally necessary

163
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,577
in order to win the war.

164
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,915
<i>Robert E. Lee lost 50%
of his entire army</i>

165
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,917
<i>during the exact same duration,</i>

166
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,003
<i>but is Lee remembered
as a butcher?</i>

167
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,589
‐ Being in command of a‐‐
of a large effort,

168
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:18,385
being the commander
is a pretty unique experience.

169
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,346
You know, there's no one
in whom you can confide.

170
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,724
It's a‐‐it is a lo‐‐it's lonely
at the top, as they say.

171
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,768
<i>And the casualties
are going to be tough,</i>

172
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,729
<i>and Grant is experiencing
the butcher's bill,</i>

173
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,731
<i>as they termed it.</i>

174
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:36,070
And it takes a great deal of,
again, just sheer fortitude,

175
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,657
sheer determination
to continue on

176
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,535
<i>and not let this grind you down.</i>

177
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,790
‐ What Grant accomplishes
after Cold Harbor is, I think,

178
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,627
one of his most impressive
feats of the war.

179
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,133
<i>Grant decides to flank
the Army of Northern Virginia</i>

180
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,468
<i>and then cross the even more
formidable obstacle</i>

181
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,096
<i>of the James River.</i>

182
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,722
<i>‐ He's trying to keep
the initiative,</i>

183
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,850
<i>continue the momentum,
drive the energy,</i>

184
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,435
and force Lee to react
to what he's doing.

185
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,437
This is one
of his great strengths.

186
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,817
<i>‐ It's an incredibly
dangerous maneuver</i>

187
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:19,488
<i>to move an army of that size
across a major body of water,</i>

188
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,576
especially whenever you're
faced off against an enemy

189
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,080
as wily as the Gray Fox,
Robert E. Lee.

190
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,917
<i>And so he finds a way,
secretly, at night,</i>

191
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:36,589
<i>to take an army of 115,000</i>

192
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,924
<i>and disappear.</i>

193
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,343
<i>And Robert E. Lee misses this.</i>

194
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,598
He misses the movement
of Grant's army.

195
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,933
<i>‐ To my dear wife, Julia.</i>

196
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,810
<i>Since Sunday,
we have been engaged</i>

197
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,771
<i>in one of the most perilous
movements ever executed</i>

198
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,857
<i>by a large army,</i>

199
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,276
<i>that of withdrawing
from the front of an enemy</i>

200
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,486
<i>and moving past his flank,</i>

201
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,115
<i>crossing the James River with
a bridge we have to improvise.</i>

202
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,493
<i>‐ U. S. Grant
sets out to construct</i>

203
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,121
<i>something that nobody thought
could be constructed:</i>

204
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,915
an actual pontoon bridge

205
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:14,960
across a 2,000‐foot span
of the James River.

206
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,088
<i>The bridge consists
of pontoon boats,</i>

207
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,716
<i>rather large boats
that have excellent buoyancy,</i>

208
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,636
<i>strung together and connected
by wooden planks.</i>

209
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,054
<i>And through these bridges,</i>

210
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,555
you could march
not only soldiers

211
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,683
but also artillery,
supplies, and whatnot.

212
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,518
<i>‐ This is the largest
pontoon bridge</i>

213
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,062
<i>built during the entire war.</i>

214
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,564
They built it in seven hours.
I mean, think about that.

215
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,901
<i>He's gonna cross 100,000 men
across the James River,</i>

216
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:42,780
<i>including these wagons
and artillery.</i>

217
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,699
But just think about the
engineering feat that that is.

218
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,993
That's remarkable.

219
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,580
<i>‐ And so Grant gets across
the James River,</i>

220
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,251
<i>which will put his forces
in assaulting position</i>

221
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,671
onto the crucial rail hub
of Petersburg, Virginia.

222
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,425
<i>‐ Petersburg
is the logistics hub,</i>

223
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,594
<i>the transportation hub.</i>

224
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,554
<i>It's connected
to all the supplies</i>

225
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,431
that can come up from the south.

226
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,058
If Lee is gonna
maintain his army,

227
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:15,104
let alone Richmond, the city,
he needs Petersburg.

228
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,231
So Grant understands this.

229
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,774
And so by threatening
Petersburg,

230
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,277
he, in fact, threatens Richmond.

231
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,196
<i>And now
we are talking about a siege.</i>

232
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,749
‐ Colonel Pleasants,
what's this plan of yours?

233
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,002
‐ Our Pennsylvania boys
are coal miners.

234
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,962
They can tunnel right
underneath their lines.

235
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,215
‐ How far?
‐ About 150 yards, sir.

236
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,467
They dig a shaft
right underneath them.

237
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,763
We fill the chamber with powder
and blow those rebs sky‐high.

238
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,473
‐ Could it break through
their fortifications?

239
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,435
‐ General, we have no
assurances this will work.

240
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,396
‐ My boys can do it.
‐ We have to consider‐‐

241
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,482
‐ Once the line is broken,
we go in.

242
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,485
We need to move quickly
after the blast.

243
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,613
Have artillery ready
to support the charge.

244
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:10,743
How big a hole will it blow?
‐ No one can say, sir.

245
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,870
But it'll be
an awful lot of powder.

246
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,427
<i>‐ Ulysses S. Grant had been
familiar with the use of mines</i>

247
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:32,014
<i>tunneling under the enemy
positions at Vicksburg.</i>

248
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,600
<i>He tried it several times
with limited success.</i>

249
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,524
<i>The Confederates heard
the Union working.</i>

250
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,277
<i>They feared that there was
a mine tunneling under.</i>

251
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,612
<i>They dug countermines down</i>

252
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,156
<i>to try to drop in
onto the Union troops.</i>

253
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,158
They could never find it
in time, however.

254
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,203
<i>‐ We learned through deserters
that the people believed</i>

255
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:58,123
<i>very wild rumors
about what was going on.</i>

256
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,877
<i>They said that we had mined
the whole of Petersburg</i>

257
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:06,048
<i>and they were resting
on a slumbering volcano</i>

258
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,133
<i>and did not know at what moment</i>

259
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,844
<i>they might expect that eruption.</i>

260
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,026
<i>‐ The mine was constructed
and ready to be exploded.</i>

261
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,571
<i>And I wanted to take
the occasion</i>

262
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,032
<i>to carry Petersburg, if I could.</i>

263
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,748
<i>‐ They packed the mine</i>

264
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,542
<i>underneath
the Confederate trenches</i>

265
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:45,254
<i>with 8,000 pounds of explosives</i>

266
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,133
<i>to try to blast a hole into
the Confederate earthworks.</i>

267
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:54,930
<i>‐ The fuse starts burning.</i>

268
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,349
<i>They pack sandbags
so the explosion</i>

269
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,685
<i>doesn't come out
toward the Union troops.</i>

270
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,895
‐ Go!
Move, move, move!

271
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,480
‐ Let's go!
‐ Faster, faster!

272
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,232
‐ Go!

273
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,404
<i>‐ And then the earth just shook.</i>

274
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,328
<i>It immediately killed
and disintegrated</i>

275
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,247
<i>300 South Carolinians,</i>

276
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,417
<i>blowing a massive hole
in the Confederate line.</i>

277
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,751
<i>‐ And then the Union army</i>

278
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,421
<i>gets ready
to launch frontal assaults.</i>

279
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,675
<i>‐ Despite all the thought
that went into this attack,</i>

280
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,428
<i>Grant's commanders put the
worst possible guy in command,</i>

281
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,597
<i>a guy named James Ledlie,</i>

282
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,307
known to be a drunk
and a coward,

283
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,809
in command of the attack.

284
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,729
<i>‐ The problem is that instead
of going around</i>

285
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:47,816
<i>to the rim of the crater,
as initially planned,</i>

286
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,485
<i>James Ledlie
blunders his division</i>

287
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,405
<i>right into the middle
of the crater,</i>

288
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,950
<i>and it becomes
a virtual turkey shoot.</i>

289
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,705
<i>‐ I expected our troops not
to stop in the crater at all</i>

290
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,666
<i>but to push on
to the top of the hill,</i>

291
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,710
<i>which would have
given us everything.</i>

292
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,797
<i>‐ And then they send in</i>

293
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,966
<i>the United States
Colored Troop regiments.</i>

294
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,180
<i>Nothing incited the rage
of a Confederate soldier</i>

295
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,141
like the sight
of an African‐American soldier

296
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,310
wielding a musket
in a blue uniform.

297
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,024
<i>‐ They just start killing
these guys wholesale.</i>

298
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,192
<i>Many blacks that tried
to surrender</i>

299
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,777
<i>are shot or bayoneted.</i>

300
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,531
And even white Union officers,
realizing that they also have

301
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,699
a death sentence
for leading black troops,

302
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,826
they turn their pistols
on their own soldiers

303
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,204
to try to save themselves.

304
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,747
<i>‐ And so at the crater,</i>

305
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,500
<i>what you have
is a racial massacre.</i>

306
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,588
<i>A North Carolinian
recalled his delight</i>

307
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:56,385
<i>at bayoneting these
African‐American soldiers.</i>

308
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,431
<i>It was an all‐out slaughter.</i>

309
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:28,417
‐ They slaughtered us all.

310
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,336
No place to go...

311
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,880
except to die.

312
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,097
<i>‐ The effort was
a stupendous failure.</i>

313
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,476
<i>It was the saddest affair
I witnessed in the war.</i>

314
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,609
<i>‐ Grant is really at fault
at Petersburg</i>

315
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,153
<i>in delegating so much</i>

316
00:18:56,177 --> 00:19:00,449
that it interfered
with the execution of the plan.

317
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,410
<i>He tries the experiment
of the crater</i>

318
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:07,998
<i>because he knows
how important a victory is</i>

319
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,627
during the election year.

320
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,671
<i>‐ 1864 is an election year.</i>

321
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,715
<i>You see Abraham Lincoln</i>

322
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,801
<i>running for reelection
on the Republican ticket.</i>

323
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,137
<i>The Democratic nominee
is George McClellan,</i>

324
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,182
<i>who is running
on a platform of peace.</i>

325
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,434
<i>The Democrats in 1864</i>

326
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,603
<i>want to end the war
as soon as possible.</i>

327
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,272
They are fine with letting
the Confederacy go.

328
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,319
‐ McClellan was on record
that he was willing

329
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,364
to trade emancipation for peace.

330
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:44,826
Grant considered this little
short of outright treason.

331
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,329
<i>‐ People forget that there
was not uniform support</i>

332
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,791
<i>for the Union effort
in the Northern states.</i>

333
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:55,837
Back in 1863 in New York City,
there were huge draft riots.

334
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,131
There was a lot of unrest
because it didn't seem

335
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,342
<i>as if the Union was prevailing.</i>

336
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,636
<i>So now Lee's only hope</i>

337
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,846
<i>was that Lincoln
would be defeated.</i>

338
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,016
McClellan would win
and sue for peace.

339
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,019
<i>‐ To have peace on any terms,
the South would demand</i>

340
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:15,399
<i>the restoration
of their slaves already freed.</i>

341
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,025
<i>They would demand a treaty</i>

342
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,363
<i>which would make the North
slave hunters for the South.</i>

343
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,950
‐ So '64 is a big year.

344
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:29,037
<i>The war's now no longer just
about preserving the Union.</i>

345
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,498
<i>Now it's become
a war for freedom.</i>

346
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,584
And with the election,
everything's at stake.

347
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,009
‐ General Grant...

348
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,721
I hold you
in the highest esteem,

349
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,831
but this catastrophe
in the crater...

350
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:57,315
Every day, I hear from
the press that I'm too timid

351
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:03,012
or too tyrannical,
too weak or... too tall.

352
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,742
My reelection and the outcome

353
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,895
of this miserable war...
depends on you.

354
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,419
‐ General Sherman is at
the threshold of Atlanta,

355
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,838
and I am at the threshold
of Petersburg‐‐

356
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,466
‐ And I am at the threshold
of losing the presidency.

357
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:29,222
‐ Mr. President,
you will never hear of me

358
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,558
farther from Richmond
than I am now.

359
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,063
I will fight it out
till the end.

360
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,115
‐ Hold on with a bulldog grip,

361
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:51,787
and chew and choke
as much as possible.

362
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,174
<i>‐ Grant is working with Lincoln,</i>

363
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,759
<i>very much in concert,</i>

364
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,469
on how they want
to conduct this war.

365
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,971
And we see that in how Grant
plans his campaigns.

366
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,139
<i>He's really, I think,</i>

367
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,766
<i>the first general
that Lincoln had</i>

368
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:17,270
<i>that had an overall strategy
for the entire war.</i>

369
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:24,152
<i>‐ I mean, this is still
a very fluid war, even by '64.</i>

370
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:29,616
<i>So the Union needs
some decisive wins.</i>

371
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,702
‐ One of the key prongs
of Grant's strategy

372
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:37,290
for the reduction of the South
is, of course, to take Atlanta.

373
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,253
<i>‐ If you don't topple Georgia,</i>

374
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,464
<i>which was one of the top
manpower‐delivering states</i>

375
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,299
<i>behind the Confederate
war effort,</i>

376
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,009
and you don't topple Atlanta,

377
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,805
which is a hub of industry
for the South,

378
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,682
then it makes it
possible to sustain

379
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:57,477
the Confederate war effort
for a prolonged period of time.

380
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:01,022
<i>‐ This is a no‐fail mission,
and you give it to the person</i>

381
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,275
<i>who you've developed
a level of trust</i>

382
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,194
<i>and who you know
is hard enough to do it,</i>

383
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,029
smart enough to do it,

384
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:12,367
<i>and also will do the intent
of what you want them to do</i>

385
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:17,747
<i>rather than getting off base,
and Sherman is that person.</i>

386
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,876
‐ Send this
to General Grant at once.

387
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,255
"We are in close proximity
and constantly skirmishing

388
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,756
"but are not yet able
to penetrate

389
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,925
the city's fortifications."

390
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,428
<i>‐ William Tecumseh Sherman
would lead</i>

391
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,847
<i>the military division
of Mississippi</i>

392
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,390
<i>through northwest Georgia,</i>

393
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:39,019
<i>targeting the industrial heart
of Georgia at Atlanta:</i>

394
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:42,022
the machine shops, the mills,
the factories that were

395
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:45,567
keeping the Confederate army
in the west going.

396
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,903
<i>‐ And it's Grant who, from afar,</i>

397
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,739
<i>is choreographing this effort.</i>

398
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,657
<i>And Grant and Sherman</i>

399
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:57,412
<i>maintain a constant
communication via telegraph</i>

400
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,581
despite the more
than 1,000 miles

401
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,207
that intervened between them.

402
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,627
‐ "If you can hold tight
as you are now,

403
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,712
you will destroy
most of that army."

404
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,093
"I would never advise
going backward."

405
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,387
<i>‐ As Sherman
is approaching Atlanta,</i>

406
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,431
Grant is sort of pushing him

407
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,433
that, "We need to get this done.

408
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,436
<i>We need to take Atlanta
before the election comes."</i>

409
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,940
‐ "I have lost
a good many regiments."

410
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,108
Continue sending.

411
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,945
"I might have to circle Atlanta
before I take it,

412
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,221
<i>but I will take it."</i>

413
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,290
<i>‐ We learned that Sherman
had our troops in Atlanta.</i>

414
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:47,128
<i>The news of his success
set the country aglow.</i>

415
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,632
<i>‐ Sherman drives on Atlanta,
delivering Atlanta,</i>

416
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,802
<i>and effectively, you do have
some aspects of total war.</i>

417
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,638
We are about collapsing the
will of the Confederate people

418
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,307
to realize,
"You are being defeated."

419
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,268
<i>‐ The fall of Atlanta
boosts Northern morale.</i>

420
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:06,773
<i>People now begin to see
that a Union victory is,</i>

421
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,859
<i>while not inevitable,
at least in sight.</i>

422
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:14,114
And it has an enormous impact
on the election of 1864.

423
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,494
<i>‐ Lincoln would win
the election.</i>

424
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,079
<i>What ultimately gave Lincoln</i>

425
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,456
that election on the battlefield

426
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,836
was Sherman's capture
of Atlanta.

427
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,714
This was part of Grant's
grand strategy

428
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,799
for how to bring about
an end to the war.

429
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:39,556
<i>Grant has a brilliant
strategic plan.</i>

430
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,810
<i>He's going to move multiple
armies simultaneously</i>

431
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:47,272
<i>to bring about maximum
pressure on the Confederacy</i>

432
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,733
<i>while also holding down
Robert E. Lee's</i>

433
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,402
<i>much‐vaunted
Army of Northern Virginia</i>

434
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,612
<i>at Petersburg.</i>

435
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,531
<i>‐ When Grant starts
to settle in at Petersburg,</i>

436
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,951
he sees, "If I put Lee
into a siege, he can't move."

437
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,911
"And a Robert E. Lee
who cannot maneuver

438
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,205
"is a Robert E. Lee that's not
nearly as dangerous.

439
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,374
<i>"So if I pin Lee,</i>

440
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,209
<i>"we'll eat the rest
of the Confederacy</i>

441
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,004
<i>while we stand here and watch
this all take place."</i>

442
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,551
<i>‐ So Grant decides to move</i>

443
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,054
<i>Phil Sheridan
up the Shenandoah Valley,</i>

444
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,805
<i>threatening
the logistical supply line</i>

445
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,265
<i>of Robert E. Lee's army,</i>

446
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,059
<i>threatening the bread basket
of the Confederacy</i>

447
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,393
<i>that for three years</i>

448
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,645
<i>had supplied
the Army of Northern Virginia.</i>

449
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,273
<i>‐ To General Sheridan:</i>

450
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:34,069
<i>Do all the damage to railroads
and crops you can.</i>

451
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:38,782
<i>We want the Shenandoah Valley
to remain a barren waste.</i>

452
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:43,578
<i>Move quickly with the goal of
destroying all in your path.</i>

453
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,246
<i>‐ After Philip Sheridan</i>

454
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,082
<i>destroys the Shenandoah Valley,</i>

455
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:50,085
<i>William Tecumseh Sherman
marches through Georgia.</i>

456
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,586
<i>Grant famously says,</i>

457
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,630
"The Confederacy
is a hollow shell.

458
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,382
I know it, and Sherman
is about to prove it."

459
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,385
<i>‐ To General Sherman:
If you are satisfied</i>

460
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,638
<i>the trip to the seacoast
can be made,</i>

461
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,598
<i>you may make it,</i>

462
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,060
<i>destroying all the railroad
as you think best.</i>

463
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:10,063
<i>‐ What Sherman is doing
in Georgia</i>

464
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,941
<i>is sending a message
to Lee's army:</i>

465
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,110
"You guys hold out here
in Richmond

466
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,278
"and you hold out here
in Petersburg,

467
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,502
<i>but we're just tearing out
the guts of the Confederacy."</i>

468
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,915
<i>‐ And meanwhile,
Robert E. Lee's army</i>

469
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,292
<i>is becoming malnourished.</i>

470
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,419
<i>His men are living in conditions</i>

471
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:37,131
<i>that are rife for disease.</i>

472
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:41,094
The biological decline
of his men

473
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,137
is beginning to show
to Robert E. Lee

474
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,431
in a way
that he'd never seen before.

475
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,813
<i>‐ They are severely worn down,</i>

476
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:55,108
<i>and they are the ones that
have to defend Petersburg.</i>

477
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,322
<i>Petersburg is the logistics hub,</i>

478
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,866
<i>the transportation hub</i>

479
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,493
<i>connected
to five separate railroads</i>

480
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,329
<i>that come into Petersburg
that feed Richmond,</i>

481
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,665
<i>the capital of the Confederacy.</i>

482
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,834
Robert E. Lee
can't lose Petersburg,

483
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,961
or he loses Richmond.

484
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:18,006
<i>‐ By April of 1865,
Grant has captured</i>

485
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,841
<i>all of the important railroads</i>

486
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,135
at Petersburg
with the exception of one,

487
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,846
and that's
the Southside Railroad.

488
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,681
<i>And there's
a crucial intersection</i>

489
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,684
<i>that commands control
of the Southside Railroad.</i>

490
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,228
<i>It's known as Five Forks.</i>

491
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,195
<i>‐ Everything looked favorable
to the defeat of the enemy</i>

492
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:45,199
<i>and the capture
of Petersburg and Richmond</i>

493
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:49,329
<i>if the proper effort was made.</i>

494
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,664
<i>‐ And so Grant will unleash
Phil Sheridan</i>

495
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,499
<i>to get out in front
of Robert E. Lee</i>

496
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,543
<i>and keep him from getting
to that railroad</i>

497
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,045
<i>and those supplies.</i>

498
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:03,134
<i>‐ It's a vicious fight.</i>

499
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:07,305
<i>At one point, Sheridan, he's
actually on horseback himself</i>

500
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:11,059
<i>and launches himself
over Confederate attackers,</i>

501
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,561
<i>ordering the men to surrender.</i>

502
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:17,857
<i>‐ The Confederates
will lose this battle,</i>

503
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:21,069
and they lose
the Southside Railroad.

504
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,737
<i>‐ And now, finally, we find</i>

505
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,989
<i>Grant is able
to sever those supply lines</i>

506
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,408
that come into Petersburg,
and Robert E. Lee

507
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,536
now has to realize,
"We have to abandon Richmond."

508
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:36,501
<i>‐ Richmond was in
the most utter confusion.</i>

509
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,419
<i>The city was on fire,</i>

510
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:42,757
<i>started by some connected
with the retreating army.</i>

511
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,635
<i>When it was evacuated,
the Confederacy at once</i>

512
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,263
<i>began to crumble and fade away.</i>

513
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,433
<i>‐ The Confederates
now scramble to the west</i>

514
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,811
<i>to make this desperate attempt
to link up</i>

515
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,563
<i>with Joe Johnston's
Army of Tennessee.</i>

516
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,566
And if they can link up again,
they can prolong the war.

517
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,986
<i>And so it becomes a chase.</i>

518
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,280
<i>‐ Lee's troops were pursued
by our cavalry so hotly</i>

519
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:10,410
<i>and closely that they threw
away ammunition, clothing,</i>

520
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:13,287
<i>and almost everything
to lighten their loads.</i>

521
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,790
‐ No sooner has Lee
evacuated his lines

522
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,750
than Grant takes off after him.

523
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:21,462
Any other Union general would
have marched into Petersburg

524
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,089
and marched into Richmond

525
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,967
<i>with bands playing and great
celebrations and parties</i>

526
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,636
<i>and all kinds of
self‐congratulatory speeches</i>

527
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,139
<i>and reviews and messages
sent back to Washington</i>

528
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,807
<i>about how wonderful it was,</i>

529
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,416
<i>they have now captured Richmond.</i>

530
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,811
Not Grant.

531
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,027
‐ One of ours, sir.

532
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,029
A messenger
from General Sheridan

533
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,780
who made it through their lines.

534
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,889
‐ Soldier.

535
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:00,984
Good job, soldier.

536
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:11,512
Sheridan wants me
to come to him at Jetersville.

537
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,681
Says he can finish Lee.

538
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,392
We'll go right away.
I'll take the advance troops.

539
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,852
‐ General, you're the commander.

540
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,687
You've gotta stay‐‐
‐ We'll go right away.

541
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,486
<i>‐ Grant is managing more people</i>

542
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,030
<i>than anyone else
in the world at this moment.</i>

543
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,866
<i>And then he gets a message
from Phil Sheridan saying,</i>

544
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,409
<i>"I think we can capture</i>

545
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,870
<i>or destroy
the Confederate army now."</i>

546
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,914
<i>As the commander
of all those armies,</i>

547
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,374
<i>sometimes your presence
is simply needed.</i>

548
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,876
<i>No matter how tired he was,</i>

549
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,920
no matter how far away
Sheridan was,

550
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,713
Grant was gonna get there.

551
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,049
<i>‐ I then started
with a few of my staff</i>

552
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,051
<i>going directly
through the woods.</i>

553
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:53,471
<i>The night being dark,
our progress was slow.</i>

554
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,181
<i>Sometimes I had great difficulty</i>

555
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,350
<i>in getting through the lines.</i>

556
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,728
<i>‐ We've got Lee
in a box, General.</i>

557
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,230
‐ We should be protecting
our position at Richmond,

558
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,564
not chasing Lee.

559
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,857
‐ We can't let him slip.

560
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,401
I can capture
his whole damn army!

561
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,530
‐ Holding Richmond
won't end this war.

562
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:13,741
Destroying Lee's army will.

563
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,245
Go after him.
‐ Yes, sir.

564
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,412
<i>‐ It now became</i>

565
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,248
<i>a life‐and‐death struggle
for Lee</i>

566
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,209
<i>to get south to his provisions.</i>

567
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:26,695
<i>We wanted to get ahead of Lee
and cut him off.</i>

568
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,934
<i>‐ The armies finally met
on Sailor's Creek.</i>

569
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,565
<i>The enemy's loss was very heavy.</i>

570
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:51,737
<i>Lee's army
was rapidly crumbling.</i>

571
00:32:55,182 --> 00:33:01,831
<i>‐ The final battle between
Grant's army and Robert E. Lee</i>

572
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:07,837
<i>comes at Sailor's Creek,
April 6, 1865.</i>

573
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:10,423
<i>‐ Lee's army haven't eaten
for five days.</i>

574
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,967
<i>He's had 2/3 of his force
whittled away</i>

575
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,636
<i>by attacks from his rear.</i>

576
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,097
<i>He is out of options.</i>

577
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,266
<i>‐ Robert E. Lee sees the men</i>

578
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:24,520
<i>streaming from
the battlefield in chaos,</i>

579
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:28,316
<i>and Lee turns, and he says
to one of his staff officers,</i>

580
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,110
<i>"My God,
has the army dissolved?"</i>

581
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,950
<i>‐ 7,000 of his men
were made prisoners.</i>

582
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,120
<i>I knew that the men
who had fought so gallantly</i>

583
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:45,041
<i>and so long for the cause
which they believed in</i>

584
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,375
<i>had lost hope.</i>

585
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,877
‐ Come on, keep moving!

586
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,381
<i>‐ Grant knows
Lee's out of options,</i>

587
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,009
<i>and he is counting on Lee</i>

588
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,471
<i>to be chivalrous
and end the war.</i>

589
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,517
<i>‐ To General R.E. Lee:</i>

590
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,646
<i>The result of the last week
must convince you</i>

591
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:10,191
<i>of the hopelessness
of further resistance.</i>

592
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,194
<i>I regard it as my duty
to shift from myself</i>

593
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:16,822
<i>the responsibility of any
further effusion of blood...</i>

594
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,036
<i>By asking of you
the surrender of that portion</i>

595
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,705
<i>of the Confederate States Army</i>

596
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,750
<i>known as
the Army of Northern Virginia.</i>

597
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:34,548
<i>‐ Lee realizes
that the game is over,</i>

598
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,550
<i>and so he sends
a message to Grant:</i>

599
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,303
<i>"If we could discuss matters</i>

600
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,972
"as you had previously
indicated,

601
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,891
I would be happy
to meet with you."

602
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,559
<i>‐ When Lee talks
about having to go</i>

603
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,270
<i>and capitulate to Grant,
Lee says,</i>

604
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:50,064
<i>"I would rather go die
a thousand deaths</i>

605
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,733
<i>than go do
what I'm about to do."</i>

606
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,901
But he asks for the cease‐fire

607
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,487
to talk about
terms of surrender.

608
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,823
<i>‐ A messenger came up to Grant</i>

609
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,075
<i>and gave him the letter
from Lee saying,</i>

610
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,954
<i>"Can you meet me at the McLean
house in Appomattox?'</i>

611
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:09,542
<i>And so he went to Appomattox
to meet Lee.</i>

612
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,714
<i>‐ It all ends at the
Wilbur McLean farmhouse.</i>

613
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,303
<i>Robert E. Lee
stands in his best uniform.</i>

614
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,266
<i>Lee dreads having to do this.</i>

615
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,435
‐ Dismount!

616
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,712
‐ General Lee.

617
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,363
‐ General Grant.

618
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,967
‐ Perhaps you remember,

619
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,953
we met once
back in the Mexican War.

620
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:51,310
‐ Yes, I'm sure you're right.
I don't quite recall.

621
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,254
‐ I was with
the Fourth Regiment.

622
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,317
‐ It was a long time ago.

623
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,197
‐ Please.

624
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,879
<i>‐ As they sit there
in that room,</i>

625
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,841
<i>it's truly a remarkable scene.</i>

626
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,093
You capture this whole nature
of the changing character

627
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:27,304
of war in that farmhouse.

628
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,265
<i>You have Robert E. Lee,</i>

629
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:32,393
<i>immaculately dressed
with his sash and his sword,</i>

630
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,312
<i>a patrician
of the Virginia caste society,</i>

631
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,773
<i>the son of
a Revolutionary War general,</i>

632
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,568
<i>a single commander
commanding as if he were</i>

633
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,570
<i>a 16th‐century prince</i>

634
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,864
representing the last
of the old wars.

635
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,868
<i>Meanwhile, you have
Ulysses S. Grant,</i>

636
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,120
<i>representing the first
of the new.</i>

637
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:53,080
<i>Grant has been riding overland.</i>

638
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,707
<i>His boots are mud‐spattered.</i>

639
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,333
<i>He's the son of a tanner,</i>

640
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,253
<i>a poor, humble,
hardscrabble background.</i>

641
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,465
<i>He sits now at the top
of this meritocracy</i>

642
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:05,885
<i>surrounded by
a very capable staff.</i>

643
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:09,054
And he has an American Indian
on his staff,

644
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,766
<i>Eli Parker, a brigadier general,</i>

645
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,809
<i>a Seneca Indian
that's gonna write out</i>

646
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,436
<i>the terms of surrender.</i>

647
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:21,275
<i>‐ General Grant...</i>

648
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,903
we should write terms now.

649
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,491
‐ General Parker.

650
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,310
‐ At least there's one
real American in this room.

651
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:01,273
‐ We're all Americans here, sir.

652
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:37,309
‐ Your terms are generous.

653
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,711
They'll have
a good effect on my men.

654
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,814
‐ Good.

655
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,026
And I must ask you in return

656
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,028
that you ask the rest
of your armies

657
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,697
lay down their arms.

658
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,407
They'll listen to you,

659
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:54,702
and this war can end quickly
without further suffering.

660
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,580
‐ That's not up to me.

661
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,665
That's up to my president.

662
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,338
‐ There's only
one president now.

663
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,728
<i>‐ I felt like anything rather
than rejoicing at the downfall</i>

664
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:24,398
<i>of a foe who had fought
so long and valiantly</i>

665
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,568
<i>and had suffered so much
for a cause,</i>

666
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,695
<i>though that cause was,
I believe,</i>

667
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:33,532
<i>one of the worst for which
a people ever fought.</i>

668
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,454
<i>‐ Grant and Lincoln wanted,
at all costs,</i>

669
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:41,373
<i>to prevent a kind
of guerilla warfare,</i>

670
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,292
which is why Grant
gave the terms

671
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:47,087
that he did to Lee
at Appomattox.

672
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,590
<i>‐ The surrender terms
are relatively lenient.</i>

673
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,800
<i>Officers can keep
their sidearms.</i>

674
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,470
<i>Men with horses
can keep their horses</i>

675
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,555
so that they might go back
and plant crops.

676
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,267
This is an idea of,
"How do we win the peace?"

677
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,729
<i>‐ Grant really tried to honor
what Lincoln asked for.</i>

678
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,774
Let him up easy.
Let these men go home.

679
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:10,611
Just lay down your guns,
and just go home.

680
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:14,573
<i>‐ Grant actually went a little
bit further than Lincoln</i>

681
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,409
<i>might have wanted him to.</i>

682
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:21,121
He paroled the Southern army,
Lee's army.

683
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:26,335
<i>And that meant Lee himself
would be free from arrest.</i>

684
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,757
<i>‐ Very significantly,
Grant did not allow</i>

685
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,885
his soldiers to in any way
gloat or celebrate.

686
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:38,973
He felt that that would simply
be rubbing salt into the wounds

687
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,975
of these defeated
Confederate soldiers.

688
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,727
And I think the fact
that Grant had experienced

689
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:48,148
so much failure in his own life
gave him a special sensitivity

690
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,818
<i>and tact in dealing with these</i>

691
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:54,697
<i>defeated Confederate soldiers
at Appomattox.</i>

692
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:58,158
<i>So you can see
that there's this yearning</i>

693
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,161
<i>to be brothers again.</i>

694
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,123
<i>There were shared memories
and shared experiences</i>

695
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:07,334
<i>that these men had had,
and these are people</i>

696
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,295
<i>who had belonged
to the same nation</i>

697
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,714
and that would again.

698
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,677
<i>‐ When news of the surrender
of Lee's army</i>

699
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:21,181
<i>gets back to Washington,
Lincoln is so thrilled.</i>

700
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:25,811
A crowd of well‐wishers comes
with bands to serenade him.

701
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:29,523
<i>Lincoln comes out and gives
them an impromptu speech.</i>

702
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,861
<i>‐ Now, fellow citizens,
give three good, hearty cheers</i>

703
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:38,824
<i>for General Grant
and all under his command.</i>

704
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,659
<i>‐ Grant stands in the front rank</i>

705
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,495
<i>of great Americans of all time.</i>

706
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,207
He was the man
who saved the Union.

707
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,793
<i>‐ Grant is one of the greatest
military strategists</i>

708
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:53,005
<i>that the United States
has produced.</i>

709
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:56,091
It is his strategy implemented
and pushed forward

710
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,927
to its conclusion
that wins the war.

711
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,891
<i>‐ The news of Appomattox</i>

712
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:07,102
<i>is immediately reported
across the country.</i>

713
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,856
There was a jubilant feeling,
at least in the‐‐in the North,

714
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,903
<i>and a great feeling of relief.</i>

715
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,947
<i>‐ There's such this feeling
of celebration</i>

716
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,657
<i>throughout the North:</i>

717
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,077
<i>the fireworks
that are being set off,</i>

718
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,370
<i>people in the streets
celebrating,</i>

719
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,749
the bunting that's being
put up all across

720
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,585
Washington and New York
and elsewhere,

721
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,130
<i>and ministers across the North
begin preparing sermons</i>

722
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,925
<i>to talk about
the rebirth of the nation.</i>

723
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,858
‐ I'm relieved we didn't
go to the theater tonight,

724
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,946
and the children will be
so happy to see you, finally.

725
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,806
‐ It's been a long time.
‐ Mm.

726
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,256
Do you know that man?

727
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,469
‐ I don't care for such looks.

728
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,265
Driver!

729
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,643
<i>‐ On the night of April 14th,</i>

730
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,103
<i>the Lincolns had invited
the Grants</i>

731
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,981
to attend Ford's Theatre
with them.

732
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:38,610
<i>But they were instead planning
to visit their children.</i>

733
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,613
<i>While the Grants were
en route to the train,</i>

734
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,158
<i>a man on horseback galloped up,</i>

735
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:46,994
tried to thrust his head in
as if to see who was there.

736
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:50,581
<i>Always afterwards,
Julia Dent Grant believed</i>

737
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,833
<i>that man had been
John Wilkes Booth.</i>

738
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,061
‐ General Grant.

739
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,772
‐ What is it?

740
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,632
‐ These are for you, sir.

741
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,510
‐ Excuse me, gentlemen.

742
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:39,755
‐ What is it, Ulys?

743
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:42,174
‐ I have to return
to Washington.

744
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:47,054
President Lincoln has been shot.

745
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,849
He won't survive.

746
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,529
<i>‐ John Wilkes Booth
had gathered a small band</i>

747
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,448
<i>of conspirators</i>

748
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,743
<i>because Booth planned
not only to murder Lincoln</i>

749
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,621
<i>but to murder
Vice President Andrew Johnson,</i>

750
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:17,960
<i>Secretary of State Seward,
and General Ulysses S. Grant.</i>

751
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,544
He planned to decapitate
the entire

752
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,463
United States government,
if he could do it.

753
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:32,099
<i>‐ I did not know what it meant.</i>

754
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,184
<i>Here was the rebellion
put down in the field</i>

755
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,812
<i>and starting up in the gutters.</i>

756
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:40,732
<i>Now we had to fight it
as assassination.</i>

757
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,442
<i>‐ Grant gets back in Washington</i>

758
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,945
<i>by 10:00 the next day,</i>

759
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:48,115
<i>and Andrew Johnson
is already being sworn in</i>

760
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,702
<i>as president
of the United States.</i>

761
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:56,581
What a different world
Ulysses Grant has returned to.

762
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:08,760
<i>‐ The joy that I had witnessed
among the people in the street</i>

763
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,305
<i>and in public places
in Washington</i>

764
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,807
<i>had been turned to grief.</i>

765
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:18,145
<i>The city was in reality
a city of mourning.</i>

766
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,814
<i>‐ Lee surrenders to Grant
on April 9th,</i>

767
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,816
<i>and only a week later,</i>

768
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,819
on Good Friday,
Lincoln is assassinated.

769
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:29,990
And a city that had been
so full of hope

770
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,826
and joy and messages of peace

771
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,787
<i>is immediately
brought to mourning.</i>

772
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:39,499
<i>And the churches that had been
decorated for Easter Sunday,</i>

773
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:43,503
<i>full of their lilies
and other symbols of peace,</i>

774
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,465
<i>are now draped in mourning.</i>

775
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:49,343
<i>Only days after coming back
from Appomattox</i>

776
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,511
<i>and being this great,
victorious general,</i>

777
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,348
<i>now Grant is tasked
with planning the funeral</i>

778
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:57,142
<i>of a man who had been
not only his president</i>

779
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:01,104
<i>but also had become
a dear friend.</i>

780
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:04,816
<i>‐ To know Lincoln personally
was to love and respect him</i>

781
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,195
<i>for his great qualities
of heart and head.</i>

782
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,280
<i>His death was
the greatest possible</i>

783
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,366
<i>calamity to the country</i>

784
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,369
<i>and especially
to the people of the South.</i>

785
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,544
<i>‐ After the war,
the South is devastated.</i>

786
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,215
<i>What was all of their wealth
has largely been wiped out.</i>

787
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,549
<i>Lincoln gets killed.</i>

788
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,344
<i>Now who's gonna provide
that stability?</i>

789
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:35,097
Who is gonna be the one man
who can provide that stable,

790
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,182
guiding hand on the nation?

791
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,894
<i>‐ When the war ends,</i>

792
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,271
<i>Ulysses S. Grant
is still general in chief.</i>

793
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,941
<i>And this becomes
extremely significant</i>

794
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:51,238
because there's nobody who has
a more comprehensive view

795
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,281
of what's going on in the South

796
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,201
in the years after
the Civil War than Grant.

797
00:48:56,225 --> 00:49:00,288
<i>‐ And so in 1865,
Grant's duties,</i>

798
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:03,458
<i>his responsibilities
as general of the armies,</i>

799
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,294
was to run
the largest civil project

800
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,422
ever the federal government
had taken on,

801
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,966
<i>known as Reconstruction.</i>

802
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:19,141
<i>Reconstruction, fundamentally,
was military occupation.</i>

803
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,935
<i>And it was organized around
five military districts</i>

804
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,854
<i>within the American South.</i>

805
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,027
<i>‐ Reconstruction
was three things.</i>

806
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,738
<i>It was to rebuild
infrastructure in the South.</i>

807
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:38,618
It was to help transition
newly freed people

808
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,912
and what freedom
could look like for them,

809
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,957
<i>most of whom
are completely illiterate,</i>

810
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,961
<i>who have no property,
who have no prospects,</i>

811
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,838
<i>but who have desire.</i>

812
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:52,424
<i>And it was to restructure
legal systems</i>

813
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:55,343
<i>to help protect
newly freed people</i>

814
00:49:55,367 --> 00:50:01,266
<i>and to address this idea
of equality for everyone.</i>

815
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:07,606
‐ But I don't think anyone
recognized the true magnitude

816
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:12,277
of what Reconstruction was
going to look like in America,

817
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:15,363
the level and number
of challenges

818
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,325
of problems that could
potentially emerge

819
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,368
from the end
of the American Civil War.

820
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:25,957
<i>‐ The success of the Union army</i>

821
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,335
<i>doesn't mean a return
to the status quo.</i>

822
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:32,339
<i>It means the Union restored
without slavery.</i>

823
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:37,344
And so the most egregious part
of Union victory

824
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:40,722
for former Confederates
is emancipation.

825
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,308
<i>And so they push back on it
from the very beginning.</i>

826
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:46,520
<i>They push back in legal ways
called the Black Codes.</i>

827
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:51,399
<i>‐ They create a series
of actions</i>

828
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:55,695
<i>that will mirror
the conditions of slavery.</i>

829
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:59,824
And so throughout the 1860s,
in major cities,

830
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:03,537
conflicts would erupt between
former Confederate soldiers

831
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:07,832
<i>and free African‐Americans.</i>

832
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:13,129
<i>‐ You see this conflict
in New Orleans in 1866.</i>

833
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:16,216
African‐Americans and a handful
of white Republicans

834
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,010
are trying to write a new
constitution for the state

835
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,846
that would recognize
African‐American voting

836
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,056
and civil rights.

837
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:28,520
<i>What happens is, a local
newspaper whips up a frenzy.</i>

838
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:31,398
<i>Ex‐Confederates gather,
trying to stop them.</i>

839
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,191
<i>It was an absolute powder keg.</i>

840
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:38,029
‐ We stand here today
as free men,

841
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,240
but that's just the beginning.

842
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:42,242
We have to stand up
for our rights.

843
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,494
We have to fight‐‐

844
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:59,199
‐ Come on!
Out the back!

845
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,266
‐ I just got a telegraph
from General Sheridan.

846
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,603
This outrage in New Orleans
must be punished.

847
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,104
I simply can't allow‐‐

848
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,106
‐ General, we don't know
if the freed men provoked this.

849
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,566
It was a riot.

850
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,067
‐ This is an atrocity.

851
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,946
Sheridan is there.

852
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,448
‐ They're gettin' away!

853
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,408
<i>‐ And the way he tells it,
this is a massacre.</i>

854
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,292
Don't let him get away!

855
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,919
Hold him, boys!

856
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,596
‐ It's my duty
to protect the people.

857
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,018
‐ Try telling that
to President Johnson.

858
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,857
‐ Instead, I wish
I could speak with Lincoln.

859
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,196
We could declare martial law.

860
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,156
‐ Sir‐‐ ‐ It won't be popular,

861
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,325
but I don't want another war.

862
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,996
We can't have another war.

863
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:19,297
<i>‐ So in 1866,
Grant receives reports</i>

864
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,675
<i>from his commanders
throughout the South,</i>

865
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:25,303
and it becomes quite evident
that there are hundreds

866
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,807
<i>if not thousands of so‐called
outrages of African‐Americans</i>

867
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:33,353
<i>being killed in horrific,
barbarious ways.</i>

868
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:37,524
<i>‐ Grant is constantly
compiling statistics</i>

869
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,067
<i>for President Andrew Johnson</i>

870
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,985
in terms of the scale
of violence

871
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:44,698
going on against the 4 million
former slaves in the South,

872
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:47,200
and Johnson refuses
to believe it.

873
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:53,373
<i>‐ Andrew Johnson is able
to emerge as a figure</i>

874
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:55,834
<i>who is a friend
of the Confederacy</i>

875
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:57,877
who will not
implement Reconstruction

876
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,046
with the great force
of the federal government.

877
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,007
<i>‐ Grant is
increasingly frustrated</i>

878
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:06,636
<i>and furious that Johnson
is trying to impede</i>

879
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,556
<i>any sort of military
intervention in the South.</i>

880
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,391
<i>But I think we underestimate</i>

881
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:15,186
<i>how politically savvy Grant was.</i>

882
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,189
<i>‐ Grant is an interesting man
as a political figure.</i>

883
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,358
He doesn't seek out
the nomination

884
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,235
for the presidency ever,

885
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,987
but he doesn't turn down
the nomination

886
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:26,156
for the presidency either.

887
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,869
<i>‐ Because of the Civil War</i>

888
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,370
<i>and because of Grant's heroism‐‐</i>

889
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,580
<i>and at Appomattox,</i>

890
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:36,249
Grant becomes the hero
not only in the North

891
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,209
but in the South
for his fairness

892
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,503
to the defeated
Confederate troops‐‐

893
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,422
<i>Grant enjoyed a certain status</i>

894
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:43,965
<i>and sort of levitated</i>

895
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,926
<i>above the level
of American politics.</i>

896
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,095
<i>‐ And not unlike Washington,</i>

897
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,848
<i>that Washington was
the father of the country</i>

898
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:54,726
<i>and Grant was the savior
of the country</i>

899
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,520
is something that is
on many people's minds.

900
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:01,399
<i>‐ And of course, at that time,
it was considered unseemly</i>

901
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:04,110
<i>for a candidate to openly
campaign for president,</i>

902
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:07,071
<i>and that was
just fine with Grant.</i>

903
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,281
And rather than campaigning,

904
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:11,784
he's kind of swept
into the presidency.

905
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,288
<i>‐ Grant wins the 1868 election</i>

906
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:18,458
<i>in an electoral
college landslide,</i>

907
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:21,211
<i>but his presidency
would be the presidency</i>

908
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:24,297
<i>that had the responsibility
of securing political rights</i>

909
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,216
<i>for African‐Americans.</i>

910
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,301
He had an enormous
responsibility

911
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,761
and an incredibly difficult one,

912
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:31,804
because there were
so many people,

913
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,848
both in the South
and in the North,

914
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,934
who were opposed to those ideas.

915
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:39,354
<i>But he was given
the difficult task, not once,</i>

916
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:41,814
<i>but twice, of doing this,</i>

917
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,818
<i>winning the war
and then winning the peace.</i>

918
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,820
‐ In here, Mr. President.

919
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,252
<i>‐ The country having
just emerged</i>

920
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:07,840
<i>from a great rebellion, many
questions will come before it</i>

921
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:11,219
<i>for settlement
in the next four years</i>

922
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:13,012
<i>which preceding administrations</i>

923
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:16,516
<i>have never had to deal with.</i>

924
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,186
<i>In meeting these,
it is desirable</i>

925
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,855
<i>that they should be
approached calmly,</i>

926
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:27,652
<i>without prejudice, hate,
or sectional pride.</i>

927
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:34,492
<i>I ask patient forbearance,
one toward another,</i>

928
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:37,745
<i>throughout the land
and a determined effort</i>

929
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,831
<i>on the part of every citizen</i>

930
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:44,443
<i>to do his share towards
cementing a happy Union.</i>

931
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,510
<i>‐ I feel the responsibilities
of the position</i>

932
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,721
<i>but accept them without fear.</i>

933
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:57,890
<i>And I bring to it
a desire and determination</i>

934
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:01,728
<i>to fill it
to the best of my ability.</i>

935
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,522
<i>‐ When Ulysses Grant
is inaugurated as president,</i>

936
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:09,569
<i>he has what amounts to
a colossal mess on his hands.</i>

937
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,070
He has not only Reconstruction,

938
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:14,073
but he has a botched attempt
at beginning Reconstruction

939
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:18,870
<i>under Andrew Johnson
that he has to overcome.</i>

940
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:22,206
And that's going to create
a formidable agenda

941
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,958
for him to deal with
as president.

942
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:29,255
<i>Reconstruction meant
the reintroduction</i>

943
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:34,552
<i>of the Confederate states
back into the American Union,</i>

944
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,387
<i>which sounds pretty simple,</i>

945
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,890
<i>but you've got to have some way</i>

946
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:42,268
<i>of reintegrating
the Southern economy</i>

947
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,145
<i>with the rest
of the national economy.</i>

948
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:48,274
Then you have to think about
what you're going to do

949
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,776
with the freed slaves.

950
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,612
<i>The 13th Amendment
abolishes slavery,</i>

951
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:55,615
<i>but what does it do beyond that?</i>

952
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,784
<i>‐ When Grant becomes president
of the United States,</i>

953
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:01,996
<i>he is absolutely committed
to the aims of Reconstruction.</i>

954
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:06,417
<i>He is committed to making
America fully just,</i>

955
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:10,797
fully equal for black people
and white people.

956
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:17,136
He is committed to this in his
own simple and elegant way.

957
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,097
‐ So it's very important
to remember that Grant

958
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,516
is the first American president

959
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,810
to govern after
the 14th Amendment

960
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:27,271
<i>that guarantees equal rights
before the law</i>

961
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:30,441
<i>and, most importantly,
after the 15th Amendment,</i>

962
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:34,278
<i>which gives black men
the right to vote.</i>

963
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,906
<i>After the passage
of the 15th Amendment,</i>

964
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:41,285
African‐American men began to
vote in extraordinary numbers.

965
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,287
<i>‐ Americans are finally
who they say they are.</i>

966
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,456
<i>All men are truly created equal.</i>

967
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,792
I think this utterly
is reflected of Grant

968
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,419
and what he believes
this nation is

969
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,295
and what it should aspire to be.

970
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:57,009
<i>‐ So now we have 3.5 million
people from Mississippi</i>

971
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,887
<i>to Louisiana to South Carolina</i>

972
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:03,516
voting themselves and the
candidates of their choosing.

973
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,686
<i>‐ African‐Americans
in most Southern states</i>

974
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:10,857
<i>were elected for the first
time to Washington, D. C.,</i>

975
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:13,860
<i>as senators and as congressmen</i>

976
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,862
<i>but on a state level as well.</i>

977
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,656
And all these things,
this incredible

978
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,200
biracial experiment,
was happening.

979
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:25,371
‐ And the changes that they
make are extraordinary.

980
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:30,042
<i>They establish free public
education for every child.</i>

981
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,336
<i>They establish systems
that make it easier</i>

982
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:36,048
<i>for people to vote and to
be able to acquire land.</i>

983
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:39,719
‐ It's a period of possibility
in American history.

984
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,053
<i>It was not just
a political project.</i>

985
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,389
<i>It was also a social project.</i>

986
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,434
<i>And you see the building
of schools,</i>

987
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:48,352
<i>the building of banks.</i>

988
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,563
<i>You see more people
are learning to read</i>

989
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,858
<i>among African‐American
communities than ever before.</i>

990
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:55,485
<i>‐ You probably had more
political progress</i>

991
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,029
for black people than you
actually had in the North.

992
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:00,406
You know, not just because
there were more black people

993
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,701
but because of what was
happening was so revolutionary.

994
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:09,207
<i>‐ There is a profoundly
progressive agenda</i>

995
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:14,086
<i>moving the arc towards justice
for everybody.</i>

996
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,006
And then it falls apart.

997
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,721
<i>‐ The Ku Klux Klan
very quickly grows</i>

998
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:26,933
<i>to become a paramilitary
insurgency</i>

999
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,769
<i>in which armed
Confederate veterans</i>

1000
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,313
will turn to violent tactics.

1001
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,108
‐ There were thousands of blacks

1002
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:40,947
who were killed for registering
and daring to‐‐to vote,

1003
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:44,450
<i>and black voting
would drop off to near zero.</i>

1004
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:47,620
<i>‐ In many counties throughout
the ex‐Confederate South,</i>

1005
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,289
the Ku Klux Klan
is really controlling

1006
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,875
the levers of power,

1007
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:57,463
<i>and they are meting out their
brand of vigilante justice.</i>

1008
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:18,025
‐ Mr. President.

1009
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:24,866
You're thinking like
a politician, not a general.

1010
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:28,035
‐ Well, there's more than
one way to get things done.

1011
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:33,708
‐ But these Ku Kluxers' minds
won't be changed by words.

1012
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:36,002
You of all people know that.

1013
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:41,007
‐ Yes, and I know the misery
that the use of force leads to.

1014
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:45,511
‐ That misery is all on
my people's heads right now.

1015
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:50,141
Should we just wait, be patient?

1016
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:53,853
‐ No.
That wouldn't be fair.

1017
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,983
You will see the general
in me soon enough.

1018
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:05,656
<i>‐ Frederick Douglass,
he understands</i>

1019
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,201
<i>Grant's huge popularity
among the people,</i>

1020
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,872
and he wants to help Grant

1021
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:17,376
be that next great
American leader

1022
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,048
in the vein
of a George Washington.

1023
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:25,343
<i>‐ But the question is,
what exactly can he do</i>

1024
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:26,969
<i>about the activities
of the Klan?</i>

1025
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:30,056
Because this is,
after all, a state matter.

1026
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,350
<i>What Congress does
is to equip Grant</i>

1027
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:35,227
<i>with the Ku Klux Klan Act.</i>

1028
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:39,190
‐ Grant felt so strongly
about the KKK Act

1029
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:41,734
that he actually marched up
to Capitol Hill

1030
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,737
with his entire cabinet
to lobby for it.

1031
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:48,532
This was a very powerful
and sweeping act.

1032
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:51,744
<i>‐ It allows Grant
to declare martial law</i>

1033
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,789
<i>and send federal troops
in directly to intervene.</i>

1034
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,091
‐ I've been there,
seen it myself, Mr. President.

1035
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:08,719
The Ku Kluxers
are all over those towns.

1036
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:14,892
They're farmers,
sheriffs, politicians.

1037
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,769
‐ You served in the war,
didn't you?

1038
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,896
‐ Yes, sir.
Missouri.

1039
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,857
‐ And you faced your share
of rebel guerillas there.

1040
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,484
How'd you deal with them?

1041
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:27,446
‐ Well, sir, we had to find
the enemy any way we could.

1042
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,366
We used informants, spies.

1043
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,077
‐ Exactly.
‐ We had to gather information,

1044
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:37,039
identities, find out
who the leaders were.

1045
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:42,169
‐ And that's what you're gonna
do now against the Klan.

1046
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:47,258
After you learn who your
targets are, you'll strike.

1047
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:52,638
And I don't care if they're
doctors or farmers or lawyers.

1048
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,141
You arrest them and try them.

1049
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,809
‐ Yes, sir.

1050
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,478
‐ You're gonna root them out,
Merrill,

1051
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,022
no matter what it takes.

1052
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,482
‐ You can count on me,
Mr. President.

1053
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:15,161
<i>‐ And so in 1871,
several companies</i>

1054
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:19,498
<i>of the Seventh Cavalry
are sent into South Carolina,</i>

1055
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:22,043
<i>where, under
Major Lewis Merrill,</i>

1056
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:26,088
they actually go out and begin
arresting large numbers

1057
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,841
of Klan members
to bring them to justice.

1058
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,801
<i>‐ It took a lot of</i>

1059
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,303
<i>counterintelligence operations,</i>

1060
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:34,513
<i>of getting to know who
the political leaders were,</i>

1061
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,016
getting to know who
the Klan leaders were‐‐

1062
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,642
a difficult thing to do,

1063
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:41,687
<i>but ultimately, Grant
is going to be successful</i>

1064
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,523
<i>at defeating the Klan.</i>

1065
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,485
‐ For all practical purposes,
by 1872,

1066
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,361
the operations
of the Ku Klux Klan

1067
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,739
had been pretty successfully
suppressed,

1068
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:54,408
and it is one of
the significant achievements

1069
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,536
of Grant's administration.

1070
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,246
<i>‐ I think fighting and defeating</i>

1071
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,040
<i>the Klan is a big deal.</i>

1072
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,542
<i>And so that Grant defeats
the first wave of the Klan is,</i>

1073
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,002
I think, something that people

1074
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,880
have not paid
enough attention to.

1075
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:13,677
‐ And so the 1871 Klan Acts
made it safe enough

1076
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:16,097
for African‐Americans
to vote in the South.

1077
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,892
<i>But there was pushback,</i>

1078
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,394
<i>and there was pushback
in large part</i>

1079
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:26,690
because many people believed
that Grant was overextending

1080
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:30,236
his hand with the Klan Acts.

1081
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,363
<i>Many white Northerners,</i>

1082
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:36,534
<i>including a fair number
of Union soldiers,</i>

1083
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:39,745
are never on board
with occupying the South.

1084
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,914
<i>They say, "If this can happen
in the South,</i>

1085
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,750
<i>why can't it happen
in the North?"</i>

1086
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:48,212
‐ And the country's also aware
of the great cost

1087
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:50,131
of this military occupation,

1088
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:52,925
the great cost
of Reconstruction.

1089
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:57,096
<i>And quite frankly, they've
grown weary of Reconstruction.</i>

1090
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,307
<i>‐ Grant is well aware
that public opinion</i>

1091
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:03,769
<i>goes strongly against
the use of federal troops</i>

1092
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,438
<i>just being sent in whenever
there's some kind of emergency</i>

1093
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:08,899
<i>and martial law being declared.</i>

1094
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,901
In other words, he could wreck

1095
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,820
the entire
Reconstruction project

1096
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:17,408
if he reaches for the
martial law weapon too much.

1097
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,285
<i>‐ I thought I could
run the government</i>

1098
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:22,580
<i>of the United States as I did
the staff of my army.</i>

1099
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:24,957
<i>It was my mistake,</i>

1100
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,066
<i>and it led me
into other mistakes.</i>

1101
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,260
‐ What's this?
‐ Requests, Mr. President.

1102
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:38,846
Suggestions for
cabinet appointments.

1103
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,472
Businessmen
want to meet with you.

1104
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:43,142
Another report of violence
in the South.

1105
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:46,979
Sherman wants troops in the
west to contain the Indians.

1106
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:50,816
One of the Indians,
a chief named Red Cloud,

1107
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,818
wants to come to Washington
to meet you.

1108
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:56,113
<i>‐ When Grant is president,
he's dealing with a host</i>

1109
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:59,992
of issues with the
Transcontinental Railroad,

1110
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,327
<i>certainly with Native Americans.</i>

1111
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,787
<i>He makes a pledge of leniency</i>

1112
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,915
<i>and goodwill
toward Native Americans</i>

1113
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:09,293
<i>which ultimately
doesn't pan out.</i>

1114
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:12,504
<i>And we're moving
into the period when industry</i>

1115
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:17,384
<i>and capitalism
are coming to the forefront.</i>

1116
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:20,179
<i>‐ The economy in the North,
in particular, had expanded</i>

1117
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:22,723
<i>tremendously during the war.</i>

1118
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,850
So you have‐‐
during Grant's presidency,

1119
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,811
you have the beginnings
of the rise of big business.

1120
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:30,981
<i>At the same time,
there's an enormous expansion</i>

1121
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,524
<i>of the federal government,</i>

1122
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,985
<i>and there is much more
opportunity</i>

1123
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:38,155
<i>for government corruption
than before.</i>

1124
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:44,536
<i>‐ Grant himself was not corrupt.</i>

1125
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,414
Ironically, his presidential
administration goes down as one

1126
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:50,834
that is remembered
as being corrupt.

1127
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:53,796
<i>‐ Grant thinks everybody
has a good heart,</i>

1128
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,632
everybody has as good
a heart as he does.

1129
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:59,718
<i>‐ Grant has a blind loyalty
to people,</i>

1130
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:04,098
<i>and some of the people that
he appointed were corrupt.</i>

1131
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:08,018
<i>‐ You see that fierce loyalty
with his secretary,</i>

1132
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,561
<i>Orville Babcock.</i>

1133
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:13,023
<i>Babcock was involved
with the Whisky Ring,</i>

1134
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:14,566
<i>which was government officials</i>

1135
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,569
working with
whiskey distributors

1136
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:20,114
and dealers to embezzle money

1137
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:23,075
<i>to the tune
of $1 1/2 million a year,</i>

1138
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,244
<i>and it was a major,
major scandal.</i>

1139
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,579
<i>But Grant's loyalty
was so strong,</i>

1140
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:30,749
he vouched for Babcock.

1141
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,751
<i>‐ There was an innocence
about Grant,</i>

1142
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:36,088
<i>and because he was not
deceitful himself,</i>

1143
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:40,217
<i>he had a lot of difficulty
seeing that in other people.</i>

1144
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:46,598
And everyone who knew Grant was
mystified by his gullibility.

1145
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,478
<i>‐ Corruption increasingly
becomes a problem</i>

1146
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:54,606
<i>as bribes become more evident.</i>

1147
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,735
And so there is a cultural
shift that's going on.

1148
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:02,865
<i>‐ Voters take their
frustrations to the polls</i>

1149
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:05,409
<i>in the midterm elections
in 1874,</i>

1150
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:07,786
and they put
a Democratic majority,

1151
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,080
for the first time
since the Civil War,

1152
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,291
into the House
of Representatives.

1153
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:13,751
Once there's
a Democratic majority

1154
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:15,127
in the House of Representatives,

1155
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,212
<i>Grant finds himself crippled</i>

1156
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:21,800
<i>in all of these
Reconstruction measures.</i>

1157
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:24,094
<i>‐ The notion
that his administration</i>

1158
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:28,432
<i>is full of corruption
leads people to doubt</i>

1159
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:30,601
<i>and to pull back
from supporting him,</i>

1160
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:33,604
<i>especially when it comes
to Reconstruction.</i>

1161
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:35,272
But Grant remained popular,

1162
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:38,817
and he certainly remained
popular with Union veterans.

1163
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,821
‐ Good to see you, sir.
‐ Thank you.

1164
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,490
‐ You're too good
to your country.

1165
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,492
Good men.
Good men and true.

1166
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,452
‐ Thank you, sir.
‐ It's nice to meet you, sir.

1167
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:50,204
‐ Pleased to meet you,
President Grant.

1168
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:53,499
I fought with General Thomas
over in Chattanooga.

1169
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:55,292
‐ I won't forget you, soldier.

1170
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:58,212
‐ Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

1171
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:00,631
‐ Excuse me, gentlemen.
‐ General.

1172
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:10,391
<i>‐ In September 1875,</i>

1173
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:12,351
<i>Grant gets an appeal from</i>

1174
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,395
<i>Governor Adelbert Ames
of Mississippi,</i>

1175
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:17,898
<i>and Ames says that there's
already so much violence</i>

1176
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:20,025
<i>ahead of the November elections.</i>

1177
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,529
And so he asks Grant
to send down federal troops.

1178
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,531
<i>‐ There's a real pushback</i>

1179
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:28,200
<i>to any more intervention
in the South.</i>

1180
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:31,453
<i>Many white Northerners
say enough is enough.</i>

1181
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,539
<i>There's a notion
that corruption abounds</i>

1182
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:37,042
in the federal government,
and there's no longer

1183
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:40,379
a real willingness
of white Northerners to say,

1184
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:43,966
"More needs to be done
for African‐Americans."

1185
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:48,721
<i>‐ So now Grant has to weigh
what intervention in the South</i>

1186
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:50,347
<i>will mean at the polls</i>

1187
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:53,600
<i>in Northern states
for Republicans.</i>

1188
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,894
<i>Do you sacrifice
the Republican Party,</i>

1189
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,354
and the only party
that's supporting

1190
01:10:57,378 --> 01:11:00,107
and defending African‐American
voting rights,

1191
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:03,068
<i>or do you capitulate
to this terrorism</i>

1192
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,529
<i>on the ground in the South?</i>

1193
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:09,408
<i>‐ It was duty on one side and
party obligation on the other.</i>

1194
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:11,785
<i>Between the two, I hesitated.</i>

1195
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:13,912
<i>If a mistake was made,</i>

1196
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:17,708
<i>it was one of the head
and not of the heart.</i>

1197
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:23,756
Tell the governor of Mississippi

1198
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,632
that I won't be sending troops.

1199
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:34,433
<i>I should not have yielded.</i>

1200
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:37,895
<i>It requires no prophet
to foresee that the results</i>

1201
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:42,608
<i>of the war would be
in large measure lost.</i>

1202
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:50,616
<i>‐ And so after Grant
leaves office,</i>

1203
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,120
<i>Reconstruction
is effectively over.</i>

1204
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:04,797
<i>‐ Grant is not the one
who abandoned Reconstruction.</i>

1205
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,465
The American people
abandoned Reconstruction,

1206
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,091
and he just couldn't
rally them back in

1207
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:10,594
because of the swirl
of things around him.

1208
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:12,471
<i>And the abandonment</i>

1209
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:15,474
<i>was also an abandonment
of the ideals behind it,</i>

1210
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:20,646
<i>which was really equality
for everyone.</i>

1211
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,940
<i>And when that was abandoned,</i>

1212
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:26,819
<i>the remnants
of this white supremacy</i>

1213
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:29,655
<i>was able to reemerge.</i>

1214
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,448
<i>The subjugation of black people</i>

1215
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:34,868
<i>was allowed
to reassert itself unchecked.</i>

1216
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:40,999
<i>It will take another 100 years</i>

1217
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:47,339
<i>of people pushing
against status quo</i>

1218
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:51,343
<i>before we can even get to
a point where we get Congress</i>

1219
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:56,139
<i>to actually enforce the
amendments of Reconstruction.</i>

1220
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,021
<i>‐ But Grant's presidency,
in many ways,</i>

1221
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:05,858
<i>was a heroic presidency.</i>

1222
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:07,526
<i>All of these things
that he accomplished,</i>

1223
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,319
<i>he didn't accomplish because</i>

1224
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:13,323
he was pursuing fame
or money or power.

1225
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,033
All these things
that he accomplished

1226
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:19,329
were just in the course
of doing his patriotic duty.

1227
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,164
<i>‐ He was probably
the most respected man</i>

1228
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:23,625
<i>and maybe the only who could
have led at those times,</i>

1229
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,419
<i>and look what he does.</i>

1230
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:26,837
He starts
the Justice Department.

1231
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:28,380
Then he battles
the Ku Klux Klan.

1232
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,049
He passes the 15th Amendment.

1233
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,802
<i>Under his watch,
the nation advances,</i>

1234
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:36,513
<i>and he does not just one
but two terms.</i>

1235
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:38,765
<i>And yet ultimately,
I don't really think</i>

1236
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:42,269
<i>he was a political animal
in any sense.</i>

1237
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:45,564
<i>‐ Personally,
I was weary of office.</i>

1238
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:47,441
<i>I never wanted
to get out of a place</i>

1239
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:50,694
<i>as much as I did the presidency.</i>

1240
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:54,406
‐ Grant felt, especially
in his second term,

1241
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,867
he felt that was in jail
every single day.

1242
01:13:56,891 --> 01:13:58,702
In fact, he used that
in a letter:

1243
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:00,037
"I'm breaking out of jail."

1244
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,875
<i>He couldn't wait to leave,
and he planned to travel.</i>

1245
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:08,587
<i>He loved to travel.
He loved to be on the move.</i>

1246
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:10,589
<i>And he and Julia spent two years</i>

1247
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:13,425
<i>traveling around the world.</i>

1248
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,260
<i>He went to India.</i>

1249
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:19,264
<i>He went to China.
He went to Japan.</i>

1250
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,767
<i>‐ And in every country
where he goes,</i>

1251
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:24,603
<i>he's received
by tremendous crowds.</i>

1252
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:30,984
So routinely, 100,000,
200,000, 250,000 people

1253
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:33,612
would pour into the streets.

1254
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:35,948
<i>So clearly,
after Abraham Lincoln,</i>

1255
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:42,204
<i>the one name that the world
knew was Ulysses S. Grant.</i>

1256
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:44,122
‐ When Grant returns
to the United States

1257
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:49,962
after his two‐year world tour,
he is looking for an income.

1258
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:51,797
Presidents had no pension
at the time,

1259
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:54,132
<i>and his son Ulysses Jr.</i>

1260
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,093
<i>Had gotten involved
in Wall Street.</i>

1261
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:59,972
<i>So Grant and his son started
a partnership for a firm</i>

1262
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:02,224
<i>with a man named Ferdinand Ward,</i>

1263
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:05,602
<i>an up‐and‐coming phenom
in the Wall Street market.</i>

1264
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:08,146
<i>The principal members
are given allowances</i>

1265
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,815
<i>of $3,000 a month.</i>

1266
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:13,026
<i>There's just money rolling in.</i>

1267
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:37,009
‐ Father...
we need to speak.

1268
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,513
‐ What is it?

1269
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:47,019
‐ Ward is gone.

1270
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:51,189
He's taken the money.

1271
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:55,027
Everything's lost...
everything.

1272
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,702
<i>‐ And it turned out
that Ferdinand Ward</i>

1273
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:05,954
<i>was the Bernie Madoff
of his day.</i>

1274
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:08,040
The whole thing
was a big Ponzi scheme.

1275
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:10,542
Grant woke up one morning
only to discover

1276
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,753
that he was worth exactly $80

1277
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:15,422
and Julia was worth
exactly $130.

1278
01:16:15,446 --> 01:16:16,715
He was wiped out.

1279
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,842
All his children were wiped out.

1280
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,350
‐ What's the matter, Ulys?
You look ill.

1281
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,773
‐ I must speak with you.

1282
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:36,777
‐ Of course.
What is it?

1283
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:39,196
‐ This morning,
I was a wealthy man.

1284
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:43,057
And now I've lost everything.

1285
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:53,919
‐ So what brings the famous
Mark Twain to my parlor?

1286
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:57,923
‐ General...

1287
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:01,885
a reason for my visit.

1288
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:04,096
I hear you've agreed
to write your memoirs

1289
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,140
for "The Century" magazine.

1290
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:09,101
‐ They've made me an offer.

1291
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:12,104
‐ And what royalty
have they promised you?

1292
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:14,231
‐ 10%.

1293
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:16,108
‐ General, they are treating you

1294
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,943
as if you were a private
in an army

1295
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,820
nobody ever heard of.

1296
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:23,406
Let me make you a better offer.
‐ But you're too late, Clemens.

1297
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:27,786
I have committed
to "Century's" publisher,

1298
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:31,081
and I can't go back on my word.

1299
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:33,625
‐ Let me publish your memoirs.

1300
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:37,295
I promise, you'll leave
your family well off

1301
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:40,674
and the nation richer
for your story.

1302
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:46,680
<i>‐ In 1884, Ulysses S. Grant,</i>

1303
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,141
<i>Civil War general
and two‐term president</i>

1304
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:54,479
<i>of the United States,
was now faced with poverty.</i>

1305
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,607
<i>And Sam Clemens,
better known as Mark Twain,</i>

1306
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,986
<i>arrived at his home
to see if he could help Grant</i>

1307
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,029
<i>by having him write his memoirs</i>

1308
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:07,826
<i>and leave a lasting legacy
of how he saw the war</i>

1309
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:10,120
and how he saw one
of the most pivotal moments

1310
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,538
in American history.

1311
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:14,457
<i>So eventually, Grant
did go with Twain's offer</i>

1312
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:17,836
<i>to make money for his family
to save them from poverty.</i>

1313
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,674
<i>‐ But during the summer
before he started writing,</i>

1314
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:26,136
he bites into a peach,
and he says that somehow

1315
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,181
<i>something stung him
from the peach in his throat</i>

1316
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:30,891
<i>and he can't figure out
what it is.</i>

1317
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:33,560
<i>He sees a doctor,
and at that point,</i>

1318
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:37,772
<i>they realize that it's cancer
and that they can't operate.</i>

1319
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:42,152
<i>So he realizes that it's fatal.</i>

1320
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:45,989
<i>‐ What is to be my fate?</i>

1321
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:49,618
<i>Will I have to lay awake again?</i>

1322
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:53,205
<i>Making it a study
how to get a breath</i>

1323
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:55,540
<i>is about as much
as I could stand</i>

1324
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,877
<i>to go through another night.</i>

1325
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:02,047
<i>‐ Grant wrote the memoirs
under horrific conditions.</i>

1326
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:05,842
He said that every time
he drank a glass of water,

1327
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:09,721
it was like drinking
a glass of molten lead.

1328
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:14,559
<i>This was a truly heroic effort
of Grant in agonizing pain,</i>

1329
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,228
<i>writing the memoirs.</i>

1330
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:19,397
<i>And he literally willed
himself to stay alive.</i>

1331
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,274
<i>‐ And it's the final battle
of his life,</i>

1332
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:24,903
the battle to outrace
his terminal cancer

1333
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,571
in order to finish his memoirs

1334
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,741
and rescue his family
from bankruptcy.

1335
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,077
<i>‐ But as everything else
in his life,</i>

1336
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:35,080
<i>he did not let it defeat him.</i>

1337
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:39,918
In the end, he would prevail,
and he would finish the book.

1338
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:43,546
<i>‐ These volumes are dedicated
to the American soldier</i>

1339
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:49,177
<i>and sailor,
U. S. Grant, 1885.</i>

1340
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:58,395
<i>‐ He dies three days
after writing the last page,</i>

1341
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:02,774
and Twain realizes at once
that what Grant has written

1342
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:07,612
is a monument
in American literature.

1343
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:12,784
<i>‐ My family is American
and has been for generations.</i>

1344
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,412
<i>In all its branches, direct...
‐ This memoir</i>

1345
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:18,290
<i>is hugely important
and hugely powerful.</i>

1346
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:21,793
It earns over half
a million dollars for Julia,

1347
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:24,796
which, of course, in today's
money, would be much more.

1348
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,674
<i>It's very successful,
and people read it everywhere.</i>

1349
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:30,593
<i>I think something people
tend to forget now</i>

1350
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:33,305
<i>is that Grant, at his death,</i>

1351
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:37,976
<i>was arguably the most famous
American in the world.</i>

1352
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,979
<i>‐ The response to his death
was amazing.</i>

1353
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:44,816
<i>The national funeral which
took place in New York City</i>

1354
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:48,862
<i>that day began with bells
ringing all over the country,</i>

1355
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:50,363
<i>North and South.</i>

1356
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:54,200
<i>It was just a national
outpouring of grief for him.</i>

1357
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:06,338
<i>‐ In 1900, Theodore Roosevelt</i>

1358
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:09,090
<i>suggested that Grant, Lincoln,
and Washington</i>

1359
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:12,802
loomed as the three great
heroes of American history.

1360
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:15,638
So even as late
as the turn of the century,

1361
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:18,791
he's part
of this heroic firmament.

1362
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,854
<i>And then in the decades
that follow,</i>

1363
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:26,524
<i>that diminishes rapidly.</i>

1364
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:32,489
<i>‐ What happened was that
the history of the war</i>

1365
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:36,868
<i>came to be written by a lot
of pro‐Southern historians</i>

1366
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,037
who exercise a powerful sway.

1367
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:41,748
It's often called
the Lost Cause.

1368

<i>‐ The Lost Cause narrative</i>

1369
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,127
<i>is really an effort
of the South to say,</i>

1370
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:49,214
"How did we sacrifice so much
for a cause so bad as slavery?"

1371
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:50,924
So they changed the narrative.

1372
01:21:50,948 --> 01:21:53,093
"No, no, it was about state's
rights and independence."

1373
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:55,053
<i>And so that narrative</i>

1374
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:57,055
<i>has become
the predominant narrative,</i>

1375
01:21:57,079 --> 01:21:59,182
<i>and I think a part of it
that gets buried in there</i>

1376
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:01,101
is the role of Grant.

1377
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:06,106
<i>‐ There were three separate
attacks on his legacy.</i>

1378
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:08,900
<i>Grant is known by many
as the butcher.</i>

1379
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:13,446
<i>Grant is known as the drunk.
Grant is known as the corrupt.</i>

1380
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,198
<i>‐ Everything else
gets stripped away,</i>

1381
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:17,367
<i>and you've got the guy
that won the Civil War</i>

1382
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:19,577
<i>and he was an alcoholic
and a failed president.</i>

1383
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:24,749
<i>‐ And the Lost Cause
casts Grant as the villain</i>

1384
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,085
<i>and Lee as the hero.</i>

1385
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:30,088
So once the memory
of that generation

1386
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:35,260
that venerated him passed on,
he was forgotten.

1387
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:37,595
<i>‐ And so Confederates
lost the Civil War,</i>

1388
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,931
but they certainly won
the war of myth.

1389
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:42,434
And Grant was on the wrong side
of that myth.

1390
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:59,892
‐ Shall I read one to you?

1391
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:07,065
This one's from
a Confederate soldier.

1392
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:11,320
Ulys?

1393
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:21,347
"Dear General Grant,
I hope you will allow one who,

1394
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:24,142
"when a boy, laid down his arms
at Appomattox

1395
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:26,394
"and pledged allegiance
to the Union

1396
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:28,646
to express his warmest
sympathy..."

1397
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,024
<i>‐ For you and your suffering.</i>

1398
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:32,484
<i>I have watched your movements</i>

1399
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:36,154
<i>from the hour you gave me
my horse and sword</i>

1400
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:40,950
<i>and told me to go home
and assist in making a crop.</i>

1401
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:44,829
<i>I have been proud to see
the nation do you honor.</i>

1402
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:50,335
<i>And now, dear General,
in the hour of your pain,</i>

1403
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:52,504
<i>I weep that so brave,</i>

1404
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:57,800
<i>so magnanimous a soul
must suffer as you do.</i>

1405
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:14,484
<i>‐ There's something, like,
really beautiful and American</i>

1406
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:15,985
<i>in his whole story.</i>

1407
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:18,196
<i>He just comes from nothing.</i>

1408
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:20,448
<i>‐ From the
hardscrabble background</i>

1409
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:24,244
<i>who's had a lot of hard times
and failures in his life,</i>

1410
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:26,996
<i>who rises to the highest
level of power,</i>

1411
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:30,542
<i>becomes the greatest general
of his time.</i>

1412
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:34,379
<i>‐ Against all odds,
against incredible obstacles,</i>

1413
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:37,840
<i>he became the winning general
of the Civil War.</i>

1414
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:41,261
<i>‐ He was the commander
of the victorious army</i>

1415
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:44,055
<i>that led to the emancipation
of 4 million people.</i>

1416
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:48,226
<i>‐ Grant is the unheroic hero</i>

1417
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:51,187
<i>of our greatest national epic,</i>

1418
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:55,024
<i>the Civil War
and Reconstruction.</i>

1419
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:56,609
<i>‐ He was committed</i>

1420
01:24:56,633 --> 01:25:00,738
<i>to making America
fully just, fully equal.</i>

1421
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:04,242
<i>‐ Grant was the first
civil rights president.</i>

1422
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:06,035
<i>‐ It's as improbable a rise</i>

1423
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:09,080
<i>as any other figure
in American history.</i>

1424
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:12,250
<i>‐ Indomitable will.
‐ Dogged determination.</i>

1425
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:14,919
<i>‐ Moral vision.
‐ He's a fighter.</i>

1426
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,588
<i>‐ It's truly an American story</i>

1427
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:19,257
<i>of not only patriotism
to the nation</i>

1428
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:20,592
<i>but for the values,</i>

1429
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:23,970
<i>who we are
and who we aspire to be.</i>

1430
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:26,848
<i>‐ One of my superstitions
has always been,</i>

1431
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:30,226
<i>when I started to go anywhere
or to do anything,</i>

1432
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:33,396
<i>never to turn back or stop</i>

1433
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:36,733
<i>until the thing intended
was accomplished.</i>

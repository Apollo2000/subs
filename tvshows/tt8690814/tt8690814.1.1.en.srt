‐ Rebs!

3
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,627
‐ Rebs!
Coming from the woods!

4
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,421
Rebs!
In the left!

5
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,985
<i>Rebs!</i>

6
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:11,566
‐ Hurt bad, private?
‐ It's only a scratch, sir.

7
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,026
‐ So you can fight?

8
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,073
Come on now, boys.

9
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:22,076
Pitch in.
I'm right behind you.

10
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,633
<i>Everyone has his superstitions.</i>

11
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,302
<i>One of my superstitions
has always been</i>

12
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,722
<i>when I started to go anywhere
or do anything,</i>

13
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,974
<i>never to turn back or stop</i>

14
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:49,562
<i>until the thing intended
was accomplished.</i>

15
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:54,025
‐ General Grant.
‐ Sherman.

16
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,736
‐ We've had the devil's
own day, haven't we?

17
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,410
‐ Lick them tomorrow though.

18
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:14,587
<i>‐ Very few people really
know who Ulysses S. Grant was.</i>

19
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:19,008
<i>‐ Today there is this sense
that he's forgotten.</i>

20
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,470
<i>‐ He's been called
so many things over the years.</i>

21
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,972
<i>‐ The greatest general
of his time.</i>

22
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,308
<i>‐ A military genius.</i>

23
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,018
<i>‐ A bloody butcher.</i>

24
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,020
<i>‐ A corrupt President.</i>

25
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,941
<i>‐ A belligerent drunk
who got lucky.</i>

26
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,026
He didn't get lucky.

27
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,196
<i>‐ Ulysses S. Grant is
this perfectly average,</i>

28
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,200
humble individual from a poor,
hardscrabble background...

29
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,370
<i>‐ With a lot of hard times
and failures in his life.</i>

30
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,831
‐ But he's got
this dogged determination

31
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,166
<i>and this bulldog mentality.</i>

32
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,876
‐ This guy comes from nothing,

33
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,003
<i>rises to the highest ranks
of the Union army.</i>

34
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,463
<i>‐ Form your lines!</i>

35
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,799
<i>‐ Fights bloody,
terrible battles‐‐</i>

36
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,009
<i>‐ With indomitable will‐‐</i>

37
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,553
‐ To save the Union.

38
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,513
<i>‐ To heal his country.</i>

39
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:09,684
<i>‐ To lead the nation
towards justice for everybody.</i>

40
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,396
<i>‐ He's the unheroic hero
of our greatest national epic,</i>

41
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,772
<i>the American Civil War.</i>

42
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,567
‐ It's truly an American story,

43
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,777
<i>not only in patriotism
to the nation,</i>

44
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:24,323
<i>but for the values of who we
are and who we aspire to be.</i>

45
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:39,922
<i>‐ My family is American
and has been for generations.</i>

46
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,678
<i>At the breaking out of the war
of the revolution,</i>

47
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,223
<i>my grandfather went to join
the Continental Army.</i>

48
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,851
<i>He was present
at the Battle of Bunker Hill.</i>

49
00:04:54,961 --> 00:05:00,568
<i>I was born on the 27th
of April, 1822, in Ohio.</i>

50
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,280
<i>While my father carried
on the manufacture of leather,</i>

51
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,532
<i>I detested the trade.</i>

52
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,787
‐ Ulys, get in here.

53
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:15,291
About that colt, offer $20.
That's what it's worth.

54
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:20,213
If old Ralston says no,
then you offer 25.

55
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,131
Don't make a mess of it.

56
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,928
<i>‐ There was Mr. Ralston,</i>

57
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,096
<i>living within a few miles
of the village,</i>

58
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,308
<i>who owned a colt
which I very much wanted.</i>

59
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,147
Well?

60
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,276
‐ Pop says I can offer you $20
for the colt,

61
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,905
but if you won't take that,
I can offer you 25.

62
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,995
‐ 25 it is, son.

63
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,125
<i>‐ That transaction caused me
much heartburn.</i>

64
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,044
‐ Ulysses.
‐ Ulysses.

65
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,589
More like useless.
Useless Grant.

66
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,469
<i>‐ Grant as a kid showed
no promise for anything.</i>

67
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,180
The local kids called him
Useless Grant

68
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,808
rather than Ulysses Grant.

69
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,853
<i>‐ Grant doesn't have,
probably, the best childhood</i>

70
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,146
in terms
of an overbearing father.

71
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,273
<i>‐ Ulysses really has nothing</i>

72
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,066
<i>in common with his father.</i>

73
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,151
<i>He does not want to follow
in the family business,</i>

74
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,279
<i>does not like the tannery.</i>

75
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,655
He's repulsed by the smell.

76
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,115
He's repulsed
by the sight of blood.

77
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,408
He just doesn't like it,

78
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,118
but what he does like is horses.

79
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,954
He becomes an avid horseman
at a very young age,

80
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,541
<i>and that's going to be
very helpful down the road.</i>

81
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,835
<i>‐ I think his father thought,
"What am I gonna do</i>

82
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,170
<i>with Ulysses?"
and so his father is able</i>

83
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,299
<i>to get Grant
an appointment to West Point,</i>

84
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,551
but he'd applied, apparently,
without Grant knowing,

85
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,261
<i>and so when the notice
came of the appointment,</i>

86
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,388
<i>his father says to Ulysses that,</i>

87
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,098
<i>"You've got the appointment,"</i>

88
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,225
and Grant's response was,
"The appointment to what?"

89
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,352
He goes, "Well, to West Point.
You're going to West Point."

90
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,771
<i>‐ And Grant said,
"I don't really think so,"</i>

91
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,899
and his father says,
"Yes‐‐yes, you are,"

92
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,735
<i>and he ends up going,</i>

93
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,821
but Grant emphatically
did not want to be a soldier.

94
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,491
<i>‐ I would have been glad to
have had a railroad collision</i>

95
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,536
<i>or any other accident happen
by which I might have received</i>

96
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,747
<i>a temporary injury sufficient</i>

97
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,833
<i>to make me ineligible
to enter the academy.</i>

98
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,670
<i>Nothing of the kind occurred,
and I had to face the music.</i>

99
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,966
‐ Sir, there's been a mistake.

100
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,344
See, this says
Ulysses S. Grant.

101
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,037
My name is Ulysses H. Grant.

102
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,561
‐ You've been
officially accepted

103
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,855
as Ulysses S. Grant.

104
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,673
‐ Well, they got that wrong.

105
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,445
‐ This is the name
that's been submitted.

106
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,056
This is the name you shall have.

107
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,060
‐ Um, yes, sir.

108
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,648
‐ Let me see that.

109
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,713
Ulysses S. Grant.

110
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,965
Longstreet,
this man's name is U. S. Grant.

111
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,551
‐ A fine appellation
if ever there was one.

112
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,387
<i>‐ Uncle Sam Grant.</i>

113
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,223
Well, Sam,
I'm William Tecumseh Sherman.

114
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,225
This here is James Longstreet
of South Carolina.

115
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,393
Call him Pete.

116
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,894
‐ Pleasure, sir.
‐ How do you do?

117
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,272
‐ Welcome to West Point.

118
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:29,318
<i>‐ The initials U. S. Grant are
actually a complete accident.</i>

119
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,153
<i>When that name appears,</i>

120
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,739
<i>his fellow cadets immediately
start making nicknames.</i>

121
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,991
United States Grant,
Uncle Sam Grant,

122
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,662
and it's Sam
that sticks with him.

123
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,749
‐ If you attended West Point,
you were a very, very prime

124
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,585
specimen in the United States
of America at that point.

125
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,130
<i>‐ Almost all
of the senior generals</i>

126
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:53,467
of the Civil War on both sides
graduated from West Point.

127
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,302
<i>In the North you had Sherman.</i>

128
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:59,098
<i>You had McClellan.
You had Sheridan and Meade.</i>

129
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,100
<i>In the South you had
Stonewall Jackson.</i>

130
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,519
<i>You had Longstreet.
You had Jeb Stuart.</i>

131
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,479
<i>You had Robert E. Lee.</i>

132
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,816
<i>Lee was second in his class,
one of the very rare cadets</i>

133
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,277
<i>in history to have no demerits.</i>

134
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,696
‐ It was very important
at West Point that Grant

135
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,491
met many of the future generals
of the Civil War.

136
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,494
<i>His intimate knowledge
of their personalities</i>

137
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,163
<i>would fill him with confidence</i>

138
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:27,001
when he found them on the other
side of the battlefield.

139
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,378
<i>‐ He was not a model cadet.</i>

140
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,921
He has plenty of demerits.

141
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,132
<i>‐ He was in the middle
of his class.</i>

142
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:36,469
As he confessed later on,
he mostly read novels.

143
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,554
<i>‐ But he was good in math.</i>

144
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,975
He enjoyed the art classes.
He enjoyed mapmaking classes.

145
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,644
<i>‐ And he excelled
at horsemanship.</i>

146
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,148
<i>He could tame
seemingly any horse.</i>

147
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:53,694
<i>‐ Now unfortunately for Grant,
when he graduates,</i>

148
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,573
<i>there were no spots
in the U. S. Cavalry,</i>

149
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,075
and so the best equestrian

150
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,951
in that particular
graduating class

151
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,828
ended up in the infantry.

152
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:07,666
<i>‐ I reported for duty at
Jefferson barracks, St. Louis.</i>

153
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,710
<i>At West Point I had a roommate,</i>

154
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,754
<i>Fred Dent,</i>

155
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,716
<i>whose family resided some five
miles west of the barracks.</i>

156
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,221
<i>I soon found my way out to
White Haven, the Dent estate.</i>

157
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,515
<i>As I found the family congenial,</i>

158
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,142
<i>my visits became frequent.</i>

159
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,314
<i>‐ The Dents were
a slave‐owning family.</i>

160
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,984
<i>They had
approximately 30 slaves.</i>

161
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,238
<i>There's no evidence
that Grant felt discomfort</i>

162
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,282
<i>with the Dents' slaves
at that point.</i>

163
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:44,203
By his own later admission,
he was not an abolitionist.

164
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,622
<i>Marcia: During Grant's time
in Missouri,</i>

165
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,624
<i>the entire nation found itself</i>

166
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,710
<i>divided over the issue
of slavery.</i>

167
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,256
The United States was engaged
in I would say

168
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,593
kind of a fiction that you
could maintain national unity

169
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,804
if you created a balance
of slave and free states.

170
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:06,600
<i>‐ Enslaved black people were
the largest asset of wealth</i>

171
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:10,062
<i>that we had in this country,
and so many Americans</i>

172
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,649
<i>wanted to maintain
the right of enslavement,</i>

173
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,401
and when I say enslavement,

174
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,944
I'm talking about for the right
to break up families,

175
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,237
for the right to sell
somebody's mother,

176
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,655
somebody's kid away,

177
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,615
<i>for the right to torture people.</i>

178
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,742
<i>‐ So the question of slavery</i>

179
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,786
<i>and the atrocities of the system</i>

180
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,622
was about the direction
that the nation would take

181
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,417
economically but also morally.

182
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:36,380
‐ Grant's dad, Jesse, is
a huge anti‐slavery advocate.

183
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,216
He's very vocal about
his opinions and his beliefs.

184
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,177
<i>‐ So Grant would have
been well aware</i>

185
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,013
of the long‐simmering tensions

186
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:48,809
between slaveholding
and non‐slaveholding states.

187
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:53,314
<i>At West Point he was friends
with slaveholding men,</i>

188
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,192
<i>many who become
some of his closest friends.</i>

189
00:11:56,216 --> 00:12:00,529
<i>Grant certainly was
part of that tension.</i>

190
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,704
‐ Grant, you haven't yet
met my sister Julia.

191
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:13,542
Julia, this is Sam,
that is, Ulysses Grant.

192
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,506
‐ You haven't spoken,
Lieutenant Grant.

193
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,383
‐ That's our Grant.

194
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,886
You'll find that he can
be silent in several languages.

195
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,056
<i>‐ Grant, far from looking
for a girlfriend</i>

196
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,142
<i>or looking for a wife
at the time,</i>

197
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,312
was as surprised as anyone
that he had fallen in love.

198
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,151
‐ However, Julia Dent is
the daughter of a slave owner.

199
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,695
<i>It's gonna create
some dilemmas for Grant.</i>

200
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,489
<i>It's gonna cause
a lot of friction</i>

201
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,908
because Jesse Grant,
anti‐slavery.

202
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,534
Frederick Dent, slave owner.

203
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,912
<i>The families
are very much opposed.</i>

204
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:54,541
<i>‐ So Grant has a secret
engagement with Julia,</i>

205
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,752
<i>and they were going to approach</i>

206
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,212
<i>Colonel Dent about it,</i>

207
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,756
<i>but it's put on hold
indefinitely</i>

208
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,509
as he's called
to the Mexican‐American War.

209
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,390
<i>‐ The thing that led
to the Mexican War</i>

210
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,434
was the westward expansion
of the United States

211
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,853
<i>into Mexican territory</i>

212
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,648
<i>with an incredibly
aggressive foreign policy</i>

213
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,693
<i>to unify the country
all the way to California,</i>

214
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,946
<i>which was the crown jewel
on the west coast.</i>

215
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,617
<i>Mexico stood in the way,
so the army marches in.</i>

216
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,578
<i>Ulysses S. Grant is assigned
as a quartermaster‐‐</i>

217
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,789
<i>that is, a supply officer.</i>

218
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,750
<i>Grant is a spectacular
quartermaster,</i>

219
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,711
<i>incredibly hands‐on,</i>

220
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:42,423
<i>but he is itching
to get into combat.</i>

221
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,634
<i>He is a 25‐year‐old
West Point graduate</i>

222
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,430
who has an opportunity
to make a name for himself.

223
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,735
<i>‐ To Colonel Garland,</i>

224
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,154
<i>I respectfully protest
against being assigned</i>

225
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,488
<i>the duties of quartermaster...</i>

226
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,282
Boys, load those boxes.

227
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,159
<i>Which removes me
from sharing in the dangers</i>

228
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:14,079
<i>and honors of service
with my company at the front.</i>

229
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:18,333
‐ I need ammunition!
‐ Yes, sir!

230
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,378
‐ Come on, guys, mount!
Rush in!

231
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,431
‐ Ammunition!
Ammunition!

232
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,183
<i>Ammo, now!</i>

233
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:38,020
‐ Volunteer!
Volunteer!

234
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,148
‐ I volunteer.

235
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,858
‐ Grant, you're
the quartermaster.

236
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,860
You don't need to do this.
‐ You asked for a volunteer.

237
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,028
‐ I need ammunition!
Come on!

238
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,280
‐ I volunteer.

239
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,698
‐ We're gonna lose this position

240
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,992
unless we get ammunition
up here now.

241
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,057
‐ God save you, Grant!

242
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,145
<i>‐ In the Mexican War,</i>

243
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,855
<i>there's a very dramatic incident</i>

244
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,566
<i>where Grant rides
on the side of a horse</i>

245
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,151
<i>using the horse as a shield</i>

246
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,570
<i>as he rides
a gauntlet of bullets</i>

247
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,907
to keep these men supplied
in the middle of a battle.

248
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,744
<i>‐ In the Mexican War Grant
learns a very important lesson</i>

249
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,789
<i>about his own emotional makeup.</i>

250
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,165
In moments of extreme danger,

251
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,835
when other people are panicking,

252
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:46,588
<i>Grant becomes very cool
in a crisis.</i>

253
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:51,593
<i>He discovers nothing ever
rattled him in battle.</i>

254
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,262
<i>‐ You want to know</i>

255
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,931
<i>what my feelings
were on the field of battle?</i>

256
00:15:55,955 --> 00:16:00,394
<i>I do not know that I felt
any peculiar sensation.</i>

257
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:04,648
<i>War seems much less horrible
to persons engaged in it</i>

258
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,234
<i>than to those
who read of the battle.</i>

259
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:13,157
<i>‐ Grant watches people die
horrible deaths in battle.</i>

260
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,827
<i>He loses many of his friends,
one after the other,</i>

261
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,996
and so I think
he has a very clear sense

262
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,499
of the costs of war
from the start.

263
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,877
<i>‐ Many West Point‐trained
officers</i>

264
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,921
<i>served together during
the U. S. war with Mexico.</i>

265
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,382
<i>That's where Grant met
Robert E. Lee</i>

266
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:34,136
for the first time,
Grant as a lower‐level officer

267
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,848
but Lee as a major
staff officer.

268
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,601
<i>Lee is a hero during the war.</i>

269
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:47,691
<i>‐ The Mexican War ends in 1848.</i>

270
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,944
We have gotten exactly
what we want,

271
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,156
<i>most of the American Southwest,</i>

272
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,159
<i>roughly 500,000 square miles
of territory,</i>

273
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,578
<i>all the way
to the Pacific Ocean,</i>

274
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,914
<i>and the question of whether
that land would be</i>

275
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,582
<i>slave or free, of course,</i>

276
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,835
would raise its ugly head
pretty much every year

277
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,005
after that right up to 1861.

278
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,343
<i>In many ways, the completion
of the United States</i>

279
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,679
<i>from sea to shining sea
leads directly</i>

280
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,514
<i>to the American Civil War.</i>

281
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,244
<i>‐ By the time Grant came
back from the Mexican War,</i>

282
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:45,207
<i>he had matured,
and Julia was waiting for him,</i>

283
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,876
<i>but Julia's father,
Colonel Dent,</i>

284
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,253
thought she could do better.

285
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,380
<i>He thought that
the military life</i>

286
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,299
<i>would be very difficult for her.</i>

287
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,885
‐ Grant eventually won over Dent

288
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,555
<i>and asked to marry Julia.</i>

289
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,516
‐ But Grant came from
a strongly abolitionist family

290
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,894
that was horrified
that he was marrying into

291
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,438
this Missouri
slave‐owning family,

292
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:12,276
<i>and when Ulysses and Julia
get married in 1848,</i>

293
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,613
<i>not a single member
of the Grant family is there.</i>

294
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,786
<i>‐ The first years</i>

295
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,247
<i>of that marriage
are actually quite difficult.</i>

296
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:29,084
<i>Grant is posted to the
west coast, to Fort Humboldt.</i>

297
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,296
Julia is expecting a child
and is thus unable

298
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,215
to go with him
to the Pacific Northwest.

299
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,758
<i>‐ When he was separated
from his family,</i>

300
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,387
<i>he missed them terribly,
especially Julia,</i>

301
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,431
and Fort Humboldt
was an isolated,

302
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,600
desolate place to be,

303
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:48,895
<i>so he really started to suffer
significant melancholy.</i>

304
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,155
<i>‐ Dear Julia, the mail came</i>

305
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,032
<i>but brought me nothing from you.</i>

306
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,618
<i>I have only had one letter
from you in three months.</i>

307
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:06,288
<i>My dear wife, how very anxious
I am to get home once again.</i>

308
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,248
<i>I sometimes get so anxious</i>

309
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,833
<i>to see you and our little boys,</i>

310
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,627
<i>I'm almost tempted to resign.</i>

311
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,629
<i>Dear Julia, I do not feel</i>

312
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:18,133
<i>as if it is possible to endure
this separation much longer.</i>

313
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,603
<i>‐ Grant gets bored easily
when there's nothing going on.</i>

314
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:34,066
He gets lonely, and that
is when you start seeing

315
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,153
maybe some problems
with the drinking.

316
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,197
‐ Thank you, sir.

317
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,077
<i>‐ When I have nothing to do,</i>

318
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,037
<i>I get blue,</i>

319
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:50,666
<i>and I have
a natural craving for a drink.</i>

320
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,277
‐ Captain Grant.

321
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:09,291
Grant, you know
the rules about drink.

322
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,361
<i>‐ This is where all the stories</i>

323
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,822
<i>of Grant's drinking start.</i>

324
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:25,701
<i>I think there were some times
when he did drink.</i>

325
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,912
<i>It was a story that circulated
among army officers,</i>

326
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:33,333
and then later it became
an easy thing

327
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,337
for those who vilified him
or wished to to seize on.

328
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,882
<i>It became one of the running
themes of his life.</i>

329
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,579
‐ Grant, I'm sorry
it's come to this.

330
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,267
You have a choice:

331
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,730
resign or court martial.

332
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:22,257
‐ Hey, mister, you a soldier?

333
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,093
‐ Uh, n‐no, I'm‐‐

334
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,930
‐ Then why are you wearing
that old soldier's coat?

335
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:33,685
‐ It's a good coat,
but I'm not a soldier anymore.

336
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,520
‐ So what are you?

337
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,367
‐ May I ask who you are?

338
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:53,288
‐ Grant, Fred Grant.

339
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,207
‐ Ulys!

340
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,128
Ulys!

341
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,556
<i>‐ When Grant arrives back
at White Haven,</i>

342
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,309
<i>it must have been an
absolutely surreal experience.</i>

343
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,730
<i>He hadn't seen his wife,
Julia, in two years.</i>

344
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:23,652
<i>He hadn't seen his young son,
Fred, in two years,</i>

345
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,862
and he had never even met
his youngest son,

346
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,407
Ulysses Jr.‐‐
his namesake.

347
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,493
<i>‐ Grant is now very much</i>

348
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,203
<i>lorded over by
his father‐in‐law,</i>

349
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:36,164
Colonel Dent, who is convinced

350
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,835
that his daughter
has married beneath her.

351
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:44,840
<i>So there's a slow burn
going on in Ulysses Grant.</i>

352
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,883
<i>‐ Grant wants to be independent.</i>

353
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,844
<i>He wants to get out
of the main house,</i>

354
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:53,849
<i>to get away from Colonel Dent,
and so he builds Hardscrabble</i>

355
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,352
<i>on the 60 acres given
by Colonel Dent to Julia.</i>

356
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,355
<i>He's got to clear the land,
clear the wood.</i>

357
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,316
<i>He wants to have his family
in their own home.</i>

358
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,320
<i>That is the independent
streak in him.</i>

359
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,661
<i>Julia had absolute trust
in her husband.</i>

360
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:18,331
<i>He wasn't looking
for fame, fortune.</i>

361
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,877
<i>His ambitions centered
on his family.</i>

362
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,212
<i>He would say,
"You know my weaknesses,</i>

363
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,172
<i>my horses and my children."</i>

364
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,762
<i>‐ Grant is now faced</i>

365
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,931
<i>with the challenge
of making a living.</i>

366
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,392
He tried farming.
That doesn't work out so well.

367
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,812
<i>He tries a real estate
business in St. Louis,</i>

368
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,732
<i>but he's not really very good
at collecting rent.</i>

369
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,067
<i>He tries to get a job
as a surveyor,</i>

370
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,736
and he isn't able to get that.

371
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,405
<i>He doesn't really know
what to do.</i>

372
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,909
<i>What's staring him
in the face is poverty.</i>

373
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:58,246
<i>‐ I did not want to fly
from one thing to another,</i>

374
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,667
<i>but I was compelled to make
a living for my family.</i>

375
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,754
<i>If nothing else could be done,
I would load a cord of wood</i>

376
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,423
<i>and take it to the city
for sale.</i>

377
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,666
‐ Captain Grant?
‐ Whoa, whoa.

378
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:25,649
‐ I served under you in Mexico,
Molino del Rey.

379
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,108
‐ Oh.

380
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,886
‐ Hell of a day, sir.
‐ Yes.

381
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,223
‐ May I ask
what you're doing, sir?

382
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,477
‐ Solving the problem
of poverty.

383
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,733
‐ Sir.

384
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:51,883
<i>‐ Many people think that
Grant selling firewood</i>

385
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,677
<i>was beneath him,</i>

386
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:57,013
but the reality was he was
willing to do whatever it took

387
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,140
to provide for his family.

388
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,686
I think that's the core
of Ulysses S. Grant.

389
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,813
<i>You will encounter hardships.</i>

390
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,482
<i>You will encounter failures,</i>

391
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,025
<i>but you've got to keep pushing.</i>

392
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,528
<i>You've gotta keep persevering.</i>

393
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,366
<i>‐ He also, however, was living</i>

394
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,910
<i>in a kind of divided household.</i>

395
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,162
<i>He's living with
the Dent slaves,</i>

396
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,332
and Grant grew up in a home
where his own father

397
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,669
was very vocal
in his anti‐slavery attitudes.

398
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:31,172
<i>He is not an abolitionist.</i>

399
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,092
<i>In fact, Grant acquires
from Colonel Dent</i>

400
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,885
<i>a slave, William Jones,</i>

401
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,847
<i>but he's criticized by the Dents</i>

402
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,348
<i>and by their neighbors</i>

403
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,351
for working alongside
the slaves in the fields.

404
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,022
<i>‐ He actually got ridiculed
by some of his neighbors</i>

405
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,816
for being too nice
to his wife's slaves,

406
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,193
<i>that he was not
whipping them enough.</i>

407
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,529
<i>‐ I don't know why a black skin</i>

408
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:59,367
<i>may not cover a true heart
as well as a white one.</i>

409
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,871
‐ In the late 1850s,
Grant obviously

410
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:07,417
was already wrestling
with this slavery issue.

411
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:11,421
<i>‐ And then this new
political party surfaces,</i>

412
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,590
<i>the Republicans,</i>

413
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,217
<i>and they have as their platform</i>

414
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,470
not the abolition of slavery

415
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,638
but to stop slavery
from spreading

416
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,349
<i>to new territories
of the United States.</i>

417
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,935
<i>‐ Slaveholders
don't see it that way,</i>

418
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,564
and they believe that all
Republicans want to end slavery

419
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,566
even in the slaveholding South.

420
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,821
<i>Neither side is happy,
and things start amping up.</i>

421
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,991
‐ Grant found himself caught
in the crossfire

422
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:44,079
between the abolitionist Grants
and the slave‐owning Dents,

423
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,790
<i>but he had enough reservations
about slavery</i>

424
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,708
<i>that in March 1859</i>

425
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:52,087
<i>Grant goes to the circuit
court in St. Louis.</i>

426
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:58,408
‐ Name, age?
‐ Jones, William, 34.

427
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,931
‐ Prices are up.

428
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:06,267
I've got a friend
that'll get you $1,000 for him.

429
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,519
Are you sure you want
to let him free

430
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,312
when you can make some money?

431
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,796
‐ Yes.

432
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,472
God protect you, William.

433
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,144
‐ You also, sir.

434
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,988
<i>‐ Grant sets him free.</i>

435
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,992
When you imagine Grant
restoring freedom

436
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,827
to an enslaved human,

437
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,496
you have to imagine, like,
walking away from your house.

438
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,373
I hate to be
that callous about it,

439
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,916
<i>but you have to imagine
walking away</i>

440
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,751
<i>from the greatest asset</i>

441
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,005
<i>you could possibly have
at a time when you're poor.</i>

442
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,631
You're not gonna sell the house.

443
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,508
You're gonna walk away from it.

444
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,760
Uh, it's a tremendous act
of courage.

445
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,769
<i>‐ So finally in 1860, one year
before the Civil War,</i>

446
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,899
Grant, in what must have felt
like the ultimate humiliation,

447
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:40,236
goes to his overbearing father
and begs his father for a job

448
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,822
<i>as a clerk in his father's
leather goods store</i>

449
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:46,034
<i>in Bologna, Illinois.</i>

450
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,620
<i>He is bored and restless.</i>

451
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:54,667
<i>He seems destined for a life
of complete obscurity.</i>

452
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:58,046
‐ During that time
there's an idealistic visionary

453
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,716
from the west
beginning to emerge

454
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,719
<i>with a special kind
of speaking ability,</i>

455
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,931
<i>who could translate
a sort of folksy,</i>

456
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:11,225
<i>homespun understanding
of American affairs</i>

457
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,394
<i>to the wider public,</i>

458
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,480
<i>and he becomes
the Republican Party's</i>

459
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,775
<i>standard bearer
in the election of 1860,</i>

460
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,902
<i>and that man
was Abraham Lincoln.</i>

461
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,450
<i>‐ I wanted to see
Mr. Lincoln elected.</i>

462
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,243
<i>Excitement ran high,</i>

463
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:34,248
<i>and torch‐led processions
enlivened the street.</i>

464
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:38,044
<i>‐ As the secession
movement gained traction,</i>

465
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,463
<i>Grant was like many northerners</i>

466
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,924
<i>and a sizeable number
of southerners</i>

467
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,260
who wondered what we could do
to keep the Union together.

468
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,638
He didn't want the Union
to break up.

469
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,515
He thought that
would be a disaster.

470
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:54,477
<i>‐ I still had hopes for the
extreme pro‐slavery sentiment</i>

471
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,771
<i>to cool down,</i>

472
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,774
<i>but I was mistaken.</i>

473
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,152
<i>‐ The election
of Abraham Lincoln in 1860</i>

474
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:08,658
is a direct‐‐
direct assault on the South.

475
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:12,120
<i>The South is feeling
completely under attack,</i>

476
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,622
<i>that the new government
is going to come in,</i>

477
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,291
<i>and they're gonna take away
all their slaves,</i>

478
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,961
<i>and we're not gonna be
a part of a country</i>

479
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:23,006
that isn't going to help
preserve our way of life.

480
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,675
<i>Now we've gone and elected
this guy</i>

481
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,219
<i>from out
in the middle of Illinois,</i>

482
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,472
this little know‐nothing
lawyer...

483
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,645
And it's on.

484
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,856
<i>‐ A few days after
Lincoln's election,</i>

485
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,317
<i>South Caroline calls
for a secession convention,</i>

486
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,153
and on December the 20th, 1860,

487
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:49,449
<i>they pull themselves
out of the Union.</i>

488
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,659
<i>Mississippi and Florida
are the second</i>

489
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,995
<i>and third states to follow.</i>

490
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:57,999
<i>By February 1861,
seven deep Southern states</i>

491
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,586
<i>have left the union to form
the Confederate States.</i>

492
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,423
<i>Four additional states
will leave after the firing</i>

493
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,258
<i>on Fort Sumter.</i>

494
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,677
<i>‐ When Southern coastal
states seceded,</i>

495
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,180
they considered all
of the forts property

496
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,473
of the Confederacy.

497
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,682
Obviously the federal government

498
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,933
didn't see it that way,

499
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,685
and Lincoln said
he would possess,

500
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,771
hold, and occupy
federal property.

501
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,648
<i>The Confederates wanted
the Union soldiers to leave.</i>

502
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:26,277
They would not, and the South
opened fire to bombard

503
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,029
Fort Sumter into submission.

504
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,242
<i>‐ The war breaks out,</i>

505
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,537
<i>and the United States
government is desperate</i>

506
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,873
for anyone who's had any kind
of military experience.

507
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,043
<i>‐ Lincoln calls for
75,000 volunteers</i>

508
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,378
<i>to suppress the rebellion.</i>

509
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,880
<i>‐ Most people in the North</i>

510
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,590
thought this would be
a short event.

511
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,093
<i>The Union would
win this war quickly</i>

512
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,427
<i>with its military might,</i>

513
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,930
<i>with its railroads,
with its brave soldiers.</i>

514
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:57,058
‐ Back in Galena, Illinois,
Grant has a friend,

515
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,727
<i>John Rawlins,
who has received a commission</i>

516
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,588
<i>from the governor
to organize a regiment.</i>

517
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,238
‐ It's damn suicide,
don't you think?

518
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,240
‐ I'd give them 90 days,

519
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,367
but then again,
the South can claim

520
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,578
more than half the officers
at West Point,

521
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,122
and I've seen them in Mexico.

522
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,833
Quick on counterattacks,

523
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,293
know the terrain.

524
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,170
Can't underestimate them.

525
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,466
‐ I'm speaking at
the courthouse later,

526
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,635
hoping to raise a regiment here.

527
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,470
I'm sure the young men
would respect a soldier

528
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,473
with your experience.
‐ Mm.

529
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,142
I'm no speaker.

530
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,434
‐ Oh, hell,

531
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,770
I'm not asking you to speak.

532
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,526
I'm asking you to lead.

533
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,132
<i>‐ The call of the
President for 75,000 men</i>

534
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,801
<i>was heard throughout
the northern states.</i>

535
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,892
<i>There were but two parties now,</i>

536
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,853
<i>traitors and patriots.</i>

537
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,108
<i>‐ We don't see a lot
of expressions of emotion</i>

538
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:33,070
<i>from Grant until we talk
about the South seceding,</i>

539
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,406
rebelling against
the United States of America.

540
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:39,911
This‐‐this grinds
at Ulysses S. Grant.

541
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,746
<i>He grows up listening
about his relatives</i>

542
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,748
<i>fighting in the revolution,</i>

543
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,834
and so he is very emotional
about this idea of traitors.

544
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,087
<i>‐ Dear Father,
my inclination is to whip</i>

545
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,089
<i>the rebellion into submission.</i>

546
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,050
<i>‐ When Jefferson Davis
is sworn in</i>

547
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,968
<i>as Confederate president,</i>

548
00:33:55,992 --> 00:34:00,556
Grant is so upset by it that
he shakes his fist in the air

549
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,853
and says, "Davis and the whole
gang of them ought to be hung."

550
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,232
<i>‐ Many people
in the United States</i>

551
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:10,942
thought that this experiment

552
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,319
that the founding fathers
had put in place

553
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,655
<i>was in fact still an experiment</i>

554
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,615
<i>and was in jeopardy,</i>

555
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,618
<i>and this notion of fighting
for the Union was tied up</i>

556
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:24,497
<i>in believing that what
the founders had created</i>

557
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:28,542
<i>was in fact worth fighting for
and worth saving,</i>

558
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,003
<i>and that's why so many men
were willing</i>

559
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:35,967
<i>to risk their lives
to fight for the Union.</i>

560
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,426
<i>‐ Beginning of the war,</i>

561
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,679
<i>we have about 31 million people</i>

562
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,138
<i>in the United States.</i>

563
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,808
<i>About 21 million
live in the North.</i>

564
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,143
<i>About 10 million of them
live in the South,</i>

565
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,313
<i>but in the South about four
million of them are slaves,</i>

566
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:54,360
<i>so it's really 6 million
against 21 million.</i>

567
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:57,780
<i>The South is 80% agricultural,
but what do they grow?</i>

568
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,534
Tobacco, cotton,
indigo, rice, corn.

569
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,869
Well, you can only eat
two of those.

570
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:07,957
<i>From people to manufacturing
to technology,</i>

571
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:11,669
<i>the North has all
the advantages over the South,</i>

572
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,796
but that doesn't make it
a foregone conclusion

573
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,256
about who will win

574
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,675
because ultimately,
war is a clash of wills,

575
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,635
<i>and in this clash of wills,</i>

576
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,638
<i>maybe, just maybe
the South would win.</i>

577
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,727
<i>‐ After southern secession,</i>

578
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,353
<i>the federal government</i>

579
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,356
<i>was looking for a commander,</i>

580
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,317
this new Union army

581
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:37,695
that was going to try
to restore the republic.

582
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,447
<i>The first name
that comes to mind</i>

583
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,992
<i>is Robert E. Lee,
a Virginian.</i>

584
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,786
‐ Lee was offered
the command of the Union army

585
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,747
<i>and, of course,
did some deep thinking</i>

586
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,707
<i>and then decided
that his allegiance</i>

587
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,460
<i>was to the South and Virginia.</i>

588
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,213
<i>‐ Ulysses S. Grant,
however,</i>

589
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,717
<i>starts the Civil War
as a nobody,</i>

590
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,011
<i>but he gets a big break
when the governor of Illinois</i>

591
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:05,222
appoints him as commander of
one of the Illinois regiments,

592
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,667
and that will start
his military career again.

593
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,854
<i>‐ And so having come
from the tannery</i>

594
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,191
<i>and now having this window
of opportunity with this war</i>

595
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,652
to get back in the army,
to take command,

596
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,696
he recognizes that
"I must seize it," and he does.

597
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,157
<i>‐ Grant comes out
of a series of failures</i>

598
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,784
<i>in his civilian life.</i>

599
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:28,454
At one point, he has
to literally sell his watch

600
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:31,582
to buy Christmas presents
for his wife and children,

601
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,919
<i>and now all of a sudden
he's back in uniform.</i>

602
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,545
<i>‐ Grant comes in
with a firm hand.</i>

603
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,631
<i>He whips this regiment
into shape,</i>

604
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:42,409
and people start realizing
maybe we've got something here.

605
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,390
<i>‐ In the military,
he was home again.</i>

606
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:48,891
<i>There was something
about the way</i>

607
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,936
he unsheathed his sword,
the way he gave orders

608
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,046
that people suddenly
listened to and obeyed.

609
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,151
<i>‐ Very soon after the war began,</i>

610
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:03,030
<i>Grant gets orders to take
his men into Kentucky,</i>

611
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:07,451
as much for political reasons
as for military reasons.

612
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,787
<i>‐ Kentucky is one of
four slaveholding states</i>

613
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,748
that will remain
precariously tethered

614
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,250
to the Union throughout the war.

615
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,545
<i>We called those
the border states.</i>

616
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,380
<i>‐ Abraham Lincoln
was very concerned</i>

617
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,091
<i>about keeping Kentucky
in the Union.</i>

618
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,552
He said, "To lose Kentucky
is nearly the same

619
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,345
as to lose the whole game."

620
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,930
<i>He thought the other
border states</i>

621
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,558
<i>might follow suit as well.</i>

622
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:35,146
<i>And then a Confederate army
marched into Kentucky,</i>

623
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:39,442
<i>so Grant moves as fast as he
can to Paducah, Kentucky.</i>

624
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,540
<i>‐ Dear Julia,</i>

625
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,042
<i>secession flags
were flying through Paducah</i>

626
00:37:57,066 --> 00:38:00,463
<i>in anticipation
of Southern troops.</i>

627
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:04,925
<i>Our arrival, therefore, put
quite a damper on their hopes.</i>

628
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,314
Come away from the window.

629
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,483
Those are Yankees.

630
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,321
‐ General, it's time.
Troops are moving in.

631
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:38,709
<i>‐ Citizens of Paducah,
I have come among you</i>

632
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,628
<i>not as your enemy
but as your friend</i>

633
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:45,341
<i>and fellow citizen,
not to injure or annoy you</i>

634
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,551
<i>but to respect the rights
and to defend</i>

635
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:52,515
<i>and enforce the rights
of all loyal citizens.</i>

636
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:56,560
<i>‐ Grant issues a proclamation
to try to quell civilian fear,</i>

637
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,896
<i>and Abraham Lincoln takes note.</i>

638
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,483
Lincoln right away saw that
proclamation and recognized,

639
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:06,320
<i>"Here's a man who understands
people and is plain‐spoken,</i>

640
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,680
<i>just like me."</i>

641
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,536
<i>‐ Grant successfully
occupied Paducah, Kentucky</i>

642
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,204
without a shot being fired,

643
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,164
<i>and so he gets orders to attack</i>

644
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,251
<i>a Confederate supply link
on the Mississippi River</i>

645
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,045
<i>at the small village of Belmont.</i>

646
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,922
<i>Belmont is very important.</i>

647
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:28,968
It's Grant's first real test
of combat in the Civil War.

648
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,761
<i>‐ My dear Julia,</i>

649
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,681
<i>what you are to look out for
I cannot tell you,</i>

650
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,392
<i>but your husband will never
disgrace you</i>

651
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:39,019
<i>nor leave a defeated field.</i>

652
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:05,045
‐ Captain, flush
these rebels out now.

653
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,088
Go on.
Go.

654
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,339
‐ Yes, sir.

655
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,632
<i>‐ Whoo, let them
taste this steel!</i>

656
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,801
<i>‐ Form up!
On me!</i>

657
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,571
‐ Find the ammunition, boys!

658
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,326
<i>‐ The Confederates abandoned
their camp,</i>

659
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,704
<i>and these Union forces,
these are guys who just fought</i>

660
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,624
<i>their first battle,
very light casualties,</i>

661
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:45,336
and so they are euphoric
at this point.

662
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,839
<i>‐ Grant has won, seemingly,
a significant victory here,</i>

663
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,134
but his troops
lose all discipline.

664
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,429
<i>Don't mind if I do!</i>

665
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,057
‐ Show me that blood
on your hands!

666
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:04,063
‐ Hey, boys, look what I found.

667
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:10,027
‐ Captain, control your men!
‐ Yes, sir!

668
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,112
‐ Now I can hit them Yankees.

669
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,658
‐ Run!

670
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,124
‐ Captain, control your men!

671
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,085
‐ Yes, sir!

672
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,754
<i>‐ At Grant's first
engagement at Belmont,</i>

673
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:31,507
<i>the Confederates
counterattacked.</i>

674
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,263
‐ Into the trees!

675
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,641
We cut our way in.
We cut our way out.

676
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,310
‐ Keep your head down!
‐ Into the trees!

677
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,979
<i>‐ They organized
a fighting retreat</i>

678
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,647
<i>north to the riverboats</i>

679
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,441
that were going to give them
their means of escape.

680
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,819
<i>Grant was the last man
to get on board ship.</i>

681
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,654
<i>The boat had already untied</i>

682
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,656
<i>and was starting to drift
out into the river,</i>

683
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,200
<i>and Grant actually
rode his horse</i>

684
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,495
<i>across the gangplank
onto the riverboat.</i>

685
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,498
<i>It was an amazing feat
of horsemanship,</i>

686
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,501
<i>and Grant, in his typical
self‐deprecating style,</i>

687
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:11,505
he gave all the credit
to the horse.

688
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,966
<i>He made some serious mistakes.</i>

689
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:18,512
<i>He lost control of his men,
but he is learning,</i>

690
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,972
and coming out
of the Battle of Belmont,

691
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,765
he's looking for the next fight.

692
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,271
<i>‐ In the early years of the war</i>

693
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:30,524
<i>there are really
two distinct theaters.</i>

694
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,568
<i>You have the eastern theater,</i>

695
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:36,321
where a series of different
Union commanders prove

696
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:40,034
<i>incapable of really putting
the pressure on the South</i>

697
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,871
<i>that President Lincoln
wants to see,</i>

698
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,664
and then you have
the western theater,

699
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,458
which is where Grant is.

700
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,960
<i>‐ In that western theater,
the Union's strategy</i>

701
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,712
<i>is going to be</i>

702
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,840
to occupy key transportation
facilities in the west,

703
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:57,926
open up the entire Mississippi
if they can,

704
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,345
<i>and it was rather simple
to look on a map</i>

705
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,182
<i>where the Confederate
strong points were</i>

706
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,893
and see where
the dominoes might fall.

707
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,063
<i>Grant could plainly see
that the most obvious ones‐‐</i>

708
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,689
<i>the northernmost ones‐‐</i>

709
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,859
<i>were clearly
Forts Henry and Donelson.</i>

710
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,694
<i>They commanded key rivers,</i>

711
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,696
<i>and he could use
those key rivers</i>

712
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,409
<i>to advance directly
into the Confederacy.</i>

713
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,329
<i>‐ Grant wants to get
this war moving.</i>

714
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:28,791
He doesn't believe sitting in
garrison is gonna win anything,

715
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,418
<i>so he makes a proposal
to his commander,</i>

716
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,212
<i>General Henry Halleck.</i>

717
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:56,050
‐ General Halleck,
it's an honor.

718
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,479
‐ State briefly
the nature of your business.

719
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,793
‐ My division is stationed
here in Carroll

720
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,962
on the Cumberland River,

721
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,922
where we've been sizing up
a naval assault

722
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:21,576
on two enemy forts,
Fort Henry and Fort Donelson.

723
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,135
‐ Continue.

724
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,781
‐ Fort Henry is badly sited

725
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,741
and vulnerable from the water.

726
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,993
Fort Donelson is stronger

727
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,829
but commanded
by General John Floyd,

728
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,563
and he's no soldier.

729
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,834
I believe if I can
take both forts,

730
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:59,131
we can advance as far
as Nashville and Alabama.

731
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,925
‐ A combined naval assault?

732
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,203
‐ The victories would
be yours, sir.

733
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,705
‐ Thank you.

734
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,524
But when I wish
to consult you on a subject,

735
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,359
I will notify you.

736
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,573
‐ Yes, sir.

737
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,338
<i>‐ They called Halleck
"Old Brains."</i>

738
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,882
<i>They don't call him
that for nothing.</i>

739
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:45,260
He wants everything done
absolutely by the book,

740
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:49,181
<i>and Grant is not
a by‐the‐book kind of guy.</i>

741
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:51,225
<i>No limelight, no fanfare,</i>

742
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,560
and forget the pomp
and circumstance.

743
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,856
We're just gonna get it done,
and so the two clash.

744
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,900
<i>Grant,
with his bulldog mentality,</i>

745
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:03,320
<i>immediately turns to what
I call his naval soul mate,</i>

746
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:04,905
<i>Andrew H. Foote,</i>

747
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,241
<i>the naval commander
of the western flotilla</i>

748
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,076
<i>with ironclad gunboats.</i>

749
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,411
<i>‐ So the two of them
jointly made a proposal</i>

750
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,748
to General Halleck
to move against Fort Henry.

751
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,084
<i>‐ They're begging Halleck,
prodding Halleck.</i>

752
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,044
"Please, turn us loose.
Let us go,"

753
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,380
<i>and it's only by
the slimmest margins</i>

754
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:25,175
<i>that Halleck allows
Grant to attack.</i>

755
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,636
<i>‐ It's very different
to be in charge.</i>

756
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,306
<i>Command is
an extraordinary privilege</i>

757
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,933
and the weight of responsibility

758
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,102
is very much on your shoulders,

759
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:39,856
<i>and Grant experiences this
as he approaches Fort Henry.</i>

760
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:43,777
<i>‐ So February the 6th,</i>

761
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,405
<i>Foote's gunboats begin
to shell Fort Henry.</i>

762
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:48,407
<i>‐ The infantry's gonna get
behind each fort,</i>

763
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,450
<i>seal in
the Confederate defenders</i>

764
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,812
while the navy just pummels
Fort Henry into submission.

765
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:59,710
<i>‐ Most of the Confederates
had already evacuated.</i>

766
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:02,754
Fort Henry surrenders
before Grant's men

767
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,090
even get close to the fort.

768
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:07,968
<i>The capture of Fort Henry
was significant,</i>

769
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:12,472
but Grant is not gonna sit
and rest on his laurels.

770
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:16,601
<i>Fort Donelson was only
about 12 miles to the east.</i>

771
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,396
<i>He keeps the ball moving.</i>

772
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,690
‐ Grant's thinking,
"All I have to do is say boo,

773
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,817
and they'll‐‐
they'll surrender,"

774
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,653
and, um, it doesn't
really happen that way.

775
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,366
<i>‐ Fort Donelson was in
a much better position,</i>

776
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:35,329
<i>much better engineered
than Fort Henry.</i>

777
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:38,665
An artillery duel began between
the fort and his gunboats,

778
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,501
and in short, the fort won.

779
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,379
‐ The Confederates came out
of the fort to counterattack...

780
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:49,343
And the first thing
Grant does is not panic.

781
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,677
<i>That's a pattern with Grant.</i>

782
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,429
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

783
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:55,307
<i>no matter how bad it gets,
Grant doesn't panic.</i>

784
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,516
‐ In the midst of the battle,

785
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,976
which is truly chaotic,

786
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,020
<i>Grant keeps his wits about him.</i>

787
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,563
<i>He actually thinks.</i>

788
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:05,192
<i>He can take input.
He can change his mind.</i>

789
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,319
<i>‐ At Fort Donelson,
Grant will figure out</i>

790
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:09,696
these Confederates are moving
with their knapsacks.

791
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,156
They're not intending
on going back.

792
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,866
They're getting out of here.

793
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:29,615
‐ Bring me that prisoner.
Show me his bag.

794
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,514
This looks like
two days' rations...

795
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,724
No, three.

796
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,850
‐ Looks like they're settling in

797
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,227
to hold their position.

798
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,396
‐ Looks like that,
but it's a retreat.

799
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,232
Three days of rations is just
enough to get to Nashville.

800
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,568
‐ Sir, we should reinforce the
right and wait till nightfall.

801
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,904
‐ If we wait,
they'll have time to escape.

802
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:54,950
We got to attack now,
and we can take this victory.

803
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,660
Form your lines.

804
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,412
‐ Sir.

805
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,289
Form your lines!

806
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,041
Form your lines!

807
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,695
‐ Prepare to advance!

808
00:49:57,745 --> 00:50:02,851
‐ They want an armistice
and terms for surrender.

809
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,562
We've broken their defenses,
surrounded the fort,

810
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,356
and outnumber them
almost two to one.

811
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,318
It's checkmate.

812
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:14,428
‐ Who signed the note?
‐ General Buckner.

813
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:19,659
‐ Oh, Buckner.

814
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:23,163
I know him from West Point.

815
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:26,082
He paid off one of my debts
back in New York.

816
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,960
Saved me, really.

817
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:32,005
Helped me get back to my family.

818
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,782
‐ Then what are your terms?

819
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:43,225
‐ Immediate
and unconditional surrender,

820
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,085
or we fire on their works.

821
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:55,195
<i>‐ At Fort Donelson, Grant
had organized a counterattack.</i>

822
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:58,031
The Confederates withdrew back
into the fort,

823
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,325
<i>and they're trapped.</i>

824
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:01,868
<i>‐ When Grant got the message,</i>

825
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,620
<i>"Hey, I want to talk
about surrender,"</i>

826
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,540
<i>the Confederate command
situation at Fort Donelson</i>

827
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:09,793
had been an absolute
comedy of errors.

828
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:14,089
<i>There had been three general
officers inside Fort Donelson,</i>

829
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:17,592
<i>John Floyd, Gideon Pillow,</i>

830
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:21,263
<i>and Grant's old friend,
Simon Bolivar Buckner.</i>

831
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:25,642
But when the idea comes
to surrender, Floyd says,

832
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,561
"There is nobody
in the Confederacy

833
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,521
that they want worse than me,"

834
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,398
and so he says,
"I'm not surrendering,"

835
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,234
<i>and he'll get out of Dodge.</i>

836
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:36,570
<i>The second in command
is Gideon Pillow.</i>

837
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:39,864
<i>He thinks he's the greatest
military commander ever,</i>

838
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,408
<i>and Pillow says,</i>

839
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,076
"They want me as well,
so I'm not surrendering,"

840
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,704
so he gets out as well,
turning the command over

841
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:49,082
<i>to the third in command,
Simon Buckner.</i>

842
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,751
<i>‐ Surrender
was the proper thing.</i>

843
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,463
<i>I rode to Buckner's
headquarters.</i>

844
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,662
General Buckner.

845
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,979
‐ You would not have
taken the fort so easily

846
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,713
if I'd been in command.

847
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,317
‐ You're right.

848
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,343
I would have
done it differently.

849
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:24,284
I assume Floyd
and Pillow got away.

850
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:28,622
‐ Last night, yellow bastards.

851
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,291
Pillow feared
you'd want him prisoner.

852
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,501
‐ In my humblest opinion,
he's more valuable to me

853
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,152
as a Southern general.

854
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:46,473
‐ Well, here we are, old friend.

855
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,558
‐ Here we are.

856
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,352
‐ About the terms you sent.

857
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:52,979
‐ No terms.

858
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,214
Immediate and
unconditional surrender...

859
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,569
Old friend.

860
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:19,798
<i>‐ The first real victory
for the United States</i>

861
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:24,886
<i>occurred at Fort Donelson
in February of 1862</i>

862
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,764
<i>courtesy of Ulysses S. Grant.</i>

863
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:30,350
<i>U.S. Grant.</i>

864
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:35,689
<i>Useless Grant became
Unconditional Surrender Grant,</i>

865
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:39,401
and that thrilled
the northern population.

866
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:42,237
<i>It was big news
because nothing good</i>

867
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:46,241
<i>had been happening
for the Union in the war.</i>

868
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,743
<i>‐ In the eastern theater
of the war,</i>

869
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,370
<i>Lincoln is dealing
with one whining,</i>

870
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:53,915
<i>procrastinating general
after another,</i>

871
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,750
but here's
this Ulysses S. Grant

872
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,044
out west who's
winning battle after battle,

873
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,046
<i>and Lincoln is thrilled.</i>

874
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,882
<i>He rushes to sign the order
promoting Grant</i>

875
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,509
<i>to major general.</i>

876
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,095
<i>‐ The first significant
Northern victory</i>

877
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,891
of the Civil War will launch
Grant to national prominence.

878
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,811
<i>During the aftermath of
the Battle at Fort Donelson,</i>

879
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:18,106
<i>a war correspondent
painted a picture of Grant</i>

880
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,649
<i>mounted on horseback,</i>

881
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,736
<i>and in his mouth
is the stub of a cigar.</i>

882
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,779
<i>As this was the first great
Northern victory</i>

883
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,740
<i>of the Civil War, fans‐‐</i>

884
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:31,453
admirers‐‐
sent him 5,000 cigars,

885
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:33,788
and so he started
smoking these things,

886
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:37,941
<i>and Grant would smoke
upwards of 20 of these a day.</i>

887
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,714
<i>‐ For Grant,
the first year goes good.</i>

888
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:46,468
If there's a rookie
of the year for the Union side,

889
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,927
<i>it's Ulysses S. Grant.</i>

890
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,763
<i>Nobody's wining
the victories like he is.</i>

891
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,975
<i>‐ He realized again that
he had a gift for this.</i>

892
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:57,437
He was very, very good
at battlefield command,

893
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:58,813
and then beyond that,

894
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:02,650
at battlefield strategy
and tactics.

895
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,320
<i>‐ Grant has captured the first
of three armies</i>

896
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:08,114
that he will capture
over the course of the war,

897
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,075
<i>and he has now opened
the Cumberland River</i>

898
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:14,454
<i>so Union naval forces
and land forces</i>

899
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:18,374
<i>can make their way south deep
into the Confederacy.</i>

900
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,460
<i>‐ Dear Julia,</i>

901
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,962
<i>soon I hope to move from here,</i>

902
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,465
<i>and when I do,
there will probably</i>

903
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:28,825
<i>be the greatest battle
fought of the war.</i>

904
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,957
<i>I have no doubt of the result.</i>

905
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:43,358
‐ Yah, yah!
Ha!

906
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:46,069
<i>‐ The enemy was
in force in Corinth,</i>

907
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,655
<i>the junction of the two
most important railroads</i>

908
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,657
<i>in the Mississippi Valley.</i>

909
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,034
<i>If we obtained possession
of Corinth,</i>

910
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,827
<i>the enemy would have no railroad</i>

911
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,998
<i>for the transportation
of armies or supplies.</i>

912
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,417
‐ Grant is thinking,
"How do I stay two steps ahead?

913
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,877
"How do I retain the initiative?

914
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,255
How do I keep the enemy
reacting to me?"

915
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,549
<i>The war in the east
is going badly,</i>

916
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,051
<i>so everything
is under a microscope,</i>

917
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,679
<i>but in the west,
with the first big victories</i>

918
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,222
<i>at Forts Henry and Donelson,</i>

919
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:16,057
<i>now all of a sudden
the Tennessee</i>

920
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:19,143
<i>and Cumberland Rivers are open
to invade the South,</i>

921
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,854
and this is what
Grant seizes upon.

922
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,274
<i>‐ Knowing that the enemy's
fortifying Corinth</i>

923
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,484
<i>and collecting an army there,</i>

924
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,820
<i>I at once put all
the troops in motion</i>

925
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:30,613
<i>for Pittsburg Landing.</i>

926
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,286
<i>‐ Pittsburg Landing
is a staging area</i>

927
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,162
<i>to attack at Corinth.</i>

928
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,872
General Halleck warns Grant,

929
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,750
"Don't bring on an engagement.
Don't start anything.

930
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,962
Don't pick a fight
until everything is ready."

931
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:48,840
<i>‐ The army had arrived
with one of Grant's</i>

932
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,301
<i>core commanders,
William Tecumseh Sherman.</i>

933
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,845
<i>Sherman was a friend
of Grant's at West Point,</i>

934
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:56,472
<i>but they had not worked
together before,</i>

935
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,726
and many of Grant's men
were absolutely green.

936
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,479
<i>Some had just received their
weapons a few days earlier.</i>

937
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:07,609
<i>So Grant's intention is to get
his men some training</i>

938
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:10,486
and wait there
for another Union army

939
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,113
<i>under the command
of Don Carlos Buell</i>

940
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,950
<i>to get there
and then set out to Corinth.</i>

941
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,369
‐ So the idea
of fighting a battle

942
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,912
never enters Grant's mind

943
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,832
at Pittsburg Landing,
and the scene is set

944
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:26,377
<i>for what would become
this bloodbath of Shiloh.</i>

945
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,139
‐ Sir, do you want
the new men digging trenches?

946
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,766
‐ I don't intend
to be here long enough.

947
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,309
The men are raw.

948
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:43,794
They need practice with guns,
not with shovels.

949
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,190
Sherman.

950
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:50,860
‐ Sam.
‐ Activity?

951
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,195
‐ The Rebs
stick their noses out,

952
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:53,863
and we keep slapping them.

953
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,865
Whipped them
in a skirmish yesterday.

954
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:59,142
‐ And General Buell's men?
‐ They're three days out.

955
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,875
‐ We'll move on Corinth
when he gets here.

956
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,377
‐ If we go down here‐‐

957
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,212
‐ Yeah.
‐ The whole way down‐‐

958
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:12,632
<i>‐ To General Halleck,
the temper of the rebel troops</i>

959
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,967
<i>is such that there
is little doubt that Corinth</i>

960
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:20,098
<i>will fall much more easily
than Fort Donelson did.</i>

961
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:22,433
<i>‐ Grant's major fault early
in the war</i>

962
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,812
<i>is this overconfidence.</i>

963
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,480
He thinks, "If anything happens,

964
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:31,007
I'm gonna start it,"
and it comes back to bite him.

965
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,319
<i>‐ Their commander at Corinth,</i>

966
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,862
<i>General Albert Sidney Johnston,</i>

967
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,615
<i>has been doing nothing
but retreat.</i>

968
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,868
<i>If he cannot regain the
initiative and defeat Grant,</i>

969
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,662
<i>it likely will mean</i>

970
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:45,540
<i>the Confederacy will lose
the Mississippi River.</i>

971
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,126
<i>Johnston really believes that
the war itself</i>

972
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,128
<i>may be at stake,</i>

973
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:54,531
so Johnston decides to organize
a counterattack against Grant.

974
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:57,385
<i>‐ Johnston knows that Grant's
army's tucked up</i>

975
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,178
<i>into Pittsburg Landing,</i>

976
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:02,598
<i>which is a cul‐de‐sac
along the Tennessee River</i>

977
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,393
<i>in between two major creeks.</i>

978
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:08,312
<i>It seems like a good place
to camp the army.</i>

979
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,647
There are good springs here.

980
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,023
There are creeks.
We can get water.

981
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,609
It's good, level camping ground,

982
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,738
<i>but the Confederate plan
is to trap the Union army</i>

983
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:18,948
<i>in this cul‐de‐sac</i>

984
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:23,870
<i>and to destroy the Union army
with one massive attack.</i>

985
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:29,459
And so Johnston gambles,
and he says,

986
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:31,878
<i>"We must roll
the iron dice of battle.</i>

987
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:34,839
We must conquer or perish."

988
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:46,184
<i>‐ Grant's camp
at Pittsburg Landing</i>

989
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:49,395
<i>was right near
a small wooden church.</i>

990
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:55,193
<i>It's one of the only landmarks
in the entire vicinity.</i>

991
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:01,073
<i>It was called Shiloh Church.</i>

992
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:04,911
<i>Shiloh is translated
as "place of peace."</i>

993
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,905
Rebs!

994
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,700
Fire!

995
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,869
‐ Rebs!

996
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:29,871
We got them from the woods!
Rebs!

997
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:36,002
‐ In the woods!

998
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:39,005
Rebs in the woods!

999
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,842
‐ Rebs!

1000
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:44,260
They're coming from the woods!

1001
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:45,928
‐ Rebs in the woods!
‐ Rebs!

1002
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,974
‐ Wait, wait, what?

1003
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:51,726
<i>‐ Move, move!</i>

1004
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,367
<i>‐ Report.</i>

1005
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,494
‐ Skirmishes, sir.
That's all.

1006
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,498
‐ These are not damn skirmishes.

1007
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:17,501
My God, we are attacked.
Form a line and hold it.

1008
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:29,430
‐ Ammunition!

1009
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:31,474
<i>‐ Grant is not at Shiloh.</i>

1010
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:34,226
<i>Grant is actually
having breakfast 9 miles north</i>

1011
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,229
<i>in his quarters
at the Cherry Mansion.</i>

1012
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:53,496
‐ Gentlemen...

1013
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,082
the ball is in motion.

1014
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,570
Fire!

1015
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,099
‐ Let's get these boys moving.

1016
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:16,227
Form them into regiments.

1017
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:19,772
I don't care what regiments
they used to be in.

1018
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,482
Make new ones.

1019
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,859
‐ Yes, sir.

1020
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,569
‐ Come on, boys, form up!

1021
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:26,946
On me!
‐ Form up, regiment two.

1022
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,199
Fall in!

1023
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,617
‐ Buell won't get here
till nightfall,

1024
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:35,496
and Wallace is still
six miles north.

1025
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,915
‐ Order Wallace to come here
at once with his men.

1026
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:40,835
Sherman?
‐ No news.

1027
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,339
<i>‐ On the first day
of the Battle of Shiloh,</i>

1028
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,800
<i>about 40,000
Confederate soldiers</i>

1029
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:52,763
<i>surprise the Union army
and begin pushing forward.</i>

1030
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:55,224
It is the largest attack
in American history

1031
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,601
up to that time.

1032
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,312
<i>‐ When Grant finally got
to Pittsburg Landing,</i>

1033
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,981
officers didn't know
where their men were.

1034
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:04,358
Their men didn't know
where the units were.

1035
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:08,446
<i>‐ Grant immediately begins
to assess the situation,</i>

1036
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:12,324
<i>and it's almost as
if battle clarified his mind,</i>

1037
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,952
and he could see the central
thing he needed to do,

1038
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,371
<i>to remain calm,</i>

1039
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:20,958
<i>to collect soldiers who have
straggled back into the area,</i>

1040
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:25,379
<i>and begin to plug
this defensive line.</i>

1041
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:47,193
‐ Hurt bad, Private?

1042
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,612
‐ It's only a scratch, sir.

1043
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,447
‐ So you can fight?

1044
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,452
Come on now, boys.

1045
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:59,622
Pitch in.
I'm right behind you.

1046
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:05,836
<i>‐ Grant makes his way
around the battlefield,</i>

1047
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,214
<i>not caught up in the chaos,</i>

1048
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:10,132
<i>thinking,
"Where are my commanders?</i>

1049
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,051
What's their assessment of
the fight and how it's going,

1050
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,720
and what can I do
to assist them?"

1051
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:21,685
‐ If Pittsburg Landing falls,
Grant knows his army is gone.

1052
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:25,272
<i>‐ If the Confederate plan
is to trap the Union army</i>

1053
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,775
<i>in this cul‐de‐sac
along the Tennessee River,</i>

1054
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:32,238
then Grant will utilize
this trap perfectly

1055
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:35,032
<i>to fight a delaying action
to hold out</i>

1056
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:38,828
<i>until Don Carlos Buell's
reinforcements arrive.</i>

1057
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:41,872
<i>He has a whole division
under Lew Wallace much nearer,</i>

1058
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,749
<i>and as he goes around</i>

1059
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,417
<i>and he talks to the different
division commanders</i>

1060
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,711
<i>throughout the day,
he will tell them,</i>

1061
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,130
"Hey, Lew Wallace is on the way.

1062
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:52,174
Should be here any moment now."

1063
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,469
<i>‐ There's confusion</i>

1064
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,805
<i>and incoherence
on the battlefield,</i>

1065
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:00,641
but Grant had enormous
control of his emotions,

1066
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:04,520
so his physical courage,
this quiet competence,

1067
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:07,565
<i>and he was a great horseman
in a day and age</i>

1068
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:09,859
<i>when that was
a very important skill</i>

1069
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,153
<i>to have on the battlefield.</i>

1070
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:14,947
<i>‐ A number of attempts
were made by the enemy</i>

1071
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,849
<i>to turn our right flank
where Sherman was posted.</i>

1072
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:20,870
General Sherman, situation?

1073
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,621
‐ General.

1074
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:25,291
The boys bounced,
but they didn't break.

1075
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:28,544
I need reinforcements now.
Where's Buell?

1076
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:30,838
‐ No Buell.

1077
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:34,675
I've sent for Wallace.
Can you hold your position?

1078
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:38,494
‐ Yes, sir, but it'll cost.

1079
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:43,350
<i>‐ At the Battle of Shiloh
Sherman and Grant,</i>

1080
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:46,937
<i>while they had never been what
you would call good friends,</i>

1081
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:49,273
<i>they will first
come into their own</i>

1082
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:53,736
<i>as this wonderful duo
who will turn out to be</i>

1083
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,697
<i>one of the great working
partnerships of the war.</i>

1084
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,700
While so many other fragments
of that Union army

1085
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:02,328
dissolve in panicked retreat,

1086
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:06,582
<i>Sherman slows
the Confederate onslaught.</i>

1087
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:09,376
<i>‐ Nevertheless,
Grant knew that he may need</i>

1088
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,880
<i>that division of Lew Wallace's
to survive this fight,</i>

1089
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:15,966
but there's great confusion
with Wallace's division

1090
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,928
<i>on how they should get
to the battlefield,</i>

1091
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:22,723
<i>and Wallace does not show up.</i>

1092
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,391
As the Confederates
move forward,

1093
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:26,727
the fighting became more
and more constricted.

1094
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:29,897
<i>It becomes a very chaotic,
brutal fight,</i>

1095
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,858
<i>and Grant recognizes
that at points of chaos</i>

1096
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,777
<i>when everything is going wrong,</i>

1097
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:39,406
<i>you just simply have to do
something to regain control.</i>

1098
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:43,577
‐ Grant is not gonna give up.
He's gonna stick and fight.

1099
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:50,084
‐ Lieutenant.
‐ General Grant, sir.

1100
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:52,002
‐ Move your men to the left,
Lieutenant.

1101
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,420
Do it now.
‐ Yes, sir.

1102
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:02,161
‐ Take cover!
There's too many of them!

1103
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:44,430
<i>‐ Contrary to all my
experience up to that time,</i>

1104
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,765
<i>we were on the defensive.</i>

1105
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,434
<i>The endeavor of the enemy</i>

1106
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,061
<i>was simply to hurl
their men against ours</i>

1107
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:54,565
<i>with a disregard of losses
on their own side.</i>

1108
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:56,859
‐ Grant realized
he needed to buy time,

1109
01:08:56,883 --> 01:09:00,321
or his army was about
to be overwhelmed.

1110
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:03,532
<i>‐ Shiloh,
the first day doesn't go well,</i>

1111
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,118
<i>but in the chaos, noise,
the friction that we know</i>

1112
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,203
<i>is inherent in a battlefield,</i>

1113
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,748
nobody gets it right initially.
Nobody.

1114
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:13,459
<i>Grant is able to learn
through hard experience,</i>

1115
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:16,337
and he has this vision
of how it's gonna turn out

1116
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:18,672
in spite of all
that's going bad around him.

1117
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:22,801
<i>‐ Grant is already thinking
to fall back gradually,</i>

1118
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,596
<i>holding successive lines
of defense,</i>

1119
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:28,807
basically trading space
for time to hold out

1120
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:32,478
until our reinforcements arrive.

1121
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:35,439
<i>‐ And so orders went out
to all his division commanders</i>

1122
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:38,442
to hold their positions,
as Grant put it,

1123
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:40,819
"at all hazards."

1124
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,654
‐ What is it?

1125
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:45,866
‐ General Prentiss surrendered.

1126
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,743
2,000 soldiers.

1127
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,335
‐ Move the artillery
to the high ground.

1128
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:57,670
Start the barrage at nightfall.

1129
01:09:57,694 --> 01:10:00,464
Have the navy chip
in from the river.

1130
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:02,466
‐ I'll telegraph Porter.

1131
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:11,016
<i>‐ Grant on the battlefield
does not appear</i>

1132
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,687
to let the demons
of failure enter.

1133
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:17,815
He's already been there.
He's a fighter.

1134
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:20,859
<i>That's one of the things
he brought to any army</i>

1135
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:24,321
<i>he was in command of,
was that sense of endurance,</i>

1136
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:27,199
<i>the sense that this isn't
going to be easy.</i>

1137
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,202
<i>"I'm not looking
to win it in a day."</i>

1138
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:36,041
<i>‐ Grant has been falling back
throughout the day,</i>

1139
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,877
<i>and the Confederate commander,
Albert Sidney Johnston,</i>

1140
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,879
wades into the battle himself

1141
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,841
<i>because he's gotta conquer
or perish,</i>

1142
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:47,720
and all of a sudden Johnston
is hit in the back of the leg,

1143
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,054
and he bleeds to death.

1144
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,890
<i>He doesn't conquer.
He perishes.</i>

1145
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:55,018
<i>‐ Johnston's second in command,</i>

1146
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,229
<i>Pierre Gustave
Toutant Beauregard,</i>

1147
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,857
<i>took over,
and Beauregard believed</i>

1148
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:03,569
they had the Union army right
where they wanted them,

1149
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:07,263
<i>but Grant used the terrain
extraordinarily well.</i>

1150
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,075
<i>His men constructed
this defensive line</i>

1151
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,786
<i>along this deep ravine.</i>

1152
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:16,123
<i>The Confederates have to go
down into this ravine.</i>

1153
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:18,709
<i>They make one charge
up out of the ravine</i>

1154
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:22,755
<i>into this whirlwind of Union
artillery and musket fire.</i>

1155
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:26,008
<i>They are driven back
by this intense fire.</i>

1156
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:28,594
<i>Orders start to echo down
the Confederate line</i>

1157
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,888
<i>that we're done.
Stop the attack.</i>

1158
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:34,600
Beauregard stopped the fight.

1159
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,643
"We'll finish this up
in the morning."

1160
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,604
<i>Grant, sitting on horseback</i>

1161
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:41,440
<i>watching as the Confederates
fell back into the ravine,</i>

1162
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:45,235
<i>said, "Not beaten yet
by a damn sight."</i>

1163
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,780
<i>‐ Grant, with
this dogged determination,</i>

1164
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:51,784
he thinks that nobody
can beat him.

1165
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:54,411
<i>‐ By the time
darkness falls, yes,</i>

1166
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:57,623
<i>it's been a bad day
for the Union army,</i>

1167
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:01,251
<i>but they haven't been
pushed off Pittsburg Landing.</i>

1168
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:04,546
They're still holding on
to that strip of ground,

1169
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,298
<i>and what's more,
across the river</i>

1170
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:09,426
<i>Don Carlos Buell
is finally starting to arrive</i>

1171
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,929
<i>and there are federal gunboats
out on the river whose shells</i>

1172
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:16,082
<i>are keeping the Confederates
at bay in the darkness.</i>

1173
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:20,979
‐ But there were a number of
Union officers coming to Grant

1174
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:24,966
that night saying,
"Let's get out of here."

1175
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,612
<i>‐ Grant is almost
defeated on the first day,</i>

1176
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:31,782
<i>almost driven back
into the river,</i>

1177
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:36,495
and this is where you see Grant
at his most indomitable,

1178
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:39,832
in a sense‐‐most determined,
most imperturbable.

1179
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:42,626
<i>He is under a tree.</i>

1180
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,671
<i>He can hear
the cries of the wounded,</i>

1181
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:48,006
and Sherman comes
out of the dark.

1182
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:03,730
‐ General Grant.
‐ Sherman.

1183
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:10,362
‐ Well, Sam, we've had
the devil's own day,

1184
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,989
haven't we?

1185
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:20,914
‐ Lick them tomorrow though.

1186
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:23,500
‐ When Wallace
and Buell turn up?

1187
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:28,839
‐ They asked me
my plan to retreat.

1188
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,952
I'll fire the first gun
in the morning.

1189
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:46,023
<i>‐ On the second day of battle,</i>

1190
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:47,482
<i>I gathered out parts</i>

1191
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:50,110
<i>of regiments from troops nearby</i>

1192
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,112
<i>and marched them forward.</i>

1193
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,659
<i>‐ Grant knew his army
was disorganized.</i>

1194
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,329
<i>They had spent a full day</i>

1195
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:02,706
<i>carrying out this brutal fight,</i>

1196
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,833
<i>but he also suspected
the Confederates</i>

1197
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:09,087
<i>were in the same condition,</i>

1198
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,298
<i>and so he believed
whoever seizes the initiative</i>

1199
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:15,010
<i>in the morning
will indeed be the victor.</i>

1200
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:16,845
So orders went out to all
his division commanders

1201
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,722
at first light,
"begin the attack.

1202
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:22,893
Wherever you are with whoever
you have, begin the attack."

1203
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,728
‐ Find another commander
at Shiloh

1204
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:27,606
that's gonna attack on day two.

1205
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:28,857
Everybody else is thinking,

1206
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,193
"Oh, my goodness,
there's no way."

1207
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:33,904
<i>I think that Grant
looks at this equation</i>

1208
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:35,697
<i>differently than everyone else.</i>

1209
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:39,117
<i>Grant, who's failed and had
to look at the dark side</i>

1210
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,953
<i>of how to be resilient,</i>

1211
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:42,663
<i>I think it gives him
an extra source of strength</i>

1212
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:44,247
<i>that most other commanders</i>

1213
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:47,334
<i>don't have the ability
to tap into.</i>

1214
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,711
<i>‐ He had the gift of being able</i>

1215
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:53,423
to take in a landscape, a map,

1216
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:57,344
and know almost at once
what needed to be defended,

1217
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:59,763
<i>what couldn't be defended,</i>

1218
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:02,849
<i>and what Grant
had seen at Shiloh</i>

1219
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,393
<i>was that the Confederates</i>

1220
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:05,936
<i>had exhausted their last energy</i>

1221
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,480
<i>just in getting as far
as they had.</i>

1222
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:12,442
<i>Grant had seen that
if in the night Buell's troops</i>

1223
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:13,777
<i>could be ferried over</i>

1224
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:16,154
<i>and Grant's army
could be rallied</i>

1225
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,532
<i>and somehow reorganized
and put back into position</i>

1226
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:20,659
<i>for a counterattack
the next morning,</i>

1227
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:25,247
<i>then the Confederate army
itself would collapse.</i>

1228
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:28,667
<i>‐ Grant was determined
to stay and fight.</i>

1229
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,252
<i>Everything he's learned
came into play</i>

1230
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:34,172
<i>in making that decision.</i>

1231
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:38,635
That's the point
where Grant becomes Grant.

1232
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:48,520
<i>‐ This day everything is
favorable for the Union side.</i>

1233
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:51,106
<i>We have now become
the attacking party.</i>

1234
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:52,733
‐ Move along!

1235
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:03,535
‐ Advance along!

1236
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:35,525
<i>‐ The enemy was driven
back all day,</i>

1237
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:39,321
<i>as we had been the day before.</i>

1238
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:41,031
<i>‐ It was another brutal day</i>

1239
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:45,160
<i>of fighting over much
of the same ground,</i>

1240
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:47,370
<i>but by 2:00 in the afternoon</i>

1241
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:49,206
<i>Confederate commander Beauregard</i>

1242
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:51,625
<i>ordered a withdrawal
back to Corinth.</i>

1243
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:58,840
<i>‐ The battle is over, and it is,</i>

1244
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:02,302
<i>technically speaking,
a victory for the Union army.</i>

1245
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:06,997
It's a victory which has been
won at terrible prices.

1246
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,520
<i>‐ Huge casualties.</i>

1247
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:16,650
<i>25,000 killed,
wounded, and missing.</i>

1248
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:18,735
<i>This was the first time
in American history</i>

1249
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:21,404
<i>that we've seen this.</i>

1250
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:22,989
The armies in the revolution
and the War of 1812

1251
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:26,952
are smaller than
the casualty count at Shiloh.

1252
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:29,287
<i>‐ I saw an open field
on the second day</i>

1253
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,248
<i>so covered with the dead</i>

1254
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:33,041
<i>that it would have been possible</i>

1255
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:36,586
<i>to walk across the clearing
stepping on dead bodies</i>

1256
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,172
<i>without a foot
touching the ground.</i>

1257
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:49,808
<i>‐ Shiloh itself means
"place of peace."</i>

1258
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:51,351
<i>Shiloh, for two days,</i>

1259
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:55,647
<i>was anything
but a place of peace.</i>

1260
01:17:55,671 --> 01:18:02,028
Shiloh is incredibly important
as the place where our country

1261
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:06,056
woke up to the reality
of what it had signed up for.

1262
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:09,703
<i>It was as if
from the battlefield</i>

1263
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:13,206
<i>a metaphorical postcard
went home to America,</i>

1264
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:16,751
<i>and it said,
with a picture of the dead,</i>

1265
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:20,964
<i>"This is what
you've signed up for."</i>

1266
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:23,925
<i>It forced us to wake up.</i>

1267
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:26,887
<i>It forced us to grow up.</i>

1268
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:29,931
<i>It forced us to realize
that this was going</i>

1269
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,767
<i>to be much harder
than anybody had imagined.</i>

1270
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:23,109
<i>‐ Up to the Battle of Shiloh,
I believed that the rebellion</i>

1271
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:26,238
<i>would collapse
suddenly and soon...</i>

1272
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:33,119
<i>But after Shiloh I gave up
all idea of saving the Union</i>

1273
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:37,249
<i>except by complete conquest.</i>

1274
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:53,640
<i>After Shiloh,
I was no longer boss.</i>

1275
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:57,227
Lincoln was right.
Vicksburg is the key.

1276
01:19:57,251 --> 01:20:01,606
<i>The art of war is simple enough.</i>

1277
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,441
<i>Find out where your enemy is...</i>

1278
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:09,030
<i>Strike him as hard as you can,
and keep moving on.</i>

1279
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,991
‐ You'll go after Lee.

1280
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,285
<i>You'll go after him
until he's finished.</i>

1281
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,788
<i>‐ It all depends on you.</i>

1281
01:20:17,305 --> 01:20:23,710

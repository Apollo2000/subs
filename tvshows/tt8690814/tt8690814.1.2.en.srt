1
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,866
<i>‐ Ulysses S. Grant.</i>

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,534
This man's name
is U. S. Grant.

3
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,204
<i>‐ A military life
had no charms for me.</i>

4
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:22,332
<i>‐ Grant, you know
the rules about drink.</i>

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,084
<i>Resign or court‐martial.</i>

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,212
<i>‐ I'm not asking you to speak.</i>

7
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,214
I'm asking you to lead.

8
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,007
<i>‐ There were
but two parties now,</i>

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,676
<i>traitors and patriots.</i>

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,595
I believe
if I can take both forts,

11
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,139
we can advance
as far as Nashville.

12
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,808
‐ When I wish to consult you
on the subject,

13
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,102
I will notify you.

14
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,437
<i>‐ General Buell's men?</i>

15
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,688
‐ They're three days out.

16
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,732
‐ We'll move on Corinth
when he gets here.

17
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,860
<i>There is little doubt
that Corinth will fall easily.</i>

18
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:53,905
‐ Fire!

19
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,789
‐ Come on, now, boys, pitch in.

20
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,332
I'm right behind you.

21
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,045
Fire the cannon!

22
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:22,141
<i>‐ Very few people really know
who Ulysses S. Grant was.</i>

23
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:26,688
<i>‐ Today there is this sense
that he's forgotten.</i>

24
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,941
<i>‐ He's been called
so many things over the years.</i>

25
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,569
<i>‐ The greatest general
of his time.</i>

26
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,779
<i>‐ A military genius.</i>

27
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,614
<i>‐ A bloody butcher.</i>

28
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,616
<i>‐ A corrupt president.</i>

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,685
<i>‐ A belligerent drunk
who got lucky.</i>

30
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,747
He didn't get lucky.

31
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,709
<i>‐ Ulysses S. Grant
is this perfectly average,</i>

32
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,671
humble individual from a poor,
hardscrabble background.

33
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,924
<i>‐ With a lot of hard times
and failures in his life.</i>

34
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,135
‐ But he's got
this dogged determination,

35
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,804
<i>this bulldog mentality.</i>

36
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,431
‐ This guy comes from nothing,

37
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,765
<i>rises to the highest ranks</i>

38
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,600
<i>of the Union army.</i>

39
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,228
<i>‐ Fights bloody,
terrible battles.</i>

40
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,814
<i>‐ With indomitable will.</i>

41
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,024
‐ To save the Union.

42
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,942
<i>‐ To heal his country.</i>

43
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,988
<i>‐ To lead the nation
towards justice for everybody.</i>

44
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,449
<i>‐ He's the unheroic hero</i>

45
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,577
<i>of our greatest national epic,
the American Civil War.</i>

46
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,079
<i>‐ It's truly an American story</i>

47
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,498
<i>not only of patriotism
to the nation</i>

48
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,542
<i>but for the values, who we are,</i>

49
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,794
<i>and who we aspire to be.</i>

50

51
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,561
<i>‐ Dear Julia...</i>

52
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,897
<i>the battle at this place
was the most desperate</i>

53
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,816
<i>that has ever taken place
on the continent,</i>

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,819
<i>and I don't look
for another like it.</i>

55
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,755
<i>‐ The battle of Shiloh
is the bloodiest battle</i>

56
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,216
<i>in American history
up to that time.</i>

57
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,342
The nation is shocked

58
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,177
when the casualty reports
come out.

59
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,225
<i>‐ Grant doesn't come out
of Shiloh looking very good.</i>

60
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,685
You know, he was
"Unconditional Surrender" Grant

61
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,062
at Fort Donelson,

62
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,730
became a hero.

63
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,982
And now all of a sudden,
people are asking,

64
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,568
<i>"What happened?"</i>

65
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,071
<i>‐ The casualty list
and the fact that Grant</i>

66
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,949
was surprised on the first day

67
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,327
overshadow the fact
of the victory.

68
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,581
<i>‐ Rumors start
reaching Washington</i>

69
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,959
that explain that surprise
as Grant must be

70
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,710
on the bottle once again.

71
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,754
<i>But the president answered</i>

72
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,298
<i>those critical of Grant
by saying,</i>

73
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,968
<i>"I can't spare this man.</i>

74
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,928
<i>He fights."</i>

75
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,443
<i>‐ After the bloodbath
of Shiloh...</i>

76
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,736
<i>Grant's superior,</i>

77
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,613
<i>Henry W. Halleck,</i>

78
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,575
<i>removes Grant
from his army command...</i>

79
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,411
with no duties,

80
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,455
no real authority, nothing.

81
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,293
<i>‐ Grant is so frustrated
by this.</i>

82
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,170
<i>Halleck is not aggressive,</i>

83
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,463
and then you have
someone like Grant,

84
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,922
who is very go‐get‐'em.

85
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,300
He's ready to jump in,
grab the initiative.

86
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,260
<i>Grant wants to finish off</i>

87
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,095
<i>what's left
of the Confederate army</i>

88
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,764
<i>that attacked him at Shiloh</i>

89
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,308
<i>but are having time
to reorganize themselves</i>

90
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,269
<i>as they fall back into Corinth.</i>

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,901
<i>‐</i> They're well defended.

92
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,612
I would say quite active.

93
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,947
They're preparing for battle.

94
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,201
‐ Respectfully,
General Halleck, that smoke?

95
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,454
It's plain.
They're burning supplies.

96
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,207
It suggests they're preparing
to retreat, sir.

97
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,171
‐ Hear that?

98
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,131
I knew it.

99
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,008
Trains coming in every day.

100
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,885
They're reinforcing.

101
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,680
‐ Again, sir, I differ.
This is a retreat.

102
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,308
Our railroad men
have ears on the tracks.

103
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,726
They say it's empty trains
coming in

104
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,853
and loaded ones going out.

105
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,481
They're withdrawing.

106
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,482
Let's move on them now‐‐

107
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,901
‐ Enough, Grant.

108
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:46,489
After Shiloh, I'd have thought
you'd have learned your lesson.

109
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,665
‐ Grant is like, "Speed,
tempo‐‐these are weapons

110
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,292
that can be used for an
adversary that's on the run."

111
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,505
<i>Grant recognizes
there's an opportunity,</i>

112
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,257
<i>but he also knows
the windows of opportunity</i>

113
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,842
<i>are very small,</i>

114
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,051
and if you don't
take advantage of them,

115
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,220
they'll pass you by.

116
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,515
<i>And Grant sees this
as a missed opportunity.</i>

117
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,310
‐ General.

118
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,155
‐ Rebs are gone.

119
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,366
Nothing but a bunch
of scarecrows.

120
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,328
‐ Send a telegraph
to the president.

121
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,664
Corinth is ours.

122
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,750
It's a great Union victory.

123
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:44,589
<i>‐ The possession of Corinth
was of strategic importance,</i>

124
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,967
<i>but the victory was barren
in every other particular.</i>

125
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,596
<i>Corinth had already
been evacuated.</i>

126
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,599
<i>A well‐directed attack
would at least have partially</i>

127
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,350
<i>destroyed the defending army.</i>

128
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,064
<i>‐ Corinth has fallen.
Grant is like,</i>

129
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,941
"Great, this is an opportunity
to strike out.

130
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,776
We should go to Atlanta.
We should go to Vicksburg."

131
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,820
And what happens?
Halleck sits tight.

132
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,405
He disperses the army,

133
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,574
and things slow down
in the western theater.

134
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,287
<i>‐ Keep in mind that
in the early years of the war,</i>

135
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,957
<i>there are really
two distinct theaters.</i>

136
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,960
<i>The west is where Grant is.</i>

137
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,212
<i>And there's the eastern theater,</i>

138
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,174
<i>and this is the fights
of the Union army</i>

139
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:32,094
against essentially the Army
of Northern Virginia of Lee.

140
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,266
<i>‐ So while Grant
has been demoted out west,</i>

141
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,018
<i>in the east,
Robert E. Lee</i>

142
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,812
<i>has taken over
the Army of Northern Virginia.</i>

143
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,689
And the average result
in the eastern theater

144
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,359
is that the Union army loses

145
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,487
<i>to an undermanned
Confederate army.</i>

146
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,200
<i>‐</i> In the east, Lincoln's
experience with his generals

147
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:59,163
had been bad, trending to worse.

148
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,999
<i>‐ Abraham Lincoln had seen
Robert E. Lee defeat</i>

149
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,669
an entire bench
of Union commanders.

150
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,465
<i>‐ By this time, Grant
is in a bad situation too.</i>

151
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,094
<i>That second year of the war
is just not very good for him.</i>

152
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,804
In fact, he calls it, of course,

153
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,305
the darkest days of the war.

154
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:23,771
<i>‐ Dear Julia,
I am no longer boss.</i>

155
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,816
<i>What the next move is
or the part I am to take,</i>

156
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,651
<i>I do not know.</i>

157
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,615
‐ What's going on?

158
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,117
‐ I've had enough.

159
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,577
I'm resigning.

160
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,287
‐ Oh, for God's sake.

161
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,331
‐ Look, I want to fight
and win this war,

162
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,417
but if Halleck
has me sit it out,

163
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,627
I might as well
sit it out at home.

164
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,838
‐ You're not resigning.

165
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,048
‐ If I can't fight,
well, then I'm useless.

166
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,385
‐ Sam, you're the most useful
man we have.

167
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,054
I know it. You know‐‐
By God, Lincoln?

168
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,180
He knows it.

169
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,875
‐ Look at this.

170
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,941
It says I was drunk at Shiloh.

171
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,234
‐ Oh, hell.

172
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,069
Forget the papers.

173
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,578
Listen.

174
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,706
You know the next move
is Vicksburg.

175
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,708
You can take Vicksburg.

176
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,046
Who else can do it?

177
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,048
Halleck?

178
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,053
‐ Vicksburg.

179
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,055
Lincoln was right.

180
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,683
Vicksburg is the key.

181
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:54,111
<i>‐ Controlling Vicksburg
allowed food and other goods</i>

182
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,405
<i>to move freely
across the Mississippi</i>

183
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,157
<i>and get onto railcars</i>

184
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,160
<i>and feed the Confederacy
in the east.</i>

185
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:06,207
<i>Without it, the Confederacy
can be cut in two.</i>

186
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,750
But for any army in history,

187
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,377
capturing Vicksburg
would be a daunting task.

188
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,925
<i>‐ The city of Vicksburg
is on the east bank</i>

189
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,135
<i>of the Mississippi River.</i>

190
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,223
<i>And it is nestled among bluffs
that tower 300 feet</i>

191
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:26,227
<i>above a horseshoe‐shaped bend
of the Mississippi.</i>

192
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,360
<i>The line of defense
consisted of nine major forts</i>

193
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:38,072
<i>connected by a continuous line
of trenches and rifle pits</i>

194
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,242
<i>that stretched for more
than eight miles</i>

195
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:45,246
<i>and then 172 big guns.</i>

196
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,793
<i>‐ Back east, Abraham Lincoln
was at that moment</i>

197
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,380
<i>about to rid himself
of his general and chief</i>

198
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,340
<i>George McClellan,</i>

199
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,342
and the replacement
that he pitches upon

200
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,761
is Henry Wager Halleck.

201
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,848
<i>He brings Halleck east.</i>

202
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,475
<i>‐ And so finally,
the clouds part,</i>

203
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,145
<i>and Halleck gives Grant
the authority</i>

204
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,647
<i>to command as Grant sees fit,</i>

205
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,816
and the interesting thing is,
it takes Grant

206
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,443
all of one day

207
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:20,656
to start organizing
an offensive against Vicksburg.

208
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,413
<i>‐ I would call Grant's
Vicksburg campaign</i>

209
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,914
his masterpiece.

210
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,875
It's the centerpiece of the war.

211
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:37,006
<i>But Vicksburg was incredibly
difficult to get at.</i>

212
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,261
<i>‐ When Grant starts
this campaign,</i>

213
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,181
<i>Grant is on the western side
of the river.</i>

214
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,486
Vicksburg, of course, is on
the eastern side of the river.

215
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:54,690
<i>‐ North of Vicksburg
was a great, gigantic swamp.</i>

216
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,860
<i>He needs to put his troops
on open ground,</i>

217
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:02,072
<i>but the only open ground
is below Vicksburg</i>

218
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,825
<i>on the eastern side
of the river.</i>

219
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:09,371
Well, how are you going
to get troops below Vicksburg?

220
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,083
<i>You just can't send
transports and gunboats</i>

221
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,920
<i>because they would have to run
the batteries at Vicksburg</i>

222
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,755
<i>to get past the defenses.</i>

223
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,305
<i>‐ Now, throughout the winter,
Grant will orchestrate</i>

224
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,350
a series of bayou campaigns,
as they were called.

225
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,149
<i>‐ Grant makes seven attempts
to get at Vicksburg.</i>

226
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,777
<i>All of these are efforts
to get around the city</i>

227
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,154
without having to run
those batteries,

228
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,490
which is their great fear.

229
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:49,578
<i>‐ Among the operations
is excavation of a canal.</i>

230
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,831
<i>It enthralls Abraham Lincoln,
who almost on a daily basis</i>

231
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,917
<i>would send Grant
a telegraph asking,</i>

232
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,295
<i>"How's work on the canal
coming along?"</i>

233
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,257
And Grant would send back
these very rosy reports.

234
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,009
<i>But Sherman was
far more candid when he said,</i>

235
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,095
<i>"The canal
don't amount to much."</i>

236
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,472
<i>And by late March,
even Grant would realize</i>

237
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,016
<i>that this canal was a bust.</i>

238
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,104
<i>And at this point in time,</i>

239
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,731
<i>it's the rainy season
in Mississippi.</i>

240
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,903
<i>‐ The whole country
was covered with water.</i>

241
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,364
<i>Troops could scarcely
find dry ground</i>

242
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,992
<i>on which to pitch their tents.</i>

243
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,786
<i>Malarial fevers
broke out among the men.</i>

244
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,916
<i>‐ Vicksburg shows a number
of qualities of Grant.</i>

245
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,669
<i>There's again a degree
of determination.</i>

246
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:42,464
<i>He tries every which way
to come at Vicksburg,</i>

247
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,759
but on any battlefield
or in any campaign,

248
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,845
results do matter.

249
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,723
<i>‐ Now, at this point in time,</i>

250
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,474
<i>Lincoln changed his generals</i>

251
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,518
almost as frequently
as he changed his shirts.

252
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,022
<i>So Grant realized that
his time and his options</i>

253
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,232
<i>were running out.</i>

254
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,670
‐ General.

255
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,018
‐ Have you heard?

256
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,563
I'm stuck in the mud
in northern Mississippi.

257
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,694
Vicksburg.

258
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,241
We need to get out of this mud
and into the water.

259
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,993
‐ What do you mean?

260
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,204
‐ Use the river to advance.

261
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,123
Move our men south.

262
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,250
Ferry them across here.

263
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:04,671
‐ But we'll need to get ships
south to transport our men.

264
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,715
‐ If we move those ships
past the Vicksburg guns,

265
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,177
they'll blow us
out of the water.

266
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,386
‐ It's too risky.

267
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,766
‐ There's no other way.

268
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,726
It's time to take a risk.

269
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,731
Gentlemen...

270
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,238
I'm gonna run their guns.

271
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,620
<i>‐ This is thought
to be suicidal.</i>

272
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,081
Everybody believes
this is a losing proposition.

273
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,254
<i>‐ The gunboats
of the Mississippi squadron,</i>

274
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,297
although they are ironclad,

275
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,258
<i>the roofs of these gunboats</i>

276
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,261
<i>are vulnerable
to a plunging fire.</i>

277
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,640
<i>‐ Sherman cautions him
against it.</i>

278
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,143
<i>Sherman says,
"I want this on paper</i>

279
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,019
<i>that I'm against this."</i>

280
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,105
And Grant can live with that.

281
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,694
<i>‐ Grant had something to prove
during the Civil War.</i>

282
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:12,447
He must have known that
this was his chance to show

283
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,074
what he had inside him.

284
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,665
<i>‐ The plan is, while the boats
will run the batteries,</i>

285
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,836
<i>Grant will march his men down
the western side of the river.</i>

286
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:31,008
<i>Ironclads provide protection
for his transports.</i>

287
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,593
<i>The transports are there
because they are</i>

288
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,178
<i>gonna move his troops
from one side</i>

289
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,054
<i>of the river to the other</i>

290
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,681
<i>and then run a land campaign</i>

291
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,683
<i>to come in
from the eastern side.</i>

292
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,981
<i>‐ In preparation,
all the gunboats</i>

293
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,733
<i>are painted black.</i>

294
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,986
<i>Bales of cotton,
bales of hay are stacked</i>

295
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,697
<i>around the engines
to muffle the sounds,</i>

296
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,282
as well as out on the gun decks,

297
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,118
to absorb incoming rounds
of Confederate ammunition.

298
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,081
<i>Around 11:00 at night,</i>

299
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,125
<i>the gunboats
and transport vessels,</i>

300
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,669
<i>in single‐file line,
will slowly drift</i>

301
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,671
<i>with the current.</i>

302
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,346
<i>‐</i> Sir, they've set fire
to the opposite shore

303
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,410
so they can see us coming.

304
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,368
‐ There they go.

305
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,829
<i>‐ The enemy were evidently
expecting our fleet.</i>

306
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,544
<i>The sight was magnificent...</i>

307
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,504
<i>but terrible.</i>

308
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,884
<i>‐ Now, on the night
of April the 16th,</i>

309
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,720
<i>Admiral David Porter
pays very close attention</i>

310
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,933
<i>as to where the shot and shell
are hitting his vessels.</i>

311
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,185
<i>They are hitting
his smokestacks,</i>

312
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,564
but almost none are getting any
lower to where the vital parts

313
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,023
of your boats are situated.

314
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,237
<i>And he realizes
the Confederates can't fire</i>

315
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:20,325
<i>against the near bank
of the Mississippi.</i>

316
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:25,289
<i>And so Porter orders all his
gunboats to hug the shoreline.</i>

317
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:28,000
<i>So close did they come
that almost all</i>

318
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:32,045
<i>the Confederate shots are now
flying harmlessly overhead.</i>

319
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,554
<i>‐</i> They're getting through,
Rawlins.

320
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,599
They're getting through.

321
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,350
We're gonna take Vicksburg
in a few days.

322
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,603
By God, at last.

323
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,606
‐ We'll end this war now.

324
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,275
‐ I think so too, John.

325
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,527
Let's see where we stand
when the sun comes up.

326
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,946
Get a message to Admiral Porter,

327
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,783
see what condition the boats
and the men are in.

328
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,328
‐ Sir.

329
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,083
<i>‐ Due to the success
of the passage</i>

330
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,753
<i>on the night of April the 16th,</i>

331
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,797
Grant would transport
24,000 soldiers

332
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,800
across the mighty river.

333
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,636
<i>‐ I think what we see
in Vicksburg</i>

334
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,680
is the maturity of Grant

335
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,475
and the decisions that he makes.

336
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:30,562
<i>It's an extraordinary campaign
at the operational level.</i>

337
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,106
<i>How do armies move
from point to point?</i>

338
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,484
<i>How do they sustain themselves?</i>

339
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,779
<i>And that's all separate
from battle itself.</i>

340
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,406
<i>‐ Grant's decision
to run those batteries,</i>

341
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,617
<i>the determination, the grit,</i>

342
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,994
<i>this is utterly part
of his makeup.</i>

343
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,498
And the loss of ships running
Vicksburg batteries is one.

344
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,127
<i>‐ All the labors, hardships,</i>

345
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,338
<i>and exposures were
for the accomplishment</i>

346
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,675
<i>of this one object.</i>

347
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,010
<i>I was on dry ground</i>

348
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,055
<i>on the same side
of the river with the enemy.</i>

349
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,978
<i>‐ So he's now run the batteries,</i>

350
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,022
<i>he's crossed
over the Mississippi River,</i>

351
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:18,568
<i>and Grant is now
making progress in the west.</i>

352
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,864
<i>Meanwhile
in the eastern theater,</i>

353
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,659
<i>it's not going well.</i>

354
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,202
<i>‐ At one point, the Union army</i>

355
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,329
is losing something like
200 men a day

356
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,373
to desertion in early 1863.

357
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,042
So the army is literally
leaving the field.

358
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,544
<i>And then in May of 1863,</i>

359
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,504
<i>you get Lee's greatest victory
of the war</i>

360
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,965
<i>at Chancellorsville.</i>

361
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,717
<i>‐ This is Robert E. Lee's
high point.</i>

362
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,052
Outnumbered two to one,
this is the whole idea

363
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,388
of one Confederate could fight
three Union soldiers.

364
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,432
Here he proves it.

365
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,725
<i>The Union public
is starting to feel like</i>

366
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,727
<i>this is unwinnable.</i>

367
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,563
<i>And so there is
a ticking clock politically,</i>

368
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,398
<i>and everyone is watching to see</i>

369
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,191
<i>if Grant will be successful.</i>

370
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,365
<i>‐ In May of 1863,</i>

371
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:09,202
<i>Grant's on that open ground
below Vicksburg.</i>

372
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,579
<i>Now that, mind you,
is only the beginning</i>

373
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,330
<i>of his campaign, though.</i>

374
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,249
'Cause now, once on the ground,

375
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,792
that's when the campaign really

376
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,085
has to move into high gear.

377
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,757
<i>‐ Once on the Vicksburg side
of the river,</i>

378
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,425
<i>most people would have
expected Grant</i>

379
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,635
<i>to march north toward Vicksburg.</i>

380
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:29,264
<i>And yet he doesn't
do anything like that.</i>

381
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,932
First of all, you don't attack

382
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,642
where the enemy
expects you to attack,

383
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,102
from the south.

384
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,771
<i>Second of all, in command</i>

385
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,689
<i>of the roughly 30,000
troops of Vicksburg</i>

386
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,442
<i>is John C. Pemberton.</i>

387
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,612
<i>And Pemberton's fortifications
are wildly strong.</i>

388
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,035
<i>‐ Rather than take
the direct road to Vicksburg,</i>

389
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,789
<i>Grant opts to move
in a northeasterly direction,</i>

390
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:57,250
<i>cut Pemberton's line
of supply and communication,</i>

391
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,086
<i>isolate his opponent
in Vicksburg,</i>

392
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,756
and then move in for the kill.

393
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,010
<i>Over the next 17 days,
Grant's army will push deep</i>

394
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:11,473
<i>into the interior
of the state of Mississippi.</i>

395
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,975
<i>‐ However, in the state
capital of Jackson,</i>

396
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,103
<i>another Confederate force
was beginning to organize</i>

397
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,815
<i>under the command
of Joseph Johnston.</i>

398
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,819
So Grant was really facing two
separate Confederate armies

399
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,570
deep in enemy territory

400
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,282
with a extraordinarily
limited supply line.

401
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,330
<i>‐ There is actually
great risk for that moment.</i>

402
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,290
He turns his back
on Pemberton's army,

403
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,167
nearly the same size of his own.

404
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,505
<i>A commander always
needs to know himself,</i>

405
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,341
<i>know the environment,
know the enemy.</i>

406
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,343
<i>He knows John Pemberton.</i>

407
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,303
<i>He knows he's not aggressive,</i>

408
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,721
<i>and he thinks,</i>

409
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,348
<i>"If I strike quickly,
I can defeat them</i>

410
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,141
<i>"in piecemeal before they join,</i>

411
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,393
<i>"and therefore,
it's an advantage</i>

412
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,436
<i>to have
this central position."</i>

413
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,855
And that's exactly what he does.

414
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:03,024
He accepts risk by leaving
Pemberton in his rear,

415
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,235
and he's gonna go ahead
and turn and attack Jackson.

416
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,533
<i>‐ And on May the 14th,</i>

417
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,743
<i>Grant's armies
will drive Confederate forces</i>

418
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,370
<i>out of Jackson</i>

419
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,416
<i>and destroy Pemberton's line
of supply and communication.</i>

420
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,338
<i>With Johnston's forces
scattered to the winds,</i>

421
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,591
<i>Grant will turn west
toward Vicksburg.</i>

422
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,886
<i>‐ Pemberton all of a sudden</i>

423
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,721
realizes Grant has turned west.

424
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,723
<i>And this is when
Pemberton decides,</i>

425
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,893
<i>"I gotta stop
and give battle."</i>

426
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,186
<i>The numbers are largely equal,</i>

427
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,273
<i>somewhere less than
30,000 on each side.</i>

428
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,279
<i>‐</i> If Ulysses S. Grant
loses a stand‐up fight,

429
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,532
<i>his army is in trouble.</i>

430
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,328
<i>They have cast off
most of their logistics.</i>

431
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,872
They are
in Confederate territory.

432
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:03,543
<i>But if there is a way he can
beat the Confederate army</i>

433
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,546
<i>without having
to storm Vicksburg,</i>

434
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,758
<i>he is more than willing
to do it.</i>

435
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,013
<i>‐ Champion Hill,
where Pemberton had chosen</i>

436
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,556
<i>to receive us,</i>

437
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,434
<i>was well selected.</i>

438
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,603
<i>It is one of the highest points</i>

439
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:25,023
<i>and commanded all the ground.</i>

440
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:38,620
Tell General McClernand to have
his men advance quickly.

441
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,413
Osterhaus and Carr
to push the center.

442
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,249
Blair and Smith should advance
quickly on the left.

443
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,133
<i>‐ Grant could feel
a battlefield.</i>

444
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,303
<i>He could see it in his mind,</i>

445
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,930
not just in space,
because keep in mind

446
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:59,599
it's not just
who's on the left, the right,

447
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:03,061
the center, but in time...

448
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:06,940
<i>because it's sequencing
the different activities.</i>

449
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,609
<i>And that is really
just short of genius.</i>

450
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,158
<i>‐</i> I see a break
in Pemberton's line.

451
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,618
Tell McPherson
to flank to the left

452
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,121
and press them hard.

453
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,699
‐ The rebs are running, sir.

454
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,368
‐ Hell, they're running
all the way to Vicksburg.

455
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,621
‐ Send General Osterhaus
to follow them.

456
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,373
I want to thin them out
before we face them again

457
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,375
at Vicksburg.

458
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,176
<i>‐ An army on the move
is an army to be destroyed.</i>

459
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,677
<i>And therefore,
he's gonna continue</i>

460
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,888
<i>to push Pemberton's army.</i>

461
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,639
<i>And this is gonna drive
the Confederates back</i>

462
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,392
into the defenses of Vicksburg.

463
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,148
<i>‐ Grant took enormous risk
when he went east</i>

464
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,401
<i>rather than immediately
to Vicksburg.</i>

465
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,697
But he very deftly
defeats piecemeal

466
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,908
the different Confederate forces

467
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:43,203
that are trying to come
to reinforce Vicksburg,

468
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,539
<i>and essentially, it's a siege
from there on out.</i>

469
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,419
<i>‐ As long as we could hold
our position,</i>

470
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,255
<i>the enemy was limited
in supplies of food,</i>

471
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,966
<i>men, and ammunition.</i>

472
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,197
<i>‐</i> Keep these men digging,
Captain.

473
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,616
Let's be done with this
by nightfall.

474
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,452
‐ Yes, sir.

475
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,995
<i>‐ Ulysses S. Grant has now</i>

476
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,247
gone down the Mississippi River.

477
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:30,834
He's in the midst
of the Vicksburg Campaign.

478
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,378
<i>In 17 days, Grant's army marched</i>

479
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,589
<i>200 miles and won five battles.</i>

480
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,592
<i>And now we are talking
about a siege.</i>

481
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,014
<i>‐ When Grant first settles
into siege operations,</i>

482
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,725
<i>he digs a line opposite
the Confederate ones,</i>

483
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:52,605
<i>so you can cut off the key
routes of supply to the city.</i>

484
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,065
And then in case
a Confederate force

485
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,359
came from his rear,
he then dug another

486
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,778
series of entrenchments
facing the other way.

487
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,658
<i>And now he's gonna ring
Vicksburg with artillery.</i>

488
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,493
<i>In fact, he's even gonna bring</i>

489
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,453
<i>naval artillery off naval ships</i>

490
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,038
<i>to bombard Vicksburg.</i>

491
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,457
<i>We want to put them
under the maximum pressure</i>

492
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,209
<i>so that they recognize
this sacrifice</i>

493
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,879
<i>is no longer worth it.</i>

494
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,673
‐ And Grant ordered
his soldiers to begin sinking

495
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,926
approaches toward
the Confederate works.

496
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,928
<i>And so you have Union engineers,</i>

497
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,430
<i>and they'd be working
behind the protection</i>

498
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:28,099
<i>of what was called a sap roller,</i>

499
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,768
<i>normally a bundle
of cane and vine</i>

500
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,562
<i>packed with dirt or cotton,</i>

501
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,397
<i>anything that'll stop a bullet.</i>

502
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,774
<i>And the whole object
is to get all the way</i>

503
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,068
<i>up to the Confederate line.</i>

504
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,746
‐ Sharpshooters!
Get down!

505
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,914
Sharpshooters!

506
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,332
‐ Sharpshooters!

507
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,417
‐ Get down!
Get down!

508
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,877
‐ See them?

509
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,879
Where are they?

510
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,632
‐ Get down!
Everybody get down!

511
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:01,841
‐ We gotta move!

512
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,571
‐ Cease fire!

513
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,615
Hold your fire!

514
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:26,741
‐ Hold fire!

515
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,825
‐ They're gone!

516
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,702
‐ Hold fire!

517
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,877
‐ I'll take that.

518
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,340
All right, everyone!

519
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,342
All right, get back to work!

520
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,593
Now!

521
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,595
Get back to work!

522
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,892
<i>‐ When it has been made clear
that the Negro,</i>

523
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,727
<i>as an independent laborer,</i>

524
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,146
<i>can do these things well,</i>

525
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,233
<i>it would be very easy
to put a musket in his hands</i>

526
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,068
<i>and make a soldier of him.</i>

527
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,950
<i>‐ Throughout the Civil War,
African‐Americans</i>

528
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:12,620
<i>start to flee
to Union army encampments</i>

529
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:16,833
in hopes of finding
some mechanism for freedom.

530
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,087
<i>Essentially, what these
African‐Americans do</i>

531
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,631
<i>is, they appeal
to the Union army and say,</i>

532
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,801
<i>"Make use of me
in this conflict."</i>

533
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:31,264
<i>‐</i> If the logic of war
is any resources,

534
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:35,184
whether it be guns, you know,
cannon, fortifications,

535
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,479
if the enemy is using something
to support their war effort,

536
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,357
it can be legitimately
taken away.

537
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,860
<i>So by the end of the first
year of the war,</i>

538
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,653
<i>Lincoln has come
to the conclusion</i>

539
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:49,323
<i>that emancipation
is a necessary war angle.</i>

540
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,745
<i>‐ In Grant's own personal life,</i>

541
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,080
the fact that he married
into a family

542
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,834
that was dependent
on the system of slavery...

543
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:04,338
<i>his decision to grant
freedom to a slave...</i>

544
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:08,217
<i>the fact that during
his time in Missouri,</i>

545
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,220
<i>he's tilling the soil
with enslaved people,</i>

546
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,556
<i>I think illustrates how</i>

547
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,683
<i>Grant's life is actually
an object lesson</i>

548
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,103
<i>in the ways that a person
has to grapple</i>

549
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,398
<i>with their position on equality.</i>

550
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:30,031
<i>‐ And then Lincoln issues
the Emancipation Proclamation.</i>

551
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:34,577
This goes into effect
as both civil and military law

552
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:38,706
on the 1st of January, 1863.

553
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,709
<i>‐ When Lincoln put out
the Emancipation Proclamation,</i>

554
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,879
it was an amazing thing.

555
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,216
One out of every four
enslaved African‐Americans

556
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,218
<i>made their way to freedom.</i>

557
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,097
<i>‐ The most important part</i>

558
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,348
<i>of the Emancipation Proclamation</i>

559
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,850
is, that's the moment
where Lincoln first,

560
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,895
you know, calls up black people
to fight in the armies

561
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,896
of the country.

562
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,898
That is significant.

563
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,525
<i>That is actually a huge,
huge deal</i>

564
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,903
<i>and has, you know, great
implications on the North</i>

565
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,781
<i>actually winning the war.</i>

566
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,410
<i>‐ And so beginning in 1863,</i>

567
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,413
<i>you have your first appearance</i>

568
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,875
<i>of black soldiers
in blue uniforms.</i>

569
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,669
<i>Their first engagement, in fact,</i>

570
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:27,296
occurs during
the Vicksburg campaign.

571
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,844
<i>‐ During the course
of the siege of Vicksburg,</i>

572
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,012
<i>Grant had established
supply enclaves</i>

573
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,640
<i>at places such
as Milliken's Bend.</i>

574
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,976
<i>And most of these
supply enclaves</i>

575
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,271
were defended by recently
recruited black troops

576
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,605
in Union blue.

577
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,818
<i>But at the same time,
Confederates west of Vicksburg</i>

578
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,736
<i>were ordered to do</i>

579
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,699
<i>"something on behalf
of the garrison of Vicksburg."</i>

580
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,618
<i>And so on June the 7th,
a Confederate brigade</i>

581
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:02,123
<i>would attack the supply
enclave at Milliken's Bend.</i>

582
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,834
‐ And it is at this moment
that two things

583
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,210
become very clear:

584
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,962
<i>that they have not been given</i>

585
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,589
<i>the best training,</i>

586
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,382
<i>nor have they been given
the best weaponry</i>

587
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,886
<i>to protect themselves.</i>

588
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,304
<i>‐</i> The thing to recognize
about the colored troops

589
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,515
is, expectations were so low.

590
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,976
<i>I mean, the idea
that black people</i>

591
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,061
<i>would fight as soldiers...</i>

592
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,982
<i>I mean, this was like
a man going to the moon.</i>

593
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,988
<i>‐ This was the first important
engagement of the war</i>

594
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:19,492
<i>in which colored troops
were under fire.</i>

595
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,535
<i>These men were very raw,</i>

596
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,206
<i>having all been enlisted since
the beginning of the siege,</i>

597
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,084
<i>but they were most gallant,
and I doubt not</i>

598
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:30,878
<i>they will make good troops.</i>

599
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,089
<i>‐</i> There were 1,500
Confederates pitted against

600
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:36,550
a little more than
1,000 Union troops.

601
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,052
<i>The Confederates
would drive them back</i>

602
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,553
<i>from their fortifications,</i>

603
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,222
<i>through their encampment,</i>

604
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:45,101
<i>and all the way
to the Mississippi River.</i>

605
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:48,729
Black soldiers would lose
70% of their numbers,

606
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,941
but they would successfully
hold on to the supply enclave

607
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,234
at Milliken's Bend.

608
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,948
<i>‐ Lincoln says he can
no longer consider an idea</i>

609
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,742
of going back to things
being the way they were

610
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,453
after black people have
actually died for the country.

611
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,455
You can't restore those people
to slavery again.

612
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,044
<i>‐ And in fact,
by the end of the Civil War,</i>

613
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,006
almost 200,000
African‐Americans,

614
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,259
you know,
fight on the Union side.

615
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,886
<i>‐ To His Excellency
A. Lincoln:</i>

616
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,641
<i>Sir, by arming the Negro,
we have added a powerful ally.</i>

617
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,477
<i>This, with the emancipation
of the Negro,</i>

618
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:32,005
<i>is the heaviest blow
yet given the Confederacy.</i>

619
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,502
<i>‐ The primary strategy
of any siege</i>

620
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:58,257
<i>is isolating the people
you are besieging inside,</i>

621
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,636
causing them to use up
both their military resources

622
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,305
but especially their food

623
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,975
<i>to force them to capitulate.</i>

624
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,853
<i>So the consequence of this
is, Grant's army will grow</i>

625
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:15,316
<i>to over 70,000 troops
over time...</i>

626
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,902
and it's a ratcheting up
of military pressure.

627
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,366
<i>‐ Now, the Confederate
government in Richmond</i>

628
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:27,870
<i>is rather concerned about
the situation at Vicksburg.</i>

629
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,998
<i>And there has emerged
a group that believes</i>

630
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,167
that less focus needs
to be placed on the east,

631
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,794
where things are going well,

632
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,879
and more focus needs
to be put on the west,

633
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,422
where things are not going well.

634
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,343
<i>Robert E. Lee's response is,</i>

635
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,345
<i>"Even if I send troops
to Vicksburg,</i>

636
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,681
<i>"by the time they got there,</i>

637
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,349
<i>it might be over."</i>

638
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,227
<i>And Lee decides to go north</i>

639
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,354
<i>and try to seek
a decisive engagement</i>

640
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:57,400
<i>with the federals
north of Pennsylvania.</i>

641
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,530
<i>At the same time,
Grant keeps the pressure up</i>

642
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,366
<i>at Vicksburg to end the siege.</i>

643
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,703
<i>‐ By the end of June,</i>

644
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,454
<i>the Confederate Army
of Vicksburg</i>

645
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,249
was subsisting
on a handful of peas and rice

646
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:16,043
issued once a day per man.

647
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,586
<i>Even their water
would be rationed</i>

648
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,548
<i>to one cup per man per day.</i>

649
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,260
‐ So now as the temperature
of the summer

650
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,220
continues to get
hotter and hotter,

651
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,680
<i>Grant will dam up</i>

652
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,473
<i>all the creeks
that are going in there.</i>

653
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,936
<i>Confederates are being shelled
by Union gunboats</i>

654
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,647
<i>as well as Union batteries.</i>

655
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,570
<i>‐ But also,
throughout the siege,</i>

656
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:46,574
<i>you have a civilian population
trapped in the city,</i>

657
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,785
<i>estimated at about 2,000.</i>

658
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,329
<i>And the citizens
lived underground</i>

659
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:56,125
<i>in man‐made caves to escape
the constant bombardment</i>

660
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:59,253
<i>of Union cannon
and heavy mortar.</i>

661
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,842
<i>And about the only time
they came out of these caves</i>

662
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,761
<i>is when the Union artillerymen</i>

663
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,930
<i>ate their morning, noon,
and evening meals.</i>

664
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,601
‐ Grant knows full well

665
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,605
the suffering of the civilians
in Vicksburg.

666
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,774
<i>He doesn't relish any of it,</i>

667
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,860
<i>but I think he does believe</i>

668
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:26,447
<i>without breaking the will
of the Southern people</i>

669
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,950
<i>that this war is not
gonna come to an end.</i>

670
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,160
<i>‐</i> These civilians at Vicksburg,

671
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,787
who weeks earlier
were able to get

672
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,956
all the food they needed,
were clearly starving.

673
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,626
<i>And they started eating
anything that moved,</i>

674
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,461
<i>rats included.</i>

675
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,671
<i>And by early July, it was clear</i>

676
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,716
<i>that the Confederates were
near the end of their rope.</i>

677
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,516
<i>‐ On July 3rd,
two persons were seen</i>

678
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,353
<i>coming towards our lines
bearing a white flag.</i>

679
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,397
<i>It was a glorious sight
to soldiers on the line.</i>

680
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,695
<i>‐ On the hot afternoon
of July 3rd,</i>

681
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,823
at the very same time
Pickett's legions

682
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:12,993
were storming over
the stone wall at Gettysburg,

683
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,496
<i>the Confederate commander
John Pemberton</i>

684
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,414
<i>would ask Grant on what terms</i>

685
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,417
<i>he would receive
the surrender of the city.</i>

686
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,341
‐ General Pemberton.

687
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,559
‐ Your terms, General?

688
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,601
Surprise me.

689
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:43,357
I propose‐‐ ‐ No proposals.

690
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,359
Terms won't change.

691
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,778
Unconditional surrender.

692
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,536
‐ Sir.

693
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,414
Listen, we need to offer terms.

694
00:39:58,438 --> 00:39:59,540
‐ No.

695
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:00,749
‐ Be practical.

696
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,544
What are we gonna do
with 30,000 prisoners?

697
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,546
Better offer terms,
don't you think?

698
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,133
General.

699
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,930
‐ I'm prepared
to accept the parole

700
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,265
but only if my men walk away

701
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,559
with all of their
personal property.

702
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,231
‐ By personal property,
do you mean to include slaves?

703
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,571
Sidearms, horses...

704
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,240
no slaves.

705
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,909
No slaves leave with you.

706
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,790
You have until 10:00 tonight.

707
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,751
Then we attack the city.

708
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,872
<i>‐ Up to this point,
Grant's reputation</i>

709
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,500
<i>is "Unconditional
Surrender" Grant.</i>

710
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,586
<i>And yet here, he paroles
the men that are there,</i>

711
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,173
<i>and it shows what
flexibility of mind he had.</i>

712
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,883
<i>I think he makes the calculus</i>

713
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,969
of, "What if we send
these 30,000 scarecrows

714
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,929
"back to their towns?

715
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,681
"What are they gonna tell them?

716
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,974
We just got whipped."

717
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,729
‐ See the corporal.
He'll sign your parole card.

718
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,758
‐ General Grant.

719
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,593
‐ Retain your sidearms, General.

720
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,859
<i>The enemy had been suffering,</i>

721
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,737
<i>particularly towards the last.</i>

722
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:38,574
<i>I saw our men taking bread
from their haversacks</i>

723
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,702
<i>and giving it to the enemy
they had so recently</i>

724
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,705
<i>been engaged in starving out.</i>

725
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:53,380
<i>‐ Grant doesn't have
a hatred of Southern people.</i>

726
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:57,384
He sees them as Americans
that have gone astray.

727
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,969
<i>He doesn't agree
with their cause,</i>

728
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,472
<i>but he cares
for the people themselves.</i>

729
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:05,726
<i>That really colors the way
he deals with the Confederates</i>

730
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,896
<i>throughout the Civil War.</i>

731
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,066
<i>‐ Vicksburg surrenders,
and the Mississippi is open.</i>

732
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,567
And as Lincoln says,

733
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:19,740
"The father of waters flows
again, unvexed, to the sea."

734
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,952
<i>And the great thing is
that the news comes to him</i>

735
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,581
<i>the same weekend as the news
of the victory at Gettysburg.</i>

736
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:33,170
<i>‐ My dear General,
when you first reached</i>

737
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:36,924
<i>the vicinity of Vicksburg,
I never had any faith,</i>

738
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:42,012
<i>except a general hope that
the expedition could succeed.</i>

739
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,807
<i>I now wish to make
the personal acknowledgment</i>

740
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,684
<i>that you were right
and I was wrong.</i>

741
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:51,105
<i>Yours very truly,
A. Lincoln.</i>

742
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:57,611
<i>‐ Grant and Lincoln
first meet as correspondents.</i>

743
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,155
<i>And their correspondence
is quite wonderful.</i>

744
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,783
<i>They are both men of the west,</i>

745
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:06,286
<i>and I think they share
a certain philosophy</i>

746
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,123
<i>and perhaps a certain attitude.</i>

747
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,958
<i>And I think it really
set the terms</i>

748
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,960
<i>for their future relationship.</i>

749
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:19,466
This victory was a culmination
of a very long campaign

750
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,051
full of trial and error,

751
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:25,013
full of Grant figuring out,
"How do I capture

752
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,474
<i>what seemed
an impregnable fort?"</i>

753
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,817
<i>‐ The Vicksburg campaign
has been studied</i>

754
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:41,321
<i>by military professionals
ever since July of 1863.</i>

755
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,160
<i>In fact, in the army's
war‐fighting manual,</i>

756
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,162
<i>it highlights
the Vicksburg campaign</i>

757
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,705
<i>as the most brilliant campaign</i>

758
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:53,876
<i>ever waged on American soil.</i>

759
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,711
<i>And so whereas
the Civil War is often</i>

760
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,963
referred to as the last
of the old wars,

761
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,673
first of the modern wars,

762
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:04,928
Grant can be termed the first
modern American warrior.

763
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,684
<i>‐ With the success at Vicksburg,</i>

764
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,186
there's no question that Grant

765
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,688
is one of the top
generals in the war.

766
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,942
<i>Lincoln said, "He'll be my man</i>

767
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,945
<i>and I'll be his
the rest of the war."</i>

768
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:26,116
<i>And so Grant is given command
of the entire western theater.</i>

769
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:31,205
<i>Well, part of that
new command was Chattanooga.</i>

770
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:33,916
<i>And in Chattanooga,
there was a Union army</i>

771
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,044
<i>that was essentially trapped.</i>

772
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:40,214
<i>‐ It's at this point
that Lincoln decides</i>

773
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,216
that he must call Grant in
for the situation.

774
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,721
<i>‐ The art of war
is simple enough.</i>

775
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,098
<i>Find out where your enemy is,</i>

776
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,893
<i>get at him as soon as you can,</i>

777
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,062
<i>strike him as hard as you can,</i>

778
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,397
<i>and keep moving on.</i>

779
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,748
<i>‐ By the summer of 1863,</i>

780
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,584
<i>the Union army had moved
all the way through Tennessee</i>

781
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:21,004
<i>and captured Chattanooga.</i>

782
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:24,508
<i>The Union army
then moved into Georgia,</i>

783
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:29,596
<i>but the Confederates lashed
back and won a huge victory.</i>

784
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,975
<i>The Union army retreated
back into Chattanooga.</i>

785
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:35,435
<i>The Confederates followed,
occupying the heights</i>

786
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,604
<i>around the city.</i>

787
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,398
And U. S. Grant is brought
into Chattanooga

788
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:41,483
to do what he does best...

789
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,443
<i>win.</i>

790
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:49,408
‐ He's essentially being
brought in as a kind of fixer.

791
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:53,287
<i>Here's the guy who won
the campaign at Vicksburg,</i>

792
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,707
and he's being asked
to do it again.

793
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:59,167
<i>The Union Army
of the Cumberland is stuck</i>

794
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,003
<i>down in this valley,</i>

795
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:05,299
<i>trapped in a siege,
and starving.</i>

796
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,050
<i>The Confederate army has set up</i>

797
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,720
<i>a ring around the city</i>

798
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:12,889
<i>that gives them a commanding
artillery position.</i>

799
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,647
<i>It's incredibly high stakes.</i>

800
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,358
<i>By holding Chattanooga,
you hold one of the most</i>

801
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:27,654
<i>important rail networks
in Tennessee.</i>

802
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,240
<i>Grant knew if you can
hold that rail hub,</i>

803
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,576
<i>you can build up
a massive effort</i>

804
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,996
<i>to invade the Deep South.</i>

805
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,414
The loss of Chattanooga
would've set

806
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,333
the Union war effort
back months,

807
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,667
if not years.

808
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,672
<i>‐ His first concern
is to feed his troops</i>

809
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,799
<i>by winning a small engagement
on the Confederate side</i>

810
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,259
<i>of the Tennessee River</i>

811
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:53,388
<i>to open up his new supply line.</i>

812
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,140
Then, like any boss
that comes into a new company,

813
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:57,517
Grant wants his people.

814
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,020
<i>And he immediately calls
the four divisions</i>

815
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:04,191
<i>of William Tecumseh Sherman
to come to Chattanooga.</i>

816
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,485
‐ The intention then
is to seize the initiative

817
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,236
and make an attack
against the Confederates

818
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,197
and drive them
away from Chattanooga.

819
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,037
<i>‐ During the battle
of Chattanooga,</i>

820
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:20,499
Grant is commanding
multiple armies.

821
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:23,085
<i>He's got Sherman with
the Army of the Tennessee.</i>

822
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:26,046
<i>He has George Thomas with
the Army of the Cumberland.</i>

823
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,631
<i>He also has Joseph Hooker,</i>

824
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,258
<i>who's coming in
from the eastern theater.</i>

825
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,803
<i>‐ The idea was that
Hooker would flank</i>

826
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,097
<i>the Confederate position
from the south,</i>

827
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,099
<i>Sherman would bring his army</i>

828
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:38,892
<i>to the northern flank,</i>

829
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,686
<i>and George Thomas
would assault the center.</i>

830
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,565
<i>Three separate assaults
of one position.</i>

831
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:11,574
‐ Sir.

832
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,346
From General Sherman
on Missionary Ridge.

833
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,769
<i>‐ At Chattanooga,
his battle plan doesn't work</i>

834
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,604
<i>the way he expected it to,</i>

835
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,274
<i>but he's got
the presence of mind</i>

836
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,485
to process it and make decisions

837
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:34,448
and adapt to things that
he didn't expect to happen.

838
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,785
<i>‐ Sherman's stuck.</i>

839
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,621
Send in Thomas' men.

840
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:45,333
Order them to attack the rifle
pits below Missionary Ridge.

841
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:48,295
<i>Sherman needs our help‐‐ now.</i>

842
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:54,801
<i>‐ George Thomas' army
had been much maligned</i>

843
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,138
<i>for having been trapped
in a siege,</i>

844
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,807
and I think those men
were spoiling for a fight

845
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,976
as a result.

846
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,152
<i>‐ Grant gives the order
with the hope that that will</i>

847
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,988
<i>force the Confederates
to start moving troops</i>

848
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,990
<i>away from Sherman's path.</i>

849
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:23,330
<i>The order was that once
they seized the rifle pits,</i>

850
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,665
<i>they should stop, reorganize,</i>

851
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:30,212
<i>and then attack the top
of Missionary Ridge.</i>

852
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:33,173
<i>But they don't stop.</i>

853
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:49,356
<i>‐ Without awaiting
further orders,</i>

854
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:53,026
<i>on our troops went
for the crest.</i>

855
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:59,324
<i>The fire along
the rebel line was terrific.</i>

856
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:03,703
<i>Cannon and musket balls
filled the air.</i>

857
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,873
<i>The pursuit continued
until the crest was reached.</i>

858
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:16,925
<i>‐ It was a fantastic
victory for Grant.</i>

859
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:19,469
<i>This is the battle
that really, I think, makes</i>

860
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:24,808
the Republic respect Grant
as the possible savior.

861
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:31,064
<i>‐ News of this goes through
the North as a great triumph.</i>

862
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,900
Grant is now clearly
and unambiguously

863
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,570
<i>the general who looks like</i>

864
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,905
<i>finally the man
who can win this war.</i>

865
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:44,286
<i>‐ Grant has eliminated two
Confederate armies via siege,</i>

866
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:47,539
<i>Fort Donelson and Vicksburg.</i>

867
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,624
At Chattanooga, he combined
three disparate armies

868
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,084
into a single effort,

869
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,254
so his technical competencies
were beyond reproach.

870
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:58,091
<i>‐ At Chattanooga,
he reverses another</i>

871
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,761
<i>very desperate situation
for the Union forces.</i>

872
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,598
That's what ultimately
then leads Lincoln

873
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,016
to bring Grant east.

874
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,937
<i>‐ By March of 1864,</i>

875
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,939
<i>Lincoln has found his man,</i>

876
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,275
and Congress raises Grant
to the rank

877
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,777
of full lieutenant general,

878
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,488
<i>the first general
since Washington</i>

879
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:24,117
<i>to hold the full rank
of lieutenant general.</i>

880
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:30,123
‐ He is to be in command
of all the Union armies.

881
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,667
<i>This is novel.</i>

882
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:35,503
<i>‐ The bill restoring the grade
of lieutenant general</i>

883
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:38,673
<i>of the army had passed.</i>

884
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:42,135
<i>I was ordered to Washington
to receive my commission.</i>

885
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,847
<i>‐ Grant and Lincoln never meet
each other face‐to‐face</i>

886
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,058
<i>until Grant shows up
in Washington</i>

887
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:51,478
<i>to be promoted
to lieutenant general...</i>

888
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,313
<i>but his ability
to advise Lincoln</i>

889
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,315
<i>and to guide
the whole nation's effort</i>

890
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,233
<i>to win the war...</i>

891
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,802
<i>that was a question mark.</i>

892
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:13,816
‐ Mr. President.

893
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,296
‐ General Grant.

894
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,382
Come in.

895
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:23,093
Come in.

896
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,891
I do not profess
to be a military man,

897
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:33,895
and I certainly would
never interfere, but...

898
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,548
Here it is.

899
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:45,031
I've marked
our current placements.

900
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,449
Now...

901
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,992
if we move into Virginia

902
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,078
between the course
of these two rivers,

903
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:53,081
we can not only use them
to bring in supplies.

904
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:55,858
We might also protect
our flanks.

905
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,254
‐ I'll consider it, sir.

906
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:09,389
‐ Of course.

907
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,433
But tell me...

908
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:17,856
You'll go after Lee?

909
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,860
You'll go after him
until he's finished?

910
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,820
It all depends on you.

911
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:32,162
<i>‐ The president told me
that all he had ever wanted</i>

912
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,831
<i>was someone who would
take responsibility</i>

913
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,166
<i>and act.</i>

914
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,465
<i>‐ Lincoln had gone
through about every other</i>

915
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,425
<i>senior general in the Union army</i>

916
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,260
<i>at this point in time.</i>

917
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,387
<i>And finally,
Lincoln finds his general,</i>

918
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:52,182
<i>a general who will
actually fight.</i>

919
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,517
<i>And Grant is truly
one of the great</i>

920
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:58,021
<i>battle captains of all time.</i>

921
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:01,941
He is someone
who achieved brilliance,

922
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,652
tactically, operationally,
and strategically.

923
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,948
<i>At the tactical level,
this would be commanding</i>

924
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:12,494
<i>multiple brigades like
Fort Henry and Fort Donelson</i>

925
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,996
in the early stages
of the war in the west.

926
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:21,544
<i>Operationally, this is
multiple divisions now.</i>

927
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,255
<i>And, of course,
Vicksburg is an extraordinary</i>

928
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,466
<i>example of that.</i>

929
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,176
And then strategically,

930
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,761
<i>when he comes east,</i>

931
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:32,805
<i>he for the first time
then develops</i>

932
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:36,684
a true strategic campaign
for all of the Union forces.

933
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,023
<i>‐ Grant's idea when
he becomes commanding general</i>

934
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:46,486
<i>is to get all of the Union
forces to act in harmony.</i>

935
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,905
<i>He wants to move on Mobile Bay,</i>

936
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:51,324
<i>one of the last
Confederate ports.</i>

937
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,994
<i>He wants Sherman
to advance on Atlanta.</i>

938
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,123
<i>He wants Franz Sigel to go
down the Shenandoah Valley,</i>

939
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:02,418
<i>the breadbasket of
the Confederacy in the east.</i>

940
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,462
<i>Benjamin Butler will
come up the James River</i>

941
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,089
<i>and get at Richmond
from the south,</i>

942
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,341
<i>hopefully dividing
some of Lee's attention.</i>

943
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,968
<i>And then finally,
the Army of the Potomac</i>

944
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:12,971
<i>will head at Robert E. Lee
in Richmond.</i>

945
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,557
It's those five pieces
acting in concert

946
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,517
that is his original vision
for how this war

947
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,227
should come to a close.

948
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:23,565
<i>‐ The South had become
very good,</i>

949
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,650
with the smaller population,

950
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:28,069
at moving troops
from one place to another.

951
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,322
<i>What Grant realized was that</i>

952
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:34,867
if you simultaneously attack
many Confederate positions,

953
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,911
they would not be able
to play this game.

954
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:42,333
<i>‐ Grant's strategic genius
was the ability to move</i>

955
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:46,004
five different armies
simultaneously...

956
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,298
<i>but also, Grant recognized,</i>

957
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:51,050
<i>the destruction
of Robert E. Lee's army,</i>

958
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,469
<i>the symbol
of Confederate nationalism,</i>

959
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:57,098
<i>was fundamental
to winning the war.</i>

960
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,395
<i>‐ Robert E. Lee's army
had countless times</i>

961
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,314
<i>defeated Union armies
on the battlefield</i>

962
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:06,774
with brilliant
tactical maneuvers,

963
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,652
<i>so there was a confidence.</i>

964
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,112
<i>There was an esprit de corps</i>

965
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,573
<i>that bound that army together,</i>

966
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:16,451
<i>and spirits are high
and ready for an engagement.</i>

967
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:21,164
<i>Robert E. Lee
is born the scion</i>

968
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:24,250
<i>to two of the oldest
elite families</i>

969
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,585
<i>of the state of Virginia.</i>

970
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,589
<i>And in many ways,
Robert E. Lee becomes</i>

971
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,049
<i>the general most connected</i>

972
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:32,842
with the institution of slavery

973
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,720
and protecting that institution.

974
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:38,848
<i>‐ Grant had none
of that mystique.</i>

975
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,643
There was no illusion of a guy,

976
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:45,146
you know, who was highborn
in the way that Lee was.

977
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,565
<i>But, you know, when I see you
on the battlefield,</i>

978
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,275
<i>none of that matters.</i>

979
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,903
<i>It's just me and you.</i>

980
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,696
<i>‐ But all of Grant's
success had been</i>

981
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,532
<i>in the western theater.</i>

982
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,661
<i>And everybody would argue...</i>

983
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:00,870
you're not out
in the western theater anymore.

984
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,456
You're fighting Robert E. Lee.

985
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,583
<i>Of course, we could flip
that coin and say</i>

986
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:09,837
<i>Robert E. Lee is now
fighting Ulysses S. Grant.</i>

987
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,845
<i>‐ Grant is gonna
personally attach himself</i>

988
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,765
<i>to George Gordon Meade's
Army the of Potomac,</i>

989
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:23,184
<i>which is gonna
latch on like a bulldog</i>

990
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:26,729
<i>to Robert E. Lee's
Army of Northern Virginia.</i>

991
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,774
<i>‐ When Grant comes
down to Brandy Station</i>

992
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:33,194
<i>to visit the headquarters
of George Gordon Meade,</i>

993
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:36,864
<i>Meade's staff are surprised.</i>

994
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:40,076
This was a slightly
ordinary figure

995
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:44,872
who looked like a merchant
who'd just come from a store.

996
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,375
<i>But then you met his eye,</i>

997
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:51,963
<i>that icy cold eye that Grant
could somehow have,</i>

998
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,464
<i>and suddenly you knew this man</i>

999
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,300
<i>was totally in charge of things.</i>

1000
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:59,220
<i>One clerk was advised,</i>

1001
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,598
"When Grant gives you
a straight order, obey it.

1002
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,350
"When you have
information for Grant,

1003
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,519
"give it to him straight.

1004
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:11,566
"And above all,
don't say 'sir' too much.

1005
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,568
<i>Grant's not interested
in that."</i>

1006
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:20,950
<i>‐ Through most of the winter
of 1863 and 1864,</i>

1007
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,827
<i>the Union army
and the Confederates</i>

1008
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,412
<i>have been glaring at each other,</i>

1009
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:27,039
<i>waiting for the spring to come</i>

1010
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,667
so that the new campaign
can begin.

1011
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,754
<i>Grant wants to get south
so he can engage</i>

1012
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:35,465
<i>Confederates
in more open ground.</i>

1013
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,925
<i>But before he does that,
he has to go across</i>

1014
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:40,720
<i>the Rapidan River
and go through an area</i>

1015
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:44,640
<i>deemed as almost Lee's hunting
ground for Union armies...</i>

1016
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,416
<i>"The Wilderness."</i>

1017
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:54,192
‐ Gentlemen?

1018
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:57,195
‐ Grant may have won
some victories in the west,

1019
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:00,239
but this is Virginia.

1020
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,074
‐ We're strong here, sir.

1021
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,826
And if he attacks,

1022
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,912
we can make a play
for Washington.

1023
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:07,872
‐ And if he crosses the Rapidan,

1024
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,666
he'd have to cut
through the Wilderness.

1025
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:14,378
I can't imagine
he'd be fool enough.

1026
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,506
We'd whip him but good.

1027
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:21,594
‐ General Longstreet?

1028
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:29,894
‐ I know Grant
from West Point and Mexico.

1029
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:33,064
Do not underestimate him.

1030
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:35,358
He will fight us every day
and every hour

1031
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,819
till the end of this war.

1032
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,781
<i>‐ There's sort of a sense
that, "Okay,</i>

1033
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:45,159
Robert E. Lee is the champion
of the eastern theater."

1034
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,038
<i>"And we've tried challenger
after challenger</i>

1035
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,998
<i>"after challenger.</i>

1036
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:54,168
<i>But now we're bringing in
our best guy from the west."</i>

1037
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,297
<i>There's huge expectations.</i>

1038
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:03,553
<i>‐ I know Lee
as well as he knows himself.</i>

1039
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,805
<i>I intend to attack
his weak points</i>

1040
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,807
<i>and flank his strong ones.</i>

1041
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:15,147
<i>‐</i> We have two choices:

1042
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,358
flank Lee and get to Richmond
from the west,

1043
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:19,652
which leaves Washington exposed,

1044
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,404
or head south,

1045
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,030
get to Lee by going
through the Wilderness.

1046
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,490
‐ The rebs know those woods.

1047
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,367
Could be deadly for us
to go through there.

1048
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,327
‐ We have to move quickly,
get out the other side,

1049
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,829
meet him in the open.
‐ It's a trap.

1050
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:32,248
We'd be leaving
Washington undefended.

1051
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:33,583
‐ General Meade?

1052
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,334
‐ I beat Lee at Gettysburg.

1053
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,378
I'd like to finish the job.

1054
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,505
‐ Then wherever he goes,
you'll follow.

1055
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,179
We'll cross the Rapidan
into the Wilderness.

1056
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,604
<i>‐</i> General, our scouts
report he crossed

1057
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,939
the Rapidan last night.

1058
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:59,692
His army is twice ours, sir.

1059
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,361
‐ We'll just have
to even the odds.

1060
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:06,365
Catch them before they
get through the Wilderness.

1061
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:11,579
Have General Hill advance
on the Orange Plank Road.

1062
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:14,707
General Ewell, on the turnpike.

1063
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,043
‐ Yes, sir.

1064
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:26,260
<i>‐ The wilderness of Spotsylvania</i>

1065
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:31,807
<i>was 70 square miles
of dense forest.</i>

1066
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:37,229
<i>It was difficult for mass groups</i>

1067
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,023
of soldiers to move through

1068
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:41,067
this particular area
of Virginia.

1069
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,572
<i>‐ A little further south
is Spotsylvania Courthouse.</i>

1070
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:49,158
<i>The land around that area
is a lot more wide open.</i>

1071
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:52,411
<i>So Grant says, "We need
to cross the Rapidan River</i>

1072
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,413
<i>"and move through
the Wilderness,</i>

1073
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,583
<i>"get to this wide‐open ground
closer to Richmond,</i>

1074
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,627
<i>"and in doing so,</i>

1075
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:01,295
"Lee's gonna have
to come out and fight us

1076
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,588
and on ground of our choosing."

1077
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,928
<i>‐ Lee knew this ground.
He knew it well.</i>

1078
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,972
He was going to use every tree

1079
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:16,602
and every bush to try
to delay Grant's actions.

1080
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,437
<i>‐ The great advantage
of the Union army</i>

1081
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,772
against
the Army of Northern Virginia

1082
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,775
is in numbers and artillery.

1083
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,112
<i>In that choked vine forest,</i>

1084
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,780
<i>numbers matter less,</i>

1085
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:31,575
<i>and you cannot bring
your artillery to bear.</i>

1086
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,452
<i>In fact, the Army of the Potomac</i>

1087
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,329
<i>fought there
against Robert E. Lee</i>

1088
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,622
<i>at the battle
of Chancellorsville</i>

1089
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,875
<i>earlier in the war and had lost.</i>

1090
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,127
<i>The battle of Chancellorsville</i>

1091
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,129
<i>is Robert E. Lee's high point.</i>

1092
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:46,090
<i>Lee is gonna violate all kind
of military principles,</i>

1093
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:48,634
<i>divide his army in the face
of a larger enemy,</i>

1094
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,803
<i>and, though outnumbered
two to one,</i>

1095
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:54,557
<i>he will drive the Union army
back across the river.</i>

1096
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:58,144
<i>This is the magic
of Robert E. Lee.</i>

1097
01:03:58,168 --> 01:03:59,186
‐ The Chancellorsville
battlefield

1098
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,813
and the Wilderness battlefield

1099
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:04,942
are pretty much
right on top of each other.

1100
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:08,904
<i>And during the initial phase
of the Wilderness campaign,</i>

1101
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,656
<i>when Grant
and the Army of the Potomac</i>

1102
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,160
<i>cross the river,
they see the remains</i>

1103
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:17,079
<i>of the battle
of the year before.</i>

1104
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,678
<i>‐ When Grant was traveling
with the Army of the Potomac,</i>

1105
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,680
he realized the extent
to which Lee

1106
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:39,018
had gotten into the mind
of all of the officers.

1107
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:42,897
<i>And he knew that he had
to deal with the Lee mystique.</i>

1108
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:47,860
<i>That was really one
of his major objectives.</i>

1109
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,112
<i>‐ The natural disposition
of most people</i>

1110
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,490
<i>is to clothe the commander
of a large army</i>

1111
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:54,200
<i>whom they do not know</i>

1112
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:57,203
<i>with almost
superhuman abilities.</i>

1113
01:04:57,227 --> 01:05:00,039
<i>But I had known
General Lee personally</i>

1114
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:03,292
<i>and knew that he was mortal.</i>

1115
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:08,214
<i>‐ The Army of the Potomac
numbers about 120,000 men.</i>

1116
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:13,385
<i>The Confederate army
numbers approximately 62,000.</i>

1117
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,096
<i>Lee knows he's outnumbered,</i>

1118
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,640
<i>but he knows if he can
bottle him up somewhere,</i>

1119
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:20,726
<i>those superior numbers
won't account for anything.</i>

1120
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,606
<i>Both sides are confident.</i>

1121
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,733
<i>The Confederates,
they've rebounded</i>

1122
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,902
<i>since their defeat
from Gettysburg.</i>

1123
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,030
<i>And also,
the Union Army of the Potomac,</i>

1124
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,657
<i>coming off that victory
at Gettysburg,</i>

1125
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:37,743
<i>they're ready to keep
following up that success.</i>

1126
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:41,247
That mentality, I think,
explains the ferocity

1127
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,581
of the fighting that follows.

1128
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:47,837
<i>‐ We had to have hard fighting.</i>

1129
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,755
<i>The two armies
now confronting each other</i>

1130
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,800
<i>had been in deadly conflict
for so long</i>

1131
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:55,594
<i>without any decisive result,</i>

1132
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,872
<i>they hardly knew
which could whip the other.</i>

1133
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:11,086
<i>‐ So the first time that Grant
and Lee go into battle,</i>

1134
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,005
<i>the two headliners of the war,</i>

1135
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,506
<i>at the Battle of the Wilderness,</i>

1136
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:18,886
<i>May of 1864,
Grant crosses into territory</i>

1137
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:22,097
<i>where Lee has his army deployed,</i>

1138
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,683
and it's a pretty brutal fight.

1139
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,228
<i>‐ Lee was actually
moving very aggressively.</i>

1140
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:29,688
<i>He wanted to attack Grant.</i>

1141
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:33,234
He wanted to push Grant
out of Virginia.

1142
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:35,903
<i>‐ Once Grant crosses the river,</i>

1143
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:39,698
<i>you see two steely‐eyed
killers who go at each other.</i>

1144
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,450
It's relentless.
It's brutal.

1145
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:43,535
It's nonstop.
It's exhausting.

1146
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,332
‐ General Grant,

1147
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,251
Rebel forces are at
the Orange Turnpike

1148
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:52,962
on the Plank Road.

1149
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,266
‐ Pitch into them at the first‐‐

1150
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:57,216
Pitch into them
at the first opportunity.

1151
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,051
Call the battery and gun crews.

1152
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,511
We'll hold this position.

1153
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:02,429
<i>‐ Grant is going to tell Meade,</i>

1154
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:04,139
"You do not wait
for them to attack you.

1155
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,684
You attack them."

1156
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,269
<i>‐ Why does he do this?</i>

1157
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:10,396
<i>Because his object
is to go ahead and fight</i>

1158
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,231
<i>Robert E. Lee.</i>

1159
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,441
<i>He takes tactical risk
fighting in the Wilderness</i>

1160
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:17,236
because there is a opportunity

1161
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,238
to destroy parts of Lee's army.

1162
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,700
<i>‐ It throws Lee for a loop,</i>

1163
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:25,703
<i>because Lee thought
he had Grant pegged.</i>

1164
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,246
<i>Lee's going off
the old rule book here,</i>

1165
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,873
<i>Union army is not
gonna act aggressively,</i>

1166
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:31,625
<i>and at the Wilderness,</i>

1167
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:33,585
<i>that preconceived notion
that he had</i>

1168
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,588
<i>really gets destroyed.</i>

1169
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:39,758
‐ Grant firmly believes that if
he can retain the initiative,

1170
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,594
he can force the other army
to react to him.

1171
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:43,971
He believes the Confederate army

1172
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:45,222
should march to a Union drum.

1173
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,102
<i>Therefore,
he's gonna continue to push</i>

1174
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,230
<i>and drive those Confederates.</i>

1175
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:58,610
<i>This is not one of those
wide‐open battlefields</i>

1176
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:01,488
<i>that you can see long lines
of clashing troops.</i>

1177
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:05,617
<i>Visibility is less
than 20 yards.</i>

1178
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,494
<i>Throw in the smoke
and noise of battle,</i>

1179
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:10,789
<i>and now it's
even more confusing.</i>

1180
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:39,318
<i>‐ It had been a very dry spring.</i>

1181
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:41,945
<i>Now, if you think of men
firing their muskets,</i>

1182
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,365
<i>there's gonna be
a flash of fire,</i>

1183
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:46,784
and all it takes is one spark.

1184
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:52,164
<i>And the real horrors
of the Wilderness begin.</i>

1185
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,833
<i>The fires are gonna
grow in intensity.</i>

1186
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:17,356
<i>For the men who are wounded,</i>

1187
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,817
<i>they can either crawl
to the enemy lines,</i>

1188
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:23,654
<i>or they can always kill
themselves with a revolver.</i>

1189
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:26,615
<i>For the living soldiers,
at the end of this fight,</i>

1190
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:29,410
<i>they have to now listen
to men scream to death</i>

1191
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:32,121
<i>as they're burned alive
in this fire,</i>

1192
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:34,081
and they now
have to smell their bodies

1193
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:36,041
as its roasted
in the conflagration,

1194
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,585
and that is something
that truly sticks with them

1195
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:39,729
for the rest of their lives.

1196
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:45,175
<i>‐ The Wilderness was a brutal,
bloody battle,</i>

1197
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,635
<i>similar to the battle
they'd fought</i>

1198
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,220
<i>at Chancellorsville
the year before,</i>

1199
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,389
<i>almost in the exact same
location.</i>

1200
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:53,058
And that battle had ended
with the Union army

1201
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,727
pulling back from the field

1202
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,979
<i>and trying to regenerate itself</i>

1203
01:10:57,003 --> 01:11:00,607
<i>and get itself
back into condition.</i>

1204
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,568
‐ Grant might have been,
like the other generals,

1205
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:05,404
justified in breaking off
and pulling back to regroup.

1206
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:24,882
‐ General Grant.

1207
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:26,741
Do you want
the casualty numbers?

1208
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:33,539
‐ We'll be the first
to attack in the morning.

1209
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,852
‐ Our men are exhausted.

1210
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:38,711
‐ So are his.

1211
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:42,733
We go forward.

1212
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:45,569
Lee's still waiting
for reinforcements.

1213
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:46,820
So if we're the first to attack,

1214
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,304
we have our advantage.

1215
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,200
‐ General.

1216
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:52,725
‐ General Meade.

1217
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:56,830
Don't forget.

1218
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,440
We possess strengths
they do not have.

1219
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:04,087
Our numbers...

1220
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:06,089
and our purpose, Meade.

1221
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,677
Our purpose.

1222
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:15,015
‐ Right, sir.

1223
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,566
<i>‐ I was anxious that
the rebels should not take</i>

1224
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,776
<i>the initiative in the morning</i>

1225
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,487
<i>and therefore
ordered an assault.</i>

1226
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:34,720
<i>‐ Union forces were successful
initially in the morning.</i>

1227
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,763
They catch
the Confederate 3rd Corps

1228
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,807
under A. P. Hill
by surprise,

1229
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:41,393
<i>they push them a good mile,</i>

1230
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:45,188
<i>and it looks like Lee's right
flank is about to cave in.</i>

1231
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:53,947
‐ General.
‐ We're losing ground.

1232
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:56,617
‐ But Longstreet's
moving in from the west...

1233
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,327
With the Texas boys.

1234
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:00,412
‐ And I'm glad of it.

1235
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:03,415
Those Texas boys will
stand and fight all day.

1236
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:12,424
<i>‐ Longstreet has arrived
with reinforcements.</i>

1237
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,926
Lee may counterattack.

1238
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,844
‐ Let him.

1239
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,346
We'll stick it out.

1240
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,348
‐ Let's taken our land,
forced us out.

1241
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:20,766
He's gonna advance.

1242
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:24,519
‐ I'm tired of hearing
about what Lee is gonna do.

1243
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,772
Some of you think he's gonna
turn a double somersault

1244
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:30,651
and land in our rear and both
flanks at the same time.

1245
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:32,361
Go back to your commands.

1246
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:34,613
Think about what we're gonna do.

1247
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:51,129
<i>‐ Longstreet arrives to save
the day in the nick of time.</i>

1248
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:54,383
<i>James Longstreet
had actually attended</i>

1249
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:57,469
<i>Ulysses S. Grant's wedding.</i>

1250
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,429
And he is Lee's
most trusted subordinate.

1251
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:00,973
He is the old warhorse.

1252
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:09,731
<i>‐ The Confederates
slam into Union lines...</i>

1253
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:12,150
<i>but the Union
had bolstered their defenses.</i>

1254
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:18,949
<i>Ultimately,
the series of assaults fail.</i>

1255
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:21,868
<i>‐ And James Longstreet
will be accidentally wounded</i>

1256
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:24,663
<i>by his own men,
shot in the neck,</i>

1257
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:27,541
<i>nearly choking to death
on his own blood</i>

1258
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:30,836
<i>before he can be moved
from the field.</i>

1259
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:35,549
<i>The Wilderness is on fire.</i>

1260
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:45,767
One soldier describes it

1261
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,187
as a battle of invisibles
versus invisibles.

1262
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:57,696
<i>They could not see
the enemy army.</i>

1263
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:10,208
<i>Soldiers are trapped.</i>

1264
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:12,836
<i>They cannot find their way out.</i>

1265
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:52,292
<i>‐ The woods were set on fire
by the bursting shells.</i>

1266
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,961
<i>The wounded,
who had not strength to move,</i>

1267
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:57,964
<i>were either suffocated
or burned to death.</i>

1268
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,097
<i>‐ By the end
of two days of combat,</i>

1269
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,974
the Union army has sustained
about 17,000 men

1270
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:10,602
killed, captured,
wounded, or missing.

1271
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,355
<i>Confederates are about 11,000.</i>

1272
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:16,608
<i>Grant has lost now more men
in the two days at Wilderness</i>

1273
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:19,111
<i>than he did
in the two days at Shiloh.</i>

1274
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:24,825
<i>‐</i> This was a particularly
horrifying battle...

1275
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:27,119
<i>not only because
of the number of casualties,</i>

1276
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,329
<i>but the forest is burning.</i>

1277
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:32,999
<i>What that meant was,
Grant went into his tent,</i>

1278
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:36,795
<i>flung himself down on the cot.</i>

1279
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,296
<i>There was a need for some</i>

1280
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,715
<i>emotional release or catharsis,</i>

1281
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,009
<i>and Grant had never
shown that side</i>

1282
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:46,304
<i>of his character before.</i>

1283
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:53,645
<i>‐ Our losses
in the Wilderness were severe.</i>

1284
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:56,690
<i>We could claim no victory
over the enemy,</i>

1285
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:59,693
<i>neither did they gain
a single advantage.</i>

1286
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:17,002
‐ We have 'em hell, General Lee.

1287
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,629
‐ They gave us the same.

1288
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,655
‐ I'm told Longstreet
will survive.

1289
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:27,179
Scouts say Grant's packing up.

1290
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:29,014
Finally retreating, sir.

1291
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:30,765
We won't see him here again.

1292
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:32,934
‐ Tell me, Colonel...

1293
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,854
have you ever met Grant?

1294
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,606
‐ No, sir.

1295
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,900
‐ No.

1296
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:41,902
I didn't think so.

1297
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:45,989
If you had,
you know he's not retreating.

1298
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,202
He's not a retreating man.

1299
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,758
<i>‐ I now felt the full weight</i>

1300
01:19:04,782 --> 01:19:07,719
<i>of responsibility
on my shoulders.</i>

1301
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:30,075
<i>‐ You will go after Lee.</i>

1302
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:33,912
<i>You will go after him
until he's finished.</i>

1303
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,107
<i>‐ It all depends on you.</i>

1304
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:41,962
‐ Gentlemen.

1305
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:44,089
‐ Come on, boys!
Let's move out!

1306
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:51,263
<i>‐ After two days
of the most brutal,</i>

1307
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:56,226
<i>vicious fighting
in the Wilderness of Virginia,</i>

1308
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,228
soldiers
of the Army of the Potomac

1309
01:19:58,252 --> 01:20:00,146
and their opposite numbers

1310
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,481
in the Army of Northern Virginia

1311
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:04,985
had fought themselves
to a standstill.

1312
01:20:05,009 --> 01:20:07,445
<i>Usually when a standstill
like that happened,</i>

1313
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,406
<i>the result was that
the Union army</i>

1314
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:12,659
<i>would pack its bags and go
back across the Rapidan River,</i>

1315
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:16,621
<i>as it had happened
literally one year before</i>

1316
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:19,541
<i>at the battle
of Chancellorsville.</i>

1317
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:22,419
<i>The question in the minds
of these soldiers was,</i>

1318
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:24,170
<i>"What direction is Ulysses Grant</i>

1319
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:25,547
<i>going to take us?"</i>

1320
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:36,224
<i>‐ In war, anything
is better than indecision.</i>

1321
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,810
<i>We must decide.</i>

1322
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:41,021
<i>If I am wrong,
we shall soon find out</i>

1323
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:43,481
<i>and can do the other thing.</i>

1324
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:47,485
<i>Not to decide
may ruin everything.</i>

1325
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:56,036
<i>‐ And so Grant arrives
at the critical intersection</i>

1326
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:59,205
in the Wilderness if he was
going to move farther south

1327
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:00,999
around Lee's flank,

1328
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:03,877
<i>seizing the strategic initiative</i>

1329
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:07,839
<i>to threaten the Confederate
capital, Richmond.</i>

1330
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:13,720
<i>‐ The soldiers
were waiting to see,</i>

1331
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:17,015
<i>"What direction
is he going to take?</i>

1332
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,100
<i>"If he turns to the left,</i>

1333
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:21,394
<i>"we're gonna be retreating
back across the river.</i>

1334
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:22,854
<i>"If he turns right,</i>

1335
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,606
<i>that means
we're heading south."</i>

1336
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:29,861
<i>‐ We're going south!</i>

1337
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,696
‐ Heading south?
‐ To Richmond.

1338
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,032
‐ Richmond?
‐ To Richmond.

1339
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:36,242
‐ We're heading south.
‐ We're headed south!

1340
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:51,383
<i>‐ Suddenly,
to their astonishment,</i>

1341
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:54,552
<i>they're all wheeling
around to the south.</i>

1342
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,055
<i>And it took tremendous
courage and tremendous</i>

1343
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:00,100
<i>personal fortitude
on Grant's part</i>

1344
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:03,603
<i>because Union casualties
were higher at the Wilderness</i>

1345
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:06,856
<i>than Confederate casualties...</i>

1346
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,944
but Grant always had this
ultimate faith in victory.

1347
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:13,988
<i>And I think that there are
certain generals in history,</i>

1348
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:15,698
<i>when they have
that faith in victory,</i>

1349
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:18,243
<i>it's something
that communicates itself</i>

1350
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,411
<i>to the troops.</i>

1351
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:26,418
<i>‐ At Wilderness,
that is a tactical loss,</i>

1352
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,420
<i>and yet Grant stands
at those crossroads</i>

1353
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:31,256
<i>and goes, "This is not a loss.</i>

1354
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,758
<i>This is the first step
to the end of the war."</i>

1355
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,430
<i>So as he heads south,
Grant will fight</i>

1356
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:42,642
<i>in a scope and scale
beyond anybody's experience.</i>

1357
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,936
We actually see the changing
character of war here.

1358
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,440
<i>Technology starts
to be a big part of it:</i>

1359
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:51,985
<i>steam engines, ironclads,</i>

1360
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:55,447
<i>railroads, telegraph.</i>

1361
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:59,284
<i>However, there is this
unchanging nature of war.</i>

1362
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:01,119
<i>It's still a clash of wills.</i>

1363
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:05,540
<i>There's still fear and interest.</i>

1364
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:09,294
<i>There's still hope
about what might happen.</i>

1365
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:15,842
<i>When you think
about the Civil War,</i>

1366
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:17,343
<i>we say that
Confederates are fighting</i>

1367
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:19,345
<i>for hearth and home</i>

1368
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:21,473
<i>and for this cause
of a Southern way of life.</i>

1369
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:22,849
<i>Well, look at what
the Northerners</i>

1370
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:26,144
<i>are fighting for.</i>

1371
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:28,563
<i>Think about all those people.</i>

1372
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:30,815
<i>They're fighting for this idea.</i>

1373
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,442
<i>The nation is new.</i>

1374
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:35,153
<i>We're largely
made up of immigrants.</i>

1375
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:36,654
<i>They have come here
because they've seen</i>

1376
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,698
<i>what it's like in the Old World.</i>

1377
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:41,659
<i>And that idea that
all men are created equal...</i>

1378
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:45,079
<i>if it doesn't exist here,
it doesn't exist anywhere.</i>

1379
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:49,000
<i>And therefore,
they're willing to fight.</i>

1380
01:23:56,490 --> 01:24:00,053
<i>‐ The greatest enthusiasm
was inspired by the fact</i>

1381
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:02,055
<i>that the movement was south.</i>

1382
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:03,932
‐ Headed to Richmond!

1383
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:05,517
‐ We're going south, boys!

1384
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:08,853
<i>‐ It indicated to the men
that they had passed through</i>

1385
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:13,316
<i>the beginning of the end.</i>

1386
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,361
<i>There would be no turning back.</i>

1387

These prayers seem kinda vague.

480
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:51,511
I mean, "make it happen"?

481
00:19:51,547 --> 00:19:52,659
Like, what does that even mean?

482
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,525
Uh, it just means they want
to become a couple.

483
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:57,428
Yeah, but at what point
do two people "become a couple"?

484
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:59,430
How about we'll say the prayer
has been answered

485
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,098
if they go out on a date?

486
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:02,567
Yeah, I don't know.

487
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:05,484
I think they really have to,
like, you know, "do it."

488
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,019
Right?
Two dates.

489
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,118
And they hold hands.

490
00:20:08,154 --> 00:20:09,386
I think it needs to be full sex.

491
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:11,789
How about a kiss?
Ooh, a kiss!

492
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,059

1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:02,920
- Now he is leaving your network.
- To go where?

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,756
Oh, to the network run by my
new friend, Laurie Bream.

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,594
- You guys, there's really no other option.
- Yes, there is.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:14,348
If Hooli won't sell us Foxhole,
we could just buy Hooli.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,724
Big question.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,517
How do we buy Hooli?

7
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,771
You want this deal to close,
you bring us the forms,

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,316
get everyone's hard signature
and then bring them to me.

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,068
You're not gonna turn your back on 30 years

10
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,569
of making money together, are you?

11
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:30,155
I don't want to be in business
with any of you people.

12
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,324
Everybody's gathered out there,

13
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,492
so you should probably say something.

14
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,994
Won't they be happy? I
freed them from Gavin.

15
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,955
Or your company just swallowed theirs

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,415
and you fired their founder and CEO.

17
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,222
All we wanted was Foxhole,

18
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,683
and instead we got all these Hooli people.

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,686
We really couldn't just
fire them, sight unseen?

20
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,397
Uh-uh. Tracy from HR has
to do an assessment

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,817
of each person first,
then we should can them.

22
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,529
Oh, hey. I think I know that guy. Uh, yeah.

23
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,447
What are you doing? Did
you just wave him in?

24
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,491
I-I don't know, automatic social shit.

25
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,952
Hey, Ethan! Uh...

26
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,037
- What are you doing here?
- You tell me, boss.

27
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,498
Uh, Ethan was my first
manager when I was at Hooli.

28
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,041
I didn't know you still worked there.

29
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,420
Yeah, well, we can't all
invent middle-out compression.

30
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,880
Uh, anyway, I-I hope I make the cut.

31
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:33,093
Yeah, well, we're having to be
creative with the merger, so...

32
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,138
Yeah, totally. That's why I
figured I could maybe help.

33
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,766
You could use Hooli OS for
your entire mobile suite.

34
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,893
Yeah, we're not gonna spend months porting

35
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,937
Hooli software over to our protocol, so...

36
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,898
- But thanks.
- Yeah, it was a good thought.

37
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,900
Yeah, you wouldn't have to.

38
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:52,237
When we iterated Hooli
OS 11, we reengineered

39
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,406
the entire network layer to be compatible

40
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,326
with other protocols... and you own it.

41
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,369
How quickly, would you say,

42
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,413
you could, um, make it work with PiperNet?

43
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,541
A few weeks with almost zero refactor.

44
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,044
How much money do you
think that could save us?

45
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,755
So you guys are planning to build your own

46
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,882
external antennas to deploy
for the Hawaii test?

47
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,967
- Why?
- The zero-start problem.

48
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,303
Until we have a critical mass of users,

49
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,473
iOS and Android devices
don't have enough range.

50
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,184
Right, of course not, but
push-to-talk HooliPhones do.

51
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,477
HooliPhones?

52
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,104
You want us to roll out our
network on push-to-talk,

53
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,106
janky-ass HooliPhones?

54
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,150
Laugh it up, but, uh, the fact that

55
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,944
they still have low power,
omnidirectional antennas

56
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,946
means they have a radius of four miles.

57
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,490
What is your antenna's range?

58
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,617
- One mile?
- Wrong.

59
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,494
One-point-one-five.

60
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,496
Okay. Line of sight, though.

61
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,956
- Maybe.
- Richard,

62
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,334
you guys just bought 250,000 HooliPhones.

63
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,004
Instead of spending more money on
expensive and mediocre antennas,

64
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,548
why not just give away
HooliPhones for the test?

65
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,134
Delete.

66
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,803
You know, Ethan, could you

67
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,473
walk us through the Hooli
OS side of all this work?

68
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,183
Yeah, totally, but I think it'd go faster

69
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,102
if I just took point and
your guys backed me up.

70
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,854
I'm sorry, what do you mean, back you up?

71
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,606
Guys, we are in a huge hole here.

72
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,858
Whatever it takes to get
us out of it, please.

73
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,653
Um, why don't you talk to Tracy in HR,

74
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,488
and you can get your start-paperwork.

75
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,032
Cool! Looks I already earned
my keep, huh, Patches?

76
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,535
Patches.

77
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,328
Yeah. Oh, that's weird
that you remember that.

78
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,790
Um, so, Patches. I'll tell them.

79
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,417
Uh, first day at Hooli,

80
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,128
I wore this sweater that had
these, like, elbow pads on it.

81
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,463
- Anyway, uh...
- HooliPhones?

82
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,798
Are you fucking serious?

83
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,509
You just laid down and let
that guy roll all over us.

84
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,429
Look, I don't wanna use Hooli
shit anymore than you guys,

85
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,472
but this is for the greater
good of the company.

86
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,391
This will get us to a working test.

87
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,435
This will get us to Hawaii.

88
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,396
Hey! Holden.

89
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,690
I asked for a water.

90
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,536
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

91
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,872
Oh... Laurie.

92
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,249
This will be sound. Excuse me one minute.

93
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,085
- Laurie.
- Oh, Monica.

94
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,297
- Hello.
- Hi.

95
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,091
I'm now using touch as a means
to communicate friendship.

96
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,968
Uh-huh.

97
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,637
Hey, um, is that Kara Swisher?

98
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,014
What do guys do in there?

99
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,558
We are uplifting each other
while we plan our annual

100
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,853
Women in Tech Empowerment panel.
Kara's moderating.

101
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,271
Oh my God. Is that Susan...

102
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,982
Susan Wojcicki from YouTube.
Don't point, it's unseemly.

103
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,110
Laurie, you do know that I am the CFO

104
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,155
of a prominent tech company
and just personally led

105
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,574
- the acquisition of Hooli?
- Yes, I am aware.

106
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,952
My partner Maximo is, hmm... unpleased.

107
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,206
I'm just saying, I-I would
love to do the panel.

108
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,541
Why? You don't mentor, you don't volunteer,

109
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,251
you don't develop programs for women.

110
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,754
You've never shown the slightest
interest in supporting women.

111
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,506
Of course I have! Which is why

112
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,634
I wanna do your panel with
Susan Wojcicki from YouTube.

113
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,093
Well...

114
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,262
we do have a lot of funny people.

115
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,973
You could add... balance.

116
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,729
Are you eating the entire leaf?

117
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,358
It's amazing how wasteful
people in the West can be.

118
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,278
Hoover.

119
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,865
This book will send shockwaves
throughout the Valley.

120
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,913
Cold Ice Cream and Hot Kisses.

121
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,916
This is about your experience at Hooli?

122
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,751
No, no. It's a coming-of-age story

123
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,962
about a lost, yet handsome teen

124
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,506
growing up one fateful summer in Maine.

125
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,424
Now, get that to the publishers.

126
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:45,428
I want the hardback in my
hand by tomorrow lunchtime.

127
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,347
Sir, it takes a bit longer than that.

128
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,809
We have to send it out to publishing
houses and then find an editor.

129
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,895
Editors are for people who can't
write correctly the first time.

130
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,480
We'll self-publish.

131
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,983
And this really isn't about tech?

132
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,027
No. I've left tech for good.

133
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,781
Now, I have a chance to
do something important.

134
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,075
Write a thinly veiled roman א clef

135
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,578
set in a whale-themed B and B.

136
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,831
So look, Monica, um, I was
looking over the org chart,

137
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,876
and I think I'm gonna put
you in charge of Foxhole.

138
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,336
- What?
- Yeah.

139
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,088
I mean, while I know that
you and I were saying

140
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,967
that maybe some people might find it
a little misogynist or offensive.

141
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,178
I think that we if we had
a woman at the helm,

142
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,181
it might change the optics, and
since you don't really care...

143
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,893
No, I-I-I do care. I care deeply.

144
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,355
No, you don't. I mean, you literally said,

145
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,274
"If a bunch of dumb Marines wanna cheat

146
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,151
on their dumb wives, what
the fuck do I care?"

147
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,778
I don't think I used those exact words.

148
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,905
I'm pretty sure you did, actually.

149
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,366
- You texted it to me last night, see?
- No, but...

150
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,701
And then you also said,

151
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,120
"We don't have to smell it.
We just have to sell it.

152
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,039
- As long as those fat fat fatties..."
- Okay.

153
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,915
I took an Ambien last night, and probably

154
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,835
should've turned off my phone.
Can you delete those?

155
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,630
Okay. Monica, just make it work.

156
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,798
Please? For women.

157
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,761
Hi.

158
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,308
Bertram Gilfoyle?

159
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,686
No.

160
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,772
I'm John.

161
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,982
Okay.

162
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,278
I brought the HooliPhones.
Would you like to see them?

163
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,156
I was told to help you with integration.

164
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,243
You know what, John?

165
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,329
That would be grand.

166
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,128
Okay, here they are.

167
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,840
The push-to-talk HooliPhone 13-X.

168
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,469
Here's a HooliPhone right here.

169
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,848
And here's a HooliPhone right here.

170
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,102
- And here's a...
- Stop talking.

171
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,270
Sit in that chair.

172
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,857
Do not touch or say anything.

173
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,655
Okay.

174
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,366
Oh my God.

175
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,244
Gwart, do you remember how I-I told you

176
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,580
I found my birth father in that
militia in the Ozarks, but...

177
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,250
then it turned out that guy was a fraud?

178
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,962
Well, um, I just went in
for some genetic testing

179
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,631
to-to confirm my diagnosis
of Marfan syndrome,

180
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:31,594
and it turns out that my
real parents are alive.

181
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,680
And they live in Santa Cruz.

182
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,224
And they're still together.

183
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,269
What should I do? Should I visit them?

184
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,231
Are you upset?

185
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,152
Should I have not allowed
somebody to sit so close?

186
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,946
Because I-I asked you if it was okay.

187
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,073
If you had an issue, you could've...

188
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,411
No. No.

189
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,623
It is my job to protect you.

190
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,167
That is my responsibility.

191
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,002
I shouldn't have put you in that position.

192
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,130
I apologize. Do you forgive me?

193
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,802
Yeah!

194
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,637
Yeah, you're right!

195
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,057
I'll be splitting you
guys into teams of four,

196
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,351
then giving you guys different
test scenarios. Hey, Patches!

197
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,188
Hey! Uh, Holden said that we
were having this thing upstairs.

198
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,273
Yeah, I moved it down here.
It's just a better space.

199
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,816
Go ahead, have a seat. You're over there.

200
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,735
I said we should wait
for you to start, but...

201
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,071
The clock is ticking, though, right?
We have stuff to do.

202
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,572
Busy, busy.

203
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,783
Oh.

204
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,243
Elbow pads. Weird. Yeah, okay.

205
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,870
Uh, actually, the first
day I was at Hooli...

206
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,414
Yeah, I told them. I told them.
They all laughed.

207
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,166
Oh. Heh.

208
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,709
Come on, put it on, Patches.

209
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:48,004
- I don't wanna put it on.
- Do it! Be fun!

210
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,591
Yeah, okay, sure. I can be fun.

211
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,635
It's kinda funny, I guess.

212
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,429
Yes! There he is!

213
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,058
There's our Patches!

214
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,684
Hey, listen, Richard.

215
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,394
You know I'm just joking
around with you, right?

216
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,897
We're all just having fun. Thanks
for being a good sport, okay?

217
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,399
Sure. No problem. Okay. Back to it.

218
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,735
Right! Okay, so as I was saying,

219
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,570
with smaller groups,

220
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,739
we'll be able to make
faster decisions, right?

221
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,699
Light on our feet. For example,

222
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,911
do we think this photo of Richard is funny?

223
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,288
We do, don't we?

224
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,665
God...

225
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,918
We do!

226
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,546
Okay. Cool, uh, guilty as charged.

227
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,964
Big cake lover. You got me.

228
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,841
Yeah. Well, I mean, I was
your boss for a year,

229
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,718
so you know I have some funny photos
of you squirreled away, right?

230
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,055
Uh, I didn't know that was a thing
bosses did, but, yeah, maybe.

231
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,392
Speaking of which, did you write that?

232
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,519
- Ooh!
- Oh, my God.

233
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,354
And sorted list size is greater than

234
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,106
plus, plus index?

235
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,441
You ran a brute force
search on a sorted list?

236
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,403
Look, guys, it was my first day, and...

237
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,989
- I was nervous, and I was hurrying, so...
- Really?

238
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,617
That's why you decided to write the
slowest subroutine in history?

239
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,496
Anyone could've made that mistake.

240
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,624
Yeah, it's true. In fact, I
could ask for a show of hands,

241
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,710
but instead of doing that,
uh, I'll just, uh...

242
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,837
Could you have made that mistake?

243
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,046
Could you have made that mistake?

244
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,464
Could you have made that mistake?

245
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,508
- Okay.
- Could you have made that mistake?

246
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,678
The joke is that he's doing a
brute force search of the room.

247
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:22,098
- Yeah, I know.
- Then, why did you do it?

248
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,602
Could you have made that mistake?

249
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,062
Richard, what the fuck was that?

250
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,523
It was just... Ethan being Ethan.

251
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,651
He was acting like your boss, and you
were acting like his noob employee.

252
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,321
No. Everyone knows I'm the boss.

253
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,449
I think people were just excited
to, you know, razz the CEO.

254
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,618
- It's all in good fun.
- I did not have fun.

255
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,828
I watched you get kicked in
the balls for 90 minutes.

256
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,914
My balls hurt sympathetically
for your balls.

257
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,916
Take off that sweater!

258
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,878
It's fine.

259
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,964
I mean, yes, Ethan can be a little prickly,

260
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,634
but he is gonna get us
to where we need to be.

261
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,012
And I don't mind putting my ego
aside for the good of the company.

262
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,097
That guy humiliating you was
not good for the company.

263
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,892
He dominated you like a silverback gorilla.

264
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,770
Do you know why the gorillas
respected Jane Goodall?

265
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,689
- Jane Goodall studied chimpanzees.
- Wrong!

266
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,067
It's because she could kick
their ass, and they knew it.

267
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,986
You need to assert dominance
like Jane Goodall.

268
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,738
I have something to show you.

269
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,823
You're gonna need this.

270
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,210
This is a video of maximizing alphaness.

271
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,799
What else happens?

272
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,718
It's just this, then it repeats itself.

273
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,345
You just kind of breathe

274
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,430
and subconsciously absorb it.

275
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,643
Dinesh, this is the dumbest
thing I've ever seen.

276
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,520
Fuck yeah.

277
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,613
Hey, John.

278
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:02,991
Yeah?

279
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,078
Could you grab my extra spudger?

280
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,080
I think it's on my desk,

281
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,499
next to my chess board.

282
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,501
Okay.

283
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,343
Cthulu limited edition, huh?

284
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,179
- That's right.
- Huh.

285
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,808
Anything else?

286
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,185
Nope.

287
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,356
Okay.

288
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,444
I am so glad we could do this.

289
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,154
Yeah.

290
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,364
What are we doing, exactly?

291
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,950
Well, I have had my eye
on you for a while now.

292
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,912
It's what I like to call,
"mentoring from a distance."

293
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,498
We haven't spoken more than
five words to each other

294
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,250
since you joined the company.

295
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,002
That's the distance part!

296
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,046
Look, I-I came here to talk about

297
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,714
advancing the careers of women,

298
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,175
specifically yours.

299
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,053
- Do you know how we just acquired Foxhole?
- Of course.

300
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,138
Apparently, it's 90% men,

301
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,767
and almost all the female
users are prostitutes.

302
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,603
Which makes it a very
challenging assignment.

303
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,438
It's also a big promotion

304
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,815
and strategically important to the company.

305
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,485
And it's yours, if you want it.

306
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,779
But, I mean, if you don't
think you can handle it,

307
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,031
I can just check in with Becky, Nadia,

308
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,741
- Dani...
- No!

309
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,619
I can do it.

310
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,829
Awesome! For you!

311
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,876
Caspian's heart cracked open

312
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,420
like one of his father's
briny lobster traps.

313
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,839
"Hannah," he whispered.

314
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,093
"I am not..." -

315
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,515
"Hannah," he whispered. "I am not a member

316
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,892
"of the prestigious
Prout's Neck Yacht Club.

317
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,853
"Truth be told, I am but a..." -

318
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,609
"Truth be told, I am but
a lowly man of the sea.

319
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,445
She... "-

320
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,866
"She was my mistress, but now, I pray

321
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,452
that you might be as well?"

322
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,331
Thank you.

323
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,752
- Name?
- Oh, I don't want to buy your book.

324
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,255
I'm Allie Abrams, arts editor
at the Sacramento Bee.

325
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,841
Do you have a minute for a quick interview?

326
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,969
I'll make the time.

327
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,056
Is it on? Running?

328
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,934
Firstly, I work in the parlor.

329
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,229
I use a 1968 IBM Selectric II.

330
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,148
In fact, the tapping of the keys

331
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,025
inspired the idea for Lana's blindness.

332
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,069
The tapping of her cane, you see?

333
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,696
Oh.

334
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,865
I guess what I really want to know is,

335
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,575
why isn't this book about tech?

336
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,160
I'm an author.

337
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,954
Would you ask John Grisham the
same question, or Jackie Collins?

338
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,748
Well, no, but they weren't the
head of a failed tech company.

339
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,251
You think I failed.

340
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,170
I didn't fail tech.

341
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,713
Tech failed me.

342
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,591
Tech failed all of us. Look.

343
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,551
We should be in a Waldenbooks,

344
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,721
but we're here, in this
decrepit shithole, and why?

345
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,016
Because people buy books
online, thanks to Hool...

346
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,392
Amazon.

347
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,603
So, don't point fingers at me.

348
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,479
I didn't write about tech

349
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,565
because tech destroys worlds,

350
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,817
and I, I wanted to create them.

351
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,491
May I have a token for
the restroom, please?

352
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,286
Well, there's not a whole lot to the story.

353
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,621
Once you came along,

354
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,665
Susan and I realized the
timing was not right,

355
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,292
and we needed to give you up.

356
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:45,338
I appreciate how difficult that
must've been for you guys.

357
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,508
One of the hardest decisions
we ever had to make.

358
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,801
Um, thank you.

359
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,136
And I just want you to know,

360
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,640
that I understand and I don't hold it

361
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,892
against you at all.

362
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,981
You guys had kids after me?

363
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,817
- Well, one was after.
- Pardon?

364
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,320
- Pete and Lisa were before you.
- Right.

365
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,197
I don't understand. You...

366
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,284
I was your third child, and-and you...
you gave me up?

367
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,454
- Yeah. It just got way too difficult for us.
- Mm. Yeah.

368
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,373
Couldn't go on as many flights.

369
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,668
Two parents, two kids...
that's a clear row across.

370
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,921
- Yeah.
- 1A, B, C, and D.

371
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,676
So, you gave me up to simplify
your first-class air travel?

372
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,428
- Oh. No, it's more complicated than that.
- Yeah.

373
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,347
Yeah, we had car travel,

374
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,182
- and taxis.
- Mm-hmm.

375
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,643
We never really did travel by train.

376
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,562
No, and I don't do boats, so...

377
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,106
Well, you did enjoy that
trip down the Rhine.

378
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,191
I... said I did.

379
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,693
Oh, you!

380
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,404
Anyway, when we gave you up, we realized...

381
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,115
- we had a huge mistake.
- You did?

382
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,618
Yeah. We realized we actually
did want a third child.

383
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,662
- Yep.
- Started trying almost immediately,

384
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,291
and we lucked out because Donald
is the best of the bunch.

385
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,584
Yeah.

386
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,419
- Donald?
- Yeah, we love that name,

387
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,212
so we just wanted to use it again.

388
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:11,757
- Oh! Speak of the angels, they're here.
- They're here.

389
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,468
Wait, you invited my birth siblings here?

390
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,679
To meet me?

391
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,015
- Hi, Mama.
- Hey.

392
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,391
This is Peter.

393
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,018
This is Lisa. This is Donald.

394
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,645
And this is, uh, Ken. He's here to tell us

395
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,856
- about the solar situation for the house...
- Ken?

396
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,983
...so, uh...

397
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,655
Yeah, we offer financing.

398
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,576
We just need one more
minute, and then we can go.

399
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,870
- All right.
- Bye.

400
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,249
We never told them about you.

401
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,084
Didn't wanna make them sad.

402
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,087
- Yeah, I-I see.
- Yeah.

403
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:53,049
Well! This has been really great.

404
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,342
We have...

405
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,344
- We have a family dinner.
- We have a dinner.

406
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,262
Every Thursday, we have Italian food, so...

407
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,765
Although, tonight, we're switching it up.
We're gonna do Chinese.

408
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,351
It was one of the hardest
decisions we ever had to make.

409
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,852
Yeah.

410
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:10,191
Well, uh, Ken, we were
underwhelmed by your presentation.

411
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,205
- Hey, John.
- Yeah?

412
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,583
Did you move the white pawn here?

413
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,503
Opening move?

414
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,380
No.

415
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,925
Okay.

416
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,980
I'm gonna go hit the head.

417
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:53,234
I should be back in about two minutes.

418
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,903
Okay.

419
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,076
Where's the dunce cap?

420
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,013
Hey, uh...

421
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,849
Uh, Ethan?

422
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,101
Yeah, Patches?

423
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,562
I-I was actually thinking that maybe

424
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,814
we stop with the nickname.

425
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,816
We had our fun,

426
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,527
but maybe stop all the jokes
about my coding mistake

427
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,071
from years ago, and also...

428
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,323
stop calling me Patches.

429
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,117
Yeah. Okay.

430
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,326
Butt Stuff.

431
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,870
You remember that?

432
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,830
When you walked around all
day and your T-shirt was

433
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,915
stuck all the way into
your underwear, all day?

434
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:53,127
I mean, I remember it,
but no to Butt Stuff.

435
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,005
- Um, just call me Richard.
- Here's the thing.

436
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,799
That name makes me happy, and...

437
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,678
if you had as much managerial
experience as I do,

438
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,639
you'd know that keeping
your star coder happy

439
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,601
is how you get the best
work, and you guys need me

440
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,978
to do really good work because I'm kind of

441
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,731
the only person here that can do it, so...

442
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:17,318
I'm just gonna keep calling you Patches.

443
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,029
Is that okay with you? Patches?

444
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,948
- Oh!
- Aw!

445
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,415
So, it's complicated.

446
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,001
You were the clear aggressor
in this incident,

447
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,296
but you're also the only one who got hurt.

448
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,714
You hit him in the forehead,

449
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,966
which is the single hardest
part of the human body.

450
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,261
I would never advocate violence,
but when you make a fist,

451
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,764
you wanna keep your thumb on the outside.

452
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:50,392
Yeah. Uh, I know that now, but at
the time, I couldn't remember.

453
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,978
You did great, Champ, but
here's the bottom line.

454
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:56,357
We gotta cool our shit down with this guy

455
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,944
before he lawyers up and
sues us a new hiney-hole.

456
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,446
You need to go talk to Ethan
and give him a sincere

457
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,157
- and honest apology.
- Without admitting any fault

458
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,786
or describing what happened in any way.

459
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,749
I asked myself, why would they reject me

460
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,210
and not their three other
biological children?

461
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,171
And that is when it hit me.

462
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,923
It's me.

463
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,883
I mean, even as a baby, I must have

464
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,635
somehow rejected them,

465
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:28,055
and every subsequent foster
family I've ever had.

466
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,349
Oh. Heavy.

467
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,725
I rejected Richard,

468
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,311
and every person who has
ever offered me safe harbor,

469
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,521
and it has to stop.

470
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,982
I have to commit to Gwart.

471
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,900
No matter how difficult it gets,

472
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,152
even if we're miserable
together, I am going

473
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,155
to support her work, and bring her food,

474
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,449
and-and put her in her
prescription sleeping bag

475
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,535
when she starts to thrash.

476
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,745
It is the only path forward.

477
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,455
Hey, that's the best, man.

478
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,332
I feel like you made a lot of progress.

479
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,960
Ha!

480
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,379
Gwart's doll gloves.

481
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,756
I'm gonna make her so happy.

482
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,427
My book is a fucking disaster.

483
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,139
What have you got there?

484
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,348
Oh, um,

485
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,684
MSNBC wanted to interview you about being

486
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:17,313
an "anti-tech evangelist." Their words.

487
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,107
I told them you only wanted
to speak about two things:

488
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,943
cold ice cream, and hot kisses.

489
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,697
Who-who was it? Was it Hayes or O'Donnell?

490
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,115
Maddow, sir.

491
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,950
- Really?
- Yes.

492
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,786
I'm sure all the major outlets
would love to have you...

493
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,080
if you discuss tech.

494
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,084
So...

495
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,549
Do I honor my truth as a starving author,

496
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,802
or do I return to the world I've scorned?

497
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,099
What did Publisher's
Weekly say about my book?

498
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,771
Publisher's Weekly is a...
terrible magazine, sir.

499
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,064
Call Maddow.

500
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,732
Yes, sir.

501
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,652
Bishop to E6.

502
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,031
- Checkmate.
- Fuck.

503
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,909
Okay, so that's...

504
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,162
42 games for me, and...

505
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,873
zero for you.

506
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:19,875
You wanna play again?

507
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,378
I think I'll take a break.

508
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,213
Okay.

509
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,450
Okay.

510
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,245
Well, thank you so much

511
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,164
for the hilarious Susan
Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube.

512
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,291
It's gonna be a very hard act to follow,

513
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,210
but here to try is Monica Hall,

514
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,671
the CFO of Pied Piper. Come on up, Monica.

515
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,429
- Thank you for coming, Monica.
- Thank you.

516
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,223
I was thrilled and surprised to be invited.

517
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,851
So, let's cut right to the chase.

518
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,477
You recently acquired Hooli,

519
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,146
and one of its properties

520
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,314
is Foxhole, which is apparently an app

521
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,443
that military members use
to source prostitutes.

522
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,445
Yes, and that's something

523
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,488
I'm not involved with on any level.

524
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,490
It's being run now by a young woman

525
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,075
I promoted, Priyanka Singh.

526
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,287
I talked to Priyanka before this panel.

527
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,788
Priyanka, are you in this audience?

528
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,499
- Yes, hi!
- Hey, Priyanka. How you doing?

529
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,418
Why don't you get up and tell us about it?

530
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,295
Well,

531
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,214
when I first took over the
app, I was pretty lost,

532
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:54,678
but, luckily, I was able to call on
my network of strong, female coders.

533
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,849
And almost immediately, we came up

534
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,019
with a plan to rebuild
Foxhole from the bottom up.

535
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,856
Our first step will be to unionize
the sex workers on the app.

536
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,901
We believe that friends with
benefits deserve benefits

537
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,361
because sex work is work.

538
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,324
And! And! Why is it only for men?

539
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,869
Don't our female soldiers, who
put their bodies in harm's way,

540
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,623
deserve to put their
bodies in pleasure's way?

541
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,710
I think it might be a good idea
to bring Priyanka up here.

542
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,838
- Priyanka, why don't you come up?
- Uh, okay.

543
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,971
So, Priyanka,

544
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,140
the business of sex positive feminism...

545
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:41,391
Monica, move.

546
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,686
Like we say at Foxhole,
if you can scale Tinder,

547
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,772
you can scale sex positive feminism.

548
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,941
There's a seat in back.

549
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,446
You.

550
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,658
Who are you?

551
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,082
Ethan. Hey, um...

552
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,042
I owe you an apology.

553
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,670
It's bad enough that I used brute force

554
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,256
to search a sorted list, but...

555
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,591
No, Richard. I'm the one

556
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,052
that needs to apologize to you.
You're my boss,

557
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,097
and the way that I talked to
you was completely outta line.

558
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,975
I'm just feeling insecure about

559
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,811
working for a guy that used to work for me.

560
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,438
- Really?
- Yeah.

561
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,732
I'm so happy to be here, and...

562
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,570
I'd love to stick around if you'll have me.

563
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,363
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

564
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,156
Great, man. Thank you so much.

565
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,617
Sorry again. Thank you, this is great.

566
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:41,994
Dinesh, I'm really looking forward

567
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,996
to finishing up this project
with you and your team.

568
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,999
- Oh, it's whatever, dawg.
- Cool.

569
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,127
What did you do to that guy?

570
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,796
- I watched that video.
- See? I told you! We're alphas!

571
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,631
- Fuck yeah!
- Fuck yeah.

572
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,758
Hey, uh, don't show that video to Gilfoyle.

573
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,719
Got it.

574
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,305
Fuck yeah.

575
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,658
- I see it's been handled.
- Yes.

576
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,368
Good.

577
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,412
So, I trust there's no more need for any...

578
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,873
No. That won't be necessary.

579
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,208
Let's hope not.

580
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,461
Can I go now, please?

581
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,422
Very well. Good job on the plate.

582
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,802
Holden,

583
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:44,097
did you threaten Ethan in some way?

584
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,558
He was causing problems

585
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,769
- for Richard.
- Oh.

586
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,562
Well, it's...

587
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,440
it's good to know that he's in good hands.

588
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,194
Don't you have somewhere to be?

589
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,905
Uh... sorry. Um...

590
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,450
It's from Gwart.

591
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,830
"I'm dissolving my company
and taking a job elsewhere.

592
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,500
"Your employment is terminated.

593
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,962
P.S. Those aren't my doll's gloves."

594
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,171
Oh.

595
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,632
So, then I...

596
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,343
I'm free to return to work with Richard.

597
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,431
Your position's been filled.

598
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,436
Oh, um...

599
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,315
No, it hasn't.

600
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,896
I'm sorry, what is this?

601
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,398
Russfest. Three days of partying

602
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,234
on a plot of land so far out
even Nevada barely wants it.

603
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,614
What's the newest killer app
coming out of Silicon Valley?

604
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,573
Are you Tethical?

605
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,742
No one in town is ever gonna sign

606
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,744
this hypocrite's hypocritical garbage.

607
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,163
Hey, Richard, are you
signing Gavin's pledge?

608
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,247
Aw... what?

609
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,084
I'd like to talk to you
about your Piper Pulse.

610
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,586
Your coworkers find you unapproachable,

611
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,755
with an unsettling stare.

612
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,256
Okay.

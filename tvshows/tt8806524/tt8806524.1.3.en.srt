Previously on
Star Trek: Picard...

2
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:12,229
I want you to reinstate me.

3
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:14,275
I will need a small
reconnaissance ship

4
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:15,928
with a minimal crew.

5
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:18,105
You think you could just waltz
back in here and be entrusted

6
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:20,498
with taking
men and women into space?

7
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:23,545
I have reason to believe that
the Tal Shiar is merely a mask

8
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:25,982
worn by another far older cabal,

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,070
the Zhat Vash.

10
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:28,724
Admiral Clancy
just called.

11
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:30,726
Jean-Luc Picard was
trying to persuade her

12
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:33,120
to let him go after
Dr. Bruce Maddox.

13
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:35,339
I want you to stay on mission.

14
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:36,732
I've put my best man on it.

15
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:37,994
Nice of you to knock.

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,126
Commodore Oh

17
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:40,779
is quite distressed.

18
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:42,433
I'm still confident
that my approach,

19
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:43,826
which you approved,
is the only sound approach.

20
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:45,088
Are we allowed

21
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:47,047
to be sleeping together,
or is that a secret?

22
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,831
Very much the latter.

23
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:50,311
How likely is the Collective

24
00:00:50,354 --> 00:00:51,921
to reestablish a link
to your Borg?

25
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:53,227
Well, they're
former Borg.

26
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,445
And we're not releasing them,

27
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:55,707
we're reclaiming them.

28
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:56,926
There's really no danger.

29
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,885
I have to go. Go? Where? Go how?

30
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,061
You need help,
you need protection.

31
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:02,323
Yeah.

32
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:03,280
You need someone who hates you

33
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:04,760
and has nothing to lose.

34
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:06,762
Raffi, it's Jean-Luc.

35
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:08,372
Please, don't hang up.

36
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,852
I need a ship.

37
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:12,855
There isn't
anything you could say

38
00:01:12,898 --> 00:01:14,248
that I want to hear.

39
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:17,816
Secret Romulan assassins
are operating on Earth.

40
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:20,384
Goddamn it.

They start with the ships?

44
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:18,355
Straight out,
just as you predicted.

45
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,878
You were ready,

46
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:22,577
with the inventories from
Beta Antares and Eridani A,

47
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,839
which shut them up.

48
00:02:25,623 --> 00:02:27,712
So they hit you with manpower.
Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:29,061
But you had the
reserve rosters

50
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:30,976
I got from Tanaka
in personnel.

51
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,848
I laid it all out.

52
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:36,330
By using reserve duty officers
and mothballed ships,

53
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:38,767
we could maintain
the evacuation,

54
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,379
though to
a severely reduced level.

55
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:44,555
Not if we use
synthetic labor.

56
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,297
All synthetic life-forms
are banned,

57
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:49,734
throughout the Federation,
effective immediately.

58
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:52,868
All active units
are dismantled and

59
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:55,131
all research is halted.

60
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,828
Well, that's crazy.

61
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:58,743
It makes no sense.

62
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:01,746
Synths don't just wake up one
morning and turn homicidal.

63
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,272
They said
it was a fatal code error

64
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:07,230
in the operating system.

65
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:08,275
That's bullshit.

66
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:09,711
S...

67
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:12,322
Something's off about
this whole business, JL.

68
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,802
It doesn't add up.

69
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:15,804
I smell the Tal Shiar.

70
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:18,850
Tal Shiar.

71
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:22,637
Raffi, why would
the Romulans attack a fleet

72
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,727
built expressly
to rescue them?

73
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,729
I can't answer that.

74
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,426
Yet.

75
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,255
But I do know that there are
billions of people out there

76
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:35,867
in the Beta Quadrant that are in
the burst radius of a supernova.

77
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,826
It's not their fault
that a bunch of A500s

78
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:39,654
went rogue on Mars.

79
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:41,786
You're absolutely right.

80
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,921
Mars is burning.

81
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:50,186
Tens of thousands
are dead.

82
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,320
And nobody is thinking,
nobody is listening.

83
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:55,365
They're just reacting.

84
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:57,759
Wait a minute.

85
00:03:57,802 --> 00:04:00,196
What happened in there, JL?

86
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,375
They said that our
plan was "unfeasible."

87
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,986
Half of them never wanted
to rescue the Romulans

88
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,640
in the first place.

89
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:12,556
And the rest are...

90
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,820
are just... frightened.

91
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:18,997
I never dreamed that
Starfleet would give in

92
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,391
to intolerance and fear.

93
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:24,220
What happened in there?

94
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,656
I said that either

95
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,965
they accept
the revised evacuation plan...

96
00:04:30,008 --> 00:04:31,880
or my resignation.

97
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,058
Are you serious?

98
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,323
Well...

99
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,412
what did they say?

100
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:46,677
Jean-Luc?

101
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:49,201
They accepted my resignation.

102
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,426
I...

103
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,906
Hell with them.

104
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:00,909
We'll figure it out.
We'll find a way.

105
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:02,911
To mount
a multi-world evacuation

106
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:08,743
of tens of millions of Romulans without
Starfleet's support?

107
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:11,136
There has to
be something.

108
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,617
Some last,

109
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:16,577
desperate, wild
solution, JL.

110
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,927
That's what you do.

111
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,625
My resignation was

112
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:24,759
the last, desperate,
wild solution.

113
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:30,591
I never believed
that they would...

114
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:32,201
accept it.

115
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:36,423
Of course you wouldn't.

116
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:39,817
Now what?

117
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:42,298
You're gonna go back
to your château and

118

write your memoirs?

119
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:48,870
I can't do this
without you, JL.

120

Oh.

121
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:56,443

It's a lot to take in.

00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:36,428
I mean, the obvious

"You have some goddamn nerve."

144
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:41,346
But I gather you...
you already heard that

Clancy, right?

00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:09,636
exactly what you're

I don't remember you being such
a chatterbox back in the day.

152
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,424
I mean...

153
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:17,165
I saw your interview.

154
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,646
An unmitigated disaster.

155
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,343
Yeah.

156
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:23,824
I saw you,

157
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:27,784
sitting back in your
very fine château.

158
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:31,396
Those big oak beams,

159
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,485
heirloom furniture.

160
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:35,662
Yeah, I-I'd show you
around my estate,

161
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:38,490
but it's more of a hovel, so
that would just be, you know,

162
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,405
humiliating.

163
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:45,715
But my entire life for
the past 14 years has been

164
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,284
one long slide into humiliation.

165
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:52,504
And rage.

166
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,294
Also a fair amount of
snakeleaf-induced paranoia,

167
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:02,558
so... some things
never change.

168
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:06,867
Mmm.

169
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,391
Hmm.

170
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,438
Might have been nice
to hear from you

171
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:16,398
a time or two in there,
JL, not because you think

172
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:20,141
I know an off-the-books pilot
with an unregistered starship.

173
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,710
Just...

174
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:27,496
...to say hi.

175
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,673
See how I was doing.

176
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:33,633
I know. I... Because I was
not doing good.

177
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,898
I lost my security clearance.

178
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:39,508
I lost...

179
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:42,642
Don't, Raffi.

180
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,644
No, don't. Just don't touch me.

181
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,733
Raffi.

182
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:56,656
Raffi.

183
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,963
♪

184
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:54,104
I really don't know
what to say, Dr. Asha.

185
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:57,107
Your work here has
always been excellent,

186
00:11:57,151 --> 00:12:00,284
but speaking to a Nameless
in his own language?

187
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:03,113
Outstanding.

188
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:06,116
You taught me
that even a few words

189
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,988
in the mother tongue
can be soothing.

190
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:09,990
Even in an unconscious state.

191
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:15,691
There is no more despised people
in the galaxy than the xBs.

192
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,476
People either see us
as property to be exploited

193
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,001
or as a hazard to be warehoused.

194
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:23,177
Our hosts,

195
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,441
the Romulans,
have a more expansive vision.

196
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,182
They see us as both.

197
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:30,619
I hate it.

198
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:32,926
You're different.

199
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:35,493
Thank you.

200
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:39,323
I've decided to let you have
your interview with Ramdha.

201
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,673
Oh, my God, really?

202
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:44,111
You've been pestering me
about it for a long time.

203
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:47,288
After today, I'm inclined
to grant your request.

204
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:50,857
Tell me, why?

205
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,120
How much do you know
about Ramdha

206
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,252
before she was assimilated?

207
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:56,950
Have you read
her Romulan dossier?

208
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,255
Of course not.

209
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,909
Wait, have you?

210
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:05,262
How did you manage that?

211
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:07,656
I just sort of asked to see it.

212
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:10,267
Usually I find that
if I ask people for help,

213
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:12,052
they're happy to give it.

214
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:15,098
That has not been my experience.
In particular with Romulans.

215
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:16,447
Ramdha was

216
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:18,667
the foremost expert
on ancient Romulan myth.

217
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,277
She wrote books about it.

218
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:22,889
And this interest of hers
links you to her work how?

219
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:26,109
There is ample evidence
for the therapeutic utility

220
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:28,503
of a shared mythical framework.

221
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:32,246
30 minutes.

222
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,857
As an experiment.

223
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:37,077
Then we'll see
how that goes.

224
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:49,872
It makes total sense
that you're angry.

225
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,006
I disappointed you.
I neglected you.

226
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,747
And I wasn't there
when you needed me.

227
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,272
I'm truly sorry.

228
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:03,886
I don't care.

229
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,107
Raffi, there is a unit

230
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,719
of Tal Shiar
synth hunters operating

231
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:12,939
on Earth, openly.

232
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:17,291
That could not happen
without Federation complicity.

233
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:19,902
I'm listening.

234
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:23,123
You always said there were
Romulan-Federation connections

235
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,472
I didn't see.

236
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:27,083
I was talking about Mars, JL.

237
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,998
The Romulan rescue.

238
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:30,739
Those aren't
connections I just see,

239
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:34,090
like people see angels
or-or, uh, ghosts.

240
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:35,744
I have evidence.

241
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,659
I have concrete evidence

242
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:40,531
that a high-ranking
Starfleet official conspired

243
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:43,056
to allow the attack
to go forward,

244
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:45,101
to put an end to
the rescue mission.

245
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:47,103
Raffi... Which they opposed.

246
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:50,890
Raffi, they had no reason
to sabotage their own rescue.

247
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,588
What do you think happens
when there's a cover-up?

248
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:56,112
They conceal it.

249
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,899
That's why I need
your help.

250
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,813
I need your mind.

251
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:06,035
Your ability to see things
others don't see.

252
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,951
No. No, no, no, no.

253
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:12,563
I will not go down another
rabbit hole with you, JL.

254
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:14,783
No, never again... No. Go.Raffi...

255
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,920
Get out of here, please.

256
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:26,012
Please.

257
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,153
I have a pilot for you.

258
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:40,765
His name is Rios.

259
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,725
And he'll be in touch.

260
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:46,902
Rios. Thank you.

261
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,730
Now go.

262
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,021
Hi.Dr. Jurati?

263
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:22,068
Commodore Oh,
director of Starfleet Security.

264
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:25,985
Okay. I'd like to
talk to you

265
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:29,205
about your two recent visits
with Admiral Picard.

266
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:39,259
All personnel...

267
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:47,919
She's here to meet
with Patient 4822 stroke 2.

268
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:49,399
She'll need
authorization.

269
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,401
This unit is operated
by the Reclamation Project.

270
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:53,403
It is under the
direct authority

271
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:56,276
of its executive director: me.

272
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:59,061
Open up.

273
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,781
All the disordered
are Romulans?

274
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:27,220
The only Romulans ever
assimilated, as far as I know.

275
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:36,620
There she is.

276
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:52,810
Hi.

277
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:15,006
What?

278
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,574
You're doing the research,
aren't you? No.

279
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:21,274
I'm sending you everything that
Daystrom had on Bruce Maddox.

280
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:22,492
I don't want it.

281
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,407
Carry on.

282
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:31,240
♪

283
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,652
Captain Rios?

284
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,743
Oh. Hi. Hello.

285
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:57,092
Picard.

286
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,224
Yes, sorry.
Of course you are.

287
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:00,269
I'm afraid
you might be too late.

288
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,054
Right, then.

289
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:05,405
Come on.

290
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:11,193
So, what seems
to be the problem?

291
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:13,108
Are you kidding me? Hey.

292
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,544
Are you...?

293
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,329
Chris Rios. He's just an EMH.

294
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:17,460
"Just."

295
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:19,201
I'm, uh... I know who you are.

296
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:20,855
I read one of your books
one time.

297
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:22,117
What happened to you?

298
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,816
I didn't die.

299
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,253
Medkit.

300
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:32,345
Aguardiente.

301
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:41,789
No, thanks.

302
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:46,010
What you want
to do is take

303
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:47,229
the giant hunk
of tritanium shrapnel

304
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:48,230
out of the hole in my shoulder.

305
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:49,971
That's just a guess.

306
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:51,190
Please,

307
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,539
sit.

308
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:04,203
Toss it anywhere.

309
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:09,251
So, where are we
going, Admiral?

310
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,558
Raffi says you
have no idea.

311
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:13,908
I'm working on it. When are we leaving?

312
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,910
Soon as possible.

313
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:18,129
You breaking any laws
or intending to?

314
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:20,567
I don't know.

315
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,701
I'm not in the habit
of consulting lawyers

316
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:27,748
before I do
what needs to be done.

317
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,271
You? I'm not in the habit

318
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:31,708
of consulting anybody
about anything.

319
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:34,537
Especially a lawyer.

320
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:37,453
There we are.

321
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:39,934
Now for the thermal regenerator. Leave it.

322
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:43,067
Give me that. Get lost.

323
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:47,028
He never gets any nicer.

324
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:48,290
Duly noted.

325
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:50,205
Deactivate, EMH.

326
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,687
I need a pilot.

327
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,950
Raffi says
you're the best around.

328
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:57,908
I never argue with Raffi.

329
00:20:57,952 --> 00:20:59,997
Huh. Wise man.

330
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:04,437
You were the XO
of a heavy cruiser?

331
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,003
The ibn Majid.

332
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:09,050
You never heard of it
because it doesn't exist.

333
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:10,965
Starfleet erased it
from the records.

334
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:15,404
Do I detect a certain bitterness
toward Starfleet?

335
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:18,277
You must know
that Starfleet and I

336
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,844
long since have parted ways.

337
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:22,629
If you say so.

338
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:24,413
I really don't
give a damn.

339
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:27,111
Oh, really?

340
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:29,331
I see this ship is

341
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,898
impeccably maintained.

342
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:33,727
Every bolt and clasp

343
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,250
and fitting in place.

344
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,167
Everything stowed
in regulation Starfleet order.

345
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,083
I don't know
what happened to you, Rios,

346
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:44,259
or to the ibn Majid.

347
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,914
But five minutes
on this ship,

348
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:50,134
and I know precisely
what I'm looking at.

349
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:52,615
You are Starfleet

350
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:54,095
to the core.

351
00:21:54,138 --> 00:21:56,837
I can smell it on you.

352
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,405
That's just my tragic
sense of life.

353
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:02,277
Raffi warned me you
were a speechmaker.

354
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:06,629
Look, Admiral, hire me
or find another pilot.

355
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:08,936
Do not try to get
inside my head.

♪

357
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:59,769
The navigation
sensors are back at maximum range.

358
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,031
Whatever it was,

359
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:02,990
it scraped off pretty easily.

360
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,513
Mm-hmm.

361
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:07,168
So are we excited?

362
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:09,039
Intimidated?

363

Maybe a teensy
bit starstruck.

Jean-Luc Picard.

Chief contact

Arbiter of succession
for the Klingon Empire.

Savior of Earth
from Borg invasion.

Captain of
the Enterprises Dand E.

The man even worked alongside

You are an emergency hologram.

372
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:35,979
We no longer have
a navigational emergency.

373
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:40,114
Why are you still here?

374
00:23:40,157 --> 00:23:42,508
Well, someone is experiencing
an acute moodiness overload.

375
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:52,300
Picard is a good man,
Captain Rios.

He's on the side

It's been a long time since you
helped out somebody like him.

00:23:58,262 --> 00:24:01,831
Hmm? A very long time.

379
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,485
Please, spare me the juvenile
Sunday school morality.

380
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:07,924
And spare me the angsty
teenage moral relativism.

381
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:10,579
I already had one grand,
heroic captain in my life.

The last thing I need
is another one.

Ten years on, I still can't
close my eyes at night

the last one's blood and brains

Wood smoke, mown hay

heavy sweetness

Oh, yes, my dear.

I will miss you
and Zhaban and Number One.

398

I tried my best

399

to belong to this place.

400
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:41,583
But I don't think I ever...

401
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:44,020
truly felt at home here.

Very close. I think
that one's called "shaipouin,"

00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:20,491
which means... A false door.

407
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:23,016
Traditional Romulan houses

that's never used.

No, but I hear that she's
very good at her job.

Sh-She wanted to know
why you came to see me, and...

I'm sorry, but I told her.

435
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:45,392
Seemed too important
not to.

436
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:47,307
And anyway,
I'm a terrible liar.

437
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,308
Of course.

438
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:49,875
It's all right.

There's one thing
I didn't tell her, though.

Zhaban. We have no time, Laris.

Let's talk.

00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:29,958
My name is Soji.

445
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:32,700
I'm working with Hugh on
the reclamation project.

446
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:35,355
But I'm an anthropologist
by training.

447
00:30:52,763 --> 00:30:54,853
Ramdha has good days
and bad days.

448
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:56,680
We all do.

449
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:01,163
Can you tell me about
the cards, Ramdha?

450
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:02,773
The pixmit?

451
00:31:02,817 --> 00:31:03,905
How do they work?

452
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:05,472
Do you tell
fortunes with them?

453
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,779
It's kind of a mandala,

454
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:09,998
is that it?

455
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:17,832
Do the images have a connection
to Romulan mythology?

456
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,878
"Mythology"?

457
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:22,315
I hate that word.

458
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:24,926
In Romulan,
we have no such word.

459
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,015
What's a
better word?

460
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,712
Scriptures?

461
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:31,280
Sacred stories?
Legendarium?

462
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:32,934
The news.

463
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:37,678
I love that.

464
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:38,984
That's perfect.

465
00:31:40,594 --> 00:31:44,119
The idea that former Borg might
be able to create a mythol...

466
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:46,121
a shared narrative
framework

467
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:47,949
for understanding
their trauma,

468
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:50,256
rooted in deep
archetypes

469
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:52,823
but as relevant
as the day's news.

470
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:55,261
That's just
what I'm hoping to do.

471
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:02,833
I know you.

472
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:08,100
Why is the Tal Shiar
on Earth?

473
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:10,885
Are you Zhat Vash?

474
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,932
If you answer
my questions,

475
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:16,108
I will release you.

476
00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:20,721
This is pointless. LARIS: Yes,

477
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:23,245
because he's a...
stubborn northerner, like you.

478
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:29,643
I remember you from tomorrow.

479
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:33,690
No, Ramdha.
We've never met.

480
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,868
Okay, wh...

481
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:40,219
what was I doing
when you met me tomorrow?

482
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:49,315
One of the things that makes you
so special, Ramdha,

483
00:32:49,358 --> 00:32:51,839
is that you were on board
the very last ship

484
00:32:51,882 --> 00:32:54,189
ever assimilated by this cube.

485
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:56,800
Is that true?
How do you know that?

486
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:59,673
You were on board the
Imperial scout ship Shaenor

487
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:01,849
with 25 other
passengers.

488
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:04,765
You encountered this cube.
You were assimilated.

489
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:06,767
But then something
went wrong.

490
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:16,472
What happened, Ramdha?
Do you know?

491
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:18,648
What caused the
submatrix collapse?

492
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:23,784
Why did you kill that girl?

493
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:25,699
Why did you kill Dahj Asha?

494
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:27,657
She's not a girl.

495
00:33:29,746 --> 00:33:31,052
Which one are you?

496
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:32,619
Just help me

497
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:35,709
understand

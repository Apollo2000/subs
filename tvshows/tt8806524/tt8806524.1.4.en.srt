00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:35,496
It's usually
a sad story.

494
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:37,019
He died.

495
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,807
He gave his life
to save mine,

496
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,461
and I have missed him
ever since.

497
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:46,463
Did you ever miss me?

498
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:48,509
Of course I did.

499
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:52,861
Continue.

500
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:56,125
Well, recently,
I've learned that Data...

501
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:58,388
this is complicated...

502
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:01,478
that Data had
two offspring.

503
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:04,438
And one of them...
her name was "Dahj"...

504
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:06,657
was murdered in front of me.

505
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:09,008
The other one, I believe,
is in serious danger.

506
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:11,793
And I have to find her
before the Tal Shiar do.

507
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:14,796
The Tal Shiar? Yes.

508
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,755
And this other sister...
is she an android?

509
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,495
Mm-hmm.

510
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,802
You told me stories
about Data.

511
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:22,891
He had an orange
cat named Spot.

512
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:25,546
[laughs]:
That's right.

513
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:27,548
I've still never
seen a cat.

514
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:29,680
Well, if you come with us,

515
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:32,422
you might just run across
one or two of them.

516
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:34,424
Why do you need me?

517
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:37,950
Because I failed
to protect her sister.

518
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:40,517
But you don't know where she is
or if she's even alive.

519
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:42,650
No.What about the man
who built her?

520
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:44,826
It's just a guess. Are you being pursued?

521
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,655
Likely.

522
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:49,831
Anticipated, actually.

523
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:52,703
All that is
why you need someone.

524
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:56,533
Why do you need me?

525
00:29:58,492 --> 00:30:00,929
Because I'm an old man
and you're a young one,

526
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:02,496
and you're strong.

527
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:05,151
Zani told me that

528
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:09,155
you are one of the best fighters
that she has ever seen.

529
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:11,984
It seems to me
that my quest

530
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:15,465
has the appropriate criterion.

531
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,424
Will you come with me?

532
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:21,080
Will you bind your sword
to my quest?

533
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:24,692
Now that you have use for me?

534
00:30:24,735 --> 00:30:26,781
Now that I have value to you?

535
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,652
You left me

536
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:30,872
on my own, old man. I never meant to...

537
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,656
I see no reason
not to do the same.

538
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,702
Elnor, it...!

539
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:43,015
PICARD:
Rios, it's Picard.

540
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,843
I'm ready for transport.

541
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,453
RIOS:
Copy that.

542
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:48,759
Next window opens
in seven minutes.

543
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:51,850
[crowd chattering]

544
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:20,443
[crowd quiets, murmurs]

545
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:54,782
[clears throat]

546
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:00,396
[speaking Romulan]

547
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:11,146
You may call me
gTenqem Adrev.

548
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,887
We met before.

549
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,671
Once.

550
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:17,413
Have we? Forgive me. I, uh...

551
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:19,459
Oh, it was
in another lifetime,

552
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:22,549
when I was another man.

553
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:25,682
A Romulan senator,
if you can believe it.

554
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:28,033
I had the honor
of being present

555
00:32:28,076 --> 00:32:30,600
the day you addressed
the Hall of State,

556
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:33,647
the very embodiment
of Starfleet,

557
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,346
making such eloquent
and generous promises

558
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,480
on behalf of
the magnanimous Federation.

559
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:42,961
The great Saint Picard.

560
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:44,397
Senator...

561
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,442
I found it
extremely moving.

562
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:49,445
How very touched we all were.

563
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:52,492
There were tears
in my eyes.

564
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:54,494
Thank you.

565
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,626
And then you went away.

566
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,978
And when you returned,
you brought the ships.

567
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:04,721
Those great big
Wallenberg-class transports.

568
00:33:04,765 --> 00:33:08,073
We all packed
and boarded the Nightingale,

569
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:10,684
five generations of parents
and grandparents,

570
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:13,556
siblings and spouses
and children.

571
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,038
And the Nightingale
brought us here,

572
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:19,432
to Vashti.

573
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:22,826
We had so little time.

574
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:27,092
There were so many of you
to save.

575
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:29,790
And so little to be expected
from Starfleet.

576
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,966
I did everything I could.

577
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,446
And then you gave up.

578
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:34,664
[sighs]

579
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,449
Skantal!

580
00:33:36,492 --> 00:33:38,364
Bidran!

581
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:50,724
No one asked
for your pity, Picard.

582
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:53,118
Just as no one asked
for your help.

583
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:55,685
You and Starfleet
had no understanding

584
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:58,949
of Romulan ingenuity, resolve,
self-sufficiency.

585
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:00,995
You took advantage of us
at the very moment

586
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,649
where we doubted
ourselves,

587
00:34:02,692 --> 00:34:04,477
enticed us
with your empty promises,

588
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,000
and did everything in your power

589
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,785
to scatter,
confuse and divide us.

590
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:10,831
That is not so!

591
00:34:12,006 --> 00:34:13,660
I promise you...

592
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:15,662
You promise?!

593
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:17,533
[quietly]:
You promise?

594
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:21,581
Give him your sword.

595
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:27,369
No.

596
00:34:30,894 --> 00:34:33,419
[grunting]

597
00:34:33,462 --> 00:34:34,855
ADREV:
Come on.

598
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,690
[grunting]

599
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,999
No!

600
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:50,044
ELNOR:
Please, my friend.

601
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:54,918
Choose to live.

602
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:58,357
[Adrev yells]

603
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:05,929
[crowd gasps, murmurs]

604
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:09,933
I regret your choice.

605
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:28,474
Enough, Elnor.

606
00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:33,522
The Federation
has failed you all.

607
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:37,439
I failed you all.

608
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:41,400
I... broke faith with you,

609
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:45,447
and the result was

610
00:35:45,491 --> 00:35:47,623
terrible...

611
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:52,411
pain and loss for you all.

612
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:56,502
And I am sorry.

613
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:05,554
RIOS [over comm]:
Picard, ready for transport.

614
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:08,775
A tan qalanq
is no match

615
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:10,646
for a disruptor,
sisterboy. RAFFI: JL?

616
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,431
Yes! Now!

617
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:20,569
That man did not
deserve to die.

618
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:22,441
Yet he chose it.
Fight a Qowat Milat,

619
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:24,007
and the outcome
is not in doubt.

620
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:26,662
Now, you listen
to me, carefully.

621
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:28,925
I will benefit
by your skill and your courage,

622
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:31,014
but if you bind yourself
to my cause,

623
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:34,496
I will tell you when to fight
and when to refrain.

624
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,411
Is that understood?

625
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:38,805
Yes.

626
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:40,459
Swear it.

627
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:42,069
I swear.

628
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:53,515
Dr. Jurati, Raffi,
this is Elnor.

629
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:57,824
A boy with a stick.

630
00:36:57,867 --> 00:37:00,348
I have to ask you,
what made you decide

631
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:02,742
to bind yourself
to my cause?

632
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:05,745
It met the requirements
for worthiness.

633
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:08,443
And it seemed like
you needed me after all.

634
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:10,532
What is the requirement
for worthiness?

635
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:12,795
A qalankhkai would
only bind herself...

636
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,841
himself... to a lost cause.

637
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:24,503
[groaning softly]

638
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:36,689
What?

639
00:37:36,732 --> 00:37:38,908
Did you think
it was your robot friend?

640
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:44,523
I take it she's
anatomically correct.

641
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:46,481
[chuckles]

642
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:47,787
[sighs]

643
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,832
It makes perfect sense.

644
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:52,792
You've been studying her kind
your whole adult life.

645
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:54,576
Waiting for her.

646
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,535
Planning for her.

647
00:37:56,578 --> 00:38:00,452
Wondering what it would be like
when you finally saw her.

648
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:02,802
Now here she is.

649
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:04,804
Why is she obsessed with Ramdha?

650
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:07,067
What happened when the cube
assimilated the Shaenor?

651
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,852
Why did its crew and passengers
lose their minds?

652
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:11,593
Who were they?

653
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:14,727
What have you accomplished
on my behalf?

654
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:17,860
I've planted
the first seed of doubt.

655
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:19,688
Really?

656
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:22,038
One whole seed.

657
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:24,084
Impressive. I know

658
00:38:24,127 --> 00:38:25,694
how to handle her.

659
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:29,132
If I press her too hard,
it might activate her.

660
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:31,526
And then we'll have another
situation like on Earth,

661
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,875
and then they'll both be dead.

662
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,442
That is the goal, you know.

663
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:35,791
To kill them.

664
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:37,619
Yes, all of them.

665
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:39,795
Which is something I can't do

666
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,450
until we find out
where she came from

667
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:44,713
and where the rest of them are.

668
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:47,716
And in the meantime...

669
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,937
you slide ever deeper
into your own obsession.

670
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:55,071
Have you entertained
for even a moment

671
00:38:55,115 --> 00:38:58,379
that she might be the one
handling you?

672
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:03,428
She was sent to this cube
for a reason.

673
00:39:04,777 --> 00:39:07,475
Your little robot girl
has a plan.

674
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:10,043
Don't forget that.

675
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:11,740
I know full well...

676
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:13,786
Who is she, Narek?

677
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:24,449
Who...

678
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:26,015
is she?

679
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:34,763
Seb-Cheneb.

680
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:38,506
The Destroyer.

681
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,380
[panting]

682
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:52,390
I'll give you and your seed
one more week.

683
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:56,045
After that,
if I don't have the location,

684
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,960
we go back to good old...

685
00:39:58,004 --> 00:39:59,788
pain and violence.

RIOS: That old heap's
targeting system is primitive,

693
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,169
but the planetary security net
worries me.

694
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:35,563
Just get us the
hell out of here.

JURATI:
Can you go faster

698
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,708
than that Bird-of-Prey?
Maybe not outrun him,

699
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:52,145
but I can definitely outfly him.
We-we should be...

Trying to get a read.

No ID,

00:41:55,425 --> 00:41:56,688
no transponder.

709
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:59,473
Great timing, though.

That pilot's hailing us, JL.

713
00:42:20,189 --> 00:42:21,539
Open a channel.

Open the channel.
Put him on.

00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:30,591
He's asking permission
to beam over.

718
00:42:30,635 --> 00:42:31,940
His ship's breaking up.

Nah, too risky.

721
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:35,640
His shields are failing.

722
00:42:35,683 --> 00:42:36,902
Raffi, beam him in,

723
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:38,686
directly here. Do it.

724

Elnor.

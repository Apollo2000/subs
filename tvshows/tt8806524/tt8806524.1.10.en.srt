00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,893
Like, if I use it too much,
it's gonna...

167
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,893
Like, if I use it too much,
it's gonna...

168
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,145
eat my soul.
RAFFI:
Well, luckily,

169
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,646
you don't have a soul, so...

170
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,773
(chuckles)

171
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,773
(chuckles)

172
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,111
But what does it do?
Like, how do I even...

173
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,111
But what does it do?
Like, how do I even...

174
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,071
Well, when Saga gave it to me,
she said,

175
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,449
"You have to use
your imagination."

176
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,826
Oh, she said that, did she?

177
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,826
Mm-hmm.

178
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,826
Oh, she said that, did she?

179
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,826
Mm-hmm.

180
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,328
Well, I don't have
one of those, either.

181
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,663
Okay, well, Chris,
this is your ship.

182
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,123
You know what's wrong with it.

183
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,123
You know what's wrong with it.

184
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,709
It's not too complicated.

185
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,795
Now, the intermix reactor
is fused.

186
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,004
I need to unfuse it,

187
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,004
I need to unfuse it,

188
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,340
which is impossible.

189
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,342
I need to replace it,
but the maintenance replicator

190
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,679
is off-line because...
the intermix reactor

191
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,679
is off-line because...
the intermix reactor

192
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,556
is fused.
Mm.

193
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,809
Well, just, you know,
give it a try.

194
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,809
Well, just, you know,
give it a try.

195
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,355
Okay. Fine, I'll do it.
I got a lot of imagination.

196
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,982
To you, everything's a hammer.

197
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,982
To you, everything's a hammer.

198
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,984
No. I'll do it.

199
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,829
T-There's no kind
of trigger or-or switch.

200
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,829
T-There's no kind
of trigger or-or switch.

201
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,833
Hmm. Well, maybe what-what
she meant was

202
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,833
Hmm. Well, maybe what-what
she meant was

203
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,377
you have to imagine the fix.

204
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,212
Have you been, um,

205
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,589
hitting the horgl again?
(chuckles)

206
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,589
hitting the horgl again?
(chuckles)

207
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,384
Visualize that it's
no longer fused.

208
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,886
You know, see the hole
patching itself.

209
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,886
You know, see the hole
patching itself.

210
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,393
(exhales)

211
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,393
(exhales)

212
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,563
(chiming)

213
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,232
Whoa.

214
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,232
Whoa.

215
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,734
Ay, caramba.

216
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,988
Uh, what's happening?

217
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,988
Uh, what's happening?

218
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,908
Nothing that makes any sense.

219
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,750
(chuckles)
(sighs)

220
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,750
(chuckles)
(sighs)

221
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,586
Say it.
Say what?

222
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,422
Mm, those three beautiful words.

223
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,422
Mm, those three beautiful words.

224
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,551
You were right.
Mm, just one more time.

225
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,760
Piss off.

226
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,928
(clattering)

227
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,928
(clattering)

228
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,433
I know that sound.

229
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,108
ALTAN:
All of Bruce's work

230
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,193
on the downloading
of consciousness

231
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,280
into a synthetic body
should be on that machine.

232
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,280
into a synthetic body
should be on that machine.

233
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,574
Let's hope so.
We don't have much time.

234
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,409
Mm-hmm.

235
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,287
You know...
(exhales)

236
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,287
You know...
(exhales)

237
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:49,626
This really is a remarkable act
of self-sacrifice on your part.

238
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:49,626
This really is a remarkable act
of self-sacrifice on your part.

239
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,086
But I suppose

240
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,797
that's what mothers do,
isn't it?

241
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,797
that's what mothers do,
isn't it?

242
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,095
(door whooshes shut)

243
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,095
(door whooshes shut)

244
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,806
(quietly):
It's okay. It'll be okay.

245
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,809
You can do this.
You have to do this.

246
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,809
You can do this.
You have to do this.

247
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,608
I'm not their mother, asshole.

248
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,608
I'm not their mother, asshole.

249
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,860
RIOS:
Someone's throwing rocks
at my ship.

250
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,613
The abusive Romulan boyfriend.

251
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,613
The abusive Romulan boyfriend.

252
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,114
Comms.

253
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,659
RIOS:
Go ahead, throw it.

254
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,286
I want to see what a photon
torpedo can do at this range.

255
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,286
I want to see what a photon
torpedo can do at this range.

256
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,664
I have 12 wide-dispersion

257
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,874
molecular solvent
grenade canisters.

258
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,878
I'm throwing rocks.

259
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,421
What do you want?

260
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,965
And don't think we won't
kick your ass, dirtbag,

261
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,965
And don't think we won't
kick your ass, dirtbag,

262
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,717
because we will.
Raff.

263
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,344
What are you doing here,
snakehead?

264
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,262
Trying to save the universe.

265
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,262
Trying to save the universe.

266
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,017
We can keep fighting,
or we can work together.

267
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,017
We can keep fighting,
or we can work together.

268
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,352
Stop what's coming for us.

269
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,522
It's your call.

270
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,364
JL. JL, come in.

271
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,364
JL. JL, come in.

272
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,157
Damn it.

273
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,576
NAREK:
They are building
some kind of transmitter.

274
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,162
They are signaling something

275
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,162
They are signaling something

276
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,206
to come here.
To do what?

277
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,457
We believe

278
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,376
synthetics are fated to destroy

279
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,376
synthetics are fated to destroy

280
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,711
all organic life.

281
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,462
We call it Ganmadan.

282
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,589
The place is on lockdown.

283
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,589
The place is on lockdown.

284
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,924
Whatever that
transmitter is,

285
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,551
they don't want anyone
interfering with it.

286
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,137
(laughs softly)
The thing about Picard is...

287
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,137
(laughs softly)
The thing about Picard is...

288
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,514
Yeah. Interfering
is definitely his thing.

289
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,391
Try him again.

290
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,769
JL, come in.

291
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,769
JL, come in.

292
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,398
Admiral Jean-Luc Picard,
retired.

293
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,858
Damn it.
I told you.

294
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,858
Damn it.
I told you.

295
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,234
They won't respond.

296
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,069
The synthetics have
jammed all comms.

297
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,780
Feldor stam torret.

298
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,780
Feldor stam torret.

299
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

300
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,744
I do. I very much

301
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,537
choose to live.
Hold up, kid.

302
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,537
choose to live.
Hold up, kid.

303
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,205
We disarmed him, searched him.

304
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,332
We may very well
have a common enemy

305
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,168
coming for us. You're
gonna want to hear

306
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,168
coming for us. You're
gonna want to hear

307
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,420
what he came here
to say.

308
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,599
Altan, I...

309
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,059
What are you doing?

310
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,936
I'm transferring Saga's memories
into a V-module.

311
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,936
I'm transferring Saga's memories
into a V-module.

312
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,564
As a memento for Arcana.

313
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,108
But the damage
to her optical processors

314
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,108
But the damage
to her optical processors

315
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,569
corrupted
the data stream and...

316
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,988
Do you need something?

317
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,281
Yes, I've been, um,

318
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,281
Yes, I've been, um,

319
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,450
I've been working on the
neural lace for your golem,

320
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,243
but some of the files
are encrypted.

321
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,247
And Bruce always said that your
crypto kung fu was the best.

322
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,247
And Bruce always said that your
crypto kung fu was the best.

323
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,083
Well... (chuckles)

324
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,127
Uh, okay, I'll, uh, see if
I can get into those files.

325
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,127
Uh, okay, I'll, uh, see if
I can get into those files.

How do you feel about Ganmadan?

Because if we waste

The story of Ganmadan begins
with two sisters.

362
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:53,870
Twin khalagu.

363
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,079
Demons.

364
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,079
Demons.

365
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,666
Twin demons who come
at the end of time

366
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,209
to open the way
and unleash the ch'khalagu.

367
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,209
to open the way
and unleash the ch'khalagu.

368
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,212
Very bad demons.

369
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,212
One sister

370
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,047
is called Seb Natan,
the Foreteller.

371
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,676
She plays a drum made
from the skin of children.

She plays a drum made
from the skin of children.

373
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,012
She strikes it
with a chain of skulls,

374
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,306
so hard and so long

375
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,306
so hard and so long

376
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,641
that her heart bursts
from the effort.

377
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,310
Mm.

378
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,772
The other sister
is called Seb Cheneb.
Seb Cheneb?

379
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,900
Yeah, see,
w-we know about her.

380
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,401
So you know that
she carries a horn

381
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,401
So you know that
she carries a horn

382
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,321
from a great pale hellbeast
called Ganmadan.

383
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,656
You know when she
blows a blast on the horn,

384
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,656
You know when she
blows a blast on the horn,

385
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,034
it will unleash
all the ch'khalagu

386
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,119
who have been waiting since
the beginning of time.

387
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,371
You know the sky will crack,

388
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,371
You know the sky will crack,

389
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,373
and through the
crack in the sky

390
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,334
the <i>ch'khalagu
</i>will come ravening.

391
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,212
You know about the
Thousand Days of Pain.

392
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,212
You know about the
Thousand Days of Pain.

393
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,755
You know the streets
will be slick

394
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,090
with entrails
of half-devoured corpses.

395
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,090
with entrails
of half-devoured corpses.

396
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,135
You know
the worlds will burn,

397
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,512
and the ch'khalagu will feast,

398
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,932
and nurse their brats
on blood,

399
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,932
and nurse their brats
on blood,

400
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,934
and pick their teeth with bones.

401
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,770
No, we did not know any of that.

402
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,770
No, we did not know any of that.

403
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,105
But, I mean, do you really...

404
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,942
you really believe
this is a-a prophecy?

405
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,985
No.

406
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,985
No.

407
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,904
I believe it's history.

408
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:16,160
And the fascinating thing
about history is...

409
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,913
it always repeats itself.

410
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,913
it always repeats itself.

Oh! Hey. Hi.

RIOS:
And how are we gonna do that?

431
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,847
By bringing them
the Romulan secret agent

432
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,348
that killed their beloved Saga.

433

Sounds like we need
a delivery system.

Sounds like we need

Your weapons?

Oh, of course.

It's stable?

Until it's detonated.

Except in metal, so the

Oh. Certainly.

You bet.

456
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,259
You bet.

457
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,261
And with the transporter block
the synths have in place,

458
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,055
we can't beam anything
in or out.

459
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,723
So, we'll need
a way to conceal it.

460
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,723
So, we'll need
a way to conceal it.

461
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,190
Do you play?

462
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,484
Oh, I love the game.
RAFFI: Ha.

463
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,069
All right, let's go.

464
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,069
All right, let's go.

465
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,071

Admiral Picard. Hello?

470
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,959
Are you...

471
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,959
Still here.

472
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,252
Okay.

473
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,252
Okay.

474
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,088
They're about
to power up the beacon.

475
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,715
We have to hurry.

476
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,092
What is this?

477
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,092
What is this?

478
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,551
I'm busting you out.

479
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,306
I honestly thought I was
the worst secret agent ever,

480

I honestly thought I was

Back to La Sirena.

Come on, we've got to move

490
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,931
on the superluminal tuner
at the base.

491
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,642
RAFFI:
How are we gonna get up there
without being seen?

492
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,642
RAFFI:
How are we gonna get up there
without being seen?

493
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,477
An excellent question.

494
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,483
JURATI: <i>I guess they
went looking for us?</i>

495
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,651
We'll worry about that later.

496
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,153
Status report on the Romulans.

497
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,153
Status report on the Romulans.

498
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,196
Uh...

499
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,196
Come on, Doctor.

500
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,953
Uh, the attack wing is
seven minutes from planetfall.

501
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,496
Any sign of Starfleet?

502
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,790
No, but even if your
message got through,

503
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,790
No, but even if your
message got through,

504
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,333
they'd still be
behind the Romulans.

505
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,044
We've got to find a way
to stall them somehow.

506
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,044
We've got to find a way
to stall them somehow.

507
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,630
And, of course, hope that
the Federation arrives.

508
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,674
Yeah? And then?

509
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,385
I mean, say we do find a way
to hold off the Romulans.

510
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,385
I mean, say we do find a way
to hold off the Romulans.

511
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,761
We save Soji.

512
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,972
Now she and the golden children
are free to call up

513
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,516
the uber-synths,
and then vapor and ash.

514
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,516
the uber-synths,
and then vapor and ash.

515
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,768
A galactic-level biocidal event.

516
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,395
Well, clearly,
we've got to stop them, too!

517
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,063
They've left us behind, Picard.

518
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,063
They've left us behind, Picard.

519
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,857
They're generations beyond us.

520
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,859
In one sense, yes.

521
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,613
But in another, as you said,
they are children.

522
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,613
But in another, as you said,
they are children.

523
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,364
And until now,
the only teachers

524
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,533
that they've had
are a couple of hermits.

525
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,533
that they've had
are a couple of hermits.

526
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,368
And the fear of extermination.

527
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,622
But fear is
an incompetent teacher.

528
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,041
Yes. They have life.

529
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,041
Yes. They have life.

530
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,377
But no one is teaching them
what it's for.

531
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,255
To be alive is a responsibility.

532
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,255
To be alive is a responsibility.

533
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,549
As well as a right.

534
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,549
How are they

535
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,426
supposed to learn
that lesson in...

536
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,426
supposed to learn
that lesson in...

537
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,720
six minutes and 11 seconds?

538
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,014
The way that children
learn most things.

539
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,852
By example.

540
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,438
Now...

541
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,438
Now...

542
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:58,359
let's see how closely
I was watching Rios.

543
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,237
(whirring)

544
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,237
(whirring)

545
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,868
All right.

546
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,287
Make it so.

547
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,762
SUTRA:
Brothers and sisters,

548
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,306
as soon as the beacon is
at full capacity,

549
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,434
we will begin transmitting.
And once the signal is received,

550
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,434
we will begin transmitting.
And once the signal is received,

551
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,602
a portal will open

552
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,437
and our liberators will be here

553
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,439
nearly instantaneously.

554
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,439
nearly instantaneously.

555
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,275
(exhales)
And then we'll be free.

556
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,070
Watch them.

557
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,070
Watch them.

558
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,624
I wanted to return this to you.

559
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,624
I wanted to return this to you.

560
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,128
You reasoned correctly

561
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,422
that your fellow synthetics
needed persuading.

562
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,422
that your fellow synthetics
needed persuading.

563
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,967
An emotional jolt to drive them
to the decision

564
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,468
you wanted them to make.

565
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,468
you wanted them to make.

566
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,928
To build the beacon.

567
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,723
I'm glad you see the
reason behind my actions.

568
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,141
I do.

569
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,141
I do.

570
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,644
But reason isn't everything.

571
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,814
How could you help that Romulan
kill your sister?

572
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,814
How could you help that Romulan
kill your sister?

573
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,650
I thought I taught you
better than this.

574
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,655
Turns out...

575
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,158
you're no better than we are.

576
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,371
(whistles)

577
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,466
Ah, come on.

578
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,551
Move, mija, move.

579
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:51,180
JURATI:
So, how do we hold off

580
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,849
218 Warbirds till Starfleet
gets here?

581
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,809
If they get here.

582
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,809
If they get here.

583
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,397
Are you not answering
to build suspense, or...?

584
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,397
Are you not answering
to build suspense, or...?

585
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,025
At the present moment,
Dr. Jurati,

586
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,777
I am trying to pilot a starship

587
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,196
for the first time
in a very long time,

588
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,196
for the first time
in a very long time,

589
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,199
without exploding or crashing!

590
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,992
If that is all right with you.

591
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,661
No, totally, good call.

592
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,661
No, totally, good call.

593
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,829
One impossible thing at a time.

594
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,506
(grunting) Soji!

595
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,506
(grunting) Soji!

596
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,800
Please!
You don't have to do this!

597
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,052
Soji! Please!

598
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,052
Soji! Please!

599
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,845
You're making a mistake!

600
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,892
(beeping rapidly)

601
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,892
(beeping rapidly)

602
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,606
(beeping accelerating)

603
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,606
(beeping accelerating)

604
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,614
Soji!

605
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,075
(grunting)

606
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,913
COMPUTER VOICE:
Launch detected.

607
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,165
Attempting to acquire
weapons lock.

608
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,165
Attempting to acquire
weapons lock.

609
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,254
Drop your weapon.

610
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,755
Over the edge.

611
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,755
Over the edge.

612
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,426
Step away from the console.

613
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,263
I'm unarmed.

614
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,263
Oh.

615
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:17,766
I seriously doubt that.

616
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,935
You know, you're rather pretty.

617
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,935
You know, you're rather pretty.

618
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,478
Or would be.

619
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,897
If you weren't
a disgusting half-meat.

620
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,566
(grunting)

621
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,566
(grunting)

622
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,036
Incoming warp signatures.

623
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,080
Wouldn't happen
to be Starfleet, would it?

624
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,925
ROMULAN OFFICER:
General, they appear to be
concentrated in one settlement.

625
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,970
Sterilize the entire planet.

626
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,970
Sterilize the entire planet.

627
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,264
(alarm blaring)

628
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,988
Here come the orchids.

629
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,988
Here come the orchids.

630
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,990
Let's see how much time
they can buy us.

631
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,929
(grunting)

632
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,929
(grunting)

633
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,645
Sad Queen Annika.

634
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,645
Sad Queen Annika.

635
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,687
Six years old,

636
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,482
and all she got for her birthday
was assimilated.

637
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,482
and all she got for her birthday
was assimilated.

638
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:49,691
(grunts)

639
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,859
(beeping)

640
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,656
(beeping continues)

641
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,656
(beeping continues)

642
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,537
Why didn't you just
put a phaser to your head

643
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,537
Why didn't you just
put a phaser to your head

644
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,955
and get it over with?

645
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,165
Because I still had this
to live for.

646
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,542
This...

647
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,542
This...

648
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,877
is for Hugh.
(screaming)

649
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,404
Now might be a good time
to reveal the secret plan.

650
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,866
Once these orchids have had it,

651
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,325
there will still be
200 Romulan warships

652
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,743
and only one of us.

653
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,453
If you figure out a way
to get us out of this one,

654
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,453
If you figure out a way
to get us out of this one,

655
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,330
they'll name it after you.

656
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,999
Picard Maneuver.

657
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,459
Wait, no, t-- No, that's
actually a thing, isn't it?

658
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,459
Wait, no, t-- No, that's
actually a thing, isn't it?

659
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,587
You made it look

660
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,589
like the Enterprise was
in two places at once.

661
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:54,798
It was the Stargazer,

662
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:54,798
It was the Stargazer,

663
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,175
and it was a long time ago.

664
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,928
It would be useless
against so many enemy vessels.

665
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,185
We'd have to multiply
the sensor images

666
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,185
We'd have to multiply
the sensor images

667
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,188
and then find some way
to disperse them.

668
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,191
Like an ancient warplane
scattering bits of mirror

669
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,191
Like an ancient warplane
scattering bits of mirror

670
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,610
to overwhelm
a radar system.

671
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,278
Yeah, how the hell
will we do that?

672
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,363
If only we had some kind

673
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,363
If only we had some kind

674
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,032
of wacky fundamental
field replicator

675
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,409
with a neurocotamic interface.

676
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,662
(echoing):
Look at my face.

677
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,662
(echoing):
Look at my face.

678
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,631
Picard, what are you doing?

679
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,966
Soji, I want you to reconsider

680
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,966
Soji, I want you to reconsider

681
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,969
your present course of action
and power down the beacon.

682
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,679
You know that's not
going to happen.

683
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,679
You know that's not
going to happen.

684
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,306
I... have something

685
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,475
I want to give you
and your people.

686
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,062
And... I hope it will
change your mind.

687
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,062
And... I hope it will
change your mind.

688
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,690
And what's that?

689
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,234
My life.

690
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,819
Picard out.

691
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,997
(alert whooping)

692
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,670
OFFICER:
<i>Orbital defenses
neutralized, General.</i>

693
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,670
OFFICER:
<i>Orbital defenses
neutralized, General.</i>

694
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:19,257
All ships, target
the abomination's nest.

695
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:19,257
All ships, target
the abomination's nest.

696
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,557
Ready? And they'll all have
warp signatures?

697
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,557
Ready? And they'll all have
warp signatures?

698
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,892
On my mark.

699
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,191
What is that?

700
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,191
What is that?

701
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,651
OFFICER:
Unknown vessel.

702
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,819
Scanning now.

703
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,699
Ignore it.

704
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:47,703
Ready planetary sterilization
pattern number five.

705
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,204
Agnes, now.

706
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,204
Agnes, now.

707
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,664
Now, now!

708
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,133
General, there are
hundreds of them.

709
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,133
General, there are
hundreds of them.

710
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,469
Reposition disruptors.
Engage them.

711
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,026
(metal creaking)

712
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,026
(metal creaking)

713
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,570
No!

714
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,374
(high-pitched ringing)

715
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,043
(heart beating)

716
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,043
(heart beating)

717
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,045
(panting)

718
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,422
(echoing):
Picard, are you
all right?

719
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,715
(beeping)

720
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,759
Oh, no.

721
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,759
Oh, no.

722
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,280
They have activated the beacon.

723
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,908
Resume sterilization
targeting pattern.

724
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,908
Resume sterilization
targeting pattern.

725
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,205
On my command.

726
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,205
On my command.

727
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,804
They're here.

728
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,806
Admiral, you did it.

729
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,806
Admiral, you did it.

730
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,809
OFFICER:
General,

731
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,393
their flagship
is hailing us.

732
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,479
Acting Captain Will Riker

733
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,479
Acting Captain Will Riker

734
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,482
in command of the USS <i>Zheng He.
</i>And?

735
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,317
And it is my duty to inform you

736
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,317
And it is my duty to inform you

737
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,152
that the United Federation
of Planets has designated

738
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,863
Planet Ghulion IV
in the Vayt Sector

739
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,616
as under the protection
of Starfleet.

740
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,616
as under the protection
of Starfleet.

741
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,993
According to the terms
of the Treaty of Algeron.

742
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,872
Too late. Our claim to this
world takes precedence.

743
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,872
Too late. Our claim to this
world takes precedence.

744
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,624
Move aside.
Afraid not.

745
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:02,337
I have a priority request
to open diplomatic negotiations

746
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:02,337
I have a priority request
to open diplomatic negotiations

747
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,841
and protection for
the inhabitants of Ghulion IV.

748
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,843
RIKER:
General or Commodore

749
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,843
RIKER:
General or Commodore

750
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,678
or whatever
you're calling yourself,

751
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,347
right now I'm on the bridge
of the toughest, fastest,

752
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,347
right now I'm on the bridge
of the toughest, fastest,

753
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:16,184
most powerful ship Starfleet
has ever put into service.

754
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,145
And I've got a fleet
of them at my back.

755
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,145
And I've got a fleet
of them at my back.

756
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,647
We've got our phasers locked
on your warp course.

757
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,859
And nothing would make me
happier than you giving me

758
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:28,196
an excuse to kick
your treacherous Tal Shiar ass.

759
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:28,196
an excuse to kick
your treacherous Tal Shiar ass.

760
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:32,701
But instead,
I'm going to ask you one time

761
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:32,701
But instead,
I'm going to ask you one time

762
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,870
to stand down.

763
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:39,541
OFFICER:
General. Your orders?

764
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,210
Retarget weapons systems.

765
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,210
Retarget weapons systems.

766
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,212
Prepare to fight.

767
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,477
Weapons hot, deflectors to full.

768
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,862
(faint trilling)

769
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,699
Picard?

770
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,699
Picard?

771
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,910
(grunting)

772
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,912
(trilling stops)

773
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,916
I know.

774
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,918
(panting)

775
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,545
(mutters)

776
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,145
I have to speak

777
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,145
I have to speak

778
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,397
with Soji

779
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,775
on an open channel.

780
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,693
You're in no shape.

781
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,693
You're in no shape.

782
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,947
Get me some polisinephrine.

783
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,573
20cc.
No.

784
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,991
I-I...
It will only

785
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,991
I-I...
It will only

786
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,952
hasten the inevitable.

787
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,829
Do it.

788
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,164
(sighs)

789
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,164
(sighs)

790
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,922
(exhales)

791
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,757
(pants softly)

792
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,759
Open the channel.

793
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,759
Open the channel.

794
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:13,843
Now.

795
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,304
Picard...

796
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,848
Soji. Please,

797
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,848
Soji. Please,

798
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,642
power down the beacon.

799
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:27,607
Show them how profoundly wrong
they are about you.

800
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:27,607
Show them how profoundly wrong
they are about you.

801
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,986
You're not the enemy.
You're not the Destroyer.

802
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,986
You're not the enemy.
You're not the Destroyer.

803
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,612
If that doesn't convince them,

804
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,823
then they will have to answer
to the Federation.

805
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,408
The same Federation
that banned us

806
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,408
The same Federation
that banned us

807
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,201
and threw us on the scrap heap?

808
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,996
If we wanted
to destroy you, Soji,

809
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,872
we would've joined forces
with the Romulans.

810
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,872
we would've joined forces
with the Romulans.

811
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,500
We would be training our phasers
on you right now.

812
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,043
We aren't. We won't.

813
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,962
You know why?

814
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,962
You know why?

815
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:53,049
Because we trust you
to make the right choice.

816
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,636
I trust you, Soji. I know you.

00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:30,251
I'm aware that I
was killed in 2379,

984
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:30,251
I'm aware that I
was killed in 2379,

985
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:33,004
but I have no memory
of my death.

986
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,922
My consciousness exists

987
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,467
in a massively complex
quantum reconstruction,

988
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,467
in a massively complex
quantum reconstruction,

989
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,220
made from a copy
of the memories I downloaded

990
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,389
into B4, just before I died.

991
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,389
into B4, just before I died.

992
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:47,226
You don't remember your death?
I can't forget it.

993
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,938
Apparently, I ended
my existence

994
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,938
Apparently, I ended
my existence

995
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,232
in the hope of
prolonging yours.

996
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,360
That's right.
Before I had even grasped

997
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,360
That's right.
Before I had even grasped

998
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,029
the nature of our predicament,

999
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,406
you had conceived
and executed it.

1000
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,406
you had conceived
and executed it.

1001
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,616
I was furious.

1002
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,826
My apologies, Captain.

1003
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,370
But I am not certain
I could have done otherwise.

1004
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,370
But I am not certain
I could have done otherwise.

1005
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,456
True. That might have been

1006
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:12,293
the most Data thing
you ever did.

1007
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:12,293
the most Data thing
you ever did.

1008
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,921
I always wished
that I could have said

1009
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:19,842
I was sorry that
it was you and not me.

1010
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:19,842
I was sorry that
it was you and not me.

1011
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:24,805
Captain, do you
regret sacrificing

1012
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:24,805
Captain, do you
regret sacrificing

1013
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,974
your life for Soji
and her people?

1014
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,142
Not for an instant.

1015
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,977
Then why would you
imagine I regret

1016
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,480
sacrificing mine for yours?

1017
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,480
sacrificing mine for yours?

1018
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,650
Ah.

1019
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,236
PICARD:
Did you say all this
was a simulation?

1020
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,236
PICARD:
Did you say all this
was a simulation?

1021
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,281
DATA:
Yes, sir.
An extremely sophisticated one.

1022
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,281
DATA:
Yes, sir.
An extremely sophisticated one.

1023
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,700
My memory
engrams were extracted

1024
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,120
from a single neuron
salvaged by Bruce Maddox,

1025
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,120
from a single neuron
salvaged by Bruce Maddox,

1026
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,707
and then my consciousness was
reconstructed by my brother,

1027
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,501
Dr. Altan Soong.

1028
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,670
I don't much care for him.

1029
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,670
I don't much care for him.

1030
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:59,423
Mm. The Soongs can be...

1031
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,469
I believe the phrase is
"an acquired taste."

1032
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,469
I believe the phrase is
"an acquired taste."

1033
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:07,640
Mm-hmm. Well, whatever this is,

1034
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:07,640
Mm-hmm. Well, whatever this is,

1035
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,184
it's wonderful to see you, Data.

1036
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,980
To see your strange,

1037
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,980
To see your strange,

1038
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,982
beautiful face.

1039
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:20,903
Among the many, many things
that I regretted

1040
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:20,903
Among the many, many things
that I regretted

1041
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,279
after your death

1042
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,533
was that I never told you...

1043
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,533
was that I never told you...

1044
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,285
That you loved me.

1045
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,209
Knowing that you loved me

1046
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:39,213
forms a small but
statistically significant

1047
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:39,213
forms a small but
statistically significant

1048
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,674
part of my memories.

1049
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,843
I hope that brings you
some comfort, sir.

1050
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,843
I hope that brings you
some comfort, sir.

1051
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,053
It does.

1052
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,305
Thank you, Data.

1053
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,305
Thank you, Data.

1054
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,391
Which is why I would like to
ask you to do me a favor.

1055
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:52,560
Of course. Anything.

1056
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,769
When you leave...

1057
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,730
Leave?

1058
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,730
Leave?

1059
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,189
(stammers)

1060
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,941
I'm sorry,
I-I don't understand.

1061
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,068
I thought this was
a simulation.

1062
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,068
I thought this was
a simulation.

1063
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,570
Yes, sir.

1064
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,238
But you are not.

1065
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,034
Before your brain
functions ceased,

1066
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,034
Before your brain
functions ceased,

1067
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:11,412
Doctors Soong and Jurati,
with help from Soji,

1068
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:14,165
were able to scan,
map and transfer

1069
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:14,165
were able to scan,
map and transfer

1070
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:17,376
a complete neural image
of your brain substrates.

1071
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,926
Do I have to go?

1072
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,720
Yes, Captain.

1073
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:42,359
Uh, you wanted me
to do you a favor.

1074
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:42,359
Uh, you wanted me
to do you a favor.

1075
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,404
Yes, sir.

1076
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:49,241
When you leave, I would be
profoundly grateful

1077
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:49,241
When you leave, I would be
profoundly grateful

1078
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,203
if you terminated
my consciousness.

1079
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,582
You want to die?

1080
00:47:56,582 --> 00:48:00,461
Not exactly, sir.

1081
00:47:56,582 --> 00:48:00,461
Not exactly, sir.

1082
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,633
I want to live, however briefly,

1083
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:08,260
knowing that my life is finite.

1084
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:08,260
knowing that my life is finite.

1085
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,555
Mortality gives meaning

1086
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,974
to human life, Captain.

1087
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,974
to human life, Captain.

1088
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:18,020
Peace, love,

1089
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:18,020
Peace, love,

1090
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,438
friendship.

1091
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,857
These are precious.

1092
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,943
Because we know

1093
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:27,113
they cannot endure.

1094
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:27,113
they cannot endure.

1095
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:34,161
A butterfly
that lives forever...

1096
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:42,503
...is really not
a butterfly at all.

1097
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:42,503
...is really not
a butterfly at all.

1098
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,590
Very well.

1099
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,177
I will do what you ask.

1100
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,683
Thank you, sir.

1101
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,683
Thank you, sir.

1102
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,656
Goodbye, Commander.

1103
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,201
(echoing):
Goodbye, Captain.

1104
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,201
(echoing):
Goodbye, Captain.

1105
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,059
(breathing deeply)

1106
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:53,741
JURATI:
Hi, mister.

1107
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,750
Am I real?

1108
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,585
Of course you are.

1109
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,098
Ah.

1110
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,098
Ah.

1111
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:22,436
Tell me about this body.

1112
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:26,565
This, uh... golem.

1113
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:26,565
This, uh... golem.

1114
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,609
Well, it has no augmentations,

1115
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:31,695
no, you know, superpowers.

1116
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:31,695
no, you know, superpowers.

1117
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,614
I knew you wouldn't want
to have to adjust

1118
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:34,949
to something new,

1119
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,785
not after 94 years
in the same body

1120
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,785
not after 94 years
in the same body

1121
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,745
with the same face.
Ah.

1122
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,913
I see.

1123
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:42,373
Everything is new, though.

1124
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:42,373
Everything is new, though.

1125
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,083
Everything works.

1126
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:47,795
And the brain abnormality
is gone for good.

1127
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,257
Extraordinary.

1128
00:50:56,553 --> 00:51:00,599
Y-You... you haven't
made me immortal?

1129
00:50:56,553 --> 00:51:00,599
Y-You... you haven't
made me immortal?

1130
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,309
Oh, relax, man.

1131
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,561
Everyone was paying attention.

1132
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,646
We took care of you.

1133
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:06,772
(quietly):
Ah.

1134
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:06,772
(quietly):
Ah.

1135
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,274
We designed
a cellular homeostasis

1136
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,484
algorithm that should
give you more or less

1137
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,611
the same number of years
you would have expected

1138
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,611
the same number of years
you would have expected

1139
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,654
without the brain condition.

1140
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,489
Ah.

1141
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,492
I wouldn't have
minded another ten.

1142
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,492
I wouldn't have
minded another ten.

1143
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,744
Twenty?

1144
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,998

Well, Dr. Soong,

Well, Dr. Soong,

1147
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,334
I must thank you.

1148
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,795
My gain is your loss.

1149
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:33,340
But now we both

1150

But now we both

1151
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,176
have something to lose.

1152

1153
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,888
I have a promise to keep.

Don't be shy, guys. Fire away.

11
00:00:47,888 --> 00:00:50,137
Why you talk like a white girl?

12
00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:52,470
Ha.

13
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,762
You caught me. I'm rocking blackface.

14
00:00:56,888 --> 00:00:58,512
That's racist.

15
00:00:58,513 --> 00:01:00,012
Any other questions?

16
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:01,637
What's up with your hair?

17
00:01:01,638 --> 00:01:03,512
I don't know what you mean.

18
00:01:03,513 --> 00:01:05,220
My cousin can put some tracks in it,

19
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:06,887
unless you like it like that.

20
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:08,762
You rude. She African.

21
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:11,637
We're all from Africa, guys.

22
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,512
Absolutely. Let's stick to
questions about the program.

23
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:15,721
Sorry.

24
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:19,220
Is this what you always wanted to do?

25
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:22,095
Uh, no, but I got this job after college

26
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:24,012
and it fit my interest at the time.

27
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:26,387
- Are you single?
- Uh, I don't think that's appropriate.

28
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:28,637
Yeah, she's single.

29
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:34,762
Okay, since you guys are so
interested in my personal life,

30
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:37,637
here it is... I'm 28, actually 29,

31
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:39,137
'cause today's my birthday.

32
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:41,762
I came from a great family,
I have a college degree.

33
00:01:41,763 --> 00:01:44,887
I work in the nonprofit world
because I like to give back.

34
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:46,637
I've been with my boyfriend
for five years,

35
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:48,595
and I did this to my hair on purpose.

36
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:50,387
So, I hope that covers everything.

37
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:53,095
Does anybody actually have any
questions about We Got Y'all?

38
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:55,470
- Why ain't you married?
- I'm just not right now.

39
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:57,220
My dad said ain't nobody checkin'

40
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:59,220
for bitter-ass black women anymore.

41
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:03,845
Dayniece, that's detention.
Apologize now.

42
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:05,928
Sorry.

43
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:07,678
That... that's okay. And tell your dad

44
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,220
that black women aren't bitter.

45
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:11,679
They're just tired of being
expected to settle for less.

46
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:16,303
Her outfit settled for less.

47
00:02:23,497 --> 00:02:28,387

48
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:31,470
My boss founded a nonprofit

49
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,095
to help kids from the hood,

50
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:35,970
but she didn't hire
anybody from the hood.

51
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:38,678
I'm torn between the Booker T. method

52
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:40,178
and the DuBois method.

53
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:43,220
What would James Baldwin
say is most beneficial

54
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:44,845
for people of color?

55
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:46,845
In 2016? That's what
you're talking about?

56
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:48,845
I've been here five years and they think

57
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:51,220
I'm the token with all the answers.

58
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:53,095
Let's just ask Issa.

59
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:56,221
Issa, what's "on fleek"?

60
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,220
I don't know what that means.

61
00:03:01,221 --> 00:03:03,428
I know what that shit means.

62
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:05,845
But being aggressively passive
is what I do best.

63
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:07,345
I used to keep a journal to vent.

64
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:08,845
Now I just write raps.

65
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:11,428
? Go, shawty, it's my birthday ?

66
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:13,970
? But no one cares because
I'm not having a party ?

67
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:18,057
? 'Cause I'm feeling sorry
for my... self. ?

68
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:23,114
_

69
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,967
_

70
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:41,053
? Oh, look, nigga,
guess you're still single ?

71
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,678
? Couldn't find another bitch
to make your toes tingle ?

72
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:46,345
? Hot shit. ?

73
00:03:46,346 --> 00:03:48,470
How different would my life be

74
00:03:48,471 --> 00:03:50,625
if I actually went after what I wanted?

75
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:58,120
Maybe I'd be more like
my best friend, Molly.

76
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:00,287
She's like the Will Smith of corporate.

77
00:04:00,288 --> 00:04:03,662
So, they want us to be more
environmentally responsible.

78
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:06,037
But it's like, seriously,
why do we need trees?

79
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,245
White people looove Molly.

80
00:04:10,246 --> 00:04:14,412
Black people also looove Molly.

81
00:04:14,413 --> 00:04:16,088
Domino, bitch!

82
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:19,963
What am I doing wrong?

83
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,787
Wait. You got the LaVinci
family to settle?

84
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:29,037
- Yep.
- No frickin' way. How?

85
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:31,037
I convinced their
youngest son to testify.

86
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,287
His inheritance was already guaranteed.

87
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:36,662
God, that's unbelievable. Please,
please teach me your ways.

88
00:04:36,663 --> 00:04:38,787
One day.

89
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:42,662
- Oh, is that that Arab guy?
- Yes. He says, "Hey."

90
00:04:42,663 --> 00:04:43,870
I love it.

91
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:46,495
So sweet. What are you gonna write back?

92
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:47,912
I think I'm just gonna call him

93
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,912
'cause, I mean, "hey"
means "I wanna talk," right?

94
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:53,162
Yeah, sure, I think it could.

95
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,495
_

96
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:56,845
What'd he say?

97
00:04:56,869 --> 00:04:59,211
He... he must be
texting me from a meeting.

98
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:00,745
You know, he's a product engineer,

99
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:03,412
so he's probably engineering
shit as we speak.

100
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:06,495
- Seems like you really like him.
- _

101
00:05:06,496 --> 00:05:08,412
You know, I do.

102
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:11,912
We've only been on three dates,
but he's so different.

103
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:14,162
I never thought I'd end up
with someone who wasn't black.

104
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:15,412
- You know?
- Totally.

105
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:16,912
Me and Jamal are always talking

106
00:05:16,913 --> 00:05:18,662
about how we're not each other's types,

107
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:21,037
but, I don't know, it works.

108
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:23,495
Girl, Jamal is frontin'.

109
00:05:23,496 --> 00:05:26,037
Niggas love Asians and Latinas

110
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:29,120
and Indians and white
chicks and mixed chicks.

111
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,120
But you know what, if they
are not checkin' for me,

112
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:33,025
I ain't checkin' for them.

113
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:38,111
_

114
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:41,538
Jamal said I was his first.

115
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:53,412
We were just going with the flow.

116
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:55,287
It came out of nowhere,
'cause, personally,

117
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,662
I thought we were having a good time.

118
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:59,162
Wait? Whose idea was it
to go with the flow?

119
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:00,537
Oh, it was mutual.

120
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:01,745
Mm.

121
00:06:01,746 --> 00:06:04,537
Okay, bitch, it was his,
but I was cool with it.

122
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,412
- Was he hairy?
- He was Arab.

123
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:08,037
- So, yeah.
- Absolutely.

124
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:10,412
And then he was also,
like, calling me every day

125
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,120
and sending me text messages.

126
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,412
- Oh, damn.
- Right?

127
00:06:13,413 --> 00:06:16,162
And then this motherfucker
got the audacity

128
00:06:16,163 --> 00:06:18,037
to hit me with this bullshit.

129
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:22,037
"Sorry. I'm not looking for
a relationship right now.

130
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:23,370
Sad face."

131
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:26,662
He did not sad face you.
I will slap you right...

132
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:29,412
bish... whaat?

133
00:06:29,413 --> 00:06:30,629
That's my life.

134
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:35,037
Can we eat? I'm hungry as fuck, okay?

135
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:37,287
Have you ever tried, like, the raw meat?

136
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:39,745
Not that raw meat,
but you know what I'm sayin'.

137
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:41,996
But, like, the food.

138
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:45,288
You okay?

139
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,287
Yeah, girl. You know what,
this is your birthday.

140
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:51,995
I don't wanna make this about me. No.

141
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:54,912
Girl, stop. What's going on?

142
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:59,412
It's, like, it doesn't
matter what I do, Issa.

143
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:01,537
If I'm into them,
then I'm too smothering.

144
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:03,412
If I take my time
or try to give them space,

145
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:04,870
"Oh, I didn't think you were into me."

146
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:06,912
Fine. Sex right away. Lose interest.

147
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:08,537
Wait to have sex. Lose interest.

148
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:12,120
If I don't have sex at all...
motherfucker, no!

149
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:14,441
I'm a grown-ass woman. I did
not sign up for that bullshit.

150
00:07:19,996 --> 00:07:21,662
I think your pussy's broken.

151
00:07:21,663 --> 00:07:23,870
- What?
- No, I read about it.

152
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:25,662
It's, like, pussies breaking everywhere.

153
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:28,537
I think your pussy's sad.
It's had enough.

154
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:31,871
And if it could talk, it would
make that sad Marge Simpson groan.

155
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:39,037
Yes, that's it! That's your pussy!

156
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,120
You're an asshole. Fuck you, Issa.

157
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:42,662
They're gonna kick us
out this restaurant.

158
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,620
- Are you ladies ready?
- Uh, no.

159
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:46,287
Can you give us, like, two minutes?

160
00:07:46,288 --> 00:07:48,037
- We're just, you know.
- All right.

161
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:50,370
- She not gonna come back for hours.
- Her broke pussy talking.

162
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:52,787
Where's the broken pussy?
Choose number four.

163
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:56,912
- Thanks for treating me, girl.
- You know I got you.

164
00:07:56,913 --> 00:08:00,787
Now, why don't you go home and get
you some of that good birthday ass?

165
00:08:00,788 --> 00:08:02,912
"Yes, Lawrence. How you doin' there?"

166
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:05,870
Actually, I'm thinking about
ending things with Lawrence.

167
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:08,245
I'm sorry, what was that?
Did you not just see me

168
00:08:08,246 --> 00:08:10,037
crying tears of singleness in there?

169
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:12,162
No, no, no. One of us
is having sex tonight.

170
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:14,870
We don't do anything.
Like, there's no excitement.

171
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,859
It's just too comfortable.

172
00:08:16,884 --> 00:08:18,587
Okay, wait.
Are you guys fighting or what?

173
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:19,671
No, I wish.

174
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:23,120
Sometimes I wish he'd just slap the
shit out of me out of angry passion.

175
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,370
Not really, but kinda.

176
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,870
So, you're an idiot. That's cool.

177
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:28,620
No, seriously. I'm
starting to resent him.

178
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:30,245
Like, I spent my entire 20s

179
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:32,120
with a dude that I'm not
even gonna end up with.

180
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:35,328
Well, I mean, you're still 29.

181
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:37,203
You got one more year.

182
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:39,370
- Bitch, you're right.
- I know.

183
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:41,370
I don't have time
for the bullshit anymore.

184
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:44,328
- Wait, what are you saying?
- I'm breaking up with him tonight.

185
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:46,995
- Bitch, no you're not.
- Yeah, you're right I'm not.

186
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:48,681
- 'Course I'm not.
- I know you.

187
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:04,995
- Hey. Happy birthday, babe.
- Thank you.

188
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:07,993
Why aren't you dressed?
The show starts at 10:00, right?

189
00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:12,620
- I bombed the interview.
- Jeez, Lawrence.

190
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:14,370
I... I just got nervous,

191
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:17,870
and I started saying stuff
that didn't make any sense.

192
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:19,870
I didn't talk about anything
I could bring to the table.

193
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,579
I just spit words out.

194
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:25,370
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

195
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:27,745
No, I literally spit on him, all right?

196
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:30,245
Then I spilled hot coffee
all over his desk.

197
00:09:30,246 --> 00:09:32,121
Never mind, then.

198
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:37,121
Hey, I'm sorry for
ruining your birthday.

199
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:42,078
All right? But can we, you
know, do a Redbox movie

200
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:43,745
and just stay in?

201
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:45,621
I promise I'll make it up to you.

202
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:48,328
Come on, hmm?

203
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:50,245
Hmm? Mm-wah! All right, thanks.

204
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:52,453
Let me finish watching this video
and then we can go to 7-Eleven.

205
00:09:52,454 --> 00:09:54,870
You want pecs? You want abs?

206
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:56,245
It takes fucking discipline.

207
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:58,203
So stop making excuses and do it.

208
00:09:58,204 --> 00:10:00,995
- Make it happen.
- It's not gonna happen...

209
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:02,870
by sittin' on your ass!

210
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:04,071
What did you want to rent?

211
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:06,971
- You know what, you pick.
- _

212
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:08,870
I wish I could come
through that screening

213
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:11,550
- pump the fuck out of your lazy ass.
- _

214
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,870
And these poor, poor children

215
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:17,828
need our guidance more than anything.

216
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:19,995
They were so intent on not acknowledging

217
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:22,328
the burdens that face them every day.

218
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:24,495
They focused mostly on Issa's love life,

219
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:27,078
which I have to say served
as a great icebreaker.

220
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:32,620
Ahem, Thomas Jefferson
Middle School statistics

221
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:36,328
state that 40% will not
graduate high school

222
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:38,870
and 20% will become teen parents.

223
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,620
We absolutely have to intervene.

224
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:43,828
Educated black women
are highly unlikely to get married

225
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:45,620
the more education they have.

226
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:48,620
On the bright side, many
black women are work-focused

227
00:10:48,621 --> 00:10:50,745
and find happiness in their careers.

228
00:10:50,746 --> 00:10:54,703
But, then, there is a small percentage

229
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:57,453
of pathetic women who have neither.

230
00:10:57,454 --> 00:10:58,745
They are purposeless.

231
00:10:58,746 --> 00:11:00,204
You're wrong!

232
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,453
What is she wrong about, Issa?

233
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:08,453
What do you think we need to do

234
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:11,495
to help these kids?

235
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:15,120
Well, stop treating them like
they're all the same, for one.

236
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:16,870
They already get enough of that.

237
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:20,453
I think these kids need permission
to explore on their own.

238
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:23,120
Okay, well, where does
We Got Y'all fit in?

239
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:24,995
Right, uh...

240
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:27,245
nothing's gonna change for these kids

241
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:29,745
if they're stuck
in the same shitty place.

242
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:32,245
They need to know that there's
more out there for them.

243
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:34,870
So, as youth liaison,
I want to take the lead

244
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:37,946
on building a program for the
kids outside of the school.

245
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:41,453
Great. Work with Frieda.

246
00:11:41,454 --> 00:11:43,620
Have a proposal to me by Monday.

247
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:45,828
- All right, Ken and Patricia...
- Love it.

248
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:48,245
...tell me about
San Pedro Middle School.

249
00:11:48,246 --> 00:11:50,495
Last year, we had black and white.

250
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:53,829
We didn't want to spend
a lot on the brochures, but...

251
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:55,745
_

252
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:57,870
- Good job.
- Thanks.

253
00:11:57,871 --> 00:12:00,495
I just was not expecting it!

254
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:03,370
I walk in, and, first of
all, he was being shady.

255
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:05,995
All night I had
no idea what was going on.

256
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:08,828
- And I go into the house...
- Hey, guys.

257
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,578
What'd I miss?

258
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:16,621
Molly, I got engaged.
He proposed last night!

259
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:19,620
Wow. Oh, my God.

260
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:21,370
I'm so happy for you.

261
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:23,203
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

262
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:25,620
- Finish the story. Finish the story.
- Okay, okay.

263
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,703
So, um, okay. So, where was I?

264
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:31,745
I walked in and my favorite
flowers are, like, everywhere.

265
00:12:31,746 --> 00:12:32,995
And he had these little notes

266
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:34,870
that were, like, tied to balloons.

267
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,953
Balloons. Wow, for real?

268
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:39,120
Girl, that... that is crazy. Balloons.

269
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:43,203
Yeah, they were, like, tied to
my friends and family... sorry.

270
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:45,959
- Wow, balloons.
- That's insane. You deserve it.

271
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:51,496
Hi, girl.

272
00:12:51,497 --> 00:12:53,370
It is never happening for me.

273
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:55,870
You sound like you're exercising.
You don't exercise.

274
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:57,495
Diane got engaged.

275
00:12:57,496 --> 00:13:00,203
- To her black boyfriend?
- Yes!

276
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:01,495
Damn!

277
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:03,370
That wife "others" up with a quickness.

278
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,495
Right? And they don't
even have to be that cute.

279
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:07,703
You know, I'm not trying to be
shady, but why does she deserve

280
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,370
to get married, and I don't?

281
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,078
Girl, stop. Who says you
don't deserve to be married?

282
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,370
Jesus, apparently!

283
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:15,370
He the nigga that gave me
this broken-ass pussy!

284
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:18,203
Okay, listen, I promise
Jesus isn't conspiring

285
00:13:18,204 --> 00:13:20,204
against you and your pussy.

286
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:23,619
- You need to go out tonight.
- No.

287
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,876
I'm taking you out.
Be ready by 8:00. Bye.

288
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:25,945
Wait...

289
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,871
Issa? Issa?

290
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:40,995
Hi, I'm sexy.

291
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:43,620
Let's get outta here. You're super!

292
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:46,578
Oh, my God, you're a music producer.
Do you know Beck?

293
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:48,120
I don't make love, I fuck.

294
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:49,995
You want some of this pussy pot pie?

295
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,578
Pop, pop, pop! Prrrrr pop, pop!

296
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:54,203
Pot pie!

297
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:56,078
Well, hello, Daniel.

298
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,328
No, you drive on the wrong
side of the street.

299
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:02,120
Let me sprinkle
some pussy Parmesan on you.

300
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:03,620
Awesome.

301
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:05,495
You hungry?

302
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,495
Hey, tiger. Mm-hmm.

303
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:09,203
No, that's so stupid.

304
00:14:09,204 --> 00:14:11,870
Take a drink. Whoo! Shots, shots!

305
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:14,370
You gonna take this nonny or not?

306
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:16,370
Take this nonny! Take it!

307
00:14:18,746 --> 00:14:20,495
It's too aggressive.

308
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:34,603
Wow. What are you all dressed up for?

309
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:36,578
I'm taking Molly out tonight.

310
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:39,245
On a date? Should I be jealous?

311
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:40,870
Uh, no, she's just really upset

312
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:42,578
and I want to make her feel better.

313
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,120
What's wrong with her now?

314
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:45,995
She doesn't think
she'll ever get married.

315
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:49,953
Ha! She might be onto something.

316
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:52,495
Don't be a dick. Dating is hard.

317
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:55,120
Not if she didn't take it so seriously.

318
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:57,056
Plus her standards are way too high.

319
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,828
Yeah, maybe she should
lower them like I did.

320
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:04,620
Wait, what the fuck?

321
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:06,495
Never mind. Just forget it. I'm sorry.

322
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:07,953
No. What's that supposed to mean?

323
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:09,703
It means sometimes

324
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:11,120
I don't know what the fuck we're doing.

325
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:12,995
Uh, we're together?

326
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,495
Yeah, but where are we going?

327
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,620
- Are we here? Is this it?
- Babe.

328
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:18,495
Because maybe I didn't know
it before, but I know it now,

329
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:20,620
and I don't wanna just
sit on the couch with you

330
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:23,370
for the rest of my life and
wait for something to happen.

331
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:24,745
What are you talking about?

332
00:15:24,746 --> 00:15:26,578
Nobody's just sitting on the couch.

333
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,328
I'm almost done with my business plan.

334
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:30,245
You know, I'm just
getting my shit together.

335
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:32,995
You've been getting your shit
together for four years, Lawrence.

336
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:35,953
I just feel like we're wasting our time.

337
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:37,871
I don't have time to waste.

338
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:41,995
So what are you saying?

339
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:44,120
I'm saying maybe we should

340
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:47,329
get our shit together separately
and see what happens.

341
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:50,995
You wanna break up with me?

342
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:52,712
- Molly's waiting on me. I'm...
- _

343
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:53,929
- gonna spend the night at her house.
- _

344
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,370
- We can talk about this tomorrow.
- Hey. Issa!

345
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:59,454
- See you later.
- Hey! Iss!

346
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:10,620
Issa, why are we in 1997 Inglewood?

347
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:13,620
Bitch, I don't know.
I've never been here before.

348
00:16:13,621 --> 00:16:15,328
But I've heard really good things.

349
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:17,453
Nigga, from who,
your middle-school Crips?

350
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:19,703
Will you stop being
all judgmental, okay?

351
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:22,328
I could've taken you to some
stuck-up Hollywood spot

352
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:25,328
with a bunch of assholes,
but we're here, okay?

353
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:27,496
Let's have fun tonight.

354
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:32,620
Yes.

355
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:34,370
Fine, but you are buying me a drink.

356
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:36,495
Okay. You're gonna have
some drinks tonight.

357
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,120
You're gonna get so fucked up.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

358
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:41,745
Oh. It's gonna be a strong drink.

359
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:52,287
- So, are y'all broken up or not?
- I think so.

360
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:54,037
You know, I told him how I felt,

361
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:56,662
and his last words were, "You
wanna break up with me?"

362
00:16:56,663 --> 00:16:58,395
And you said?

363
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:00,120
That I was spending
the night at your house

364
00:17:00,121 --> 00:17:01,537
and that we'd talk about it later.

365
00:17:01,538 --> 00:17:03,245
But I'm pretty sure he got the message.

366
00:17:03,246 --> 00:17:05,537
Yeah, and the message was,
"She mad, we good."

367
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:08,162
We need to find you somebody.

368
00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:10,995
Every dude in here got dry cornrows.

369
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:11,996
That's a fact.

370
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,412
Listen, bougie bitch,

371
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:15,745
half of these dudes are cute, okay?

372
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:17,412
- Where? Mm-mm.
- What?

373
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:19,662
Let's just go stand by
them so they notice you.

374
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,287
Since when did you
become Party McPartisan?

375
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:23,162
I usually have to drag your ass out.

376
00:17:23,163 --> 00:17:25,662
- Come on, over here.
- What? Issa, where are we going?

377
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:27,162
No. Jesus.

378
00:17:34,163 --> 00:17:37,412
? Crying on the bathroom
floor full of tears ?

379
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:40,745
? My baby mama left me, said I
couldn't face my fears... ?

380
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,620
No, let me finish. I got it.

381
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:47,662
? Hey, yo, you a bitch... ?

382
00:17:47,663 --> 00:17:49,537
Ah, ah, ah.

383
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:51,620
- Pop it. Yes. Yes.
- I'm not doing this.

384
00:17:51,621 --> 00:17:52,995
? Couldn't relive it ?

385
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:54,537
? She got an iceberg heart ?

386
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:57,120
? She just sunk my ship... ?

387
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:58,787
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming.

388
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:01,162
Hey. How y'all ladies doing tonight?

389
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,995
Good.

390
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:04,120
I'm Jered, by the way.

391
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:06,037
- Molly.
- Nice to meet you.

392
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:07,537
- Issa.
- Uh...

393
00:18:07,538 --> 00:18:09,745
So, like, y'all performing?
What's going on?

394
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:11,162
Oh, my God, no.

395
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:13,412
We didn't even know it was
this kind of a party.

396
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:15,412
- Oh, word.
- Are you performing?

397
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:17,412
No. Hell, no. Hell, no. No, no, no.

398
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:19,537
- Thank God.
- My little brother is.

399
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:22,370
I don't know if this is really his
kind of crowd, you know what I mean?

400
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:24,620
Oh, you mean he's not a gin and
juice, smoke weed every day,

401
00:18:24,621 --> 00:18:26,412
fuck bitches, get money kinda guy?

402
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:30,037
Ha! He's more like a
skinny-jeans, juicing-type dude.

403
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:36,912
Hey, give it up for Train Wreck.

404
00:18:36,937 --> 00:18:38,763
- So, your little brother?
- Yeah, yeah.

405
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:40,282
- Is he a poet?
- He's supposed to be up there soon.

406
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:41,370
Yeah.

407
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:55,413
Yo.

408
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:08,412
Iss!

409
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,371
Daniel? Whoa, hey!

410
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:13,870
What are you even doing here?

411
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:15,287
My friend's performing tonight.

412
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,787
I produce some of his tracks.

413
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:17,788
What are you doing here?

414
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,662
Oh, um, my friend Molly

415
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:22,287
had suggested, um, here, this place,

416
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:23,662
where we are.

417
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,120
What a coincidence.
How was your birthday?

418
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:29,037
Oh, it was chill.
You know, nothing special.

419
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:31,662
Well, we're celebrating tonight.
Let me get you a drink.

420
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:32,663
Okay.

421
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:41,287
- What you want?
- A vodka tonic.

422
00:19:41,288 --> 00:19:42,912
Two vodka tonics, man.

423
00:19:42,913 --> 00:19:45,537
? This is 'tween us,
you and I are committed ?

424
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:47,870
? I'm the type of player
always rep my city ?

425
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:50,287
? Step to the plate
like I'm a Ken Griffey ?

426
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:52,995
? Grand slam, bringing
three hos home with me ?

427
00:19:52,996 --> 00:19:55,537
? Slide to home base, hit 450... ?

428
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:58,412
Wait. I just don't understand
why these grown-ass men

429
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,120
are still dressing like Kris Kross.

430
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:02,412
I bagged you looking like Kris Kross.

431
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:04,412
Okay, that was high school

432
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,412
when I thought prison jeans were sexy,

433
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,787
and you didn't bag me till
college, fuck you very much.

434
00:20:08,788 --> 00:20:11,287
I'm pretty sure my jeans
were still sagging then.

435
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:14,870
Oh. Well, I'm just glad
your pants grew up.

436
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:17,495
? Show me you can biddy up ?

437
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:19,412
? Let me see you giddy up. ?

438
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:26,287
Yo, remember when we used to rap?

439
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:27,745
You still flow?

440
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:30,620
You know, I might actually still write.

441
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:32,620
You lying. You lying.

442
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:34,787
All right, now. It's open mic night.

443
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:36,870
So you rappers, singers,

444
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:39,495
get it off your chest, all right?

445
00:20:39,496 --> 00:20:40,745
I dare you.

446
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:42,287
No. I'm... nope.

447
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:45,620
Come on, Iss. It was just your birthday.

448
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:48,288
You're never gonna
have this moment again.

449
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:52,870
You got this.

450
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:55,663
You got this.

451
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:02,037
What up, y'all?

452
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:06,412
- You were polite.
- Yo.

453
00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:08,037
- Isn't that your girl?
- What?

454
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:10,245
That's your girl, right?

455
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,142
What the fuck?

456
00:21:15,663 --> 00:21:17,037
? Love rookie ?

457
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:18,662
? She give them all the cookies ?

458
00:21:18,663 --> 00:21:20,162
? By cookies I mean pussy ?

459
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:21,537
? This girl is kinda loosey ?

460
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:23,037
? Dudes take her off the shelf ?

461
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:24,662
? And they put her on credit ?

462
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:27,745
? 30 days later,
they return it and regret it ?

463
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:31,037
? Used like a dishrag,
dumped with a hashtag ?

464
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,037
? I blame it on the pussy,
that shit must be bad ?

465
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:35,788
? Broken pussy ?

466
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:38,871
? Broken pussy ?

467
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:42,037
? Maybe it's dry as hell ?

468
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:43,412
? Maybe it really smells ?

469
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:44,787
? Broken pussy... ?

470
00:21:44,788 --> 00:21:46,912
Oh, my God. She's talking about me.

471
00:21:46,913 --> 00:21:49,787
? Maybe it's really rough,
maybe it's had enough ?

472
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:51,163
? Broken pussy ?

473
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:56,037
? Nobody wants you 'cause
you got a broken pussy ?

474
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:58,870
? Nobody wants you
'cause you got a broken pussy ?

475
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:02,037
- ? Broken pussy ?
- Crowd: ? Broken pussy ?

476
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:03,662
? Broken pussy ?

477
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:05,412
? Hey ?

478
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:08,245
? Maybe it's really rough,
maybe it's had enough ?

479
00:22:08,246 --> 00:22:10,037
? Broken pussy ?

480
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,662
? Hey! ?

481
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,412
? Maybe it's really rough,
maybe it's had enough ?

482
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,037
? Broken pussy ?

483
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:18,912
? Hey, broken pussy. ?

484
00:22:18,913 --> 00:22:21,912
Thank you, guys.

485
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:25,412
Girl, I'm sorry, okay?
It wasn't even about you.

486
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:26,620
Daniel dared me to do it.

487
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:27,870
And you know how we were talking

488
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:29,412
about this being the last year of my 20s

489
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:30,870
and how I need to make the most of it.

490
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:32,412
I don't even know what came over me,

491
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:34,037
but I just went up there

492
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:36,287
and I just did that shit, you know?

493
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,037
Oh! I mean, I don't know. You tell me.

494
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:40,746
I thought I was pretty good up there.

495
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:47,038
Mm-hmm.

496
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:56,245
So, am I still spending the night,

497
00:22:56,246 --> 00:22:59,745
or no... t?

498
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:02,287
Yo, can you shut the fuck up?!

499
00:23:02,288 --> 00:23:03,662
Damn!

500
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:05,162
What did I say?

501
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:07,662
The only reason we came to
that hoodrat-ass club tonight

502
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:09,537
is so that you could
hook up with Daniel.

503
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:11,162
I didn't even know
he was gonna be there.

504
00:23:11,163 --> 00:23:12,537
Just stop it. You knew.

505
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:14,287
This was always about you.

506
00:23:14,288 --> 00:23:15,870
It was about you, too.

507
00:23:15,871 --> 00:23:18,912
Is my life a joke to you?
No, no, no, real talk.

508
00:23:18,913 --> 00:23:21,662
'Cause it's bad enough that I got
to deal with real triflin' niggas

509
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:23,912
and real untraditional niggas
on a daily basis.

510
00:23:23,913 --> 00:23:26,995
Now I got to worry about dealing
with a triflin' best friend?

511
00:23:26,996 --> 00:23:29,912
You made a joke
of my heartbreak up there.

512
00:23:29,913 --> 00:23:32,745
I didn't mean to. I didn't
think about it like that.

513
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:35,245
That's the damn problem, Issa. You don't
stop to think about the shit you do

514
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:38,037
- can actually affect others.
- Are you kidding me?

515
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:40,870
My whole life is about how
shit affects others, okay?

516
00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:43,245
My job, my boyfriend, you.

517
00:23:43,246 --> 00:23:44,912
I care about how shit affects you, too.

518
00:23:44,913 --> 00:23:46,037
I always listen to you.

519
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:47,245
You only listen to me

520
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:48,995
because I make you
feel better about you.

521
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:51,537
Damn it. This is bullshit.

522
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:53,362
- I didn't even want to go out tonight.
- _

523
00:23:53,387 --> 00:23:55,870
You drag me out here,
then I meet a decent dude,

524
00:23:55,871 --> 00:23:57,662
but you should've seen
how fast Jered left.

525
00:23:57,663 --> 00:23:59,412
- You're right.
- What if he was the one?

526
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:00,778
- Oh, that's right, nigga.
- _

527
00:24:00,802 --> 00:24:02,042
I'll never know.

528
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,537
Never know.

529
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:06,662
Bitch, I know you did not just respond

530
00:24:06,663 --> 00:24:08,912
to that motherfucking text message.

531
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:10,537
- I didn't.
- You're lying.

532
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:12,537
Did you just send a text message?

533
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:14,412
I swear on my brother's life and my life

534
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,412
I did not send a text.

535
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,662
Okay, now it's technically sent.

536
00:24:20,663 --> 00:24:23,245
- But Daniel, he disappeared...
- You know what, fuck you!

537
00:24:23,246 --> 00:24:24,787
And if you fuck Daniel,

538
00:24:24,788 --> 00:24:27,620
you're as much of a dumb bitch as I am.

539
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:28,930
Fucking asshole.

540
00:24:28,954 --> 00:24:31,131
- Motherfucker, open the door!
- It's the child locks.

541
00:24:31,156 --> 00:24:33,620
- I was just playing with you.
- Shut the fuck up.

542
00:25:07,996 --> 00:25:10,787
Hey. Where you going?

543
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:12,662
I shouldn't be here.

544
00:25:12,663 --> 00:25:14,370
Why? Come on.

545
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:15,663
You're here.

546
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:24,912
I got you this.

547
00:25:24,913 --> 00:25:28,287
Not Moscato, but some
shit Drake would like.

548
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:30,037
Why are you assuming I like Drake?

549
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:32,245
Every black girl that went
to college likes Drake.

550
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:34,245
He just really gets us.

551
00:25:47,288 --> 00:25:48,912
I'm not a dumb bitch!

552
00:25:48,913 --> 00:25:50,788
I never said you were.

553
00:25:51,913 --> 00:25:54,120
No, you didn't.

554
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:57,245
But I just got out of a
relationship, I think,

555
00:25:57,246 --> 00:26:00,495
and I-I wanna try being
this new, different person,

556
00:26:00,496 --> 00:26:01,995
and you seem like the perfect person

557
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:03,495
to be this new, different person with

558
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:05,370
because you've always
been my "what if" guy,

559
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:08,162
but I... I can't just jump from
one relationship to another

560
00:26:08,163 --> 00:26:11,037
- because that's crazy...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

561
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:12,913
Relationship?

562
00:26:14,413 --> 00:26:16,370
I'm not looking for a relationship.

563
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:17,662
Maybe...

564
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:20,163
maybe I gave you the wrong idea.

565
00:26:23,746 --> 00:26:24,996
No, you didn't.

566
00:26:26,788 --> 00:26:29,038
That's good to know.

567
00:26:49,538 --> 00:26:51,662
Bitch, you still mad?

568
00:26:51,663 --> 00:26:53,528
Bitch, you still trippin'?

569
00:26:57,163 --> 00:26:58,537
My...

570
00:26:58,538 --> 00:27:01,537
? Girlfriend. ?

571
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,412
If you don't get off of me...

572
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,412
Where is your bag?
'Cause I only see one.

573
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:07,120
It's not under your big-ass wrap?

574
00:27:07,144 --> 00:27:12,144

575
00:27:13,305 --> 00:28:13,339

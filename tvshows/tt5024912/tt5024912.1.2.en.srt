so you're trying to tell me you
went all the way to Daniel's house

14
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:42,427
and nothing happened?

15
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:46,372
Like, at all?

16
00:00:46,374 --> 00:00:48,741
- I didn't even go inside.
- Hold the fuck up!

17
00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:51,844
You got on stage and went all Dej
Nope about my broken pussy for nothing?

18
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:54,013
Like, all that drama for zero dick?

19
00:00:54,015 --> 00:00:56,849
- Tsk, bitch, you buggin'.
- It wasn't for nothing, though.

20
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:58,651
Like, it wasn't even about Daniel.

21
00:00:58,653 --> 00:01:00,152
It was about me.

22
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:02,554
Like, I became someone else up there.

23
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:04,823
- Mm.
- You know, it was like brave me.

24
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:06,157
It was "no fucks" me.

25
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,227
And I wanna be that person.

26
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:09,628
You used to be that person,

27
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,731
all freestyle and drunk
in my backseat and shit.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,434
So, what, you trying to be a rapper now?

29
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:19,467
No! I just wanna not be
scared to do shit anymore.

30
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:22,473
Well, you know what?
That sound real cool, real noble,

31
00:01:22,475 --> 00:01:24,275
but can you just leave
my shit out of it?

32
00:01:24,277 --> 00:01:26,810
- You right.
- Okay, thank you!

33
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:29,714
And I'm really sorry for
saying your pussy's broken.

34
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:31,515
- You know, I was just talking.
- No, no, no, shut up.

35
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:34,184
You was right, my pussy is broken

36
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:35,818
and I need to take better care of her.

37
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,388
So, I'm gonna get her a tune-up.

38
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:40,590
A tune-up?

39
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:42,459
Like, she needs her oil changed?

40
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:44,961
Like, your pussy gonna
pass a smog check or...?

41
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:46,363
- Shut the fuck up.
- [laughs]

42
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:48,231
- I'ma get her fixed.
- How, Sway?

43
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,667
I'm making today Molly Maintenance Day.

44
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:54,202
I'ma get my hair done, nails done,

45
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:55,738
everything did.

46
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,406
Ooh, like a fancy day!

47
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,007
- Basically, yeah.
- <i>[phone buzzing]</i>

48
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,577
If I'm feeling fancy and well
taken care of, so will she.

49
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,078
- That makes sense.
- Right?

50
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,047
Yo, Issa, you got
Lawrence calling me now.

51
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:08,716
What? Just... just ignore it.

Hey, who all is there?

Oh, Fast Mike and Brandon. Where you at?

- Grab me a Guinness, B.
- I got you.

67
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,851
Yo, bro,

68
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:47,820
Fast Mike got fat as fuck.

69
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:50,356
I wanna call him Slow Mike, but you
know how sensitive that nigga get.

00:02:50,358 --> 00:02:51,457
- <i>Ah.</i>
- [chuckles]

71
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:52,958
What's good with you, man?

<i>Aw, shit is up right now, money.</i>

73
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,928
I sold a house to Tiger earlier, man.

74
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,763
I was starstruck, tap
dancing for his ass and shit.

75
00:02:57,765 --> 00:02:59,464
That nigga swole as fuck.
Commission was crazy.

76
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:01,299
- Oh, that's cool.
- <i>What's up with you, man?</i>

77
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:03,034
How's that new project
going, the Whoopty-Whoop?

Still working on my business plan, man.

<i>Plus, you know, there's so
many apps out there now,</i>

81
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:10,675
it's hard to break into the market.

82
00:03:10,677 --> 00:03:13,110
Am I going too broad, do
I need to be more specific?

83
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:15,347
- <i>It's just a lot, you know?</i>
- Cool, cool.

84
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:18,081
That's what's up, man. Hey, I'ma
be selling you a house soon, fam.

85
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,351

- <i>Issa's cool.</i>

She, um...

87
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:25,656
I kind of fucked up her birthday, man.

Aw, damn, man, you gotta fix that.

89
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:29,159
But other than that, you good, right?

90
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:31,194
Uh, actually, man,

91
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:33,529
I was calling 'cause I just wanted to...

92
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:35,931
Oh, shit, this motherfucker
hit a three, bro.

93
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,792
Hey, man, let me finish the rest of
this game. I'ma shout at you, all right?

94
00:03:38,816 --> 00:03:40,518
Yeah, all right. All right, cool.

95
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:42,223
<i>I can't hear you. I
was on the phone, girl.</i>

00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,723
Mm, I probably should.

99
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:03,492
Ooh, girl.

100
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,293
Lawrence ever suck your toes?

101
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:07,295
Once, but it made us both uncomfortable.

102
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:10,698
Ugh, he was sucking on
your big old man feet?

103
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,848
Girl, I tell ya, that nigga is the one.

104
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:15,293
Or someone else might be.

105
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:17,705
What are you talking about?

106
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:19,006
I like Lawrence.

107
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,476
Bitch, I love him, but...

108
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:24,511
I mean, maybe I'm not satisfied.

109
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:27,647
You know? Maybe I wanna
be dicked down properly.

110
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:30,182
You know? Maybe I wanna be face down,

111
00:04:30,184 --> 00:04:33,486
ass up, surrounded by
foreign freaks, you know?

112
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,988
Maybe I wanna ask a nigga
what he wants for breakfast

113
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,190
and he replies, "That pussy,"

114
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:39,826
and he's talking about me, girl.

115
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:42,294
- You know?
- I can't with you. Mm-mm.

116
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:45,431
You don't know.

117
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:49,701
I'm just saying

118
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:52,905
Lawrence hasn't put it down
in a very long time, okay?

119
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:55,741
And maybe I need to get on one
of those apps like you, girl.

120
00:04:55,743 --> 00:04:58,109
Girl, calm your deprived ass down.

121
00:04:58,111 --> 00:04:59,744
You are not about this app life.

122
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:01,579
Try me.

123
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:04,482
Bitch, I'm not gonna sign up. I
just wanna see what's out there.

124
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:08,085
All right. You asked for it.

125
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:10,421
Check it, that's OkCupid.

126
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:13,658
It's free, so it's like
"bottom of the barrel" dudes.

127
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,692
Bought a bunch of new
movies at the barbershop.

128
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:17,594
Bootleg and chill?

129
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:20,464
Tinder used to be cool,

130
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:22,666
but now it's basically a fuck app.

131
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:24,668
So, what are you in the mood for?

132
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,035
We could ditch the menus

133
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:27,771
and have our own dinner for two.

134
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:29,973
Heh, I'll be six, you'll be nine.

135
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:31,842
[chuckles]

136
00:05:31,844 --> 00:05:34,009
Hinge at least pulls from
your network of friends,

137
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:37,212
but apparently all my friends
only know Hotep niggas.

138
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:38,814
Uh-uh, no.

139
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:42,618
I just want a queen that respects
herself, who lays off the swine,

140
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,589
who stands beside her king like
a strong black woman should.

141
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:47,790
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

142
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:50,424
But my queen gotta be a freak, too.

143
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:54,328
I fucked that nigga 'cause he was fine.

144
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,798
But then he had the nerve to dump me

145
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,200
'cause I told him I never
went to the beach till college.

146
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:03,371
Nigga, you sell Obama puzzles
at the African marketplace

147
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:05,373
and you gonna judge me?

148
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:09,810
You grew up in LA and you
never went to the beach?

149
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:12,679
Okay, Windsor Hills, I was a hood rat.

150
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:15,649
All I knew was Florence and
Crenshaw. Whatever, I am still fly.

151
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:19,820
Basically, most of these dudes
are not looking for a relationship.

152
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:22,022
- They're just trying to fuck.
- Really?

153
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:23,456
Yep.

154
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,025
I mean, I just wanna up the
quality of dudes that I meet.

155
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:28,193
There's this one app called The League.

156
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:29,595
It's for elite dating.

157
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,731
Like, girl, you gotta be a
professional just to get in.

158
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,900
I mean, I've been on, like,
a three-month waiting list.

159
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:35,267
Three months?

160
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,036
To meet one nigga?

161
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:40,772
Yeah, this is a lot.

162
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:43,341
You gotta fuck a lot of
frogs to get a good frog.

163
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:46,545
That's not the saying. Or any saying.

164
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:48,747
The point is it's a numbers game.

165
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:51,883
Check it, I'm going on a
date with this frog tomorrow.

166
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:54,385
- Mm.
- He could be different.

167
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:57,688
- You never know.
- Mm.

168
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,657
So, what we doing next?

169
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:02,426
I gotta get my hair done
and then something else.

170
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:04,327
What?

171
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:06,797
It's a "vagacial" appointment.

172
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:09,199
It's like a facial for your vagina.

173
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:11,035
- I said everything did.
- Mm.

174
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:12,870
I saw it on Draya's Instagram.

175
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:17,540
I mean, you could roll if you want to.

176
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,146
Fuck! I guess I'll go home and deal
with this motherfucking relationship.

177
00:07:24,148 --> 00:07:26,248
You should write Hallmark cards.

178
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,384
- Bitch, shut up.
- [chuckles]

179
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,220
I'll see you later.

180
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:33,555
Go handle your man, girl.

181
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:48,203
Do you know who you are?
You the bossiest bitch.

182
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:50,705
You a grown-ass woman
like Solange's sis.

183
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:53,474
You gonna take control like
Janet, or lose control like Missy.

184
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:57,211
The decision is yours...
boss up or be a pussy.

185
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:03,951
Mm-mm, no.

186
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:05,986

Issa.

196
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,763
- Lawrence?
- Where have you been, huh?

197
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,597
- I've been calling you.
- Oh, I... I...

198
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,633
you know, I had my
phone on airplane mode.

- Why you being all loud?!

00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:01,038
Why are you buying a six pack?

202
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,874
It's cheaper and it's not
like it's the cute kind.

203
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,475
Wait, are you not coming home?

204
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:07,277
Lawrence, I'm not ready to
talk about this right now.

205
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,388
No, no, no, no, no. You can't keep
ignoring me, Issa. I wanna talk!

206
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,849
Lawrence, we are not about to be
the black couple fighting in Rite Aid.

207
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:16,852
Okay, listen, I know that this
is about your birthday, okay?

208
00:09:16,854 --> 00:09:18,554
It's not even about my birthday.

209
00:09:18,556 --> 00:09:20,222
- See? You don't even...
- I don't even what?

210
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:22,424
I... I can't do this right now.

211
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:24,860
- I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- Wait, Is-Issa!

213
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:33,168
Lawrence, wait.

214
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:39,074
Can I get your Rite Aid
card for the discount?

215
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,976
Come on, man.

216
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,587
Woman on TV: <i>I [bleep] men and women.</i>

<i>I got two bitches
waiting on me outside...</i>

218
00:09:57,426 --> 00:09:59,893
and two counts of murder on my head

219
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:02,429
that they know about. [chuckles]

220
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:04,970
And I ain't sorry.

221
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,871
Girl, hey! Look at you.

222
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:14,273
Uh, how was your "vagacial"?

223
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:17,576
This bitch blew bubbles
at me. My pussy is still broken.

224
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:19,879
<i>At least I have an icebreaker

00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:22,114
But what are you still doing here?

226
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:23,815
I thought Miss No Fucks was going home.

227
00:10:23,817 --> 00:10:25,583
Um, can I stay one more night?

228
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:28,086
Flavor Flav said yes already.

229
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:30,789
Issa, what's going on? Why
are you avoiding Lawrence?

230
00:10:33,393 --> 00:10:35,060
I kissed Daniel.

231
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:36,661
But it was like... it
was like... [kisses]

232
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:39,396
And then it was... and
then it was finished.

233
00:10:39,398 --> 00:10:41,866
Bitch, I knew it with
your old lying ass.

234
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:43,600
Okay, I did not lie,

235
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:47,271
because, technically, I did
not go inside or fuck him.

236
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:49,306
That's a sound defense.

237
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:52,009
[sighs]

238
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:53,244
And I saw Lawrence

239
00:10:53,246 --> 00:10:56,379
and, girl, he just doesn't get it.

240
00:10:56,381 --> 00:11:00,150
And I don't know what to do
and I'm just... I'm tired.

241
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:02,685
Stay as long as you need.

242
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:04,453
Thank you.

243
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,889
[sighs]

244
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:07,590
And just so we're clear,
I'm still Miss No Fucks.

245
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:10,126
It's a... it's a whole
process. It's a thing, so...

246
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,261
Yeah.

247
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:12,995
How's your presentation going?

248
00:11:12,997 --> 00:11:15,097
Girl, I got too much on my mind, okay?

249
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:18,767
I am about to just wing
this shit "no fucks" style.

250
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:21,603
And these white people, they're
not even gonna know the difference.

251
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:23,438
They're not gonna know!

252
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,573
You're so stupid.

253
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:27,709
Oh, can I borrow some
clothes for work tomorrow?

Hey, I'm so glad you came in early.

268
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:59,873
So, about our youth... your
youth outreach initiative,

269
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,141
um, did you get my email?

270
00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:03,776
Oh, no, I had a lot to do this weekend.

271
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:05,911
Well, I don't wanna step on your toes,

272
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:09,748
but I spoke to some of the
teachers at Thomas Jefferson

273
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,119
and it turns out the students
have a high interest in sports.

274
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:17,422
Sports? That's not exactly
outside of what they know,

275
00:12:17,424 --> 00:12:20,359
and don't you think
that's extremely limiting?

276
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:21,993
No, I hear you.

277
00:12:21,995 --> 00:12:24,162
That is sadly stereotypical.

278
00:12:24,164 --> 00:12:29,033
But to your general point about exposing
them to new and untraditional things,

279
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:33,271
what about partnering with
USC for sports like lacrosse,

280
00:12:33,273 --> 00:12:37,508
water polo, or even real polo?

281
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,885
I don't... Culturally
speaking, I just...

282
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,678
It's crippling for inner city kids

283
00:12:43,703 --> 00:12:46,397
to rely solely on sports
to achieve success...

284
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:49,052
- you know?
- That's true.

285
00:12:49,054 --> 00:12:52,389
Well, my other idea was to take
them to different neighborhoods

286
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:53,924
and to do a community cleanup.

287
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:58,394
You mean take a bunch of black kids

288
00:12:58,396 --> 00:13:02,131
and have them clean up the
streets like a chain gang?

289
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:05,868
That's the whitest
shit you've ever said!

290
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,636
You know, community service is cool,

291
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:09,939
but I think I found my stride.

292
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:11,607
- I've got this.
- Okay.

293
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:14,175
- Thank you, though.
- Thank you.

294
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:16,444
Guys, I've been doing this a long time,

295
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:19,014
but I still get excited when
my staff takes initiative

296
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:21,516
to maximize their
impact in the classroom.

297
00:13:21,518 --> 00:13:23,985
Issa, Frieda, the floor is yours.

298
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:25,653
Thank you, Joanne.

299
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:29,189
Ahem, so the kids of Thomas
Jefferson Middle School

300
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:32,492
are stagnant because they don't
know what else is out there.

301
00:13:32,494 --> 00:13:37,464
So, my idea is to expose them

302
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:40,700
to the arts around Los Angeles.

303
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:44,438
Which arts?

304
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:48,607
Uh, all of them.

305
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:50,209
Are you referring to, like, visual arts,

306
00:13:50,211 --> 00:13:53,346
theatrical arts, or did you
really just mean the arts?

307
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:56,582
Um, what I'm asking is, is that it?

308
00:13:56,584 --> 00:13:59,285
[chuckles] No, that's...
uh-uh, that's not it.

309
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:02,888
Um, if they're interested
in painting and sculpture,

310
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,889
we can take them to The Broad.

311
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:06,224
If they like music,

312
00:14:06,226 --> 00:14:07,792
we can take them to the Hollywood Bowl.

313
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:09,561
There's the Watts Towers...

314
00:14:09,563 --> 00:14:11,729
Have you put together a budget on this?

315
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:15,000
- That sounds expensive.
- It does, right?

316
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:18,570
No, I was gonna get people
excited about it first

317
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:20,838
and then I was gonna
take a stab at the budget.

318
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,606
A stab?

319
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:26,844
So, you have really no idea how
much this is gonna cost at all?

320
00:14:26,846 --> 00:14:30,247
This sounds like a whole lot
of work for very little benefit.

321
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:31,882
Joanne: <i>I see where
you're going with this,</i>

322
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:34,452
but have you thought
about the risk factors,

323
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:37,587
the executions, how
is it mission-driven?

324
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:40,890
Uh, the... the mission would be... help.

325
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:44,060
We were also considering a
community service component

326
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:45,428
- which I...
- Not yet, Frieda.

327
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,084
- This is Issa's idea. Let her finish.
- Okay.

328
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:50,967
Yeah, no, uh, a community
service component

329
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:54,036
could also be included, um...

330
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,872
Culturally, I'm just like...

331
00:14:56,874 --> 00:15:00,442
Wouldn't they rather go to
an African American museum

332
00:15:00,444 --> 00:15:02,011
or, like, a Latino museum

333
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:04,446
and just see how much more
grateful other generations were?

334
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:07,449
Oh, my God, what about
hip-hop Shakespeare?

335
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:09,151
<i>The kids would love "Othello."</i>

336

An interracial romance.

00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:12,487
Ooh, what about a drum circle?

338
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:14,055
That really helps with aggression.

339
00:15:14,057 --> 00:15:15,956
I took an African dance
class in high school,

340
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,425
so I could do mask work with the kids.

Yes, but when the plaintiff

- You're not.
- Um, sorry?

380

I hired you because I saw someone
who wanted to make a difference.

00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,630
You seemed passionate at first,

but I've noticed you've been
on autopilot for a while now.

if you're no longer invested
in what we're trying to do here,

464
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,353
I don't know,

465
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:07,521
what if we just took these
kids to the beach to start?

466
00:21:07,523 --> 00:21:10,390
You know, we could even do your
service idea and make it a...

467
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:12,726
Both: Beach cleanup.

468
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:14,728
Word twins.

469
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,862
Hello.

470
00:21:15,864 --> 00:21:18,732
- It's becoming our thing.
- Mm-mm.

No, no, no, look,

474
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,473
hands down, the worst
dating experience I've had...

475
00:21:27,475 --> 00:21:30,008
- Coffee Meets Bagel.
- Wait, worse than OkCupid?

476
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,412
Listen, I've never had so
many women eyeing my shoe size

477
00:21:33,414 --> 00:21:35,113
and asking me, "So,
are the rumors true?"

478
00:21:35,115 --> 00:21:37,949
- Wait, about your...?
- Uh-huh.

479
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:40,486
Yep, white girls have no shame.

480
00:21:40,488 --> 00:21:42,754
Oh, so you mostly date white girls?

481
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:44,889
Not at all. I just
went through this period

482
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:47,992
- where black women weren't feeling me.
- Now I know you lying.

483
00:21:47,994 --> 00:21:50,561
No, no, no, listen, you're
the first black woman

00:21:50,563 --> 00:21:51,996
who's responded to me in a minute.

485
00:21:51,998 --> 00:21:53,964
- I don't know what it is.
- Really?

486
00:21:53,966 --> 00:21:55,165
Really.

487
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,734
Wow.

488
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:59,003
You two, okay?

489
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:02,105
You want some more wine
or are you in a rush?

490
00:22:02,107 --> 00:22:04,441
Sure, no rush here.

491
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:06,242
Can we have your Argentinian Malbec?

492
00:22:06,244 --> 00:22:08,645
- Okay.
- Thanks, man. You're gonna like this.

493
00:22:08,647 --> 00:22:09,946
- Oh, am I?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

494
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:11,548
Am I gonna like it like
I like your chicken?

Uh, I mean, you know...

496
00:22:12,718 --> 00:22:14,484
- I mean, just a taste!
- You got pasta.

- Yeah!

Uh, definitely.

500
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,136
You trying to fuck, though?

501
00:22:35,138 --> 00:22:38,105
- You motherfucker.
- All right.

502
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,775
You think that just 'cause
you know some fancy wine-speak,

503
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,310
I'm just supposed to
let you take me home?

504
00:22:42,312 --> 00:22:44,546
What, three glasses of
Spanish wine means we fuck?

- Malbec's Argentinian, but...
- [sighs]

I spent all this time trying to
make sure that my pussy is fixed,

507
00:22:49,486 --> 00:22:52,853
but it turns out you are just like
every other single asshole out here.

"Yep, but who else you gonna be with?"

514
00:23:23,217 --> 00:23:25,116
Oh, I got options, nigga. I got options.

515
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:27,853
"So, you ready to talk now?"

516
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:29,788
You ready to man-up now? Ha!

517
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,190
You wasn't expecting
that, huh? That was good.

518
00:23:32,192 --> 00:23:35,093
That's, like, pow. "What's my mama
gonna say about us breaking up?"

519

I don't give a shit
about your mama, nigga!

She's really nice.

jungle sometimes, nigga.

"So, you know I'm
gonna take all my DVDs."

Don't nobody want your

"You know I'm still working
on my business plan."

I got a plan... start the business.

you." I love you, too.

Jared.

- Right, right.
- What's up?

You got... you got a little...

something all over your face.

Okay, so you got jokes.

Somebody runs out of a
club and don't say good-bye.

- Uh, who is this?
- That's Flavor Flav.

539
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,221
Oh, you should get a
Doberman and name him Chuck D.

540
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:42,623
- Thank you.
- Real clever.

541
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,559
I tried. Did a little something.

542
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:43,680
Got an interview with
a headhunter tomorrow.

That's great.

544
00:25:52,124 --> 00:25:56,159
I shouldn't have ignored you today.

00:25:59,497 --> 00:26:01,864
Thug Yoda spelled an
entire sentence today.

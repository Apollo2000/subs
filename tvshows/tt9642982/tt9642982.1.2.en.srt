<font color="#008000">at the famous ball in Brussels.</font>

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,090
How strange
that we should be discussing a ball

3

He is the eldest son of an earl,
my child.

8
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,810
He cannot choose his wife
to suit his heart.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,010
It must end,
before there is damaging talk.

Do we have a right to hide from her
that she has a grandson?

I've been back in Bakewell,

<font color="cyan">A sad time.</font>

It was sad.

Why did we not keep him?

00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:16,410
Doctor Smiley, who attended her,
wanted us to, and he was right.

58
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,689
We could have thought
of a thousand explanations.

59
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:21,650
No one need have known the truth.

60
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,890
<font color="cyan">Why say that now? It's done.</font>

61
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:28,010
<font color="cyan">Mr and Mrs Pope gave him a good home</font>

You did that.

<font color="cyan">But they brought him up</font>
<font color="cyan">without a shadow of suspicion...</font>

64
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,210
<font color="cyan">and he saved them</font>
<font color="cyan">from being childless.</font>

Doesn't it trouble you
that we don't know him?

We don't know our own grandson...

..it seems
I am in possession of a secret

100
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:59,049
which I have sworn to my husband
never to reveal,

101
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,770
and indeed, he would be very angry
if he knew I was here today.

<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

At the Duchess's tea,

104
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:11,650
you said that when
you and your husband go,

105
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:13,129
there will be nothing left of you.

106
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:14,809
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

107
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,530
Well, that's not quite true.

108
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:21,650
Before she died,

109
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:24,289
my daughter Sophia
was delivered of a child.

110
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,970
A boy.

111
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,489
The son of Lord Bellasis.

112
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:31,489
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

113
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,249
The Duchess of Bedford
would be very flattered

114
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:41,609
to see her invention
celebrated elsewhere.

115
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,330
<font color="yellow">I liked it more than I knew.</font>

116
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:46,530
<font color="yellow">And now I stage</font>
<font color="yellow">an imitation of it every day.</font>

117
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:50,289
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>
<font color="yellow">We can fend for ourselves.</font>

118
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,129
<font color="yellow">So, where is he now, this boy?</font>

119
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:01,090
I only know the boy is a man.

120
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,410
He was 25 last birthday.

121
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,049
<font color="yellow">And what is he like?</font>

122
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:09,609
I'm afraid I cannot tell you.

123
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:15,049
Mr Trenchard...

124
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,090
placed the baby
in the care of a clergyman,

125
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:20,570
and now he goes under the name
of Charles Pope.

126
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,369
We have never
made our connection public.

127
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,129
He, himself, knows nothing.

128
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:28,289
<font color="yellow">What does he do?</font>

129
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,050
We had meant him for the cloth,
like his adopted father.

130
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:35,970
But I believe
he proved to be more business-like.

131
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,729
I know no more than that.

132
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,529
<font color="yellow">Like your husband.</font>

133
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,090
<font color="yellow">Well, you cannot be surprised.</font>

134
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:44,810
<font color="yellow">Blood will out.</font>

135
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:51,290
I hope you will not
think too badly of Sophia.

136
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,570
<font color="yellow">You must protect her memory,</font>
<font color="yellow">poor child.</font>

137
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:56,850
<font color="yellow">We will try not to blame her.</font>

138
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:58,529
<font color="yellow">She is to be pitied.</font>

139
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,570
<font color="yellow">In that atmosphere,</font>
<font color="yellow">in Brussels, before the battle,</font>

140
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,450
<font color="yellow">anyone could lose their reason</font>
<font color="yellow">for a moment.</font>

141
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:06,889
I do not blame her.

142
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:09,690
And she didn't lose her reason.

143
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,330
She believed
she was married to Lord Bellasis.

144
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:16,489
He tricked her into thinking
that her marriage had taken place.

145
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:17,930
<font color="yellow">I beg your pardon?</font>

146
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,570
He tricked her.

147
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:21,129
He bamboozled her.

148
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,810
He persuaded a fellow officer
to pretend to be a clergyman,

149
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,409
and Sophia did not find out
the truth till it was too late.

150
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,009
<font color="yellow">I don't believe you.</font>

151
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,570
That is your privilege,
but it's the truth.

152
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:33,810
<font color="yellow">I see how it is.</font>

153
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,889
<font color="yellow">Your daughter was scheming</font>
<font color="yellow">to catch my wretched son,</font>

154
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,050
<font color="yellow">no doubt encouraged by her parents.</font>

155
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,009
You mean Lord Bellasis
was incapable of such behaviour?

156
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,409
<font color="yellow">I most certainly do.</font>

157
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,409
<font color="yellow">He could never even</font>
<font color="yellow">have conceived of the very idea.</font>

158
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,570
Wasn't his godfather Lord Berkeley?

159
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:51,290
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

160
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,330
Lord Bellasis
spoke of him one evening,

161
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:56,249
when he joined us for dinner.

162
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,649
He said that when Lord Berkeley
seduced the mother of his children,

163
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,609
he got a friend
to pose as a clergyman,

164
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:05,330
so he might lure
the unsuspecting girl into bed.

165
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,050
I beg you not to tell me

166
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:12,009
that Lord Bellasis could never
have conceived of any such idea!

167
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:17,729
BELL RINGS

168
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,170
<font color="yellow">My son was seduced</font>
<font color="yellow">by an ambitious girl,</font>

169
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,330
<font color="yellow">who wanted to use the chaos of war</font>

170
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:25,609
<font color="yellow">to bring about a marriage</font>
<font color="yellow">beyond even her father's dreams.</font>

171
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:26,690
<font color="yellow">Well, she failed.</font>

172
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:28,889
<font color="yellow">My son took her as his mistress,</font>
<font color="yellow">but what of that?</font>

173
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,330
<font color="yellow">He was a man, and she was a slut.</font>

174
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:33,249
<font color="yellow">It happens.</font>

175
00:10:34,489 --> 00:10:36,409
<font color="yellow">Ah, Jenkins.</font>

176
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,129
<font color="yellow">Please take Mrs Trenchard down.</font>
<font color="yellow">She's leaving.</font>

177
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:48,170
<font color="yellow">It's funny. I thought you'd come</font>

178
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,489
<font color="yellow">with some sentimental tale</font>
<font color="yellow">to tell me of my son.</font>

179
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:53,249
<font color="yellow">Some happy story</font>
<font color="yellow">of his last days on earth.</font>

180
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,690
<font color="yellow">You spoke so well of him</font>
<font color="yellow">when we first met.</font>

181
00:10:56,729 --> 00:11:00,649
I spoke of him
as I knew him before that night.

182
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,690
But I should have been honest.

183
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,649
If it's any consolation,
no one was more surprised than I

184
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,330
to learn what he was capable of.

185
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,889
I must ask.

186
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,769
Will you keep our secret?

187
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,769
Can I have your word?

188
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,690
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

189
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:27,290
<font color="yellow">Why would I publicise</font>
<font color="yellow">my late son's degradation?</font>

190
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,620
<font color="#008000">How is she today?</font>

191
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,140
<font color="cyan">She's not come down.</font>
<font color="cyan">She's still in her room.</font>

192
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,099
<font color="cyan">The Master must have his luncheon</font>
<font color="cyan">by himself.</font>

193
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,140
<font color="#008000">I'm sorry.</font>

194
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:00,140
<font color="cyan">When she came home</font>
<font color="cyan">from Belgrave Square,</font>

195
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,339
<font color="cyan">she was shaking like a jelly.</font>

196
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,300
<font color="cyan">I swear she's had a headache</font>
<font color="cyan">from that moment.</font>

197
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,219
<font color="#008000">Have you tried valerian?</font>
<font color="cyan">Tried it? I've given her that much</font>

198
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,059
<font color="cyan">I'm surprised she hasn't had a fit.</font>

199
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:09,900
<font color="cyan">And she's not sleeping.</font>

200
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:12,540
<font color="#008000">Has she said what's wrong?</font>
<font color="cyan">Not a word.</font>

201
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:13,900
<font color="cyan">It was like she was in a daze.</font>

202
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:16,300
<font color="cyan">Just hugging that dog</font>
<font color="cyan">and rocking in her chair.</font>

203
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:18,900
I expect you've seen her through
some hard times, eh, Miss Ellis?

204
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,660
<font color="cyan">I expect I have.</font>
<font color="cyan">Much good has it done me.</font>

205
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,179
<font color="yellow">You're not unhappy here, are you?</font>

206
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:25,459
<font color="cyan">Well...</font>

207
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,900
<font color="cyan">..I'm not sure</font>
<font color="cyan">I've made the right choice.</font>

208
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:32,260
<font color="cyan">Look at Jane Croft,</font>
<font color="cyan">Miss Sophia's maid.</font>

209
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,780
<font color="cyan">She's a housekeeper now, with</font>
<font color="cyan">a full staff of servants under her.</font>

210
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:37,339
<font color="cyan">Could have been me.</font>

211
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,540
<font color="yellow">Yeah, but would you want that,</font>
<font color="yellow">Miss Ellis?</font>

212
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:43,059
<font color="cyan">I'm not sure what I want.</font>

213
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,540
RUMBLE OF HOOVES

214
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:07,900
<font color="#008000">It's beginning to look like</font>
<font color="#008000">Peel's going to win this election.</font>

215
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:11,099
<font color="#008000">It seems that Melbourne's</font>
<font color="#008000">on the way out.</font>

216
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,939
<font color="#008000">She's not gonna like that.</font>

217
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:15,660
<font color="yellow">I believe the Prince</font>
<font color="yellow">favours Sir Robert Peel.</font>

218
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:17,459
<font color="#008000">He would. He's German.</font>

219
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,939
<font color="yellow">You haven't forgotten</font>

220
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:22,979
<font color="yellow">that Stephen and Grace</font>
<font color="yellow">will be here for dinner?</font>

221
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:26,179
<font color="#008000">Are they bringing John?</font>

222
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,500
<font color="yellow">I think so. He's staying with them.</font>

223
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,179
<font color="#008000">Drat. They'll be wanting money.</font>

224
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:34,459
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Jenkins.</font>

225
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,140
<font color="yellow">Really, Peregrine.</font>

226
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:42,420
<font color="yellow">Are we to have</font>
<font color="yellow">no secrets of our own?</font>

227
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:44,819
<font color="#008000">You don't worry about Jenkins,</font>
<font color="#008000">are you?</font>

228
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:47,059
<font color="#008000">He knows more about this family</font>
<font color="#008000">than I ever will.</font>

229
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:49,339
<font color="yellow">I don't worry about him, but it's...</font>

230
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,500
<font color="yellow">It's rude to test him.</font>

231
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,900
<font color="yellow">Whether we like it or not,</font>

232
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:54,540
<font color="yellow">Stephen is your brother</font>
<font color="yellow">and your heir</font>

233
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:57,500
<font color="yellow">and should be treated with respect,</font>
<font color="yellow">at least in public.</font>

234
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,979
<font color="yellow">But not in private, by God.</font>

235
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,540
Jenkins? Where is his Lordship?
<font color="#008000">He's gone for a walk, sir.</font>

236
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:30,819
<font color="#008000">Dinner will not be</font>
<font color="#008000">until half past four.</font>

237
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:33,459
<font color="cyan">Ugh.</font>
<font color="cyan">I said we were too damned early.</font>

238
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,740
<font color="cyan">Nobody eats dinner in London</font>
<font color="cyan">before six, these days.</font>

239
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,579
<font color="cyan">That's why they've started</font>
<font color="cyan">eating with their tea.</font>

240
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,300
We're not in London.

241
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,579
<font color="cyan">Yeah, more's the pity.</font>

242
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,699
<font color="cyan">Jenkins? Give me another one.</font>

243
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,420
<font color="#008000">Soda water, sir?</font>
<font color="cyan">Yes.</font>

SIGHS

245
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,300
DOOR OPENS

246
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:05,059
We wondered what had become of you.

247
00:15:05,099 --> 00:15:06,699
<font color="cyan">I can tell you</font>
<font color="cyan">what will become of me,</font>

248
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,620
<font color="cyan">if I can't lay my hands</font>
<font color="cyan">on some funding.</font>

249
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,020
<font color="#008000">Well, that didn't take very long.</font>

250
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:12,939
<font color="#008000">I thought we'd at least</font>
<font color="#008000">get to the pudding</font>

251
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,540
<font color="#008000">before you held your hand out.</font>
<font color="#008000">Where have you been?</font>

252
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:18,059
<font color="yellow">We've been to Lower Farm.</font>

253
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,500
<font color="yellow">John? You were saying?</font>

254
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,059
<font color="cyan">I'm serious.</font>
<font color="cyan">There's nothing else for it.</font>

255
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,500
<font color="#008000">Nothing else for what?</font>

256
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,339
<font color="cyan">Well, a tailor's bill to pay,</font>
<font color="cyan">and the rent on Albany.</font>

257
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,219
<font color="#008000">Albany?</font>
<font color="#008000">Doesn't your mother pay that?</font>

258
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,699
<font color="#008000">And MORE tailors' bills?</font>
<font color="cyan">Yes!</font>

259
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,620
<font color="cyan">I don't know</font>
<font color="cyan">how a man in my position</font>

260
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,660
<font color="cyan">can get through the Season</font>
<font color="cyan">without any clothes.</font>

261
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:39,420
<font color="#008000">Your position?</font>
<font color="#008000">Heavens, what position is that?</font>

262
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:40,939
Peregrine!

263
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:45,339
It is not fair to expect him
to look like a ragamuffin.

264
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,260
Especially not now.

265
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,540
<font color="yellow">Why? What's happening now?</font>

266
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:51,380
That's the reason for our coming.

267
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,140
<font color="#008000">That's the other reason for coming.</font>

268
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,660
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

269
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:57,179
John...

270
00:15:57,219 --> 00:16:01,059
has reached an understanding
with Lady Maria Grey.

271
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:04,979
<font color="#008000">What? Lord Templemore's daughter?</font>

272
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,780
<font color="yellow">Her father is dead.</font>
<font color="yellow">The present Earl is her brother.</font>

273
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:10,660
<font color="#008000">Well, yes. She's still</font>
<font color="#008000">Lord Templemore's daughter.</font>

274
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:12,979
<font color="#008000">Well, that's -</font>
<font color="#008000">that's very good, John.</font>

275
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,179
<font color="#008000">Well done, and congratulations. Ha!</font>

276
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:17,500
<font color="cyan">You sound astonished.</font>
<font color="cyan">Why shouldn't I marry Maria Grey?</font>

277
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,140
<font color="#008000">Well, no reason. No reason at all.</font>
<font color="#008000">It's a very good match.</font>

278
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:23,140
<font color="#008000">I say again, well done.</font>
<font color="#008000">And I mean it.</font>

279
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:24,740
<font color="yellow">It's a good match for her.</font>

280
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,939
<font color="yellow">The Templemores</font>
<font color="yellow">have no money to speak of,</font>

281
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:30,219
<font color="yellow">and she's marrying the future</font>
<font color="yellow">Earl of Brockenhurst, after all.</font>

282
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:36,819
<font color="#008000">So, what do you think of the work</font>
<font color="#008000">of the Ecclesiastical Commission?</font>

283
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:39,300
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

284
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:41,699
<font color="#008000">Are its reforms working?</font>

285
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,900
<font color="#008000">In placating the dissidents?</font>
<font color="#008000">In containing the Oxford Movement?</font>

286
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:46,179
<font color="yellow">What do I care about any of it?</font>

287
00:16:46,219 --> 00:16:48,900
<font color="yellow">Just as long as I don't have to</font>
<font color="yellow">give any more damn sermons!</font>

288
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:51,620
<font color="#008000">If you're not interested</font>
<font color="#008000">in the doctrine,</font>

289
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,900
<font color="#008000">why did you join the Church?</font>
<font color="yellow">Why do you think?</font>

290
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:57,339
<font color="yellow">Because I'm the younger son</font>
<font color="yellow">of an Earl.</font>

291
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,139
Emma is to have another child.

292
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,379
<font color="cyan">You'll be a grandmother</font>
<font color="cyan">five times over.</font>

293
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:05,020
<font color="cyan">Think of that.</font>

294
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,540
<font color="yellow">They're hoping for another boy.</font>

295
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,980
<font color="cyan">Well, I shall write to her.</font>

296
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,780
<font color="yellow">Hugo's very keen on a second boy.</font>
<font color="yellow">He loves the girls, of course,</font>

297
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,579
<font color="yellow">but he doesn't want</font>
<font color="yellow">to take any chances.</font>

298
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,460
<font color="yellow">"I want an heir and a spare,"</font>
<font color="yellow">he keeps saying.</font>

299
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,220
HE LAUGHS

300
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,659
<font color="yellow">An heir and a spare.</font>

301
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,899
<font color="yellow">I wonder, dear brother,</font>

302
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,139
<font color="yellow">i-if I might have a little word</font>
<font color="yellow">in private later?</font>

303
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,819
<font color="#008000">Aren't we in private now?</font>

304
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,819
<font color="#008000">We all know</font>
<font color="#008000">you want to talk about money.</font>

305
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,220
<font color="#008000">All right, let's have it.</font>

306
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,099
<font color="yellow">We mustn't bore the ladies.</font>

307
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:52,260
<font color="#008000">You don't mind boring me.</font>

308
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,300
<font color="yellow">If - if we could...</font>
<font color="yellow">i-if we could just...</font>

309
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,099
Come on. Come on, out with it.
<font color="cyan">What my father is asking for</font>

310
00:17:57,139 --> 00:17:59,059
<font color="cyan">is a loan</font>
<font color="cyan">against my future inheritance.</font>

311
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:00,579
<font color="#008000">Your inheritance, or his?</font>

312
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,099
<font color="cyan">Our inheritance.</font>

313
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:07,180
<font color="#008000">You're saying he wants another loan</font>
<font color="#008000">against your inheritance.</font>

314
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,579
<font color="cyan">Very well, then, another loan.</font>

315
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:11,899
<font color="#008000">I think my little brother</font>
<font color="#008000">has chipped away</font>

316
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,659
<font color="#008000">at his prospects</font>
<font color="#008000">quite substantially already.</font>

317
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,540
<font color="yellow">You will agree</font>
<font color="yellow">that the family's honour</font>

318
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:18,059
<font color="yellow">demands we keep up appearances.</font>

319
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:20,260
<font color="#008000">No, no, no. I don't agree at all.</font>

320
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,980
<font color="#008000">Any kind of show</font>
<font color="#008000">in a man of the cloth</font>

321
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,980
<font color="#008000">is neither expected, nor liked,</font>
<font color="#008000">by the public.</font>

322
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,619
<font color="#008000">What are you spending it on?</font>
<font color="yellow">Nothing you'd disapprove of.</font>

323
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,139
<font color="yellow">You've released funds in the past.</font>
<font color="#008000">Oh, yes,</font>

324
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,020
<font color="#008000">many times. Too many.</font>

325
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,339
<font color="#008000">I think you should stay down here,</font>

326
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:41,379
<font color="#008000">attend to your Church duties</font>
<font color="#008000">and not go up to London so much.</font>

327
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,899
<font color="yellow">Tell me about Maria Grey.</font>

328
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,099
<font color="yellow">I thought</font>
<font color="yellow">she'd only just been presented.</font>

329
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:50,780
No, no.

330
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:53,780
She's quite out by now. She's 21.

331
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:55,540
<font color="yellow">How time flies.</font>

332
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:58,980
<font color="yellow">I'm surprised Lady Templemore</font>
<font color="yellow">said nothing to me.</font>

333
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,619
Perhaps she was waiting
till things were quite settled.

334
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:05,899
<font color="yellow">And are they settled now?</font>

335
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,379
They will be, soon.

336
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:11,419
And after that,
we'll announce it properly.

337
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,260
<font color="yellow">You must feel very proud, John.</font>

338
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,859
<font color="cyan">Of what?</font>

339
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:19,460
<font color="yellow">Of convincing such a lovely girl</font>
<font color="yellow">to be your wife.</font>

340
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,180
HE CHUCKLES
<font color="cyan">Yes.</font>

341
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,419
<font color="cyan">Yes, I suppose I am.</font>

342
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:30,139
<font color="yellow">You've been very quiet.</font>
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

343
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,700
<font color="#008000">Why does my brother,</font>

344
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,419
<font color="#008000">who has never said or done anything</font>
<font color="#008000">of the slightest value...</font>

345
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,579
<font color="#008000">..live to see</font>
<font color="#008000">his children make fine marriages</font>

346
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:45,419
<font color="#008000">and his grandchildren</font>
<font color="#008000">round his chair?</font>

347
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,700
<font color="yellow">Oh, my dear.</font>

348
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,700
<font color="#008000">A house in Harley Street and</font>
<font color="#008000">a large rectory here in the village,</font>

349
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,220
<font color="#008000">and all he does is complain.</font>
<font color="yellow">And gamble.</font>

350
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,859
<font color="#008000">And yet he is allowed</font>
<font color="#008000">to have a family,</font>

351
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:57,540
<font color="#008000">and I am not.</font>

352
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:03,339
<font color="#008000">No, I'm sorry.</font>

353
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:05,619
<font color="#008000">Well, I... I'm just a silly old man.</font>

354
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:09,659
<font color="#008000">But sometimes I can't help</font>
<font color="#008000">but rail at the injustice of it.</font>

355
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:12,139
<font color="yellow">You think I don't?</font>

356
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:19,659
<font color="#008000">Do you ever wonder</font>
<font color="#008000">what he'd be like now?</font>

357
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,460
<font color="#008000">Married, of course.</font>

358
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,180
<font color="#008000">Clever sons and pretty daughters.</font>

359
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,419
<font color="yellow">Or perhaps clever daughters</font>
<font color="yellow">and pretty sons.</font>

360
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,300
<font color="#008000">The point is, he's not here.</font>

361
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,540
<font color="#008000">Our boy is gone.</font>

362
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:41,020
<font color="#008000">I don't understand...</font>

363
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:43,059
<font color="#008000">why it happened to us.</font>

364
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,059
<font color="cyan">A peace offering?</font>

365
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,540
I can't pretend, James.

366
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:55,139
SHE SIGHS

367
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,379
It's brought it all back.
My anger, along with the rest.

368
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:02,859
You persuaded her
into a false marriage,

369
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:04,659
and in the process, ruined her.

370
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,260
<font color="cyan">I didn't persuade her.</font>
<font color="cyan">She persuaded me.</font>

371
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,220
What is it?

372
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,980
<font color="cyan">A ticket for the Horticultural</font>
<font color="cyan">Society's new botanical gardens.</font>

373
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,659
How did you get it?

374
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,859
<font color="cyan">The Cubitts</font>
<font color="cyan">are among their supporters.</font>

375
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,020
<font color="cyan">Am I forgiven, then?</font>

376
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:35,819
<font color="cyan">You could take Susan.</font>

377
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,740
SHE CHUCKLES

378
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,740
Susan dislikes flowers.

379
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,300
She can't see beauty in anything

380
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:44,700
she hasn't seen
in Mr Asprey's window.

381
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,859
Poor Oliver.
<font color="cyan">Hmm.</font>

382
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:51,980
<font color="cyan">After the other night,</font>
<font color="cyan">I was wondering how to help him.</font>

383
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,659
What have you come up with?

384
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,260
<font color="cyan">Cubitt's had an interesting idea</font>

385
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,899
<font color="cyan">to do something</font>
<font color="cyan">with the Isle of Dogs.</font>

386
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,819
The Isle of Dogs? Really?

387
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:03,020
<font color="cyan">The new docks</font>
<font color="cyan">have made a big difference.</font>

388
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,300
<font color="cyan">He wants to build</font>
<font color="cyan">a solid community there.</font>

389
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:06,980
<font color="cyan">It's exciting.</font>

390
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,500
<font color="cyan">Perhaps I can bring Oliver into it.</font>

391
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,899
You're welcome to try.

392
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,540
It doesn't sound like
his sort of thing at all.

393
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:16,899
<font color="cyan">Perhaps he should be a little less</font>
<font color="cyan">choosy about what interests him.</font>

394
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,180
Well...

395
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,139
..I suppose it won't hurt.

396
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:35,529
<font color="#008000">All alone, Mrs Babbage?</font>
<font color="yellow">So I am.</font>

397
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:38,130
<font color="yellow">Mrs Frant's gone shopping</font>
<font color="yellow">for some bits and bobs.</font>

398
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,890
<font color="#008000">Might this be a moment for us</font>
<font color="#008000">to do a little business, I wonder?</font>

399
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,089
<font color="yellow">There's two shoulders of lamb</font>
<font color="yellow">in there, and a leg.</font>

400
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,289
<font color="yellow">No doubt you can add</font>
<font color="yellow">some bottles to it.</font>

401
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:57,690
<font color="#008000">I can, and I'll do it now.</font>
<font color="yellow">It's all up from Glanville,</font>

402
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,490
<font color="yellow">so it needs to be eaten</font>
<font color="yellow">straight away.</font>

403
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:02,049
<font color="#008000">What does Mrs Frant say</font>
<font color="#008000">when she sees the food's gone?</font>

404
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,849
<font color="yellow">She knows better than to ask.</font>

405
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,250
<font color="#008000">I'll take it round now.</font>
<font color="#008000">They pay well for country meat.</font>

406
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:08,450
That looks heavy.
<font color="#008000">It is.</font>

407
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,730
<font color="#008000">So I'll get it out of your way.</font>
<font color="#008000">I won't be too long.</font>

408
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:13,369
<font color="yellow">No hurry, Mr Turton.</font>
<font color="yellow">The Mistress is on her way to Kew,</font>

409
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,369
<font color="yellow">and the Master</font>
<font color="yellow">won't be back before six.</font>

410
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:20,930
You want to watch yourself.

411
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,970
One day, Mistress will come down
and ask to be shown

412
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:28,410
what's been delivered
from her beloved Glanville.

413
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,329
<font color="yellow">Then Mrs Frant will deal with her</font>
<font color="yellow">enquiries, won't she, Miss Ellis?</font>

414

GENTLE MUSIC PLAYS

415
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:12,849
Mr Paxton, I was hoping I'd see you.

416
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,769
<font color="cyan">Mrs Trenchard, how are you?</font>

417
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:17,170
Oh, I wish you could see the gardens
at Glanville.

418
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,809
There isn't a corner that has not
benefitted from your advice.

419
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:23,130
<font color="cyan">One day.</font>
<font color="#008000">Oh, there you are, Paxton.</font>

420
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,130
<font color="#008000">I've been looking everywhere</font>
<font color="#008000">for you.</font>

421
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,529
<font color="#008000">Have you heard the news?</font>
<font color="cyan">What news is that, Your Grace?</font>

422
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:31,890
<font color="#008000">They've taken all the citrus</font>
<font color="#008000">out of the orangery.</font>

423
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,450
<font color="#008000">Too dark in there.</font>

424
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,809
<font color="#008000">They didn't have the advantage</font>
<font color="#008000">of your planning.</font>

425
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,569
<font color="cyan">Your Grace, Your Ladyship,</font>

426
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,410
<font color="cyan">may I present</font>
<font color="cyan">a keen and talented gardener?</font>

427
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,650
<font color="cyan">Mrs Trenchard,</font>

428
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,970
<font color="cyan">The Duke of Devonshire</font>
<font color="cyan">and Lady Brockenhurst.</font>

429
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:48,130
<font color="#008000">A pleasure, Mrs Trenchard.</font>
<font color="yellow">Mrs Trenchard and I are old friends.</font>

430
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,650
<font color="#008000">Excellent!</font>

431
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,289
<font color="#008000">Shall we go and see what</font>
<font color="#008000">they've done to the conservatory?</font>

432
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,849
Are you interested in Kew?

433
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,769
<font color="yellow">The Duke was good enough</font>
<font color="yellow">to ask for my help</font>

434
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:00,329
<font color="yellow">when the Horticultural Society</font>

435
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:02,289
<font color="yellow">first took on</font>
<font color="yellow">the management of the garden.</font>

436
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,569
<font color="yellow">Mrs Trenchard...</font>

437
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:07,849
<font color="yellow">That man we were talking about</font>
<font color="yellow">the other day...</font>

438
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,130
Charles Pope?
<font color="yellow">The very one.</font>

439
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,009
<font color="yellow">Mr Charles Pope.</font>

440
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,809
What about him?

441
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,170
<font color="yellow">I have forgotten where he lives,</font>
<font color="yellow">this Mr Pope.</font>

442
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,329
I am not sure of the address.

443
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,529
<font color="yellow">What about his parents?</font>

444
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:26,769
<font color="yellow">I remember the father</font>
<font color="yellow">was a clergyman.</font>

445
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:31,009
The Reverend Benjamin Pope.
<font color="yellow">And the county?</font>

446
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,210
Surrey.
<font color="yellow">There we are.</font>

447
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,049
<font color="yellow">That didn't hurt too much, did it?</font>

448
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:41,690
BUSTLING STREET

<font color="cyan">Anything while I've been out,</font>
<font color="cyan">Brodsworth?</font>

450
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,369
<font color="#008000">Yes, Mr Pope.</font>
<font color="#008000">You've got a visitor.</font>

451
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,970
<font color="cyan">I wasn't expecting anyone, was I?</font>

452
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,529
<font color="#008000">Well, you weren't expecting her.</font>

453
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:16,529
<font color="#008000">It's the Countess of Brockenhurst.</font>
<font color="cyan">What?</font>

454
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,490
<font color="cyan">Lady Brockenhurst.</font>

455
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:23,769
<font color="cyan">I' m terribly sorry</font>
<font color="cyan">to have kept you waiting.</font>

456
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,410
<font color="yellow">Since I made no appointment,</font>
<font color="yellow">there's no need to apologise.</font>

457
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:32,849
<font color="cyan">Are you all right?</font>

458
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,130
<font color="cyan">You look as if you've seen a ghost.</font>

EXHALES

460
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,009
<font color="yellow">You remind me of someone</font>
<font color="yellow">I used to know. That's all.</font>

461
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:42,250
<font color="cyan">Someone nice, I hope?</font>

462
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:44,529
<font color="yellow">Very nice.</font>

463
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:48,210
<font color="cyan">Now, what can I offer you?</font>

464
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,490
<font color="cyan">I have tea. I have coffee...</font>

465
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:52,170
<font color="yellow">No. No, thank you, nothing.</font>

466
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:04,569
<font color="yellow">I dare say</font>
<font color="yellow">you're surprised to see me,</font>

467
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:06,970
<font color="yellow">but I've been curious to meet you.</font>

468
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:09,410
<font color="cyan">Have you? Why?</font>

469
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,049
<font color="cyan">How on earth</font>
<font color="cyan">did I come to your notice?</font>

470
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,410
<font color="yellow">I've heard you talked of.</font>

471
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,250
<font color="yellow">People say you have a future.</font>

472
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:19,450
<font color="yellow">Lord Brockenhurst and I like to</font>
<font color="yellow">help young men who are on their way.</font>

473
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,130
<font color="cyan">I see.</font>

474
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,369
<font color="yellow">So, tell me about yourself, Mr Pope.</font>

475
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,849
<font color="yellow">Who are you? Where are you from?</font>

476
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,329
<font color="cyan">Where am I from?</font>

477
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:30,970
<font color="cyan">It is not a very interesting story.</font>

478
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:33,490
<font color="cyan">I am from Surrey,</font>
<font color="cyan">the son of a vicar.</font>

479
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:35,450
<font color="yellow">There's nothing wrong with that.</font>

480
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,049
<font color="cyan">Well, actually, my real father</font>
<font color="cyan">was dead when I was born.</font>

481
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:41,009
<font color="cyan">So his cousin,</font>
<font color="cyan">the Reverend Benjamin Pope,</font>

482
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:43,690
<font color="cyan">brought me up.</font>
<font color="cyan">I think of him as my father,</font>

483
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,250
<font color="cyan">but, sadly, he is also gone now.</font>

484
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,730
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

485
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,450
<font color="cyan">What else have you heard about me?</font>

486
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:54,049
<font color="yellow">I know that you've bought a mill</font>
<font color="yellow">in Manchester,</font>

487
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,609
<font color="yellow">and that you're looking</font>
<font color="yellow">for a regular supplier of cotton.</font>

488
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,769
<font color="cyan">This is astonishing.</font>

489
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,369
<font color="yellow">And I understand you've decided</font>
<font color="yellow">on India for your suppliers.</font>

490
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,730
<font color="cyan">Much more, and I'll ask you</font>
<font color="cyan">to sit on the board!</font>

491
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:04,329
THEY CHUCKLE

492
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:06,009
<font color="yellow">I... I won't keep you too long,</font>
<font color="yellow">but...</font>

493
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:09,569
<font color="yellow">I would like you to send me</font>
<font color="yellow">whatever you think would be useful,</font>

494
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:12,849
<font color="yellow">and then I'll come back to you</font>
<font color="yellow">with my decision.</font>

495
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,609
<font color="cyan">What decision?</font>

496
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,369
<font color="yellow">As to whether or not</font>
<font color="yellow">we should invest in your company.</font>

497
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:26,250
<font color="yellow">Mr Pope,</font>

498
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:28,410
<font color="yellow">I am giving an At Home on Tuesday.</font>

499
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,769
<font color="yellow">I generally receive</font>

500
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,450
<font color="yellow">on the second Tuesday of every month</font>
<font color="yellow">during the season.</font>

501
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,930
<font color="yellow">I wonder if you might like to come.</font>

502
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,329
<font color="cyan">Me?</font>
<font color="yellow">It starts at ten.</font>

503
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:40,970
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't dine too heartily</font>
<font color="yellow">beforehand,</font>

504
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:42,569
<font color="yellow">as there will be a supper</font>
<font color="yellow">at midnight.</font>

505
00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:44,569
<font color="cyan">I don't quite understand.</font>
<font color="yellow">Mr Pope,</font>

506
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:48,130
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you to a party.</font>
<font color="yellow">Is that so very puzzling?</font>

507
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:51,450
<font color="cyan">I should be delighted, m'lady.</font>

508
00:28:58,849 --> 00:29:01,529
NOISY, BUSTLING STREET

509
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,170
<font color="#008000">How did you know where to find me?</font>
You're always here.

510
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:18,170
Who's paying for this feed?
You or me?

511
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,450
<font color="#008000">You. Want some of this?</font>

512
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,769
No, I'll wait
until they bring my luncheon.

513
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:24,690
<font color="#008000">All right, suit yourself.</font>

514
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,170
Your mother wants to invite

Lady Maria and her mother
for dinner,

516
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,890
and she needs you to suggest a date.

517
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,569
<font color="#008000">Shouldn't we just...</font>
<font color="#008000">wait till everything's agreed?</font>

518
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,250
What's the matter, John?

519
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:38,890
Why aren't you happier?

520
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,529
Maria seems a nice girl to me,
and very pretty.

521
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:43,009
<font color="#008000">Mm.</font>

523
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,369
<font color="#008000">to do with as one likes,</font>

524
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,410
<font color="#008000">it rather takes the sport out of it.</font>
<font color="#008000">At least, it does to me.</font>

525
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,049
<font color="#008000">Anyway, Uncle Peregrine is pleased,</font>
<font color="#008000">which is all that really matters.</font>

526
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:59,170
Well, you'll grow to like her,
I'm sure.

527
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,329
<font color="#008000">Really? As much as you like Mama?</font>

530
00:30:10,329 --> 00:30:12,849
<font color="yellow">A footman brought it</font>
<font color="yellow">from Brockenhurst House.</font>

531
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,730
<font color="cyan">Is it an invitation?</font>

532
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:19,890
What are you doing there?

533
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,809
<font color="cyan">Are you invited to dinner?</font>

534
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:23,329
No, to a reception after dinner.

535
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:25,690
Although I dare say there will
be something to eat later on.

536
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,410
But I'm not sure we'll go.

537
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,730
<font color="cyan">Not go?</font>

538
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:30,650
We barely know her.

539
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,890
And it's hard
to get up much enthusiasm for...

540
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,210
for something that begins
so late in the evening.

541
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,009
<font color="cyan">But surely you...</font>
What is it you're trying to ask?

542
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:41,730
<font color="cyan">I just hoped that Oliver and I...</font>

543
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:44,849
<font color="cyan">might be included in the invitation.</font>

544
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,130
But you're not.

545
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,849
<font color="cyan">Please don't make me beg, Mother.</font>

546
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,089
<font color="cyan">Would it be so terribly difficult</font>
<font color="cyan">for you to write and ask?</font>

547
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,890
<font color="yellow">I suppose</font>
<font color="yellow">they're moving up in the world,</font>

548
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,490
<font color="yellow">if the Countess of Brockenhurst</font>
<font color="yellow">deigns to know them.</font>

549
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,809
<font color="#008000">That's what the Master will think,</font>
<font color="#008000">anyway.</font>

550
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:07,490
BELL RINGS

551
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:10,130
Why does Lady Brockenhurst
want to bother with them?

552
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,730
What have the Trenchards
got to give the Brockenhursts?

553
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:15,809
<font color="cyan">Why? Do you only make friends</font>
<font color="cyan">where there's something to gain?</font>

554
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:17,769
<font color="#008000">It's the times we live in.</font>

555
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,289
<font color="#008000">New folk coming up</font>
<font color="#008000">and overtaking the old.</font>

556
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:21,769
<font color="yellow">Brockenhurst House again.</font>

557
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:25,529
That's the invitation
for Mr and Mrs Oliver. You'll see.

558
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:27,410
DOOR KNOCKS

559
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,849
I think I have everything I need.

560
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,210
<font color="yellow">They brought this round just now,</font>
<font color="yellow">from Brockenhurst House.</font>

561
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:38,289
I see.

562
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:42,369
You may go.
Goodnight, Ellis, and thank you.

563
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,250
DOOR OPENS

564
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:01,089
CLEARS HIS THROAT

565
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:04,410
<font color="cyan">Well, well. Susan will be pleased.</font>

566
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,049
We shouldn't go.
<font color="cyan">Of course we should go.</font>

567
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:09,250
<font color="cyan">Why do you think we've been asked?</font>

568
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:13,369
<font color="cyan">Did she take a shine to you</font>
<font color="cyan">when you met?</font>

569
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,809
Whether she did or not,

570
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,730
it seems awkward and wrong
to accept, knowing what we know.

571
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,009
<font color="cyan">Well, I don't agree.</font>

572
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:22,609
<font color="cyan">And besides, Lady Brockenhurst</font>
<font color="cyan">doesn't know what we know.</font>

573
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:38,060
HORSES' HOOVES CLATTER

574
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,820
<font color="cyan">Quirk! Be back here by one o'clock.</font>

575
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,659
<font color="cyan">We won't leave before then.</font>
<font color="#008000">Very good, sir.</font>

576
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:06,060
<font color="cyan">I wonder how many people dined here</font>
<font color="cyan">before the crowd arrived.</font>

577
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,939
STRING ORCHESTRA
PLAYS BRIGHT MUSIC

<font color="#008000">Mr and Mrs James Trenchard.</font>

579
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,900
<font color="#008000">Mr and Mrs Oliver Trenchard.</font>

580
00:33:21,939 --> 00:33:23,820
<font color="yellow">How good of you to come.</font>

581
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,620
What beautiful flowers!
And what a heavenly scent.

582
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:29,419
<font color="yellow">Yes, they were brought up</font>
<font color="yellow">from Lymington this morning.</font>

583
00:33:29,459 --> 00:33:31,620
<font color="yellow">I don't believe</font>
<font color="yellow">I've met your husband.</font>

584
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:34,860
Lady Brockenhurst,
may I present Mr Trenchard.

585
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:37,259
<font color="cyan">Lady Brockenhurst,</font>

586
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,540
<font color="cyan">it is very gracious of you</font>
<font color="cyan">to invite us to your charming home.</font>

587
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,060
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

588
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,820
<font color="yellow">I doubt the house holds</font>
<font color="yellow">many secrets for you, Mr Trenchard,</font>

589
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,179
<font color="yellow">since you built it.</font>
THEY CHUCKLE

590
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:52,540
<font color="cyan">May I present my son,</font>
<font color="cyan">Mr Oliver Trenchard, and his wife.</font>

591
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,179
<font color="#008000">Countess,</font>
<font color="#008000">what a beautiful drawing room.</font>

592
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:58,459
<font color="yellow">So, Mr Trenchard, tell me,</font>

593
00:33:58,499 --> 00:34:01,059
<font color="yellow">do you share the same interests</font>
<font color="yellow">as your father?</font>

594
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:04,380
<font color="cyan">Oliver works for me.</font>
<font color="cyan">Or, should I say, works with me.</font>

595
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,740
<font color="cyan">At the moment,</font>
<font color="cyan">we are engaged on a new project,</font>

596
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,579
<font color="cyan">developing the Isle of Dogs.</font>
<font color="yellow">The Isle of Dogs?</font>

597
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:11,539
<font color="cyan">It's in East London.</font>

598
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:13,260
<font color="yellow">East London?</font>

599
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,260
<font color="cyan">We're creating a new embankment,</font>
<font color="cyan">with business properties</font>

600
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,260
<font color="cyan">and workers' cottages, and, indeed,</font>
<font color="cyan">houses for management, and so on.</font>

601
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,900
<font color="cyan">And we're expanding the docks.</font>

602
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:23,419
James...
<font color="cyan">It's true.</font>

603
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:25,220
<font color="cyan">The ships have run out of room.</font>

604
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,260
<font color="cyan">They need new places</font>
<font color="cyan">to load and unload,</font>

605
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,979
<font color="cyan">with all the trade that's coming in</font>
<font color="cyan">from all over the world.</font>

606
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:33,499
<font color="cyan">The further the Empire expands...</font>
<font color="yellow">How exciting you make it sound.</font>

607
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,019
<font color="yellow">Would you excuse me?</font>

608
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,579
Mr and Mrs John Grant.

609
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:41,220
CHATTER

610
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:45,820
<font color="#008000">What sort of person</font>
<font color="#008000">has their fires lit in high summer?</font>

611
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,660
<font color="#008000">It's stifling in here.</font>

612
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,900
<font color="#008000">Oliver, let's go through.</font>

613
00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:56,019
I'd rather we stay here,
to watch the arrivals.

614
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:58,260
There may be someone we know
who can lend us face.

615
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:03,700
<font color="yellow">Mr Trenchard? I'm Stephen Bellasis.</font>

616
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,860
The Reverend Mr Bellasis
is the brother of our host.

617
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,059
<font color="yellow">Just so.</font>
<font color="yellow">I gather you're Cubitt's man?</font>

618
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:11,979
<font color="yellow">Responsible</font>
<font color="yellow">for turning the streets of London</font>

619
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:13,860
<font color="yellow">into a white colonnade overnight.</font>

620
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,820
<font color="cyan">What we do seems to be popular,</font>
<font color="cyan">Reverend.</font>

621
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,820
<font color="yellow">Riot is popular, sir.</font>
<font color="yellow">Revolution is popular.</font>

622
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,740
<font color="yellow">What sort of test is that?</font>

623
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,619
<font color="#008000">We understand from Lady Brockenhurst</font>

624
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,300
<font color="#008000">that you knew our poor nephew,</font>
<font color="#008000">Lord Bellasis.</font>

625
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,459
Yes. We knew him well.

626
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:32,499
But I'm afraid
it was a long time ago.

627
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:34,900
<font color="yellow">Now there's only my son John</font>

628
00:35:34,939 --> 00:35:37,059
<font color="yellow">between this family and extinction.</font>

629
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:40,579
<font color="yellow">That's him over there,</font>
<font color="yellow">talking to the pretty woman in pink.</font>

630
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:42,780
<font color="cyan">That pretty woman</font>
<font color="cyan">is my daughter-in-law.</font>

631
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,419
<font color="cyan">He looks to be entertaining her</font>
<font color="cyan">rather well.</font>

632
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:48,019
<font color="#008000">John is about to announce</font>
<font color="#008000">his engagement.</font>

633
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:51,059
The Countess of Templemore
and Lady Maria Grey.

00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:53,059
<font color="#008000">Oh, here they are!</font>

MUTED CHATTER

636
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:03,860
<font color="yellow">We've been looking for you.</font>
Good evening, to both of you.

637
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,300
<font color="yellow">Say "Good evening" to John, dear.</font>
<font color="#008000">Good evening.</font>

638
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,700
Did you have a pleasant journey?
<font color="#008000">We should have walked.</font>

639
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,260
<font color="#008000">It took twice as long in a carriage.</font>
Ah!

640
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,860
<font color="cyan">The Isle of Dogs</font>
<font color="cyan">may not seem so inspiring a place,</font>

641
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,059
<font color="cyan">but I can assure you</font>
<font color="cyan">that when we are finished,</font>

00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,419
<font color="cyan">the whole area</font>

<font color="yellow">You came!</font>

646
00:36:34,419 --> 00:36:36,579
<font color="yellow">Let me introduce you to some people,</font>
<font color="yellow">come with me.</font>

647
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,860
<font color="yellow">Mrs Trenchard...</font>

648
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:46,099
<font color="yellow">may I present a new acquaintance?</font>
<font color="yellow">Mr Charles Pope.</font>

649
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:48,139
<font color="#008000">Mr Trenchard?</font>
<font color="#008000">What are you doing here?</font>

650
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,780
GLASS SMASHES

651
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,459
<font color="yellow">Well, this is amusing.</font>

652
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:55,619
<font color="yellow">There was I,</font>
<font color="yellow">thinking Mr Pope was my secret,</font>

653
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,820
<font color="yellow">only to find</font>
<font color="yellow">that you're well acquainted.</font>

654
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:01,300
<font color="yellow">How funny.</font>
<font color="yellow">How long have you known each other?</font>

655
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,820
<font color="cyan">Not long.</font>
<font color="#008000">A while.</font>

656
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,260
<font color="yellow">Not long? A while?</font>
Yes, dear, do tell me.

657
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,419
How long have you known Mr Pope?

658
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:13,660
<font color="cyan">Well, I knew his father. And, erm,</font>
<font color="cyan">when Charles came to London,</font>

659
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,900
<font color="cyan">I felt it my duty to lend a hand,</font>
<font color="cyan">if I could.</font>

660
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:21,139
And did you?
<font color="cyan">Did I what?</font>

661
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:23,180
Lend a hand.

662
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,340
<font color="#008000">Very much so.</font>

663
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,539
<font color="#008000">I'd gained a place in a bank,</font>
<font color="#008000">but when I got to London,</font>

664
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,979
<font color="#008000">it didn't take me long to realise</font>
<font color="#008000">I was playing the wrong game.</font>

665
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:31,539
<font color="#008000">Mr Trenchard rescued me.</font>

00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:33,419
<font color="#008000">He helped get my own business</font>
<font color="#008000">up and running.</font>

667
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,579
<font color="#008000">I couldn't have managed without him.</font>

668
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:38,220
<font color="#008000">It is the same venture you're</font>
<font color="#008000">interested in, Lady Brockenhurst.</font>

669
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,939
In what way are you...

670
00:37:40,979 --> 00:37:42,380
interested?

671
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:44,660
<font color="yellow">Isn't London a tiny place?</font>

672
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,340
THEY LAUGH

673
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,220
Forgive me,
but I-I don't understand.

674
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,860
Are you and Mr Trenchard...

675
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:57,579
<font color="#008000">In business together?</font>
<font color="#008000">We are, in a way, I'm glad to say.</font>

676
00:37:57,619 --> 00:37:59,579
How long has this been going on?

677
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:03,419
<font color="cyan">Er, Mr Pope's father</font>
<font color="cyan">asked for my help.</font>

678
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:05,780
<font color="cyan">He has since died,</font>
<font color="cyan">and so, naturally,</font>

679
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,979
<font color="cyan">I take his request very seriously.</font>

680
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,780
<font color="cyan">And I'm glad to do so.</font>
<font color="yellow">There is Lord Brockenhurst.</font>

681
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,539
<font color="yellow">I... I want you to meet Mr Pope.</font>

682
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:15,260
Ah, Mr Pope.

683
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,180
<font color="#008000">Lovely to meet you.</font>
<font color="yellow">Come.</font>

684
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,019
<font color="cyan">Anne, I...</font>
I can't talk to you.

685
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:26,660
<font color="cyan">You knew he was coming here,</font>
<font color="cyan">didn't you?</font>

686
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,260
<font color="cyan">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

687
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,700
<font color="cyan">You have disobeyed my orders</font>
<font color="cyan">and told our hostess everything.</font>

688
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,380
Keep your voice down.
<font color="cyan">I thought we had an agreement.</font>

689
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,979
You are in no position
to lecture me.

690
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:40,860
You have built and enjoyed
a friendship with our grandson

691
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,139
that you have denied me,
most cruelly.

692
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:47,260
<font color="cyan">I invested in his business.</font>

693
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,419
<font color="cyan">I gave him advice.</font>

694
00:38:50,939 --> 00:38:53,780
<font color="cyan">Do you not think</font>
<font color="cyan">that Sophia would have wanted that?</font>

695
00:38:55,939 --> 00:38:58,660
LAUGHTER, CHATTER

696
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,300
<font color="#008000">Really, Mr Bellasis.</font>

697
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,220
<font color="#008000">You've made me offend</font>
<font color="#008000">nice Baron whatever-his-name-was.</font>

698
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,419
<font color="cyan">Hmm.</font>
<font color="#008000">Honestly.</font>

699
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:16,220
<font color="#008000">And I was on my best behaviour, too.</font>

700
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,619
<font color="cyan">Yes, I bet your behaviour's</font>
<font color="cyan">always pretty good, worse luck.</font>

701
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,660
<font color="#008000">Oh, quickly!</font>

702
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:32,740
<font color="cyan">That frightful old bore</font>
<font color="cyan">was headed straight towards us.</font>

703
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,180
<font color="cyan">It took me half an hour</font>
<font color="cyan">to shake him off the last time.</font>

704
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,459
<font color="#008000">That old bore was my father-in-law.</font>

705
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:39,939
<font color="cyan">Ha-ha-ha! Poor you.</font>

706
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:45,220
<font color="#008000">I know your type.</font>
<font color="#008000">You're just the sort of man</font>

707
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,180
<font color="#008000">to make me say all manner of things</font>
<font color="#008000">I don't want to say in the least.</font>

708
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,380
<font color="cyan">Yes, and I hope I can make you</font>
<font color="cyan">do all manner of things</font>

709
00:39:51,419 --> 00:39:53,019
<font color="cyan">you don't want to do in the least.</font>

DOOR OPENS

711
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:08,300
<font color="yellow">Oh, er, sorry. Do I disturb you?</font>

712
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,820
<font color="#008000">Not at all. I'm afraid</font>
<font color="#008000">it's I who am disturbing you.</font>

713
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,019
<font color="#008000">If you'd rather be alone...?</font>
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

714
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:15,340
<font color="#008000">I suspect your mother</font>
<font color="#008000">would prefer you to be alone,</font>

715
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,139
<font color="#008000">or at least not with a strange man</font>
<font color="#008000">to whom you haven't been introduced.</font>

716
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,939
<font color="yellow">My mother is deep in conversation</font>
<font color="yellow">with an aged great aunt,</font>

717
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:24,139
<font color="yellow">who will not release her</font>
<font color="yellow">without a fight.</font>

718
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,900
THEY LAUGH

719
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,340
<font color="#008000">Then perhaps</font>
<font color="#008000">we had better introduce ourselves.</font>

720
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:32,180
<font color="#008000">Charles Pope.</font>

721
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,539
<font color="yellow">Maria Grey.</font>

722
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:38,419
<font color="yellow">So, why are you hiding out here?</font>

723
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:39,900
<font color="#008000">Is it that obvious?</font>

724
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:41,700
CHUCKLES
<font color="yellow">I felt so sorry for you</font>

725
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:45,499
<font color="yellow">when you were being</font>
<font color="yellow">paraded around by our hostess.</font>

726
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:47,260
<font color="yellow">How do you know them?</font>
<font color="yellow">Are you related?</font>

727
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,939
<font color="#008000">Heavens, no.</font>

728
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,300
<font color="#008000">This isn't my natural habitat</font>
<font color="#008000">at all.</font>

729
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,220
<font color="#008000">I'm a very ordinary sort of fellow.</font>

730
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,619
<font color="yellow">Well, Lady Brockenhurst</font>
<font color="yellow">doesn't seem to think so.</font>

731
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,900
<font color="yellow">I've never seen her so animated.</font>

732
00:40:57,939 --> 00:41:00,099
<font color="yellow">She's not a woman</font>
<font color="yellow">known for her enthusiasms.</font>

733
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:02,300
<font color="#008000">You're right that she's</font>
<font color="#008000">taken an interest in my work,</font>

734
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,619
<font color="#008000">although I couldn't tell you why.</font>

735
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,099
<font color="yellow">Lady Brockenhurst has taken</font>
<font color="yellow">an interest in a business venture?</font>

736
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:08,419
<font color="#008000">You sound surprised.</font>

737
00:41:08,459 --> 00:41:11,780
<font color="yellow">I should be less surprised</font>
<font color="yellow">if she wanted to walk on the moon!</font>

738
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:14,740
<font color="#008000">I don't understand it, either.</font>

739
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,539
<font color="#008000">She seems enthused</font>
<font color="#008000">by the whole idea.</font>

740
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:18,780
<font color="yellow">What is the idea?</font>

741
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,340
<font color="#008000">I have bought a mill in Manchester.</font>

742
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,660
<font color="#008000">Now I need a better supply</font>
<font color="#008000">of raw cotton from India,</font>

743
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,619
<font color="#008000">and for that, I must have funding.</font>

744
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,340
<font color="#008000">But I'm determined that anyone who</font>
<font color="#008000">invests in me will not regret it.</font>

745
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,059
<font color="yellow">Of course you are.</font>

746
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:32,260
<font color="#008000">I don't know why I said all that.</font>

747
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,660
<font color="#008000">I seem to have told you everything</font>
<font color="#008000">there is to know about me.</font>

748
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,740
<font color="yellow">Not quite.</font>

749
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,419
<font color="yellow">I thought Indian cotton production</font>
<font color="yellow">was in disarray.</font>

750
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:42,220
<font color="yellow">Surely the shipping</font>
<font color="yellow">is too expensive to be worth it?</font>

751
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,820
<font color="#008000">How in heaven do you know that?</font>

759
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,820

<font color="yellow">to a milky white in the evening,</font>

764
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,059
<font color="yellow">to a gold when lit by the moon.</font>

768
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,579
<font color="yellow">That when they lose the right woman,</font>

769
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:29,340
<font color="yellow">they find her much harder to replace</font>
<font color="yellow">than they expected.</font>

770
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,539
THEY LAUGH

Maria?
<font color="yellow">Mama.</font>

772
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,979
They're calling us to supper.
And we must find John.

773
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:38,019
We've hardly spoken to him
all evening.

Do you think him dreary?

780
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:30,380
I don't.

00:43:30,419 --> 00:43:32,180

786
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,459
His name is Charles Pope.

787
00:43:42,499 --> 00:43:44,660
<font color="#008000">He was talking to your husband</font>

789
00:43:48,499 --> 00:43:51,380
No, he doesn't work for him.
He works for himself.

790
00:43:51,419 --> 00:43:53,340
They know each other.

791
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,979
They may have some project

00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:34,260
Come, my dear. John is not
interested in cotton merchants.

805
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,499
Are you?

What are you doing?

00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,380
<font color="yellow">I'm getting to know the grandson</font>
<font color="yellow">who's been concealed from me</font>

819
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:22,860
<font color="yellow">for a quarter of a century.</font>

820
00:45:23,979 --> 00:45:25,419
But why so publicly?

821
00:45:25,459 --> 00:45:27,139
Can't you see that half the room

822
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,139
is asking who
this strange young man could be?

823
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,619
<font color="yellow">Of course, that must worry you.</font>

<font color="yellow">Sophia's memory, your reputation.</font>

You want them to guess.

826
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,660
You want them to guess
he's Edmund's child,

827
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,619
and you wanted us to witness it.

828
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,539
Then you will not
have broken your word,

829
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:45,820
but the secret will be out.

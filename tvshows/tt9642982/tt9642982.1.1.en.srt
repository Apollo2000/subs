'It was certainly a city
right at the centre of things,

00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,569
'brim-full of tourists,
bustling with activity.

00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:54,889
'And no-one would have guessed
that the Emperor Napoleon

'was on the march

00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,850

Who the devil
has come to interrupt me...

16
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,490
Captain Cooper, you must excuse me.
<font color="cyan">That's all very well, Trenchard...</font>

17
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,929
Trenchard?
<font color="cyan">Mr Trenchard.</font>

18
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,490
<font color="cyan">But we must have the flour</font>
<font color="cyan">by tonight.</font>

00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,770
And I promise
I will do my level best, Captain.

00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:46,729
Now, if you'll just wait outside
for a moment.

Have you got them?

22
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:55,850
<font color="yellow">Three. One for you, one for Mama</font>
<font color="yellow">and one for me.</font>

23
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,770
I suppose Lord Bellasis will
be dining there, before the ball?

24
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:05,050
<font color="yellow">She is his aunt.</font>
Of course.

<font color="yellow">sometime after midnight.</font>

26
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,889
Don't call him Edmund
to anyone but me.

27
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,250
Now go to your mother.
She'll need every minute to prepare.

28
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:13,729
<font color="yellow">It's too late to have anything made.</font>

29
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:16,329
But not too late to have things
brought up to scratch.

30
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,489
She won't want to go.
She will, because she must.

31
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,930
<font color="yellow">Well... when shall we tell her</font>
<font color="yellow">the rest of it?</font>

32
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,690
Not yet.
It must all be properly managed.

33
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:27,049
We must take our lead from him.
Now go.

34
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,889
And send that blithering idiot
back in.

37
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:40,370

<font color="cyan">to find they're sharing a ballroom</font>

38
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,970
<font color="cyan">with a man who supplies their men</font>
<font color="cyan">with bread and ale.</font>

00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:45,169
<font color="yellow">I hope you won't take this tone</font>

40

<font color="cyan">Beware of castles in the air,</font>
<font color="cyan">my darling.</font>

41
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,530
<font color="yellow">Of course, you won't believe him</font>
<font color="yellow">capable of honourable intentions.</font>

42
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:55,370
<font color="cyan">He is the eldest son of an earl,</font>
<font color="cyan">my child.</font>

43
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,130
<font color="cyan">He cannot choose his wife</font>
<font color="cyan">to suit his heart.</font>

<font color="cyan">You have enjoyed a flirtation that</font>
<font color="cyan">has harmed neither of you, so far,</font>

45
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,769
<font color="cyan">but it must end,</font>

46
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,729
<font color="cyan">before there is damaging talk,</font>
<font color="cyan">Sophia,</font>

47
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,250
<font color="cyan">or you will be the one to suffer.</font>

48
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,009
<font color="yellow">And it doesn't tell you anything?</font>

49
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,650
<font color="yellow">That he has secured us</font>
<font color="yellow">invitations to his aunt's ball?</font>

50
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,329
<font color="cyan">It tells me</font>
<font color="cyan">that you're a lovely girl</font>

51
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,049
<font color="cyan">and he wishes to please you.</font>

52
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,810
<font color="cyan">He couldn't have managed it</font>
<font color="cyan">in London,</font>

53
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,090
<font color="cyan">but in Brussels</font>
<font color="cyan">everything is coloured by war.</font>

54
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,090
<font color="cyan">And so, the normal rules</font>
<font color="cyan">do not apply.</font>

55
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,690
<font color="yellow">You mean that by the normal rules</font>

56
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,729
<font color="yellow">we are not acceptable as company</font>
<font color="yellow">for the Duchess's friends?</font>

57
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,210
<font color="cyan">That is exactly what I mean</font>
<font color="cyan">and you know it to be true.</font>

58
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,650
<font color="yellow">Papa would not agree.</font>

59
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:35,130
<font color="cyan">Your father has travelled a long way</font>

60
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:37,329
<font color="cyan">and so he does not see</font>
<font color="cyan">the natural barriers</font>

61
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,289
<font color="cyan">that will prevent him</font>
<font color="cyan">from going much further.</font>

62
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,049
<font color="cyan">Be content with who we are.</font>

63
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,769
<font color="cyan">Your father has done well.</font>
<font color="cyan">Don't look down on us.</font>

64
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,489
<font color="yellow">You're the one who looks down.</font>

65
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,930
<font color="yellow">The schoolmaster's daughter</font>
<font color="yellow">who was too good</font>

66
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,090
<font color="yellow">for her market trader husband.</font>

67

<font color="cyan">I don't look down on anyone!</font>
<font color="cyan">Least of all your father.</font>

68
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,810
<font color="cyan">I do not care to place myself</font>

<font color="cyan">in situations</font>
<font color="cyan">I don't feel comfortable.</font>

70
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,569
<font color="yellow">You see, that to me,</font>
<font color="yellow">is another kind of snobbery!</font>

71
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:04,970
<font color="#008000">Am I too early, Ma'am?</font>

74
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,090
<font color="cyan">We've been asked</font>
<font color="cyan">to the Duchess of Richmond's ball.</font>

75
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:25,129
<font color="#008000">Never!</font>

76
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,770
<font color="#008000">That is, we should make a decision</font>

77
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:31,970
<font color="#008000">I'll need some time,</font>
<font color="#008000">if it's to be just so.</font>

78
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:41,249

00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:42,650
<font color="#008000">excited.</font>

80
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:45,330
<font color="#008000">I expect Lord Bellasis</font>
<font color="#008000">arranged the tickets for the ball?</font>

81
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,129
<font color="cyan">It may have been</font>
<font color="cyan">the Duke of Wellington.</font>

82
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:51,169
<font color="cyan">Mr Trenchard</font>
<font color="cyan">is a great favourite of his</font>

83
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,369
<font color="cyan">and the ball</font>
<font color="cyan">is being given in the Duke's honour.</font>

84
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,809
<font color="#008000">Yes. That must be it, ma'am.</font>

85
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,929
She told you, then? He's done it.

86
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,289
<font color="cyan">Thank you, Ellis.</font>
<font color="cyan">If you could come back later.</font>

87
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,489
What a chance it is.
The Duke himself will be there.

88
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,090
Two dukes, for that matter.

89
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:13,090
My commander
and our hostess' husband.

90
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:14,570
Reigning princes, too.

91
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:17,609
James Trenchard, who started
at a stall in Covent Garden,

92
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,929
must get himself ready
to dance with a princess.

93
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,929
<font color="cyan">You will do no such thing.</font>
<font color="cyan">You would embarrass us both.</font>

94
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,650
We'll see.
<font color="cyan">I mean it.</font>

95
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,090
<font color="cyan">It's bad enough</font>
<font color="cyan">that you encourage Sophia.</font>

96
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:31,689
Anne, I believe the boy is sincere.
I'm sure of it, in fact.

97
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:33,129
<font color="cyan">You are nothing of the sort.</font>

98
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,570
<font color="cyan">Lord Bellasis, himself,</font>
<font color="cyan">might even think he's sincere.</font>

99
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:38,970
<font color="cyan">He is not his own master</font>
<font color="cyan">and nothing proper can come of it.</font>

100
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,970
MARCHING OUTSIDE

101
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,450
<font color="cyan">How strange that we should</font>
<font color="cyan">be discussing a ball</font>

102
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:50,609
<font color="cyan">when we're on the brink of war.</font>
<font color="cyan">How ridiculous.</font>

103
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,809
I don't agree.
With that, or about Lord Bellasis.

104
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,289
<font color="cyan">Just know this,</font>

105
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,489
<font color="cyan">if Sophia comes to any harm</font>
<font color="cyan">through this nonsense</font>

106
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,689
<font color="cyan">I will hold you</font>
<font color="cyan">personally responsible.</font>

107
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:00,809
Very well.

108
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,410
<font color="cyan">And as for blackmailing him into</font>
<font color="cyan">begging his aunt for invitations,</font>

109
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,010
<font color="cyan">I feel so humiliated.</font>
Anne, you won't spoil this.

110
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:11,410
I won't allow you to.
<font color="cyan">I don't need to.</font>

111
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,169
<font color="cyan">It will spoil itself.</font>

112
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,330
<font color="#008000">I hope this isn't a mistake.</font>
CHUCKLES

113
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:26,809
Too late for that sort of talk.

114
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,609
<font color="#008000">What's so funny?</font>

115
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,010
Only that we came to Brussels
to escape Society

116
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:34,210
and now we appear
to be giving the ball of the season.

117
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:36,970
<font color="#008000">The Duke insisted.</font>

118
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,570
<font color="#008000">He said we needed to show</font>
<font color="#008000">that nothing Boney could do,</font>

119
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,330
<font color="#008000">could rattle the British.</font>

120
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,410
<font color="#008000">Edmund! You're the very first.</font>
<font color="#008000">How nice.</font>

121
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,410
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd come early</font>
<font color="yellow">to lend you support.</font>

122
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:55,689
<font color="yellow">I must say, Aunt, you've made these</font>
<font color="yellow">dreary rooms feel very splendid.</font>

123
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:58,330
<font color="yellow">No-one would know people were</font>
<font color="yellow">choosing which coach to buy in here,</font>

124
00:06:58,369 --> 00:06:59,890
<font color="yellow">only a few months ago.</font>

125
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:03,770
<font color="cyan">Mr and Mrs James Trenchard.</font>
<font color="cyan">Miss Sophia Trenchard.</font>

126
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:10,970
You've not invited the Magician?
<font color="#008000">What do you mean?</font>

127
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,210
He's Wellington's main supplier.
What's he doing here?

128
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:16,650
<font color="#008000">The Duke of Wellington's victualler?</font>

129
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:18,850
<font color="#008000">I've invited a merchant supplier</font>
<font color="#008000">to my ball?</font>

130
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,369
<font color="yellow">My dear aunt, you've invited</font>
<font color="yellow">one of the Duke's most loyal helpers</font>

131
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,410
<font color="yellow">in his fight for victory.</font>
<font color="#008000">You have tricked me, Edmund.</font>

132
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,010
<font color="#008000">And I do not like</font>
<font color="#008000">to be made a fool of.</font>

133
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:30,049
<font color="#008000">I hope your mother</font>
<font color="#008000">isn't going to be cross with me.</font>

134
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:38,650
<font color="cyan">This is good of you, Duchess.</font>
<font color="#008000">Not at all, Mrs Trenchard.</font>

135
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:41,530
<font color="#008000">I gather you've been</font>
<font color="#008000">so kind to my nephew.</font>

136
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,530
<font color="cyan">It's always a pleasure</font>
<font color="cyan">to see Lord Bellasis.</font>

137
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,410
<font color="#008000">All those young men,</font>
<font color="#008000">so far from home, poor things.</font>

138
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,330
Well, if it isn't our Magician.

139
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,970
<font color="yellow">Good evening, um, your, um,</font>
<font color="yellow">Great, Great, um...</font>

140
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,010
<font color="yellow">..Duke.</font>
<font color="cyan">May I present my daughter, Sophia?</font>

141
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,729
Miss Trenchard,
may I escort you into the ballroom?

142
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,489
I thought you'd never get here.
<font color="yellow">Don't be silly. We're very early.</font>

143
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,210
An hour away from you
is like a lifetime.

144
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:15,890
<font color="yellow">You read that in a book.</font>

145
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,650
WHISPERS:
<font color="#008000">Can Edmund really be serious?</font>

146
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,450
<font color="#008000">The mother isn't too ridiculous,</font>
<font color="#008000">the father is simply grotesque.</font>

147
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:26,249
I'll talk to Edmund later on.

148
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:29,169
<font color="#008000">Wait until the ball is over</font>
<font color="#008000">and the girl is gone.</font>

149
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:33,090
<font color="#008000">And pray Caroline never finds out</font>
<font color="#008000">I invited her here.</font>

150
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,529
<font color="cyan">His Royal Highness,</font>

INDISTINCT CHATTER

153
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,369
Why don't you call him Your Grace?

154
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:01,570
<font color="cyan">Your Grace is for servants</font>
<font color="cyan">and officials.</font>

155
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,729
<font color="cyan">Not for a private party.</font>

156
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:06,330
But I've always called
the Duke of Wellington Your Grace.

157
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:09,090
<font color="cyan">Because you are his victualler.</font>
Then I shouldn't do it tonight?

158
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:11,009
<font color="cyan">If you hadn't</font>
<font color="cyan">procured our invitations,</font>

159
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,369
<font color="cyan">you wouldn't be</font>
<font color="cyan">in this invidious position now.</font>

160
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:15,769
<font color="#008000">What brings the Magician</font>
<font color="#008000">here tonight?</font>

161
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,090
Er, the Duchess invited us.
<font color="#008000">Did she, indeed?</font>

162
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:22,129
<font color="#008000">And has the evening</font>
<font color="#008000">been enjoyable so far?</font>

163
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,690
Oh, yes, Your Grace.

164
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:26,769
But there has been
a good deal of talk

165
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,009
about the advance of Bonaparte.
<font color="#008000">Well, that's why we're so late.</font>

166
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,729
<font color="#008000">It looks as if</font>
<font color="#008000">we'll be off tomorrow.</font>

167
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,649
<font color="#008000">Am I to understand,</font>
<font color="#008000">the charming lady is Mrs Trenchard?</font>

168
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,489
<font color="cyan">Your calm is very reassuring, Duke.</font>
<font color="#008000">Ponsonby.</font>

169
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,850
<font color="#008000">Are you acquainted</font>
<font color="#008000">with the Magician?</font>

170
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:49,290
<font color="yellow">I spend a good deal of time</font>
<font color="yellow">outside Mr Trenchard's office,</font>

171
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,570
<font color="yellow">waiting to plead the cause</font>
<font color="yellow">of my men.</font>

172
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:54,489
<font color="#008000">Mrs Trenchard,</font>
<font color="#008000">may I present Sir William Ponsonby?</font>

173
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:57,170
<font color="#008000">Ponsonby,</font>
<font color="#008000">this is the Magician's wife.</font>

174
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,609
<font color="yellow">I hope he's kinder to you</font>
<font color="yellow">than he is to me.</font>

BAGPIPES PLAY

176
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,210
<font color="#008000">A splendid touch, Duchess.</font>

177
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:18,450
My father did raise
the Gordon Highlanders after all,

178
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:21,050
so how could
their Commanding Officer refuse?

179
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,489
<font color="#008000">How indeed?</font>

180
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:29,330
BAGPIPES CONTINUE TO PLAY

183
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,690
<font color="yellow">My mother is coming</font>
<font color="yellow">to break us apart.</font>

184
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:54,489
Why is she so against me?

185
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,129
<font color="yellow">She's convinced nothing good</font>
<font color="yellow">can come of it.</font>

186
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,450
Well, then we shall prove her wrong.

187
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:03,489
<font color="cyan">You mustn't let Sophia</font>
<font color="cyan">monopolise you, Lord Bellasis.</font>

188
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,810
<font color="cyan">You must have many friends here</font>

189
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,330
<font color="cyan">who would be glad of the chance</font>
<font color="cyan">to hear your news.</font>

190
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:10,729
Never fear, Mrs Trenchard.
I am where I want to be.

191
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:13,330
<font color="cyan">That is all very well, my lord.</font>

192
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:15,529
<font color="cyan">But Sophia</font>
<font color="cyan">has a reputation to protect</font>

193
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,930
<font color="cyan">and the courtesy of your attention</font>
<font color="cyan">may be putting it at risk.</font>

194
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,170
<font color="yellow">I wish you would give me credit</font>
<font color="yellow">for a little sense, Mama.</font>

195
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,330
<font color="cyan">I wish I could.</font>

196

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,210
<font color="#008000">Your Royal Highnesses, your Graces,</font>

201
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:22,970
<font color="#008000">much as I regret to interrupt the</font>

PANICKED CONVERSATION

205
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:48,050
<font color="#008000">May we have the room for a moment?</font>
<font color="#008000">Ponsonby, you have the map?</font>

206
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,450
<font color="yellow">I do indeed.</font>

207
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:55,450
<font color="#008000">Orange has had a message</font>
<font color="#008000">from Baron Rebecque.</font>

208
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:59,330
<font color="yellow">Bonaparte has pushed up the road</font>
<font color="yellow">from Charleroi to Brussels</font>

209
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:00,649
<font color="yellow">and he's getting nearer.</font>

210
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,290
<font color="#008000">I've given orders for the army</font>
<font color="#008000">to concentrate at Quatre Bras,</font>

211
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,769
<font color="#008000">but we shall not stop him there.</font>

212
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,970
<font color="cyan">You may.</font>
<font color="cyan">You have some hours before daylight.</font>

213
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:10,690
<font color="#008000">If I do not,</font>
<font color="#008000">then I shall have to fight him here.</font>

214
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:13,729
<font color="#008000">At Waterloo.</font>
<font color="#008000">I shall need your help, Magician.</font>

215
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:16,129
We will not fail
for lack of supplies.

216
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,170
<font color="#008000">You're a bright man, Trenchard.</font>

217
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,450
<font color="#008000">You must use your talents well</font>
<font color="#008000">when the wars are done.</font>

218
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:22,769
<font color="#008000">I believe you have the potential</font>
<font color="#008000">to go far.</font>

219
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,450
Your Grace is very kind.

220
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:27,409
<font color="#008000">But don't be distracted</font>
<font color="#008000">by the gewgaws of society.</font>

221
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,170
<font color="#008000">You're cleverer than that,</font>
<font color="#008000">or should be.</font>

222
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:32,889
<font color="#008000">Enough.</font>

223
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,290
<font color="#008000">Let us get ready.</font>

224
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,729
I must go to the depot.

225
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:50,290
I'll put you and Sophia
in the carriage and I'll walk.

226
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,690
<font color="cyan">Is it the final struggle?</font>
I think so.

227
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:55,409
We've told ourselves every skirmish
was the last battle for years,

228
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,970
but this time I truly believe it is.
Where is Sophia?

229
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:01,970
<font color="cyan">At least no-one will remember</font>
<font color="cyan">their folly and indiscretion.</font>

230
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,450
Just bring her to the door, my dear,
whilst I fetch the shawls.

231
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:08,170
<font color="#008000">Don't be silly, my darling,</font>
<font color="#008000">nothing can happen to us,</font>

232
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,450
<font color="#008000">we are the luckiest couple alive!</font>
<font color="yellow">We're the most in love.</font>

233
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:13,090
<font color="#008000">And when I get back,</font>

234
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:15,769
<font color="#008000">we'll laugh at your fears</font>
<font color="#008000">and make merry. I give you my word.</font>

235
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,489
<font color="yellow">And no gentleman</font>
<font color="yellow">would break his word.</font>

236
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:18,729
<font color="#008000">Precisely.</font>

237
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,570
<font color="cyan">Sophia...</font>

238
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,050

<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

242
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:58,290
<font color="cyan">My dear, you must control yourself.</font>
<font color="cyan">Come with me. Quickly.</font>

243
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:09,170
Go now. I will return when I can.

I assume he was no longer
a ship's carpenter by that time?

393
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,344
<font color="cyan">You're right.</font>
<font color="cyan">He started as a carpenter,</font>

394
00:26:48,384 --> 00:26:50,665
<font color="cyan">but he devised</font>
<font color="cyan">a new method for building.</font>

395
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:53,304
<font color="cyan">He undertook to employ</font>
<font color="cyan">all the different trades involved,</font>

396
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:54,705
<font color="cyan">bricklayers, plasterers.</font>

397
00:26:54,745 --> 00:26:57,784
So, the people he worked for...
<font color="cyan">Had only to give the commission.</font>

398
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,624
<font color="cyan">He and his brother</font>
<font color="cyan">saw to everything.</font>

399
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,584
Very impressive.

400
00:27:01,624 --> 00:27:03,784
<font color="cyan">They were building</font>
<font color="cyan">the London Institution</font>

401
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:06,384
<font color="cyan">in Finsbury Circus</font>
<font color="cyan">when they met Mr Trenchard.</font>

402
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,265
I remember
the Institution being opened.

403
00:27:08,304 --> 00:27:10,705
We find it magnificent.

404
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:14,064
<font color="cyan">After that,</font>
<font color="cyan">they worked on Tavistock Square</font>

405
00:27:14,104 --> 00:27:16,985
<font color="cyan">and various other ventures.</font>
Until they built Belgravia.

406
00:27:18,064 --> 00:27:22,265
This spangled city for the rich,
where we all live now.

407
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,064
Well, what a story.

408
00:27:27,304 --> 00:27:30,905
You are a woman of the New Age,
Mrs Trenchard.

409
00:27:30,945 --> 00:27:33,745
I hope I do not offend you.
<font color="cyan">Not in the least.</font>

410
00:27:35,824 --> 00:27:37,144
<font color="cyan">As for why we were at the ball...</font>

411
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:41,624
<font color="cyan">..we were friendly</font>
<font color="cyan">with a favourite of your sister</font>

412
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:44,425
<font color="cyan">and he got us invited.</font>
And, who was this favourite?

413
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:46,745
Might I have known him?

414
00:27:48,985 --> 00:27:51,584
Come, Mrs Trenchard,
don't be bashful. Please.

415
00:27:51,624 --> 00:27:53,624
<font color="cyan">You knew him very well.</font>

416
00:27:53,665 --> 00:27:56,505
<font color="cyan">It was Lord Bellasis.</font>

417
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,384
And you? Did you know my son well?

418
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:02,864
<font color="yellow">Mrs Trenchard,</font>
<font color="yellow">would you like to come and meet...</font>

419
00:28:02,905 --> 00:28:05,265
Forgive me, my dear,
Mrs Trenchard and I are talking.

420
00:28:13,144 --> 00:28:14,624
So, you were saying?

421
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:18,905
<font color="cyan">Only that my daughter knew</font>
<font color="cyan">Lord Bellasis better than we did.</font>

422
00:28:19,985 --> 00:28:22,784
<font color="cyan">Brussels was quite a hothouse</font>
<font color="cyan">at that time.</font>

423
00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:24,265
<font color="cyan">We none of us knew what was coming.</font>

424
00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:27,745
<font color="cyan">The enslavement of England,</font>
<font color="cyan">or a British victory.</font>

425
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:31,505
<font color="cyan">The uncertainty created</font>
<font color="cyan">an atmosphere that was...</font>

426
00:28:32,665 --> 00:28:35,344
<font color="cyan">..heady, wild and exciting.</font>

427
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,304
And the knowledge
must have hung in the air

428
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:42,064
that some of those smiling,
young men would not be coming home.

429
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:44,265
<font color="cyan">Yes.</font>

430
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:47,705
They must have enjoyed it...

431
00:28:49,624 --> 00:28:52,225
..the glamour and the danger,

432
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:54,665
because danger is glamorous
when you're young.

433
00:28:56,425 --> 00:28:57,864
So, where is she now?

434
00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:03,624
<font color="cyan">Sophia died.</font>

435
00:29:08,344 --> 00:29:09,864
Now that I did not know.

436
00:29:09,905 --> 00:29:12,864
<font color="cyan">It was quite soon after the battle,</font>
<font color="cyan">so a long time ago now.</font>

437
00:29:14,384 --> 00:29:15,425
I'm so sorry.

438
00:29:18,544 --> 00:29:21,344
Everyone claims to understand
what you're going through, but I do.

439
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:24,905
And I've learned
that it never goes away.

440
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:30,624
<font color="cyan">Oddly, I find that comforting.</font>

441
00:29:31,624 --> 00:29:34,344
<font color="cyan">They say misery loves company.</font>
<font color="cyan">And perhaps it does.</font>

442
00:29:34,384 --> 00:29:35,384
Hmm.

443
00:29:38,225 --> 00:29:39,745
So, you remember Edmund?

444
00:29:41,104 --> 00:29:42,985
<font color="cyan">Very well.</font>

445
00:29:43,025 --> 00:29:45,185
<font color="cyan">He would come to the house</font>
<font color="cyan">with the other young people.</font>

446
00:29:46,344 --> 00:29:48,344
<font color="cyan">He was very popular, charming.</font>

447
00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:51,905
<font color="cyan">Good-looking and funny as could be.</font>

448
00:29:51,945 --> 00:29:54,784
Oh, yes. All that and more.

449
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,985
<font color="cyan">Do you have other children?</font>
<font color="cyan">I'm so sorry.</font>

450
00:30:11,025 --> 00:30:13,505
<font color="cyan">I remember now, you do not.</font>
<font color="cyan">Please forgive me.</font>

451
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:16,344
No. When we go,
there will be nothing left of us.

452
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:18,584
Not a trace.

453
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:24,705
But we are proud of Edmund still.
<font color="cyan">Of course you are.</font>

454
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:26,425
CLOCK CHIMES

455
00:30:26,465 --> 00:30:28,705
I'm going now, Mrs Trenchard.

456
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:31,025
I've enjoyed our talk
more than I anticipated.

457
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:35,745
<font color="cyan">Who told you I'd be here?</font>

458
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:39,824
No-one. I...

459
00:30:39,864 --> 00:30:43,384
I asked our hostess who it was
speaking with my sister

460
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,544
and she told me your name.
I was curious.

461
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:50,425
I've spoken of you and your daughter
so many times,

462
00:30:50,465 --> 00:30:53,864
it seemed a shame
to miss the chance of a meeting.

463
00:30:53,905 --> 00:30:55,225
<font color="cyan">I hope you're not sorry.</font>

464
00:30:56,624 --> 00:30:57,824
I'm glad.

465
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:01,784
You've made me feel
like I've seen him again...

466
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:06,225
..dancing and flirting
and having fun in his last hours.

467
00:31:08,225 --> 00:31:09,544
I like to think of that.

468
00:31:11,544 --> 00:31:13,144
I will think of that.

469
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:16,505
So, thank you.

470
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:30,144
<font color="yellow">What was Mr Wilkie like?</font>
Civil enough.

471
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:33,665
A year after he painted my portrait,

472
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:36,705
he painted the young Queen
at her first Council meeting.

473
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:39,104
You'd have to pay twice
what I gave to get him now.

474
00:31:39,144 --> 00:31:40,705
DOG WHINES

475
00:31:40,745 --> 00:31:42,265
You only encourage her to beg.

476
00:31:43,465 --> 00:31:46,304
<font color="yellow">Mama, you know I was alone</font>
<font color="yellow">all afternoon?</font>

477
00:31:46,344 --> 00:31:48,985
<font color="cyan">I'm sure there are plenty of things</font>
<font color="cyan">that could use your attention.</font>

478
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:50,025
<font color="yellow">That's not the point.</font>

479
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:52,025
<font color="yellow">What I mean is I could have</font>
<font color="yellow">easily accompanied you</font>

480
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,064
<font color="yellow">if I'd been told</font>
<font color="yellow">where you were going.</font>

481
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:57,144
<font color="cyan">But you weren't invited.</font>
<font color="yellow">What difference does that make?</font>

482
00:31:57,185 --> 00:32:00,025
<font color="yellow">Most women would have replied</font>
<font color="yellow">saying they'd be happy to accept</font>

483
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:02,905
<font color="yellow">and they'll bring their daughter.</font>
<font color="cyan">You're not my daughter.</font>

484
00:32:04,784 --> 00:32:06,784
<font color="#008000">She is your daughter-in-law, Mother,</font>

485
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,104
<font color="#008000">which would mean the same</font>
<font color="#008000">as daughter in any other house.</font>

486
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:12,144
<font color="cyan">I don't think I would be justified</font>
<font color="cyan">in taking someone, anyone,</font>

487
00:32:12,185 --> 00:32:14,344
<font color="cyan">to the house of a woman</font>
<font color="cyan">I barely know.</font>

488
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:17,104
<font color="yellow">A Duchess you barely know</font>
<font color="yellow">and I don't know at all.</font>

489
00:32:18,864 --> 00:32:20,425
So, who was there?
Anyone interesting?

490
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:24,745
<font color="cyan">I talked to the old</font>
<font color="cyan">Duchess of Richmond.</font>

491
00:32:24,784 --> 00:32:27,665
<font color="cyan">We reminisced about our time</font>
<font color="cyan">in Brussels at the ball.</font>

492
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:29,945
Oh, yes?
<font color="cyan">Her sister was there, too.</font>

493
00:32:31,665 --> 00:32:33,544
You mean the mother of...
<font color="cyan">Yes.</font>

494
00:32:35,384 --> 00:32:37,945
Did you speak with her?
<font color="cyan">Yes.</font>

495
00:32:37,985 --> 00:32:39,985
And what did she say?
<font color="cyan">I'll tell you later.</font>

496
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:42,144
<font color="cyan">We mustn't bore Oliver and Susan.</font>

497
00:32:42,185 --> 00:32:43,985
<font color="yellow">I'm only bored,</font>
<font color="yellow">because I wasn't there.</font>

498
00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:47,025
I didn't see you
at the office today, Oliver.

499
00:32:47,064 --> 00:32:49,025
<font color="#008000">I didn't come in.</font>
Why not?

500
00:32:49,064 --> 00:32:50,905
<font color="#008000">I went to inspect the work</font>
<font color="#008000">at Chapel Street.</font>

501
00:32:50,945 --> 00:32:52,705
<font color="#008000">Why have you made the houses</font>
<font color="#008000">so small?</font>

502
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:55,544
<font color="#008000">Won't it put a dent in the profits?</font>
When you develop an area,

503
00:32:55,584 --> 00:32:57,265
you must build
for the whole picture.

504
00:32:57,304 --> 00:33:00,344
You can't only have palaces.
You must house the supporters

505
00:33:00,384 --> 00:33:02,624
of the princes
who live in the palaces,

506
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:05,025
their clerks and managers
and upper servants.

507
00:33:05,064 --> 00:33:07,304
Then there must be a mews
for the coaches and coachmen.

508
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:10,104
They all take space,
but it is space well used.

509
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:13,064
<font color="yellow">Have you given any more thought</font>
<font color="yellow">to where we might live, Father?</font>

510
00:33:13,104 --> 00:33:14,584
Well,
I'd be happy to give you the pick

511
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:16,064
of anything empty in Chester Row.

512
00:33:17,265 --> 00:33:18,344
<font color="yellow">Aren't they a little poky?</font>

513
00:33:18,384 --> 00:33:20,784
<font color="#008000">She's right.</font>
<font color="#008000">They're too small for entertaining</font>

514
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:23,544
<font color="#008000">and I suppose I have</font>
<font color="#008000">a position to keep up, as your son.</font>

515
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:27,144
They're less poky than the first
house I shared with your mother.

516
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:30,144
<font color="#008000">I have been brought up differently</font>
<font color="#008000">from the way you began your lives.</font>

517
00:33:30,185 --> 00:33:33,265
<font color="#008000">If I have grander expectations,</font>
<font color="#008000">it is you who have given them to me.</font>

518
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:34,905
Well, well.

519
00:33:34,945 --> 00:33:38,064
We seem to be failing
on every count tonight.

520
00:33:38,104 --> 00:33:40,584
<font color="cyan">We'll be at Glanville next month.</font>
<font color="cyan">I hope you'll come down.</font>

521
00:33:40,624 --> 00:33:42,864
<font color="cyan">Perhaps you might stay</font>
<font color="cyan">for a week or two?</font>

522
00:33:44,104 --> 00:33:46,104
<font color="yellow">We will if we can.</font>

523
00:33:46,144 --> 00:33:48,784
<font color="yellow">It's such a way.</font>
Well, what about you, Oliver?

524
00:33:48,824 --> 00:33:51,104
You've always loved Glanville.
<font color="#008000">That is true.</font>

525
00:33:52,185 --> 00:33:54,784
<font color="#008000">But I'm, er, I'm afraid</font>
<font color="#008000">Susan is not a good traveller.</font>

526
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,465
<font color="yellow">I'm ashamed to admit it,</font>
<font color="yellow">but he's right.</font>

527
00:33:57,505 --> 00:34:00,225
<font color="yellow">Two hours in a carriage</font>
<font color="yellow">and it takes me a day to recover.</font>

528
00:34:00,265 --> 00:34:02,825
<font color="cyan">So, three days in a carriage</font>
<font color="cyan">must be a trial, indeed.</font>

529
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:06,224
<font color="yellow">I hate to disappoint you</font>
<font color="yellow">when I know you love it so.</font>

530
00:34:06,264 --> 00:34:07,985
<font color="cyan">I suppose I feel</font>
<font color="cyan">I brought it back to life.</font>

531
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:09,945
<font color="cyan">And in return,</font>
<font color="cyan">the house brought me back to life.</font>

532
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:11,905
<font color="yellow">After Sophia's death, you mean?</font>

533
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:14,785
<font color="cyan">I'm going up.</font>

534
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,224
<font color="cyan">Don't stay too long over your port.</font>
<font color="cyan">The servants need to get in.</font>

535
00:34:31,664 --> 00:34:33,064
Can't you control her?

536
00:34:34,385 --> 00:34:36,064
<font color="#008000">Apparently not.</font>

537
00:34:36,104 --> 00:34:38,025
<font color="yellow">"Not Chester Row," she says,</font>

538
00:34:38,064 --> 00:34:40,224
<font color="yellow">as if he'd threatened her</font>
<font color="yellow">with cholera.</font>

539
00:34:40,264 --> 00:34:43,305
<font color="yellow">"It's much too poky</font>
<font color="yellow">for fine folks like we."</font>

540
00:34:43,345 --> 00:34:45,264
<font color="yellow">And you should have seen</font>
<font color="yellow">the look the Master got</font>

541
00:34:45,305 --> 00:34:48,184
<font color="yellow">when he suggested</font>
<font color="yellow">Mr Oliver did a hand's turn!</font>

542
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:49,224
LAUGHS

543
00:34:49,264 --> 00:34:51,584
<font color="#008000">I hope there's nothing untoward</font>
<font color="#008000">on display in this room.</font>

544
00:34:51,624 --> 00:34:53,104
<font color="yellow">No, Mr Turton.</font>

545
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:55,985
<font color="#008000">Mr and Mrs Trenchard pay our wages</font>
<font color="#008000">and for that,</font>

546
00:34:56,025 --> 00:34:59,465
<font color="#008000">they are entitled</font>
<font color="#008000">to be treated with respect, Morris.</font>

547
00:34:59,505 --> 00:35:00,744
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr Turton.</font>

548
00:35:06,744 --> 00:35:08,905
<font color="#008000">Of course, they're not</font>
<font color="#008000">what they like to pretend,</font>

549
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:11,664
<font color="#008000">it's only the more obvious</font>
<font color="#008000">when they're alone.</font>

550
00:35:11,704 --> 00:35:15,064
<font color="cyan">Mr Trenchard is respectable, polite</font>
<font color="cyan">and honest to deal with, Mr Turton.</font>

551
00:35:15,104 --> 00:35:18,025
<font color="yellow">Mr Myles is the Master's valet,</font>
<font color="yellow">Mr Turton, so he must know.</font>

552
00:35:18,064 --> 00:35:21,305
<font color="cyan">I've known far worse in households</font>
<font color="cyan">headed by a coronet.</font>

553
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:22,905
<font color="#008000">I don't like to disagree, Mr Myles,</font>

554
00:35:22,945 --> 00:35:25,305
<font color="#008000">but my sympathies</font>
<font color="#008000">are with Mr Oliver.</font>

555
00:35:25,345 --> 00:35:27,025
<font color="#008000">They've brought him up</font>
<font color="#008000">as a gentleman,</font>

556
00:35:27,064 --> 00:35:29,385
<font color="#008000">but now they seem to resent him</font>
<font color="#008000">for wanting to be one.</font>

557
00:35:29,425 --> 00:35:31,584
<font color="cyan">Why should Mr Oliver</font>
<font color="cyan">ask for houses and estates</font>

558
00:35:31,624 --> 00:35:32,945
<font color="cyan">that are grander than his parents'?</font>

559
00:35:32,985 --> 00:35:35,224
<font color="cyan">What's he done to earn them?</font>
<font color="cyan">That's what I'd like to know.</font>

560
00:35:35,264 --> 00:35:38,184
<font color="#008000">Gentlemen don't earn their houses,</font>
<font color="#008000">Mr Myles.</font>

561
00:35:38,224 --> 00:35:40,544
<font color="#008000">They inherit them.</font>
I agree.

562
00:35:40,584 --> 00:35:44,025
Why shouldn't Mrs Oliver
have a decent house to entertain?

563
00:35:44,064 --> 00:35:45,945
She's brought enough money
to the table.

564
00:35:45,985 --> 00:35:47,345
It's illogical for the Master

565
00:35:47,385 --> 00:35:49,385
to force them to live
in a rabbit hutch.

566
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:50,945
<font color="cyan">I'm sorry to say it, Miss Speer,</font>

567
00:35:50,985 --> 00:35:53,905
<font color="cyan">and I'm glad you think her</font>
<font color="cyan">a good employer,</font>

568
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:57,144
<font color="cyan">but I find Mrs Oliver</font>
<font color="cyan">very hard to please.</font>

569
00:35:57,184 --> 00:35:58,305
<font color="yellow">She's got a point.</font>

570
00:35:58,345 --> 00:36:00,184
<font color="cyan">You'd think she was</font>
<font color="cyan">an Infanta of Spain</font>

571
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:01,785
<font color="cyan">with all her airs and graces.</font>

572
00:36:01,825 --> 00:36:04,584
<font color="cyan">But I've never had any trouble</font>
<font color="cyan">with the Mistress.</font>

573
00:36:04,624 --> 00:36:07,985
<font color="cyan">She's straightforward</font>
<font color="cyan">and I've no reason to complain.</font>

574
00:36:08,025 --> 00:36:09,144
<font color="#008000">I am glad to hear it.</font>

575
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:11,345
We must feel some sympathy
for the Master.

576
00:36:11,385 --> 00:36:14,544
It's hard to get the trick of it
in a single generation.

577
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:16,104
<font color="#008000">I agree with you there, Miss Ellis.</font>

578
00:36:16,144 --> 00:36:19,144
<font color="cyan">We don't see these things</font>
<font color="cyan">in the same way, Mr Turton,</font>

579
00:36:19,184 --> 00:36:20,584
<font color="cyan">we'll have to agree to differ.</font>

580
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:28,735
Of course you can't tell her!
What are you talking about?

581
00:36:28,775 --> 00:36:31,575
<font color="cyan">But when she said,</font>
<font color="cyan">"There'll be nothing left of us."</font>

582
00:36:31,615 --> 00:36:33,414
<font color="cyan">You'd have been</font>
<font color="cyan">as touched as I was.</font>

583
00:36:33,454 --> 00:36:34,735
What, so you'd like the idea

584
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:38,175
that Sophia should be remembered
as a... as a harlot?

585
00:36:38,215 --> 00:36:40,615
<font color="cyan">I would ask her to keep the secret.</font>

586
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:42,215
<font color="cyan">Of course I couldn't force her,</font>
<font color="cyan">but...</font>

587
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:48,535
<font color="cyan">..do we have a right to hide from</font>
<font color="cyan">her that she has a grandson?</font>

588
00:36:48,575 --> 00:36:50,735
We've hidden it for more than
a quarter of a century.

589
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:53,775
I forbid it.

590
00:36:53,814 --> 00:36:55,974
I will not have the memory
of our daughter defaced.

591
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:59,854
Certainly not by her own mother.
And get that dog off the bed!

592
00:37:59,135 --> 00:38:00,175
<font color="cyan">What is it?</font>

593
00:38:02,095 --> 00:38:03,814
<font color="yellow">I'm going to have a child.</font>

594
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:07,974
<font color="cyan">What?</font>

595
00:38:09,775 --> 00:38:11,175
<font color="cyan">When?</font>

596
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:13,735
<font color="yellow">The end of February, I think.</font>

597
00:38:14,854 --> 00:38:16,454
<font color="cyan">Don't you know?</font>
<font color="yellow">The end of February.</font>

598
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:21,814
<font color="cyan">Do I have Lord Bellasis</font>
<font color="cyan">to thank for this?</font>

599
00:38:24,894 --> 00:38:26,374
SCOFFS

600
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:30,974
<font color="cyan">You foolish, stupid, stupid fool.</font>

601
00:38:32,294 --> 00:38:35,575
<font color="cyan">How did it happen? How...</font>
<font color="cyan">how could you have let it happen?</font>

602
00:38:35,615 --> 00:38:36,854
<font color="yellow">I thought we were married.</font>

603
00:38:36,894 --> 00:38:39,055
<font color="cyan">Didn't you know</font>
<font color="cyan">you needed your father's permission</font>

604
00:38:39,095 --> 00:38:41,454
<font color="cyan">for it to be legal?</font>
<font color="cyan">You're only 18!</font>

605
00:38:41,494 --> 00:38:42,974
<font color="yellow">Papa gave his permission.</font>

606
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:47,735
<font color="cyan">Your...</font>

607
00:38:47,775 --> 00:38:48,894
<font color="cyan">your father knew?</font>

608
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:51,575
<font color="yellow">He knew that Edmund</font>
<font color="yellow">wanted to marry me</font>

609
00:38:51,615 --> 00:38:54,294
<font color="yellow">before he went back to the fighting</font>
<font color="yellow">and he gave permission.</font>

610
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:58,535
<font color="yellow">Edmund found a parson to marry us</font>
<font color="yellow">in a little chapel near the city.</font>

611
00:38:59,575 --> 00:39:03,535
<font color="#008000">I now pronounce you man and wife.</font>

612
00:39:04,934 --> 00:39:07,775
May we kiss?
<font color="#008000">With my blessing.</font>

613
00:39:13,255 --> 00:39:16,014
<font color="yellow">Are we truly married?</font>
<font color="#008000">Most definitely.</font>

614
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,055
<font color="yellow">Then we left</font>
<font color="yellow">and went back to his lodgings.</font>

615
00:39:23,095 --> 00:39:25,215
<font color="yellow">That's when it happened.</font>

616
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:26,974
<font color="cyan">I assume the ceremony was false?</font>

617
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:30,655
<font color="yellow">I never suspected it,</font>
<font color="yellow">not for a moment.</font>

618
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:34,334
<font color="yellow">Edmund spoke of his love</font>
<font color="yellow">and our future,</font>

619
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:37,215
<font color="yellow">right up until the moment</font>
<font color="yellow">we were leaving his aunt's ball</font>

620
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:40,135
<font color="yellow">on the night of the battle.</font>
<font color="cyan">So, when did you find out?</font>

621
00:39:41,894 --> 00:39:43,775
<font color="yellow">As we came out into the street...</font>

622
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:46,655
<font color="yellow">there was a group</font>
<font color="yellow">of mounted officers,</font>

623
00:39:46,695 --> 00:39:49,535
<font color="yellow">in the uniforms of</font>
<font color="yellow">the 52nd Light Infantry,</font>

624
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:51,215
<font color="yellow">Edmund's regiment...</font>

625
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:54,934
<font color="cyan">And?</font>

626
00:39:54,974 --> 00:39:57,255
<font color="yellow">One of them was the parson</font>
<font color="yellow">who had married us.</font>

627
00:40:00,535 --> 00:40:01,775
<font color="yellow">He was a soldier.</font>

628
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:04,894
<font color="yellow">A friend of Edmund's, who turned</font>
<font color="yellow">his collar round to deceive me!</font>

629
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:08,494
<font color="cyan">Now I understand what put you</font>
<font color="cyan">in such a state that night.</font>

630
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:09,974
<font color="cyan">I thought it was simply</font>

631
00:40:10,014 --> 00:40:11,575
<font color="cyan">Lord Bellasis</font>
<font color="cyan">leaving for the battle.</font>

632
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:14,494
<font color="yellow">The moment I saw the man</font>
<font color="yellow">I knew I'd been duped.</font>

633
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:17,215
<font color="yellow">I was not heading</font>
<font color="yellow">for a golden future.</font>

634
00:40:17,255 --> 00:40:19,974
<font color="yellow">I was a stupid girl</font>
<font color="yellow">who'd been used as a streetwalker.</font>

635
00:40:21,135 --> 00:40:24,175
<font color="yellow">I suppose I clung to the idea</font>
<font color="yellow">that Edmund might explain,</font>

636
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:26,414
<font color="yellow">but he was killed</font>
<font color="yellow">before he had the chance.</font>

637
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,095
<font color="cyan">When did you know you were</font>
<font color="cyan">carrying his child?</font>

638
00:40:31,454 --> 00:40:33,655
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't admit it at first.</font>

639
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:36,934
<font color="yellow">I was like a mad woman.</font>
<font color="yellow">I took foolish remedies,</font>

640
00:40:36,974 --> 00:40:40,695
<font color="yellow">I gave a gypsy a sovereign</font>
<font color="yellow">for what I'm sure was sugar water.</font>

641
00:40:41,735 --> 00:40:43,894
<font color="yellow">But they all failed.</font>
<font color="yellow">I am still enceinte.</font>

642
00:40:45,454 --> 00:40:46,974
<font color="cyan">What have you told your father?</font>

643
00:40:48,575 --> 00:40:50,175
<font color="yellow">He knows I was tricked.</font>

644
00:40:51,374 --> 00:40:53,535
<font color="yellow">I told him that morning</font>
<font color="yellow">he brought me the news</font>

645
00:40:53,575 --> 00:40:56,255
<font color="yellow">of Edmund's death.</font>
<font color="yellow">But he thinks I got away with it.</font>

646
00:41:03,854 --> 00:41:06,655
<font color="cyan">We must go north, out of sight,</font>

647
00:41:06,695 --> 00:41:08,655
<font color="cyan">while James makes arrangements</font>
<font color="cyan">for the child.</font>

648
00:41:10,414 --> 00:41:12,255
<font color="cyan">I'll have a story ready by tomorrow,</font>
<font color="cyan">but...</font>

649
00:41:13,894 --> 00:41:15,575
<font color="cyan">..tonight I will speak</font>
<font color="cyan">with your father.</font>

650

2
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,289
Shaun, did you undress me?

3
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,624
Except your underpants.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,060
How long have you been here?

5
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,328
All night.

6
00:00:22,597 --> 00:00:24,031
You should be at work.

7
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,766
I'm taking the day off.

8
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:27,467
No, you should be at work.

9
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:30,637
You're sick all the time,
not just after hours.

10
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:32,372
Shaun, you shouldn't give up your life.

11
00:00:32,374 --> 00:00:34,308
You have my number. You check in with me.

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,445
I have 15 paid vacation days
and 10 sick days per year,

13
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:40,326
but I can only take sick days
when I'm sick,

14
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:42,516
not when you are, so this is a vacation.

15
00:00:45,354 --> 00:00:46,787
The plan is to align your eyes

16
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:49,823
using what's called
distraction osteogenesis.

17
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:51,658
We cut the bone and implant posts

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,494
on either side of your eye orbits.

19
00:00:54,496 --> 00:00:57,631
Then we slowly expand that distance,

20
00:00:57,633 --> 00:01:00,567
allowing for new bone to grow
in the gaps.

21
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:01,969
Will it hurt?

22
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,404
Mm, for mere mortals it would,

23
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:07,341
but with your pain tolerance,
it'll tickle.

24
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:09,094
You up for this?

25
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:12,312
So I'll have perfectly aligned eyes

26
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:14,181
but still look like a wad of chewing gum.

27
00:01:14,183 --> 00:01:16,350
Molly...

28
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:19,610
You lost an awful lot of bone and
soft tissue in the accident,

29
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,588
and in terms of facial reconstruction,

30
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,790
we've actually come a long way
in the past two years.

31
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,626
And after 12 surgeries,

32
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:28,128
you get your own personalized coffee mug.

33
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,696
Oh, I forgot about that.

34
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:31,198
Okay, when can we get prepped?

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,302
Is now too soon?

36
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:39,239
Car accident. Karin Tindle, 14.

37
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,273
She was sleeping in the back.

38
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:41,975
Trucker in the oncoming lane fell asleep.

39
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,210
She wasn't wearing a seatbelt.

40
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:44,778
Head trauma, not responsive,

41
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,613
GCS of 5 with decorticate posturing.

42
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:47,814
Sounds like a bleed in the brain.

43
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,716
And she has a 25-point
difference in blood pressures

44
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:50,851
between her arms.

45
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:53,120
- Possible aortic dissection.
- Head and heart.

46
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:55,756
Page Dr. Melendez. Have
him meet us in the O.R.

47
00:01:55,758 --> 00:01:57,457
Have you contacted Karin's father?

48
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:58,792
He passed away three years ago.

49
00:01:58,794 --> 00:02:00,527
Let's go.

50
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:02,763
Why isn't she waking up?

51
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:04,297
We're gonna take good care of her.

52
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:17,244
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

53
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:19,579
CT confirmed an aortic dissection.

54
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:21,081
She needs a thoracotomy.

55
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,282
Aorta hasn't ruptured yet...

56
00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:23,917
And she has a pseudoaneurysm.

57
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,852
We need to get after
her head trauma first.

58
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,688
I don't see any major brain bleeds

59
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,456
and we can monitor pressures.

60
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,458
In this case, the heart trumps the head.

61
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:35,228
Okay.

62
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,600
I have two major symptoms...

63
00:02:40,602 --> 00:02:42,803
nausea and boredom.

64
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:46,206
I didn't know boredom was
a symptom of chemotherapy.

65
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,609
It's a symptom of
sitting on my ass all day.

66
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:52,679
I used to run a 700-bed hospital

67
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:54,347
with a staff of thousands.

68
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:58,151
Now all I have to think about
is how I keep my food down

69
00:02:58,153 --> 00:03:00,721
and how many bowel movements
I've had all week.

70
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,040
Four.

71
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:04,758
And I don't have to think about that.

72
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:10,097
You know what I need?

73
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,633
My meds.

74
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,567
Will you do me a favor

75
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:18,572
and run and pick these up?

76
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,308
When I come back, we can do "Mad Libs."

77
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:28,448
Unclamp.

78
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,653
Graft is holding.

79
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:35,722
That's one fire out. Drill.

80
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:38,191
Pupils are blown.

81
00:03:38,193 --> 00:03:39,326
ICPs are spiking way up,

82
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:41,394
brain perfusion CPP is down.

83
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:42,996
She needs a hemicraniectomy.

84
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:44,431
Let's sit her up.

85
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:48,602
It's marijuana.

86
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:49,838
Yes, it is.

87
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,739
It's marijuana.

88
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:55,008
Medicinal marijuana. Hold on.

89
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:59,479
One... for the boredom.

90
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:01,815
One for the nausea.

91
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:03,650
Can I try one?

92
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:06,853
I met someone who said cannabidiol

93
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:08,889
improved his ASD symptoms.

94
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,090
<i>A</i> person?

95
00:04:10,092 --> 00:04:12,259
You met a person once?

96
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:14,728
Shaun, have you heard of
the scientific method?

97
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,030
I'd like to perform a practical,

98
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:19,266
albeit anecdotal, experiment.

99
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:21,101
Since you're on vacation...

100
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:24,004
and we can keep an eye out
on each other...

101
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:29,509
One. One. Uh, whoa.

102
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:32,479
One. Take one.

103
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,326
Cruciate wide incision of the dura.

104
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,029
- Brain edema.
- She's bradycardic.

105
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:50,230
Push another 50 grams of Mannitol

106
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:51,598
and ventilate down her CO2.

107
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
No corneal reflex. No overbreathing vent.

108
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:55,654
No brain stem reflexes.

109
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:58,274
She's brain-dead.

110
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,860
Fore!

111
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:22,864
You broke my house.

112
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:25,200
You got to club down. It's just 12 yards.

113
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:26,468
It's a little dog leg.

114
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,403
Here. Watch this.

115
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:32,740
It's in the cup.

116
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:34,209
Nice shot, Glassy.

117
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:35,910
You're gonna call me Glassy?

118
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:37,779
All right. I'm gonna call you Smurf.

119
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:41,282
Smurf. This... This is very interesting.

120
00:05:41,284 --> 00:05:42,951
I find that very funny.

121
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:44,953
But it's not.

122
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:46,588
It's not. Am I high?

123
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,356
I think you're pretty high, yeah.

124
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:51,459
Am I acting more... normal?

125
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:54,696
- No, you're acting high.
- Smurf. Smurf.

126
00:05:54,698 --> 00:05:56,798
- Why is Smurf funny?
- I don't know.

127
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,166
It's... It's, um...

128
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:01,269
You take the first letter
of the first name

129
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:05,039
and you attach it to the first
syllable of your last name, see?

130
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,009
S-S-S-Murph. Smurf.

131
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:09,477
We did it all the time in high school.

132
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,780
So your name was A-Glass?

133
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:16,150
Yeah, no, it didn't work for me.

134
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:17,785
Okay, serious now.

135
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:19,120
Where's the next hole?

136
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:21,623
Right there. Careful of
the hazard right behind it.

137
00:06:24,994 --> 00:06:27,161
- Okay, Sam Snead.
- Dr. Glassman.

138
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:28,204
See what you got.

139
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:16,878
How's Lea?

140
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,713
Lee-Ya.

141
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:24,252
Lee-Ya!

142
00:07:24,254 --> 00:07:26,721
There should be a "Y" in her name.

143
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:29,424
Lee-Ya.

144
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:31,159
She still into Jack?

145
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:32,994
No.

146
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:36,531
She is into Jake.

147
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:37,599
Who the hell is Jake?

148
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:40,610
Jake is the guy

149
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:43,613
Lea is into.

150
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:46,874
You okay with that?

151
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,966
I don't think you're okay with that.

152
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:54,034
I think that's why you're here.

153
00:07:54,036 --> 00:07:58,805
I'm here to help you through chemo.

154
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:01,074
When a guy is stoned,

155
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:04,744
he can tell another guy
anything that's in his heart.

156
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:07,981
You know, all the messy,
scary, embarrassing stuff

157
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:11,850
that he would otherwise never,
ever, ever tell anyone.

158
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:14,519
So what are you thinking?

159
00:08:18,926 --> 00:08:21,595
A dog pooped on your lawn.

160
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:41,248
You were right to insist

161
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,116
that we deal with the aorta
before the brain.

162
00:08:44,685 --> 00:08:46,593
I appreciate you saying that.

163
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:50,457
Don't let guilt make you
second-guess yourself.

164
00:08:52,493 --> 00:08:54,561
Why would I have guilt?

165
00:08:54,563 --> 00:08:56,463
You shouldn't. That's my point.

166
00:08:58,065 --> 00:08:59,299
Good.

167
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:10,410
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

168
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:11,511
I think I am.

169
00:09:11,513 --> 00:09:13,179
When a man's hungry,
you know what a man wants?

170
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:15,649
There's an open can of chickpeas
in the fridge.

171
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:17,450
- Mallomars.
- What are Mal...

172
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:19,553
What are... what... what is the Mallomar?

173
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:22,789
Pure chocolate, fluffy marshmallows

174
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:26,026
on a crispy bed of graham goodness.

175
00:09:26,028 --> 00:09:27,260
Get us an Uber.

176
00:09:37,138 --> 00:09:39,039
The next few days are going to be filled

177
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,241
with many difficult decisions.

178
00:09:43,044 --> 00:09:46,046
Decisions no parent
should ever have to make.

179
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:51,117
We've kept your daughter on life support

180
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:53,868
- because we...
- You...

181
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:58,091
want to ask about organ donation.

182
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:02,796
Yes.

183
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:07,000
You want her what? Her heart?

184
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,539
Unfortunately, her heart
was injured by the trauma,

185
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,541
as were several other organs.

186
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:20,246
We have a 16-year-old girl

187
00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:26,119
who had a tragic accident
a couple of years ago

188
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:28,421
that destroyed her face.

189
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,924
And we were hoping that you might...

190
00:10:30,926 --> 00:10:35,962
You... want to take my daughter's face...

191
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:38,131
and put it on someone else?

192
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:43,670
This young girl's life
has been devastated,

193
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:44,904
and you have a chance...

194
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:45,805
No.

195
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:50,300
I'm sorry, Dr. Andrews.

196
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:52,278
No.

197
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:03,446
- Okay, how about this one?
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:05,782
"The ugly can be beautiful.

199
00:11:05,784 --> 00:11:08,135
The pretty, never."

200
00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:09,953
Seems a little judge-y.

201
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:11,521
Yeah, well, it was Oscar Wilde.

202
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:13,531
Hmm. Fair enough.

203
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,662
So I'm guessing you didn't see
the Quakes last night.

204
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:21,797
The San Jose Earthquakes?

205
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,865
Your home team?

206
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:24,834
Yeah, I know who the Quakes are.

207
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:26,168
I recorded it.

208
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,037
No, you didn't.

209
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,305
Don't worry.

210
00:11:29,307 --> 00:11:31,707
I watch enough soccer for the both of us.

211
00:11:33,244 --> 00:11:35,011
They won 3 to 2, by the way.

212
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:37,513
Beautiful goal in extra time.

213
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:47,957
They didn't have any either.

214
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,859
Well, that's all the major chains.

215
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:51,560
We're 0 for 4.

216
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:54,897
Our next place is on Thornwood Drive,

217
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,067
just west of Santa Teresa Boulevard.

218
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:59,335
That's in Alamitos.

219
00:11:59,337 --> 00:12:00,803
Yes.

220
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,471
There are still 28 stores

221
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:04,807
in the greater San Jose area
that we can try

222
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,375
and I've devised a route
starting in the south

223
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:08,544
working counterclockwise around the city

224
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:10,079
to best avoid traffic.

225
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:14,050
We'll buy you a box, I promise.

226
00:12:14,052 --> 00:12:17,086
Okay, guys, I, uh, like a big fare

227
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:18,754
as much as the next driver

228
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:21,357
but racking up hundreds of
dollars on a munchie quest

229
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:23,459
is starting to feel exploitative.

230
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:25,494
What do you say I order ahead for pizza

231
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:26,962
and then we just pick it up
on the way home?

232
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:29,131
- I don't want pizza.
- I don't want pizza.

233
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,466
What takeout food do you like?

234
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:32,501
- I like pancakes.
- I don't want pancakes.

235
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:33,969
I don't want to go home.

236
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:42,244
We're paying you to drive us.

237
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,706
You want these cookies?

238
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:48,084
What is the real reason?

239
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,023
- You'll laugh.
- What's the funny reason?

240
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,626
I had a crush on a girl.

241
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:01,464
Robin Demayne.

242
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,632
Senior year in high school.

243
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:07,403
Her favorite snack.

244
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:15,678
Okay.

245
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,646
Are we going to get Mallomars?

246
00:13:17,648 --> 00:13:18,881
Nope.

247
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:21,417
You have been harboring
feelings for this girl

248
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:23,519
for over 40 years.

249
00:13:23,521 --> 00:13:26,055
<i>That</i> is a worthy quest.

250
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:27,890
Now, how do you spell "Demayne"?

251
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:30,059
D-E?

252
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:38,134
You're the same sex, race,
approximate age,

253
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:39,935
share compatible blood types
and antigens,

254
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:41,470
and a whole bunch of other things

255
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:44,140
that make you the perfect match.

256
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:48,611
And we just received permission
from her next of kin.

257
00:13:57,455 --> 00:13:59,522
Yeah.

258
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:18,374
Our donor's on life support
but her heart is compromised,

259
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:20,743
so we are very much on the clock.

260
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:23,913
Cancel all elective surgeries,
all personal plans,

261
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:25,281
and all hopes of sleep.

262
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:28,984
This is your home for the next two days.

263
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,324
Let's give Molly a new face.

264
00:14:43,118 --> 00:14:47,668
There is another Robin Demayne
living in San Mateo.

265
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:49,902
That's less than half an hour from here.

266
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:52,705
Ooh, I found one in Los Gatos,
even closer.

267
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:55,742
You realize how stupid this is, right?

268
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:58,111
This is a quest. A quest is never stupid.

269
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:00,646
A quest is, by definition,
almost always stupid.

270
00:15:00,648 --> 00:15:02,715
Why would I want to see Robin Demayne

271
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:03,983
after all these years?

272
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:05,752
To tell her you love her?

273
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:07,515
I just want a cookie!

274
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,211
I wasn't in love with her.

275
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:12,520
I was a teenager.

276
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:16,399
I was infatuated.

277
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:19,098
And whenever you thought about her,

278
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,533
it made you happy.

279
00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:23,102
And you thought about her all the time.

280
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:27,618
And every time you saw her,
you felt a rush, light-headed...

281
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,998
Is that how you know you're in love?

282
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
That's how it starts.

283
00:15:34,282 --> 00:15:36,282
And when you're not with that person,

284
00:15:36,284 --> 00:15:40,319
you miss them so much you're
willing to drive to 32 stores

285
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:42,488
to find a sensory reminder

286
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,857
that might bring back those memories.

287
00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:05,778
♪ I'm all right today

288
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,082

and you gonna get there ♪

289

♪ You worry me

299
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,592
Ride home's on me.

300
00:16:55,654 --> 00:16:57,254
Flake.

301
00:16:57,256 --> 00:16:59,457
Flake's a guy from my high school.

302
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,992
He knew everyone,
he kept track of everyone,

303
00:17:01,994 --> 00:17:04,228
and I guarantee you
he never left Livermore.

304
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,032
We need to go to Livermore
and ask Flake about Robin.

305
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:10,868
We're going to Livermore.

306
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:18,476
Every lab and imaging
test that comes back

307
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:20,511
just reinforces the fact
that this really is

308
00:17:20,513 --> 00:17:22,274
a one-in-a-million match.

309
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:23,914
Nice.

310
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:27,251
Yeah, it is.

311
00:17:28,086 --> 00:17:30,955
It's also very scary

312
00:17:30,957 --> 00:17:33,494
and natural to be having second thoughts.

313
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:36,247
It's just...

314
00:17:37,998 --> 00:17:40,918
I-I don't know how to
accept a gift like this...

315
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:46,737
Someone else's face,
someone else's identity...

316
00:17:46,739 --> 00:17:48,906
The face is just a mask.

317
00:17:48,908 --> 00:17:51,809
It's what's... Underneath that counts?

318
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:53,744
Really?

319
00:17:53,746 --> 00:17:56,213
Those lame quotes we've been mocking,

320
00:17:56,215 --> 00:17:57,948
you're gonna use them on me?

321
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:01,981
Yeah.

322
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:13,075
Molly.

323
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:19,503
Right now, your face is
the only thing anyone sees.

324
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:21,959
This operation will change that.

325
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:25,838
It'll let the world see not your new face

326
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:30,247
but what has always been behind it.

327
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:42,459
Will it count towards the coffee mug?

328
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,700
Flake lives at your old high school?

329
00:18:49,702 --> 00:18:51,869
He was the janitor back then.

330
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:52,937
He's the janitor now.

331
00:18:52,939 --> 00:18:54,738
He'll probably be the janitor

332
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,075
when this planet crashes into the sun.

333
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:01,145
- Flake.
- Findlay Lake was his name.

334
00:19:06,117 --> 00:19:07,084
Hey, Flakey.

335
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:09,186
Hey yourself, Glaaron Assman.

336
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:12,593
Your name was Glaaron Assman.

337
00:19:15,928 --> 00:19:18,295
His name was Glaaron Assman.

338
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,002
1973 state championship.

339
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:27,905
He threw for 460 yards.

340
00:19:27,907 --> 00:19:31,942
And if you squint hard enough,
you'll see who was named MVP.

341
00:19:32,344 --> 00:19:34,311
You said you had something to show us?

342
00:19:34,313 --> 00:19:36,280
Oh, yeah. Wait right here.

343
00:20:06,544 --> 00:20:07,856
Shannon?

344
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:12,616
I keep thinking she's just sleeping.

345
00:20:13,786 --> 00:20:16,120
How can I say goodbye?

346
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,350
We call it the Walk of Honor.

347
00:20:46,352 --> 00:20:48,986
To thank your daughter for her sacrifice.

348
00:22:40,014 --> 00:22:42,500
Do you remember a guy named Bobby Juarez?

349
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,034
Tall kid but too clumsy to play hoops?

350
00:22:46,036 --> 00:22:49,638
He told me that Robin
married a dentist named Scaplin

351
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,206
and moved out of state.

352
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,442
You couldn't tell me that when I called?

353
00:22:53,444 --> 00:22:55,210
I wanted to see you.

354
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:57,679
I found her.

355
00:22:57,681 --> 00:23:02,184
Robin Scaplin is in Portland, Oregon.

356
00:23:02,186 --> 00:23:05,187
It's an 11 hour and 27 minute drive.

357
00:23:08,324 --> 00:23:10,659
Fill up the tank, I guess.

358
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:12,416
We're going to Portland.

359
00:23:33,284 --> 00:23:34,383
10 blade.

360
00:23:44,995 --> 00:23:46,595
10 blade.

361
00:24:01,111 --> 00:24:04,079
Proximal facial nerve
isolated and dissected.

362
00:24:04,081 --> 00:24:06,715
Okay, let's start the heavy lifting.

363
00:24:30,774 --> 00:24:34,876
Clamping the left and right
common carotid arteries

364
00:24:34,878 --> 00:24:36,445
and jugular veins...

365
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:39,581
Cutting the carotids and jugulars...

366
00:24:43,219 --> 00:24:44,820
Let's do it.

367
00:25:59,897 --> 00:26:03,298
It's a long way to go
to visit a married woman

368
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,933
you haven't seen since high school

369
00:26:04,935 --> 00:26:06,768
who may not even be home.

370
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,938
She's home. I called at the last stop.

371
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,306
What did she say?

372
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:13,108
"Hello."

373
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,576
What did you say?

374
00:26:14,578 --> 00:26:17,312
Nothing. He hung up.

375
00:26:17,314 --> 00:26:18,680
When you sober up,

376
00:26:18,682 --> 00:26:21,249
you are gonna want to
turn around and go home.

377
00:26:25,988 --> 00:26:27,456
Probably.

378
00:26:53,984 --> 00:26:55,250
As rehearsed...

379
00:26:55,252 --> 00:26:57,919
veins, arteries, nerves,
in that order, from the chin up.

380
00:26:57,921 --> 00:26:59,354
Yes?

381
00:27:11,668 --> 00:27:14,569
Can I get the osteosynthetic
plates and screws, please?

382
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:17,639
Damn it.

383
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:19,674
I tore part of the donor's artery.

384
00:27:19,676 --> 00:27:21,243
I need more interrupted sutures.

385
00:27:21,245 --> 00:27:23,412
Let's keep our focus, people.

386
00:27:23,414 --> 00:27:24,646
Dr. Browne,

387
00:27:24,648 --> 00:27:26,181
Molly's parents would like to see you

388
00:27:26,183 --> 00:27:27,783
on your next break.

389
00:27:27,785 --> 00:27:29,131
Take it now.

390
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,757
You, too.

391
00:27:31,255 --> 00:27:32,187
Uh...

392
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:33,655
Dr. Park?

393
00:28:06,723 --> 00:28:10,463
I had a huge crush on Robin Demayne.

394
00:28:10,994 --> 00:28:13,508
A thoroughly unrequited crush...

395
00:28:13,997 --> 00:28:17,065
that slowly turned into a grudge.

396
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:19,868
Last day of school,

397
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,670
kids were passing around their yearbooks,

398
00:28:21,672 --> 00:28:24,060
and I signed in hers

399
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,476
something that was borne out of anger

400
00:28:27,478 --> 00:28:30,358
and resentment and pettiness.

401
00:28:30,814 --> 00:28:34,362
It was designed to be
somewhat humorous, but...

402
00:28:34,852 --> 00:28:37,586
was really just mostly hurtful.

403
00:28:37,588 --> 00:28:41,623
Later that day, at the award ceremony,

404
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:44,459
I was skimming through my yearbook

405
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:46,495
and saw what she wrote me...

406
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,836
"I have only two regrets...

407
00:28:50,434 --> 00:28:53,298
my haircut in junior year

408
00:28:53,937 --> 00:28:56,204
and that you never asked me out."

409
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:03,683
And just then, I looked out
in the crowd and saw her.

410
00:29:04,515 --> 00:29:06,181
Her eyes were red,

411
00:29:06,183 --> 00:29:08,650
obviously crying, obviously very hurt.

412
00:29:11,187 --> 00:29:14,356
And at that exact moment,
I was awarded my trophy.

413
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:19,828
I looked for her after
but never saw her again.

414
00:29:21,764 --> 00:29:25,700
Is that all the scary,
messy, embarrassing stuff

415
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:27,736
that guys never, ever tell anyone?

416
00:29:31,308 --> 00:29:32,921
Pretty much.

417
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,284
Dean and Lori?

418
00:29:42,286 --> 00:29:43,952
This is Shannon.

419
00:29:47,924 --> 00:29:49,980
Thank you for meeting with us.

420
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:52,065
And for...

421
00:29:52,763 --> 00:29:54,362
everything.

422
00:29:54,364 --> 00:29:56,698
If you don't mind, we have
so many questions for you,

423
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,433
about your daughter.

424
00:29:58,435 --> 00:30:01,202
We'd like to know what she was like,

425
00:30:01,204 --> 00:30:03,705
what she liked to do.

426
00:30:03,707 --> 00:30:05,807
Molly wants to know, too.

427
00:30:12,815 --> 00:30:14,082
Uh...

428
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:17,218
Her name was Karin.

429
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:20,522
And I killed her.

430
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,934
I'm supposed to tell you to get back in.

431
00:30:35,638 --> 00:30:37,205
Don't let him get to you.

432
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:38,707
It's not him, it's you.

433
00:30:40,443 --> 00:30:42,811
Your advice that I shouldn't be
second-guessing myself

434
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:45,547
is making me think you must be
second-guessing yourself.

435
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:46,615
About what?

436
00:30:46,617 --> 00:30:49,150
You're the one who insisted we deal
with the heart before the brain.

437
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:51,143
And you didn't fight me. Why not?

438
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:53,154
- Because you were right.
- I was right.

439
00:30:53,156 --> 00:30:54,322
But you have never thought anyone

440
00:30:54,324 --> 00:30:55,991
other than yourself was right in an O.R.

441
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:58,093
since you first stepped foot in one.

442
00:30:58,095 --> 00:31:00,428
You backed off 'cause
we're sleeping together.

443
00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:14,981
The car accident was my fault.

444
00:31:15,846 --> 00:31:18,913
It was my idea to leave so early.

445
00:31:18,915 --> 00:31:21,654
It was my idea
to let her sleep in the back.

446
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:26,117
It was up to me to make sure
she was wearing her seatbelt.

447
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:30,091
None of which would've mattered

448
00:31:30,093 --> 00:31:32,427
if the truck driver hadn't fallen asleep.

449
00:31:33,763 --> 00:31:35,630
It's natural to feel guilt,

450
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:38,667
but you have to understand
this wasn't your fault.

451
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:42,804
It doesn't work that way, Dr. Browne.

452
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,842
It was my handgun that hurt Molly.

453
00:31:47,844 --> 00:31:49,978
And you can say that
it was a freak accident

454
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,148
or that Molly knew
she wasn't supposed to touch it

455
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,188
or some other B.S., but...

456
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,719
it was my fault.

457
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,189
I had one job...

458
00:32:02,725 --> 00:32:05,156
...and that was to protect my family.

459
00:32:06,963 --> 00:32:08,563
I didn't do my job.

460
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,267
And you could try to make sense of it,

461
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:15,670
try to find something,
some pleasure somewhere,

462
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:17,127
some meaning.

463
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:19,240
But there just isn't.

464
00:32:24,347 --> 00:32:26,381
And then your daughter...

465
00:32:28,117 --> 00:32:30,251
...does this for us...

466
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:52,173
Hi, Robin.

467
00:32:53,676 --> 00:32:55,610
Aaron?

468
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:11,241
He had a huge crush on you.

469
00:33:14,445 --> 00:33:16,580
Yeah. Uh...

470
00:33:16,582 --> 00:33:19,983
That's not why I'm here, though.

471
00:33:19,985 --> 00:33:22,319
I'm here to apologize.

472
00:33:24,822 --> 00:33:27,357
For what I wrote in your yearbook.

473
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,658
Yearbook?

474
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:32,529
Yeah. Uh...

475
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:36,333
I wrote something, um...

476
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:45,256
...hurtful and untrue and really stupid.

477
00:33:45,944 --> 00:33:49,112
And then I read what you wrote in mine.

478
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:53,139
What did I write?

479
00:33:56,426 --> 00:34:00,028
She had a bad haircut in junior year.

480
00:34:00,158 --> 00:34:02,859
Oh. I certainly remember that.

481
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:07,931
Yeah, well, it was a long time ago.

482
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:11,535
Anyway, I just...
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

483
00:34:13,938 --> 00:34:15,238
Well...

484
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,707
Apology accepted.

485
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:19,743
Thank you.

486
00:34:24,282 --> 00:34:25,982
Mallomars.

487
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:31,521
Robin's favorite snack.

488
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:46,303
Right side donor to recipient
vessels are anastomosed.

489
00:34:46,305 --> 00:34:47,337
Ditto on the left.

490
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:49,205
Let's see how our plumbing works.

491
00:34:49,207 --> 00:34:50,640
Unclamp them, please.

492
00:34:55,479 --> 00:34:57,029
She's pinking up.

493
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:09,593
Moving on. Motor and sensory
neurorrhaphies...

494
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:56,039
How's our girl doing?

495
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:58,108
She's just waking up now.

496
00:36:03,881 --> 00:36:05,521
Hi, Molly.

497
00:36:06,718 --> 00:36:07,851
How are you feeling?

498
00:36:07,853 --> 00:36:09,219
Terrible.

499
00:36:09,221 --> 00:36:12,322
Then we're right on target.

500
00:36:12,324 --> 00:36:13,757
You want to have a look?

501
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:16,760
No.

502
00:36:16,762 --> 00:36:17,894
No rush.

503
00:36:20,398 --> 00:36:22,732
It is going to look...

504
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:25,835
surreal.

505
00:36:25,837 --> 00:36:27,971
Like you're looking at a stranger.

506
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:32,242
But it won't always.

507
00:36:32,244 --> 00:36:36,246
Because nobody laughs or holds their head

508
00:36:36,248 --> 00:36:40,183
or looks someone in the eye
exactly the way you do.

509
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,858
Okay.

510
00:37:39,376 --> 00:37:41,211
I apologize

511
00:37:41,213 --> 00:37:44,814
for telling you how to react
to losing a patient.

512
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:47,050
Thank you.

513
00:37:49,587 --> 00:37:52,088
When I accused you
of second-guessing yourself,

514
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,924
that's because I'm doing it, too.

515
00:37:56,494 --> 00:37:58,795
Our relationship has me
questioning everything I do

516
00:37:58,797 --> 00:38:00,530
and everything you do.

517
00:38:00,532 --> 00:38:03,133
You're making this way more
complicated than it has to be.

518
00:38:03,135 --> 00:38:05,268
It is complicated.

519
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,636
The fact that we're seeing each other

520
00:38:06,638 --> 00:38:09,539
changes the context
of all of our interactions.

521
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:14,811
I guess that's why
there are rules against it.

522
00:38:18,883 --> 00:38:21,751
I think I can keep
being a jerk to you at work

523
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:23,219
if that's what you want.

524
00:38:27,491 --> 00:38:29,359
You think we should end it?

525
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:35,265
No.

526
00:38:45,577 --> 00:38:47,010
See you tomorrow.

527
00:38:54,452 --> 00:38:57,787
So, once you're feeling
a little less woozy,

528
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:00,089
we'll set you up with
a whole bunch of therapists...

529
00:39:00,091 --> 00:39:03,426
speech, occupational, physical.

530
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:06,830
Shannon.

531
00:39:06,832 --> 00:39:08,598
Please come in.

532
00:39:13,337 --> 00:39:15,211
I'm Karin's mom.

533
00:39:15,907 --> 00:39:17,006
Hi.

534
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:22,812
I brought something for you.

535
00:39:55,714 --> 00:39:56,980
She was beautiful.

536
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:09,092
Thank you.

537
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:14,697
And thank you for timing
that elevator ride so perfectly.

538
00:40:19,536 --> 00:40:21,604
Can I ask you for a favor?

539
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:27,176
I'd like to say goodbye.

540
00:40:55,806 --> 00:40:58,241
Eh, we'll clean up tomorrow.

541
00:40:58,243 --> 00:41:00,209
And buy a new vase.

542
00:41:00,211 --> 00:41:02,445
Yeah, buying a new vase is easy.

543
00:41:04,615 --> 00:41:07,717
Vacuuming up my grandmother's ashes,

544
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,118
not so easy.

545
00:41:10,621 --> 00:41:13,287
Are you glad you apologized?

546
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:15,831
Yeah.

547
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:18,828
Do you still feel guilty?

548
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:23,199
Yeah.

549
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:27,203
Guilt must be a bad thing
if it makes people feel badly

550
00:41:27,205 --> 00:41:29,595
about something they can never fix.

551
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,709
Or maybe it's a deterrent

552
00:41:32,711 --> 00:41:35,011
so we do the right thing the next time.

553
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,649
You loved Robin

554
00:41:42,354 --> 00:41:44,887
but could never be with her.

555
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:46,456
Do you wish you'd never met her?

556
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:48,658
Not for one second.

557
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:56,966
I'm not okay that Lea is into Jake.

558
00:42:07,946 --> 00:42:09,969
Good night, Smurf.

559
00:42:11,049 --> 00:42:12,682
Night, Glassy.

559
00:42:13,305 --> 00:43:13,876

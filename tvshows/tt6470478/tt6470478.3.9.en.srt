2
00:00:13,243 --> 00:00:14,842
Mm.

3
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:32,824
Kinda overcooked the eggs.

4
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:35,352
Not used to a gas stove. Sorry.

5
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,518
Last thing I want is food right now.

6
00:00:38,543 --> 00:00:41,055
Ah, lightweight.

7
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:43,590
You know, I outdrank you
at least two to one.

8
00:00:43,592 --> 00:00:45,492
Never mind I was rolling on Molly.

9
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:48,228
I'm a cheap date.

10
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,741
I'll take the coffee, though.

11
00:00:52,492 --> 00:00:54,225
You're a doctor?

12
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:01,395
Well, Dr. Browne...

13
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,339
I had fun last night.

14
00:01:05,663 --> 00:01:07,030
Me too.

15
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:11,831
And that unenthusiastic response
answers my question.

16
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:14,734
"Wanna meet up again?"

17
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,273
I'll get out of here.

18
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:39,658
Hey, Shaun...

19
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,211
I have a question for Dr. Glassman.

20
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:44,451
Uh, he's, uh, in the shower.

21
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:47,020
- Do you want to come on...
- When did his shower begin?

22
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:48,855
Just... He just got in.

23
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:51,258
His showers are at least nine minutes.

24
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,721
I'd be late to work.

25
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,447
I'll wait. This is important.

26
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:06,273
Is there something I can help with?

27
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:09,276
The florist told me
the pink roses express passion

28
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:11,912
and the purple Peruvian lilies
convey devotion,

29
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:14,979
but I feel both passion
and devotion for Carly.

30
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,311
You could give her both.

31
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,451
Please ask Dr. Glassman
to text me the answer

32
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:24,086
as soon as he gets out of the shower.

33
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:27,298
Well... what's Carly's favorite color?

34
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:29,623
'Cause flowers don't really have meaning.

35
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,425
That's just a tactic to boost sales.

36
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,295
Purple.

37
00:02:35,497 --> 00:02:37,231
There you go.

38
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:02,601
Hi, Shaun.

39
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,168
I'd like to have sex tonight.

40
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,338
Would you?

41
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,989
Yes.

42
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,410
39-year-old male, multi-car accident,

43
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:34,578
blunt abdominal injuries,

44
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,646
including ruptured spleen
and lacerated liver.

45
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:38,315
- What's his G.C.S.?
- Nine.

46
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:40,584
Intraperitoneal free fluid
in the right upper quadrant.

47
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:42,919
We need an O.R., stat. Page Melendez.

48

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

49
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:03,573
We were at our engagement photoshoot.

50
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:05,108
I thought it was just a migraine.

51
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,344
I get them sometimes
with the flashing lights.

52
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:08,979
Then she started slurring her words.

53
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:10,380
I was trying to tell him

54
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:12,849
that I couldn't feel
or move my left side.

55
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:15,051
The only thing that got me
through was Tony telling me,

56
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:16,907
"Okay, it will be."

57
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:20,856
How long before your symptoms
began to subside?

58
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:22,258
About half an hour.

59
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,227
By the time we got here,
all I had was a mild headache.

60
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:29,031
I think you had
a transient ischemic attack.

61
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,399
A mini-stroke.

62
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:32,101
- A stroke?
- Mini.

63
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:33,536
Jeanie's 25.

64
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:36,272
Which is why we'll need
an MRI, cardiac echo, and labs

65
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:39,308
before... we know for sure.

66
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,811
Cauterize that bleed.

67
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:44,947
That's it for the liver.

68
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:46,849
What's his mean arterial pressure?

69
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:48,484
67.

70
00:04:48,486 --> 00:04:50,319
What was that place
with the deviled oysters

71
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:52,025
you took Dr. Lim to?

72
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:53,823
Oh, Mia's in town.

73
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:54,924
As some of you may be aware,

74
00:04:54,926 --> 00:04:56,863
Dr. Lim and I are no longer together.

75
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,762
It's called Half Shell.

76
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:01,564
Downtown, off Second.

77
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:02,933
Remove the packing.

78
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:09,538
Look at the aorta.

79
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,774
Likely a laceration from the accident.

80
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:14,295
We'll need to dissect further to
determine the extent of the damage.

81
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:16,445
B.P.'s skyrocketing.

82
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:17,847
He's just suffered massive blood loss.

83
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:19,715
He's under anesthesia.
He should be hypotensive.

84
00:05:19,717 --> 00:05:20,850
Pulmonary embolism?

85
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:21,884
Push beta-blockers.

86
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:23,752
That... That'd kill him.

87
00:05:23,754 --> 00:05:25,454
He's tachycardic and hyperthermic.

88
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:27,686
I think he must be on something.

89
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,564
MDMA mixed with anesthesia?

90
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:33,991
Give him a low dose of nitroglycerin

91
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:35,706
and calcium channel blockers.

92
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:45,941
B.P.'s dropping.

93
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:47,743
It's working.

94
00:05:47,745 --> 00:05:49,645
Push the full dose. Close him up.

95
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:52,281
We're gonna have to wait for the
MDMA to leave his bloodstream.

96
00:05:52,283 --> 00:05:55,317
We'll get a better look
at the aorta via imaging.

97
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,352
Good call.

98
00:06:02,126 --> 00:06:05,265
I need to use the restroom.

99
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:08,497
Hang in there, Jeanie.
Just a couple more minutes.

100
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:18,440
You should ask me
what I'm going to do tonight.

101
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:20,676
Um... okay.

102
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:22,912
But just to make it feel

103
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:25,481
more like an actual conversation...

104
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:26,849
Nothing much.

105
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:29,278
I've got a yoga class and a date
with Ben & Jerry tonight.

106
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,432
How about you, Shaun?

107
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:33,022
I'm having sex with Carly.

108
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:35,457
- Whoa.
- It's my first time.

109
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:37,993
- Mazel tov.
- It took us 22 days to kiss,

110
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:39,361
nine more to hold hands...

111
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:41,931
although, we don't really
hold hands when we hold hands...

112
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:45,968
and another six to touch
more than one thing at a time.

113
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,269
But now I'm ready.

114
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:48,522
That's a lot of foreplay.

115
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:51,106
I've been reading about
the four stages of arousal...

116
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:53,609
Fair warning...
the first time for most people

117
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:55,144
is kind of awful.

118
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:56,942
Your first time was awful?

119
00:06:58,014 --> 00:07:00,616
Not an appropriate question
to ask a colleague.

120
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:06,356
Although, there's an exception
to every rule.

121
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:10,492
Which books did your lover
read to prepare?

122
00:07:14,698 --> 00:07:18,500
No clots, no bleeds,
no occlusions, no P.F.O.

123
00:07:18,502 --> 00:07:20,169
W...

124
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:21,570
She didn't have a stroke.

125
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:25,074
She's having a seizure.

126
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,749
Pushing diazepam.

127
00:07:38,055 --> 00:07:41,090
She had to use the restroom.

128
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:45,561
Her bladder is distended.

129
00:07:45,563 --> 00:07:48,831
Whatever it's pressing against
must be causing these attacks.

130
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:53,202
CT shows she has two pelvic lesions,

131
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:55,738
and labs show elevated levels
of catecholamines.

132
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,107
The pain meds we gave her could
have distended her bladder,

133
00:07:58,109 --> 00:07:59,575
which is abutting one of the tumors,

134
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,510
setting off her second attack.

135
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:02,845
But what set off the first one?

136
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:04,676
Sexual intercourse.

137
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:08,083
The other tumor appears
to be within her clitoris.

138
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:11,520
Progressive impact may have
destabilized it over time.

139
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:15,024
And now she's at risk
of having more seizures.

140
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:19,595
Sex could kill this woman.

141
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:25,713
He's stable, and the MDMA
is out of his system.

142
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,987
We're good to go back in
and graft the aorta.

143
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:30,087
We're just getting caught up
with blood loss

144
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,455
and fluid resuscitation.

145
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:34,157
An endovascular stent
is minimally invasive.

146
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,792
It is a better option than a graft.

147
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:36,706
But a stent could clot off

148
00:08:36,731 --> 00:08:38,295
because we won't be able
to give blood thinners.

149
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:40,030
His liver is still a bleeding risk.

150
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:42,172
Let's take our chances with the stent.

151
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,468
We can be in and out
and have him back in the ICU,

152
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,737
where we can focus on his recovery.

153
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:48,739
I do not want to proceed without consent.

154
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:51,675
He won't regain consciousness
for another couple of hours.

155
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:53,610
We shouldn't wait that long.

156
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:56,079
Get it from his wife.
She's on her way here now.

157
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:02,085
We can remove the tumors,

158
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:03,920
but it means we also have to remove

159
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:06,032
most of your vagina and clitoris.

160
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:08,659
You can still have children.

161
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:12,029
Via C-section. It won't affect
your uterus or ovaries.

162
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:15,732
What about sex?

163
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:18,402
You won't be able to have intercourse

164
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:20,370
or experience an orgasm.

165
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:24,241
I-It doesn't make sense.

166
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:26,476
I've been sexually active for five years.

167
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:28,111
Never had any attacks.

168
00:09:28,113 --> 00:09:31,148
We suspect the tumor's
been dormant for some time.

169
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:36,219
What if I don't have the surgery?

170
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:37,954
What are the odds of another attack?

171
00:09:37,956 --> 00:09:40,223
There are many variables involved,

172
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:43,293
including frequency, duration,
sexual position, penis size...

173
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:44,928
About 2%.

174
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,029
Each time?

175
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:47,230
Each time.

176
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:52,169
On average, couples have sex
52 times per year,

177
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:53,837
which means in the next three years,

178
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,006
your chance of having
a life-threatening attack

179
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:59,276
is well over 95%.

180
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:10,420
I think we'll take our chances.

181
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:14,491
You should talk it over
between yourselves,

182
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:15,659
perhaps with a counselor...

183
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:18,261
I understand the situation.

184
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:20,530
I don't want the surgery.

185
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:35,345
I'll catch up.

186
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:37,975
Hey.

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,999
Hey.

188
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:40,571
Missed you at the research meeting.

189
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:42,162
I was in surgery. Craniotomy.

190
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:46,577
Now I have two consults,
a meeting with a donor,

191
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:48,168
and a hospital chair meeting.

192
00:10:48,193 --> 00:10:49,774
Well, don't forget to eat something.

193
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,232
Ah, food is for the weak.

194
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:54,726
So is waiting for this elevator.

195
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:57,402
Are we okay?

196
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,582
Yeah.

197
00:10:58,607 --> 00:10:59,639
Sorry, I'm just busy.

198
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:08,864
We're recommending the stent.

199
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:12,130
It risks clotting, but it's also
less invasive than the graft.

200
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:14,722
The graft would be
a more permanent repair,

201
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:17,952
but there's greater chance
of surgical complications.

202
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:22,838
I have to trust you, right?

203
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,154
Is Dad gonna be okay?

204
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:32,146
Oh, absolutely, darling.

205
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:36,096
We're gonna take good care of your dad.

206
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:38,231
He'll be home before you know it, okay?

207
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:39,499
Okay.

208
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:43,303
Thank you.

209
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:47,277
If we send her home
without the surgery, she'll die.

210
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,429
We don't know that.

211
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:52,512
And taking away sex
from a young couple in love?

212
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:54,221
That's devastating.

213
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,946
So's death.

214
00:11:55,971 --> 00:11:58,571
How much time does a couple
actually spend having sex?

215
00:11:58,596 --> 00:12:01,931
19 minutes per week, including foreplay.

216
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:06,400
The rest... that's the real relationship.

217
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:08,803
Forget the act itself.

218
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:10,538
Sex is crucial to the happiness

219
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,473
and satisfaction of a relationship.

220
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:14,241
Sex is destructive.

221
00:12:14,243 --> 00:12:17,445
It turns people into liars
and cheaters and idiots.

222
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:18,946
It might start relationships,

223
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:20,976
but more often than not,
it rips them apart.

224
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:22,676
She got devastating news

225
00:12:22,678 --> 00:12:25,613
and made an emotional decision
without thinking it through.

226
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:27,848
The least we can do
is get her counseling.

227
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,317
Was she offered counseling
when you gave her the diagnosis?

228
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:32,119
Briefly, but she was still
reeling from the...

229
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:33,187
Then it's over.

230
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:34,822
When she's stable, discharge her.

231
00:12:34,824 --> 00:12:35,889
Thank you.

232
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:45,058
Yeah, the pink heart and purple star...

233
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:46,725
How are you feeling?

234
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:48,894
Hi, Doctor. He's doing great.

235
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:50,362
Hi. I'm Dr. Browne.

236
00:12:50,364 --> 00:12:52,798
You had a tear in your aorta,

237
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,600
but we stabilized it with a stent.

238
00:12:55,993 --> 00:12:58,527
Until we can give you blood thinners,

239
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,995
you'll be at risk of a clot,

240
00:12:59,997 --> 00:13:02,015
so we'll be monitoring you closely.

241
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:05,393
But right now, everything is
looking absolutely perfect.

242
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,082
Oh!

243
00:13:07,107 --> 00:13:08,674
Gentle.

244
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:11,420
See, Cupcake?

245
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:13,245
It's all good.

246
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,670
Why didn't you come home last night?

247
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,895
Daddy had a sleepover at Uncle Jeff's.

248
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,688
He got a new turtle.
You can see it next time.

249
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:31,493
Your blood pressure is responding well

250
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:32,751
to the alpha-blockers.

251
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:33,885
We'll run labs.

252
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,000
If they're normal, you can be
discharged in the morning.

253
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,124
Thank you.

254
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:41,390
You'll want to be aware at all times

255
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:43,548
of where the closest hospital is.

256
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:47,289
Every time you have intercourse,

257
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:49,581
you'll be endangering
your fiancיe's life.

258
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:52,682
I-I'm aware of that.

259
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:53,942
We both are.

260
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,201
But it's Jeanie's body.
It's her decision.

261
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:58,421
I'm just... trying to be supportive.

262
00:13:58,446 --> 00:13:59,712
I don't think you are.

263
00:13:59,737 --> 00:14:01,437
You're being selfish.

264
00:14:01,462 --> 00:14:02,494
She's risking her life,

265
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,052
and you're keeping your mouth shut

266
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,410
so you can keep getting laid.

267
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:09,800
You do think I'm making
the right decision?

268
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:13,429
Yes.

269
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:14,554
I do.

270
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:26,171
Thanks.

271
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:34,315
He really is gonna be fine.

272
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:36,592
I know. Thank you.

273
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,428
You okay?

274
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:45,380
I think he's cheating on me.

275
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:47,287
His brother lives in Willow Glen,

276
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:49,914
the other side of the city
from where he had his accident.

277
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:52,917
What did he say about it?

278
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:56,212
That he had a breakfast meeting
with a client.

279
00:14:56,975 --> 00:15:00,008
Not unlike the excuse he used
last time he cheated.

280
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,787
Him denying it was the worst part.

281
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:06,615
Made me doubt myself.

282
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,976
You know, was I just
a paranoid, jealous wife,

283
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:11,900
throwing out wild accusations?

284
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:20,987
Your husband has just had
a serious car accident,

285
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:23,866
and you're very stressed.

286
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:28,098
Right now, all you should be
thinking about is...

287
00:15:28,123 --> 00:15:29,522
getting him better.

288
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:33,550
You're right.

289
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:37,754
Thank you.

290
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,312
Not at all.

291
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,533
Would you like to take my top off?

292
00:15:46,558 --> 00:15:48,325
Yes.

293
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:03,465
Would you like me to take your shirt off?

294
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:05,031
No.

295
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:07,325
I would like to do it myself.

296
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,325
Even better.

297
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:25,306
Okay.

298
00:16:26,705 --> 00:16:27,704
I've got it.

299
00:16:33,871 --> 00:16:34,870
- I-I got it.
- Okay.

300
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:49,513
Mm.

301
00:16:50,795 --> 00:16:52,094
Do you want to slow down?

302
00:16:53,864 --> 00:16:55,498
Do you want to stop?

303
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:04,820
I'd like to go watch some TV.

304
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:28,274
So, eh, you weren't feeling it?

305
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:30,107
I was definitely feeling it.

306
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,632
She... Mm.

307
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,400
I don't know.

308
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:34,835
I think you're confused.

309
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:36,503
I think... I think it's emotional

310
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:38,282
and it's hormonal,
and... and... and maybe...

311
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:40,273
I wasn't confused.

312
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:42,922
She had a tattoo.

313
00:17:42,947 --> 00:17:44,514
It was half a heart.

314
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:46,832
I don't understand why someone
would get an incomplete tattoo.

315
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,023
She shouldn't have something
that's incomplete

316
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:51,215
on her body that I can see.

317
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,041
You sure it was the tattoo?

318
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,477
Yes. It is a...

319
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:04,599
very disturbing tattoo
that makes no sense.

320
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,028
Maybe it's not about the tattoo.

321
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:09,102
I mean...

322
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:11,468
maybe it's about intimacy?

323
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:13,801
Letting another person into
your life... that's a big deal.

324
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:15,804
I know. Trust me.

325
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:18,172
There are gonna be things
about her that you love

326
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:21,876
and things about her that you don't.

327
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:25,245
And there are certain things,
like the tattoo,

328
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,189
you... you can't change.

329
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:28,341
Because...

330
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,801
because...

331
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:33,567
well, it's worth it.

332
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:38,855
She can get the tattoo removed.

333
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:41,426
She can't get the tattoo removed, Shaun.

334
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:43,827
I don't think it's about the tattoo.

335
00:18:45,164 --> 00:18:47,458
We are backed up.

336
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,832
Sorry, Shaun.

337
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:55,943
Okay.

338
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,283
Everything looks good.

339
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:02,683
Could've just checked them on the E.M.R.

340
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,874
I know.

341
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:05,265
How's it going with Shaun?

342
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:08,564
He tends to overshare with coworkers.

343
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:09,788
Yes, he does.

344
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:12,047
And he was oversharing
up until this morning,

345
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:14,465
so I'm guessing
the Night of a Thousand Stars

346
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,290
didn't go as planned?

347
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:18,074
We're fine, thanks.

348
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:19,325
Of course.

349
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,284
You waited three weeks
for a kiss. You're a saint.

350
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:24,276
That didn't sound like a compliment.

351
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,579
I like Shaun,
and I love that he's dating,

352
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:29,870
but I can't help thinking

353
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:31,728
that the kind of person
who'd go out with Shaun

354
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,906
might be seeing him
more as a project than a person.

355
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:36,498
And I'd rather not see him
get his heart broken.

356
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:42,407
Last week, two techs called in sick.

357
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:45,966
I had to diagnose and file
over 200 slides.

358
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:47,191
But when I told Shaun,

359
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:49,021
he came down and he helped me
get through them

360
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:50,412
until 3:00 in the morning.

361
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,611
I am not going out with Shaun
because I have a martyr complex.

362
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:57,369
I'm going out with him
'cause he's a great guy

363
00:19:57,394 --> 00:19:59,260
who treats me well.

364
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:01,319
And the condescending notion
that someone needs

365
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:04,103
an ulterior motive
to be interested in him

366
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:07,796
means you're the one who isn't
seeing him as a person.

367
00:20:18,743 --> 00:20:21,977
Your craniotomy ended an hour
before the research meeting.

368
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:24,002
You didn't miss the meeting
'cause you were in surgery.

369
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:26,161
I think you missed the meeting
because I was gonna be there.

370
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:29,120
I'm busy. I can show you
my calendar if you'd like.

371
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,519
You dumped me. I should be
the one avoiding you.

372
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,786
What's going on?

373
00:20:33,788 --> 00:20:35,208
Are you having second thoughts?

374
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,864
No. I'm not.

375
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:47,007
Why are you willing to die for sex?

376
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,289
Sex creates...

377
00:20:54,314 --> 00:20:56,364
vulnerability,

378
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:58,692
lets you be open,

379
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,409
honest with each other,

380
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,477
share your biggest fears.

381
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:06,369
Sometimes, you shouldn't share.

382
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:09,151
Sometimes, you have to
just accept, right?

383
00:21:09,176 --> 00:21:10,843
Wrong.

384
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:14,336
What you have to accept, that's
not for anyone else to say.

385
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:18,913
If you don't tell your partner
everything that you're feeling,

386
00:21:18,938 --> 00:21:21,864
thinking, worrying about,

387
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:25,958
then you aren't fully connected.

388
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:34,575
Close your eyes.

389
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,401
Yes, this is one of those
dumb sensory exercises,

390
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:38,792
but just go with it.

391
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:47,242
Now tell me one of your favorite
memories with your fiancיe.

392
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:52,788
Last summer, we went camping in Yosemite.

393
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,379
We decided to rough it

394
00:21:54,404 --> 00:21:57,099
by only packing PB&J sandwiches.

395
00:21:57,124 --> 00:21:59,457
The first night,
a bear rips into our tent

396
00:21:59,482 --> 00:22:00,739
and devours them.

397
00:22:00,764 --> 00:22:03,098
And the next night, of course,
we had this hole in our tent,

398
00:22:03,123 --> 00:22:06,851
and the mosquitos just ate us alive.

399
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:10,788
And the bug spray
that we thought we packed?

400
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:12,883
It was sunscreen.

401
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:14,667
And then when it started pouring,

402
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:17,319
we turned to each other
at the same time and we said,

403
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,050
"Denny's."

404
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,548
And that's when I knew
I wanted to marry her.

405
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,618
Great.

406
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:29,957
That was a memory of something
you got through together,

407
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:32,289
not about the time
you had a threesome in Miami.

408
00:22:33,838 --> 00:22:35,105
It was New Orleans.

409
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:38,502
The threesome was
in New Orleans, not Miami.

410
00:22:38,527 --> 00:22:41,562
And it was way better than the bear trip.

411
00:22:42,373 --> 00:22:45,030
But I wasn't gonna tell
my fiancיe's doctor about it.

412
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:48,256
Sex... makes you real with someone.

413
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:49,935
Sex makes you stupid.

414
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:54,746
I had the perfect man.

415
00:22:54,771 --> 00:22:59,040
He was... smart and funny.

416
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:01,766
He squeezed the sponge
after washing the dishes.

417
00:23:04,938 --> 00:23:08,907
Then one night, I-I met some guy
and I had a few drinks,

418
00:23:08,932 --> 00:23:10,665
and, um...

419
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,667
I got all tingly and got really stupid.

420
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,425
Never saw him again.

421
00:23:17,157 --> 00:23:18,624
Or my boyfriend.

422
00:23:20,153 --> 00:23:23,844
Sex can make us feel
incredibly close to someone...

423
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:26,514
honest,

424
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:28,541
vulnerable.

425
00:23:30,724 --> 00:23:33,979
But sex is not the goal.

426
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:37,316
All the rest of those things are.

427
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:44,110
She's the love of my life.

428
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:46,402
And I always thought that we were strong

429
00:23:46,427 --> 00:23:48,961
and that we can overcome
anything together.

430
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:53,106
But without sex...

431
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:56,617
...I don't know if...

432
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:58,252
if we have enough.

433
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:03,157
Okay.

434
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:09,030
Then you need to lie to her.

435
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:15,436
Nurse said you'd be here an hour ago.

436
00:24:15,438 --> 00:24:18,206
Yeah, well, you're not my only patient.

437
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:21,375
Look, I get it.

438
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,025
This is about as awkward as it gets.

439
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:26,707
Yes, it is.

440
00:24:28,998 --> 00:24:31,233
You know, I almost died in that accident.

441
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:38,900
When I woke up, all I could
think about was my wife...

442
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:40,838
and my little girl...

443
00:24:40,863 --> 00:24:44,098
and how much of an ass I'd been
and how hurt they'd be.

444
00:24:46,842 --> 00:24:48,843
So, why is it
that once I get out of here,

445
00:24:48,868 --> 00:24:50,558
I'm gonna keep cheating on them?

446
00:24:51,195 --> 00:24:53,225
I can't help it.

447
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,812
No matter how much remorse or guilt...

448
00:24:57,508 --> 00:25:00,075
I feel like I always give in.

449
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,299
Then you should leave them.

450
00:25:01,324 --> 00:25:03,158
I can't.

451
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:04,526
I love them.

452
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,873
How messed up is that, right?

453
00:25:13,687 --> 00:25:15,372
But I think you know.

454
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:18,328
Yeah, well, I don't cheat.

455
00:25:18,353 --> 00:25:21,087
I saw you checking me out in the bar.

456
00:25:21,112 --> 00:25:22,778
My left hand,

457
00:25:22,803 --> 00:25:26,271
just making sure I was married.

458
00:25:30,674 --> 00:25:33,376
You're just as big a cheater
as me, Dr. Browne.

459
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:40,829
My, uh, leg...

460
00:25:40,854 --> 00:25:42,254
it's... it's cold.

461
00:25:56,456 --> 00:25:58,022
No pulse.

462
00:25:58,047 --> 00:25:59,279
Your stent has formed a clot.

463
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:01,098
We need an angio, stat!

464
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:05,073
Everything okay?

465
00:26:05,075 --> 00:26:07,575
You haven't said a word
since "Pass the salt."

466
00:26:09,424 --> 00:26:11,258
It's about Shaun, isn't it?

467
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:16,485
Two weeks ago,

468
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,311
you asked me to give him romantic advice,

469
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:20,800
which I didn't want to do.

470
00:26:20,825 --> 00:26:23,626
And then he comes into my office
for romantic advice,

471
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:25,084
and you kick him right out.

472
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:26,875
It's because you're helping him too much.

473
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,699
He is completely dependent on you.

474
00:26:28,724 --> 00:26:29,822
For good reason.

475
00:26:29,847 --> 00:26:31,972
He hasn't spoken to his parents
since he was 14.

476
00:26:31,997 --> 00:26:33,897
The only person he cared about...

477
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:35,761
died right in front of his eyes.

478
00:26:35,786 --> 00:26:38,956
Aaron, I know how much you love him.

479
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:43,993
How you hate to see him
struggle, fail, get hurt.

480
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:47,131
But you need to let him.

481
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,174
And he'll be okay.

482
00:26:49,654 --> 00:26:53,055
Because he has someone else
in his life now.

483
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,880
Just like you do.

484
00:26:58,298 --> 00:27:01,770
Placing guide wire through the needle.

485
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:03,473
Placing catheter.

486
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,026
So, how do you know this guy?

487
00:27:07,346 --> 00:27:08,712
You knew he was on MDMA,

488
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:10,270
you've been avoiding him
since he arrived,

489
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,029
and... I checked on his accident.

490
00:27:13,054 --> 00:27:14,887
It was a half mile from your place.

491
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,478
I was with him
the night before the accident,

492
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,646
but it's not relevant.

493
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:21,247
It hasn't affected my judgement.

494
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:22,515
Yes, it has.

495
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:23,883
If you hadn't been avoiding him,

496
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:25,585
we could've caught the clot earlier.

497
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:31,250
I figure you've been
going through something lately.

498
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:33,839
Something that's really hurt you.

499
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:38,668
And maybe it's making you turn
to things you normally wouldn't.

500
00:27:39,953 --> 00:27:41,753
But some of the guys you meet
are gonna be trouble,

501
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:43,378
some are gonna be married,
some are gonna...

502
00:27:43,403 --> 00:27:45,136
He took a vow, not me.

503
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:51,585
That's the exact attitude someone had

504
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,343
when they helped ruin my life.

505
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:55,576
There's the clot.

506
00:27:58,907 --> 00:28:00,708
Activating angio jet.

507
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:04,571
It's too big to bust.

508
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:06,029
We have to open him up.

509
00:28:07,723 --> 00:28:10,502
You said to accept things
I don't like, but Jeanie said

510
00:28:10,527 --> 00:28:11,753
- I have to share everything,
- Shaun. Shaun.

511
00:28:11,754 --> 00:28:12,888
And I don't know...

512
00:28:12,913 --> 00:28:14,232
Shaun, stop, stop, stop.

513
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:16,845
I have to go home.

514
00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:20,268
I can walk you to your car.
Is it very far?

515
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:22,627
I think this discussion
will take at least 15 minutes,

516
00:28:22,652 --> 00:28:24,069
so maybe you can drive me?

517
00:28:24,094 --> 00:28:25,760
We have to set boundaries, okay?

518
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:27,251
We have to set some limits.

519
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:30,044
You can't just come over
6:30 in the morning,

520
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:31,506
uh, uh, for flower advice.

521
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:33,708
You can't just pop into
my office anytime you want.

522
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:35,199
Is this because of Debbie?

523
00:28:35,224 --> 00:28:36,880
No. Yes.

524
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:42,830
And I agree with her.

525
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:45,863
It was different when it was
just the two of us,

526
00:28:45,865 --> 00:28:47,998
but now we have people in our lives...

527
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,600
both of us.

528
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,535
We have to make them the priority.

529
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:56,402
Does this mean we can't talk anymore?

530
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:58,805
No, of course we can talk. Of...

531
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:02,083
It's just that there's a time
and a place for everything.

532
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:05,520
And this is the wrong time and place?

533
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,663
Yeah.

534
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:23,264
7:00 a.m. Tuesday. Pancakes.

535
00:29:26,617 --> 00:29:28,985
I liked it better

536
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,944
when it was just the two of us.

537
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:42,683
125 over 78.

538
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,307
Looks good.

539
00:29:57,885 --> 00:29:59,818
Nice bug spray.

540
00:29:59,843 --> 00:30:01,909
SPF 50.

541
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,566
Not much went right that trip.

542
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,772
But...

543
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,417
the more things went wrong,

544
00:30:11,731 --> 00:30:13,398
the closer I felt to you.

545
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:17,268
We'll get through this, too.

546
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:23,834
I don't know.

547
00:30:25,351 --> 00:30:27,559
Sex has always been...

548
00:30:28,448 --> 00:30:29,748
our language.

549
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,858
Our way of sharing who we are
with each other.

550
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:36,616
And if we lose that...

551
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,323
...what if we don't have enough?

552
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:43,158
We'll still have...

553
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:46,286
honesty,

554
00:30:46,827 --> 00:30:48,593
intimacy,

555
00:30:48,618 --> 00:30:49,748
love,

556
00:30:50,445 --> 00:30:52,211
three kids.

557
00:30:52,236 --> 00:30:53,402
Two boys and a girl.

558
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:03,548
I love you more than sex.

559
00:31:04,991 --> 00:31:07,059
I love you more than sex, too.

560
00:31:19,886 --> 00:31:24,223
Does... this mean
you're getting the surgery?

561
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:27,619
Yeah.

562
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,020
90 minutes without a pulse in his leg.

563
00:31:34,045 --> 00:31:35,511
He's at high risk for necrosis.

564
00:31:35,536 --> 00:31:37,357
Prosthetic successfully sutured to aorta.

565
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:39,358
Almost done with
the distal right anastomosis.

566
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,293
Careful not to narrow the artery
during suturing.

567
00:31:41,295 --> 00:31:42,595
Mm-hmm.

568
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:03,424
Blood flow restored. Good arterial pulse.

569
00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:05,324
Good job catching that clot, Dr. Browne.

570
00:32:05,326 --> 00:32:07,626
If we'd waited any longer,
we'd have to amputate.

571
00:32:08,815 --> 00:32:09,815
Thank you.

572
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,474
It... was a team effort.

573
00:32:15,626 --> 00:32:18,526
Making incision at the vaginal wall.

574
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:20,418
Murphy, develop margins at the lesion.

575
00:32:20,443 --> 00:32:21,575
Forceps.

576
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,008
Nicely done.

577
00:32:23,251 --> 00:32:25,417
How you turned your patient around.

578
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:27,576
It was nice when Tony told Jeanie

579
00:32:27,601 --> 00:32:29,367
he loved her more than sex.

580
00:32:31,171 --> 00:32:32,304
He was lying.

581
00:32:33,527 --> 00:32:36,195
I told him that if he cared
about her at all, he had to.

582
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:39,071
Maybe it was the truth.

583
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,653
It can be true
without him knowing it's true.

584
00:33:01,623 --> 00:33:02,822
What's wrong?

585
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:08,061
Dr. Glassman told me
I have to accept things,

586
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:10,476
but Jeanie said to be open and honest.

587
00:33:10,477 --> 00:33:12,344
I agree with Jeanie...

588
00:33:12,346 --> 00:33:14,059
whoever she is.

589
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:16,247
It's your tattoo.

590
00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:17,549
Thank God.

591
00:33:17,551 --> 00:33:19,341
I thought you hated my boobs
or something.

592
00:33:19,342 --> 00:33:20,640
It's incomplete.

593
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:24,003
Didn't you have enough money
to pay for a full heart?

594
00:33:25,362 --> 00:33:26,828
I got this in high school.

595
00:33:26,853 --> 00:33:28,219
It's incomplete.

596
00:33:41,044 --> 00:33:42,744
Not anymore.

597
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:46,466
I got you.

598
00:34:08,525 --> 00:34:09,991
Shaun?

599
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:14,536
Dr. Glassman was right.

600
00:34:14,561 --> 00:34:16,461
It's not the tattoo.

601
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:34,028
We were able to restore
blood flow to his legs.

602
00:34:34,053 --> 00:34:35,319
He's gonna be just fine.

603
00:34:36,735 --> 00:34:38,402
Thank you so much, Dr. Browne.

604
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,731
Now that he's out of the woods,

605
00:34:42,756 --> 00:34:46,058
you don't need to feel guilty
about questioning him.

606
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:49,905
All the pain, paranoia, and self-doubt...

607
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,622
you deserve to know the truth.

608
00:34:52,647 --> 00:34:54,413
He's just gonna deny it.

609
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,140
Then you need to insist.

610
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,085
Our relationship was a stupid idea.

611
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:22,521
Which made ending it a smart idea.

612
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:24,835
Simple, binary...

613
00:35:24,837 --> 00:35:26,325
and naive.

614
00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:32,290
I really underestimated
how hard this would be.

615
00:35:36,392 --> 00:35:39,060
Yes, I've been having second thoughts.

616
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:40,930
I'm not saying we should
get back together...

617
00:35:40,955 --> 00:35:42,455
What are you saying?

618
00:35:44,905 --> 00:35:46,605
I don't know.

619
00:35:48,128 --> 00:35:49,361
Good.

620
00:35:51,419 --> 00:35:55,689
It's... good to know that it's not easy.

621
00:35:57,658 --> 00:35:59,258
It's good to know that it mattered.

622
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:14,030
Intimacy isn't about a tattoo.

623
00:36:15,231 --> 00:36:18,599
And it's not about touching or kissing

624
00:36:18,624 --> 00:36:21,491
or... even sex.

625
00:36:22,937 --> 00:36:27,608
It's about sharing your biggest fears.

626
00:36:29,424 --> 00:36:30,458
Yes.

627
00:36:32,554 --> 00:36:34,155
What are you scared of?

628
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,981
I love being a pathologist.

629
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,725
But every day I walk into the lab,

630
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,955
I am filled with doubt.

631
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,214
Am I smart enough? Am I capable enough?

632
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:52,440
Do I really deserve to be here?

633
00:36:52,569 --> 00:36:56,516
How long until someone walks in
and exposes my fraud

634
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:59,108
and has me removed from the premises?

635
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:03,525
Eventually, those thoughts retreat.

636
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,749
Until the next morning,

637
00:37:04,774 --> 00:37:07,375
when they all come crashing
back into my brain.

638
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,222
That and pigeons.

639
00:37:12,436 --> 00:37:14,132
They freak me out.

640
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:16,311
Hmm.

641
00:37:21,037 --> 00:37:23,003
My biggest fear...

642
00:37:25,467 --> 00:37:27,901
...is that I'll be alone.

643
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,582
If I don't get over this, you'll leave.

644
00:38:02,812 --> 00:38:04,311
We don't have to have sex.

645
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,746
Can we just hold each other
for a little bit?

646
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:17,105
I think I'd like that.

647
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:56,581
Shaun?

648
00:39:08,327 --> 00:39:09,494
Sash...

649
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,613
Sash!

650
00:39:30,894 --> 00:39:32,161
You should go.

651
00:39:33,596 --> 00:39:35,264
I don't know. Maybe.

652
00:39:35,266 --> 00:39:37,650
It can wait till tomorrow morning.

653
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,403
Eh, you were right.

654
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,657
Everything you said was right.

655
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:46,016
But this is different.

656
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:49,752
Shaun needs you.

657
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,196
Hey.

658

you have an amazing story ahead.

652
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:57,335
I can't wait to see it.

653
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,345
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

654
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,693
(SIGHS)

655
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:23,107
MIA ON PHONE: You can come home?

656
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,430
I can come home.

657
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,297
But...

658
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
But?

659
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,472
Do you love me?

660
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,807
Of course I love you.

661
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:38,883
What do you love about me?

662
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,416
I love that you love our son.

663
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:49,154
I love watching you two talk.

664
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:51,990
I love the way Kellan
lights up when he's with you.

665
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,494
I love you, too.

666
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:58,630
For all the same reasons.

667
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:01,800
And we both wanna
be there for Kellan.

668
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,334
And we are.

669
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:06,672
But...

670
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,610
You and I don't need
to be together to do that.

671
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:13,712
(EXHALES SOFTLY)

672
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,257
Are you okay if...

673
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,864
Maybe it's time we
stopped coming here.

674
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:34,866
You're ready to move on?

675
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:36,868
No.

676
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:39,771
But he'll still be with us,
right?

677
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:41,506
Wherever we are.

678
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,376
He changed me.

679
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,884
That's not gonna go away.

680
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:13,304
I have everything I
need to stay overnight,

681
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:15,807
including this...
Negative for COVID.

682
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:19,911
I know negative tests
are unreliable,

683
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:21,913
but it's my third in three days.

684
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,449

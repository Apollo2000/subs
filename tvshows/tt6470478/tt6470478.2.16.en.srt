2
00:00:34,907 --> 00:00:36,842
Today is not Saturday.

3
00:00:36,876 --> 00:00:38,711
Why did you make me pancakes?

4
00:00:38,744 --> 00:00:40,947
They are fresh start pancakes.

5
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:43,383
Like the first day
of school every year

6
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,385
when you get to wear
a brand-new outfit.

7
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,822
Well, not everyone
wore a new outfit.

8
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:51,391
But the rule in this house

9
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:53,859
is that when you start
a new life event,

10
00:00:53,893 --> 00:00:55,161
you get pancakes.

11
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:59,365
I don't want a fresh start.

12
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,234
I want to stay in surgery.

13
00:01:03,403 --> 00:01:04,604
I know.

14
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:08,708
And I am really proud of you
for handling it all so...

15
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:21,387
Doctors, please give me
one more minute.

16
00:01:22,288 --> 00:01:24,290
We have an associate pastor
at the church,

17
00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:26,826
but Clarence
likes to write the sermons.

18
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:29,262
- Sorry.
- Please.

19
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:30,796
Although this is important too.

20
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:33,766
The surgery consists
of two steps.

21
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,136
First we fuse the spine
to stabilize it,

22
00:01:36,169 --> 00:01:37,703
and then we remove the tumor.

23
00:01:37,737 --> 00:01:39,905
Because the cancer has spread
to your lymph nodes,

24
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:41,341
you'll still have
to follow up with chemo.

25
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:45,945
Clarence, are you in pain?

26
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:48,581
Quite a bit actually,
but I'm fine.

27
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:50,316
Well,
since what's causing your pain

28
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,152
is the tumor pushing
against your spine,

29
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:53,953
the spinal fusion will ease
pressure on your nerves

30
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:55,155
and should eliminate your pain.

31
00:01:55,188 --> 00:01:58,624
Please, I, uh...
I need this pain.

32
00:02:00,193 --> 00:02:02,662
Can't you just do the second
part and remove the tumor?

33
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:03,963
If we don't fuse the spine,

34
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:06,566
it'll make removing the tumor
a lot more difficult.

35
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,301
More difficult,
but it can be done?

36
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:10,170
It can.
But I recommend against it.

37
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:12,105
Especially since
there's no reason not to.

38
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:21,547
I did something

39
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:24,884
unforgivable.

40
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:30,090
This pain is my punishment.

41
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:39,832
Can I ask what you did
that was so bad?

42
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:44,470
I killed someone.

43
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,880

44
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:17,570
My sister and I were

45
00:03:17,603 --> 00:03:19,339
coming home from climbing
Mt. Whitney.

46
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:21,073
We're doing the State 50 climbs.

47
00:03:21,107 --> 00:03:22,608
The numbness started
during the climb?

48
00:03:23,443 --> 00:03:25,411
First my hands,
and then my feet.

49
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,149
You have a headache?
Yeah.

50
00:03:29,182 --> 00:03:31,351
High altitude causes headaches.

51
00:03:31,384 --> 00:03:32,685
Dehydration compounds it.

52
00:03:32,718 --> 00:03:35,221
From now on just climb
slower and drink more.

53
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,793
Tell them about the other thing.

54
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:46,599
Before leaving for the mountain,

55
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:50,836
I had this
weird sensation like...

56
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,937
Dread.

57
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:53,739
I couldn't shake it.

58
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:59,545
Well, when people describe a sense of
impending doom, it's usually anxiety.

59
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,614
No, it was like a premonition,

60
00:04:04,484 --> 00:04:06,252
that I was going to die.

61
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:11,791
I'm sure it was...
Dr. Park will run a brain scan,

62
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:13,058
and we'll do some lab work.

63
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,042
Shaun.

64
00:05:04,109 --> 00:05:06,011
Hello, Dr. Lever.

65
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:07,913
Carly is fine.

66
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:09,349
Welcome to pathology.

67
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:14,820
It is going to be great
working with you.

68
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:23,229
What do you think?

69
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:27,933
I know it's a lot to take in.

70
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:30,336
It's kind of like your first
time at Disneyland, right?

71
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,405
I've never been to Disneyland.

72
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:37,477
Let me give you a tour.

73
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,812
Cytopathology, forensics,

74
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:42,282
genomics, microbiology.

75
00:05:42,315 --> 00:05:44,450
We get to identify organisms,

76
00:05:44,484 --> 00:05:47,019
interpret cell morphology,

77
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:48,654
sequence genes.

78
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:53,058
Is that a D300e

79
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:55,595
pathogen antibacterial
bioprinter?

80
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:57,397
It's new.

81
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,733
You're working on
antibiotic resistance

82
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:02,802
in emerging microorganisms?

83
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:04,737
It's "we" now, Shaun.

84
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,871
Yes, we are.

85
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:09,742
Do you want to play with it?

86
00:06:11,544 --> 00:06:13,313
Very much.

87
00:06:13,346 --> 00:06:14,814
Go ahead.

88
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:16,582
It's kind of your job now.

89
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:23,556
We are the detectives.

90
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:25,925
Surgeons are just the beat cops.

91
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:34,767
Our best bet is to try
to separate the tumor

92
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,069
from his cord,
and then resect it.

93
00:06:37,102 --> 00:06:38,704
Okay, this is insane.

94
00:06:38,738 --> 00:06:40,172
You know how
he "killed" a person?

95
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:43,108
He was counseling a parishioner
who committed suicide.

96
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:44,377
That must have been traumatic.

97
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,279
Traumatic, yes.
Murder, no.

98
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:49,515
Hey, I know it's stupid,
but he has autonomy.

99
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:51,384
I didn't stay stupid.
I said "insane."

100
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:54,520
You want to override his
wishes because he's religious?

101
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:57,022
Something like 90% of
Americans believe in God.

102
00:06:57,056 --> 00:07:00,360
I'm one of them.
Are we all mentally impaired?

103
00:07:00,393 --> 00:07:02,127
Should you ignore us all
if you don't like our choices?

104
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:04,597
Only those getting divine
messages from their tumors.

105
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,366
He's not crazy.
Okay, you're right.

106
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,369
He is just stupid.
But don't we have a duty to educate him?

107
00:07:09,402 --> 00:07:12,137
You're gonna talk him
out of his religion? No.

108
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:15,608
You told him the surgery
was more dangerous this way.

109
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:18,344
I don't think he appreciated
how much more dangerous.

110
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,582
Good idea.

111
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:24,950
He thinks he'll go to hell if
he dies before he's forgiven.

112
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:27,620
Make sure he knows
it can happen on the table.

113
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:37,397
An MRI for anxiety?

114
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,998
It does fly in the face of reducing

115
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:40,466
unnecessary medical tests.

116
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:45,605
When I was a resident,
I had a patient come through the ER.

117
00:07:45,638 --> 00:07:47,072
Female.
35 years old.

118
00:07:47,106 --> 00:07:49,108
Slight cough.
Slightly hypothyroid.

119
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:51,110
Normal vitals.

120
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:54,246
I labeled her a whiner
because she kept insisting,

121
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,148
"I'm gonna die."

122
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,750
I sent her home.

123
00:07:57,783 --> 00:07:59,118
And she died?

124
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:01,320
No. She kept
coming back.

125
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:04,590
Over and over again.

126
00:08:04,624 --> 00:08:07,627
We do this test,
we prove there's nothing wrong with her,

127
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,194
we send her home reassured.

128
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:19,805
Damn.

129
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:25,265
The MRI showed
a high grade meningioma.

130
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:28,301
An advanced tumor that grows in the
tissue layers that cover the brain.

131
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,339
Its features are consistent
with it being malignant.

132
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,512
These tumors
tend to be aggressive

133
00:08:39,546 --> 00:08:42,015
and impossible to fully resect.

134
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:45,351
Um, so what...
What can you do?

135
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:48,354
Palliative care,

136
00:08:48,388 --> 00:08:50,456
symptom control
with medications.

137
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:07,040
You're risking spinal damage,

138
00:09:07,073 --> 00:09:09,409
paralysis, death.

139
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:13,313
If that's what God chooses,
then that is his will.

140
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:16,683
If you have cancer because
he wants you to have cancer,

141
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:18,885
why are you here?
Getting treatment?

142
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,854
I'm here because
I believe in science.

143
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:25,892
I am who I am
because I believe in God.

144
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:30,664
So do you think all people who
are sick are being punished?

145
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:35,101
I mean, we have an eight-year-old
down the hall with bone cancer.

146
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:38,538
You want to go tell her
God hates her?

147
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:42,008
I'm sure that girl is not
suffering as a punishment.

148
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:45,411
She's suffering so others
may have a chance

149
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:47,714
to show her mercy,

150
00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:49,950
to show her compassion,
so she can inspire.

151
00:09:52,252 --> 00:09:54,655
I don't know His plan, but I know
it's not as simple as you would...

152
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:56,857
No.
No, it's not simple.

153
00:09:58,391 --> 00:09:59,926
Except for your pain.

154
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:10,370
His name was Michael.

155
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:20,213
His wife found his body.

156
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:22,048
You had no idea.

157
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:24,050
I knew he was depressed.

158
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:25,719
But you thought
he was getting better.

159
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:31,124
I didn't take his call.

160
00:10:31,157 --> 00:10:33,126
Because I was having a drink.

161
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:39,800
It'd been a long day
dealing with the renovations,

162
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,802
and I was having a damn drink.

163
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:51,845
Hey, Shaun.

164
00:10:52,412 --> 00:10:53,980
Hey, Carly.

165
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:56,549
I started Sadie Barnes
on anti-seizure medication,

166
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:59,119
need you to run
a peak phenytoin level.

167
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:01,054
The couriers must be happy
that the surgeons

168
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:03,089
are doing their own
specimen deliveries.

169
00:11:05,992 --> 00:11:07,127
How you doing down here?

170
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:13,099
Carly says pathologists
are the detectives,

171
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:14,835
surgeons are just the beat cops.

172
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:24,110
Shaun, are you happy here?

173
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:26,412
When did you give the patient
her loading dose?

174
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:28,181
One hour ago.
Hmm.

175
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:31,885
Shaun, if you're happy,
that's great.

176
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:33,653
But if you're not,

177
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:35,221
you have to tell Han
how you feel.

178
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:37,357
You need to show him you care

179
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,859
and that you believe
in yourself.

180
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,800
Do you need this done STAT?

181
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,935
No.
She's asymptomatic.

182
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:50,536
It's just for seizure prevention.
Good.

183
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,138
Carly says that in pathology

184
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:53,840
you can take a break
whenever you want.

185
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:56,042
I want to take a break now.
I'm going for a walk.

186
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:03,683
He shouldn't be in pathology.

187
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:06,319
He's a good surgical resident.
You're right.

188
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:07,954
Then you'll move him back? No.

189
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:10,023
You're wrong about that part.
He should be in pathology.

190
00:12:10,056 --> 00:12:11,925
But he was a good surgical resident.
Then why...

191
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,828
Because he'll never
be a good surgeon.

192
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:16,196
How do you think
he'll do in three years

193
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:17,563
when no one's looking
over his shoulder?

194
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:20,901
When he's looking over
someone else's shoulder?

195
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:23,703
Supervising new residents,
leading grand rounds,

196
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:25,872
advocating for
vulnerable patients.

197
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:28,108
Do you see him doing any of
that without a safety net?

198
00:12:30,676 --> 00:12:32,846
We can help him get there.

199
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,480
Just because he wants
to be a surgeon,

200
00:12:34,514 --> 00:12:35,882
just because you want
him to be a surgeon,

201
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,084
doesn't mean he gets to have
that dream come true.

202
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,587
Has it occurred to you
that maybe

203
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:43,189
we know Shaun
better than you do?

204
00:12:44,257 --> 00:12:45,992
Has it occurred to you that

205
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:47,861
that might be your problem?

206
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:50,897
That your view of him might be
distorted because you like him?

207
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:54,100
Has it occurred to you that maybe
he's better off in pathology?

208
00:12:54,134 --> 00:12:55,969
That maybe he'll even like it?

209
00:12:56,636 --> 00:12:57,770
Do you care?

210
00:12:58,771 --> 00:12:59,873
I thought you might.

211
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:08,081
We need better ventral exposure.

212
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:09,983
Drill off more of the
pedicle and vertebral body.

213
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:13,553
Ligate the exiting nerve root.

214
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:15,288
We'll take it with the tumor
for a wider margin.

215
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,128
I can't see it.

216
00:13:22,162 --> 00:13:24,264
The tumor's causing the spinal
cord to be bowed up to us.

217
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:31,037
We need more exposure to get
around and in front of it.

218
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:33,306
The vertebrae is
too fragmented and displaced.

219
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:36,309
We can't get a complete
resection without stabilization.

220
00:13:36,342 --> 00:13:38,044
He's tanking.

221
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,413
Probably spinal shock from tension
on the cord. We need to abort.

222
00:13:45,986 --> 00:13:48,454
All right, on three.
One, two, three.

223
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:50,862
You fixed me!

224
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,066
No, no.
What happened to my pain?

225
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,903
Stop!
We didn't fix you.

226
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:00,939
There was a complication.
We injected anesthetic.

227
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,442
It'll wear off.

228
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,943
We had to stop the surgery

229
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,578
before we could
remove the tumor.

230
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,780
You went into shock.

231
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:12,251
We lost your heart rate
and blood pressure.

232
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,587
We warned it would be a trickier
surgery without the fusion.

233
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,257
Nothing has changed.
The anesthetic will wear off,

234
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,792
the pain will come back,
but worse.

235
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,428
When can you try again?

236
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,231
Try again?
We failed.

237
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,867
There is no reason
to think we will succeed

238
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,202
next time unless
we do the fusion...

239
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,705
But you know what the issues are,
you learned... Why haven't you?

240
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,012
Do think God wants you to die?

241
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,654
Please.

242
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,323
Try again.

243
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,463
Cyanide poisoning.

244
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,700
The cause of death
on the Atlin case.

245
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:06,472
You know how I found it?

246
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,608
I smelled it.
Almonds.

247
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,450
Dr. Park's patient.

248
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,986
I flagged her eosinophil count.

249
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,788
It doesn't match up
with the diagnosis

250
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,357
of advanced meningioma
listed on the requisition.

251
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,993
Great. Nice work.

252
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,297
I'm going to talk
to Dr. Lim about it.

253
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,564
Whoa there, Shaun.
Hold up.

254
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,800
You don't need to do that.

255
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,703
The attendings are on the lookout
for the flags. They'll run with it.

256
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,038
I want to run with it.

257
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,341
You've been on the receiving
end. You know how it works.

258
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,811
How it works
is I see something abnormal

259
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,813
and then I discuss it
with the team,

260
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,848
and we plan how we'll fix it.

261
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:51,150
We run with it.

262
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:56,755
Shaun, once a test is done,
we move on to the next one.

263
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,662
I'd like to take a walk.

264
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,400
Are you going to walk to Dr. Lim

265
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,868
and discuss this case, Shaun?

266
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,676
That's not what we do here.

267
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:22,581
We investigate, report,
and then we move on.

268
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,385
Are you gonna be able
to do that,

269
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,686
move on?

270
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,522
I don't know.

271
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,560
But I will try very hard.

272
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,898
Next time.

273
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:50,976
Dr. Browne.

274
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:52,911
Is this about a patient?

275
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,980
No.

276
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,716
Come in.

277
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,821
I've heard a lot about you.

278
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:04,556
I'm aware you stood up
to a supervisor.

279
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,957
Is that what's happening now?

280
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:13,098
Um, I put together
a list of cases

281
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:16,101
which Dr. Murphy
contributed to.

282
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:18,103
Uniquely.

283
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:19,871
You're a loyal friend.

284
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,241
I've specified the ideas he had,

285
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,244
ideas that no one else
around here could have...

286
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,678
Do you think I hate him?

287
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,748
No.

288
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,655
But I think

289
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,825
you might be biased against
him because of his condition.

290
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,328
So he doesn't have communication issues?
I'm wrong about that?

291
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,264
No. But he...
If he had the flu,

292
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,334
I would tell him to stay
home until he got better.

293
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,269
He has autism...

294
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,604
I could tell him to stay home
until he gets better.

295
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,807
Instead I found a place
for him to help us,

296
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,276
to save lives.

297
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:02,147
And you should know I have rather
mixed feelings about loyalty.

298
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,176
All righty.
There you go.

299
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,313
Hello.

300
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,048
Aaron.

301
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,351
It's good to see you.

302
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,852
Yeah.
The feeling is mutual.

303
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:43,355
Can I have one of those?

304
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,758
The chocolate chip muffin?
Yes, please.

305
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,827
Special occasion?

306
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,462
Yes.
Yeah?

307
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,232
As of today, I am no longer
injecting toxins into my body.

308
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,702
Except, of course,
with chocolate chips.

309
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:00,171
Oh, you're done with chemo?
Wow. That's amazing.

310
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,707
Congratulations.
Thank you.

311
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,677
I was thinking of going out
tonight and celebrating

312
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,079
what may be very good news.

313
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,015
If you're free, my treat.

314
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,717
I...
I'm sorry, Aaron.

315
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,184
I have, uh, another commitment.

316
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,020
Oh. Um, tomorrow then?

317
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,522
This week is really crazy.

318
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:20,091
You know what? I am not doing
chemo every night next week,

319
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,228
so I am free every single
night, so...

320
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:26,031
Aaron, I'm seeing someone.

321
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:29,601
I'm sorry.

322
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,574
Nothing to be sorry about.

323
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,779
It was good to see you.

324
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,224
Keep an extra close
eye on blood pressure and heart rate.

325
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,496
I have extra
fluid, vasopressors,

326
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,597
and inotropes ready.

327
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,668
Why no God?

328
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,805
You follow in the tradition
that you're handed.

329
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,274
My family wasn't religious.
We never went to church.

330
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:10,742
I was there every Sunday.

331
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,644
8:00 a.m.
for Catholic mass.

332
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,714
My parents eventually got tired of
all the rules and turned Lutheran.

333
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,483
They found that dull
and went back to Catholic.

334
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,317
That's my tradition.

335
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,224
What do you think
it'll be like when you die?

336
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:29,294
Probably like it was before I was born.
A whole lot of nothing.

337
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,364
We're there.

338
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,568
Where we were when everything
went wrong last time.

339
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,970
We need to remove the tumor
without putting any pressure

340
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,373
on his cord at all,
or he'll be back in spinal shock.

341
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,511
And we need more tumor release
from the vertebral body.

342
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,846
Extend your osteotomies
proximal and distal.

343
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,150
Good.

344
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,788
I think I got a free plane...

345
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,457
Retract it from the cord
a little more.

346
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,630
I got it.

347
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,132
Now, when you remove it
careful not to morselize it.

348
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,003
Can you hold that up?

349
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,974
Dr. Reznick,
give me a measurement.

350
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,479
Max length is 4.5.

351
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:22,548
Get a pre-op scan up.

352
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,585
That says the tumor's
eight centimeters.

353
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,456
How does a tumor shrink
from eight centimeters

354
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,691
to 4.5 without radiation
in two weeks?

355
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:35,527
It doesn't.

356
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,759
Why the page, Shaun?
And why are you in radiology?

357
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:44,394
We rely on flags.

358
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,496
You have to count on
the ordering physician

359
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,033
seeing it while you move on
to something else.

360
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:50,167
Okay. And?

361
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,837
I don't agree with
Sadie Barnes' diagnosis,

362
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,273
and I think her tumor
should be biopsied.

363
00:21:56,306 --> 00:21:59,043
Shaun, I...
Dr. Han wanted me away from patients.

364
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:00,845
Patients are not allowed
in the viewing room.

365
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:02,479
So I'm not doing anything wrong.

366
00:22:04,414 --> 00:22:06,951
Two radiologists said

367
00:22:06,984 --> 00:22:08,853
it was a malignant meningioma

368
00:22:08,886 --> 00:22:11,388
in the insular region
and encasing the MCA vessels.

369
00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:12,789
That's exactly where it is.

370
00:22:12,823 --> 00:22:14,558
And her clinical picture
matches perfectly.

371
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:16,861
Arm and leg numbness.

372
00:22:16,894 --> 00:22:20,865
The tumor attachment to the
dura is slightly anomalous.

373
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:23,433
And the insular region
is slightly atypical, too.

374
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,974
What differential diagnoses
are you proposing?

375
00:22:31,942 --> 00:22:33,810
I need to speak to the patient.

376
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:36,113
Should I ask
Dr. Han for permission?

377
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,781
Shaun, I...

378
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,951
...will bring your concern about
the scan to the head of radiology.

379
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,188
But approaching Dr. Han?
Don't do that.

380
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:48,192
Now, I already talked to him
about your reassignment.

381
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:50,127
I don't know if it'll make
any difference...

382
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,264
If I were Claire, would you
let me approach Dr. Han

383
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:55,832
about something
that concerned me?

384
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:02,106
Yes.
I probably would.

385
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:06,276
Hmm.

386
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:10,814
Is that because Claire doesn't make
mistakes when she's communicating?

387
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:13,617
Yes.

388
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:19,723
Then do you think Dr. Han made the right
decision by sending me to pathology?

389
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:24,128
No.

390
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:38,008
The lymph nodes
have shrunk, too.

391
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,144
This is a PET scan
from two weeks ago.

392
00:23:40,177 --> 00:23:41,946
Enlarged and cancerous.

393
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:43,380
Today...

394
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:45,749
...they've all regressed.

395
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:54,724
Spontaneous regression
has been reported

396
00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:57,361
in melanomas,
renal cell carcinomas,

397
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,030
neuroblastomas, and some
types of blood cancers.

398
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,366
In a sarcoma
that's metastasized?

399
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,535
No. But if it happened
in those others, why not?

400
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,704
Because none of them make sense.

401
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,139
When I read about
disappearing cancer,

402
00:24:09,173 --> 00:24:12,242
I always think some doctor missed
something, forgot something,

403
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:15,479
screwed up something.

404
00:24:15,512 --> 00:24:18,415
The theory is that
the body somehow triggers

405
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:20,350
an immune response
against the cancer.

406
00:24:20,384 --> 00:24:22,652
Something somehow lights a fuse.

407
00:24:22,686 --> 00:24:24,754
The theory says the fuse
is lit by an infection.

408
00:24:24,788 --> 00:24:26,856
His lab work proves
he hasn't had one.

409
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,994
At this point, the most
credible explanation is...

410
00:24:30,027 --> 00:24:31,228
Are you gonna use the "M" word?

411
00:24:32,662 --> 00:24:34,264
You seriously can't say it?

412
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:38,435
Only when referencing
the 1980 U.S. hockey team.

413
00:24:38,468 --> 00:24:40,537
Keep testing.
Anything you can think of.

414
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,906
Molecular markers,
T-cells, PD-L1.

415
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,442
We'll need permission
from the patient.

416
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:46,743
Which raises another issue,

417
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,645
what are we gonna
do next, medically?

418
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:50,380
He was supposed to
start chemo next week.

419
00:24:50,414 --> 00:24:51,848
No, it'll wipe out
his immune system,

420
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:54,018
which may be what's
actually killing his cancer.

421
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:55,952
If we don't know
what's making him better,

422
00:24:55,986 --> 00:24:57,921
we don't know what
to stop, what to start.

423
00:25:00,924 --> 00:25:02,392
So we do nothing?

424
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:05,495
Just trust God to fix him?

425
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:08,732
We trust whatever is currently
fixing him to keep fixing him.

426
00:25:08,765 --> 00:25:10,467
If he took a Tylenol
yesterday at 8:00,

427
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,069
he takes a Tylenol
today at 8:00.

428
00:25:12,102 --> 00:25:14,804
Monitor him. Closely.
Scans constantly.

429
00:25:31,688 --> 00:25:32,689
Hmm.

430
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:41,065
Hello, Dr. Glassman.

431
00:25:41,098 --> 00:25:42,932
Hi.
Thank you for coming.

432
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:47,504
He has been doing this
for two hours.

433
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,840
Shaun.

434
00:25:52,242 --> 00:25:53,343
What are you up to?

435
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,280
Alphabetizing our canned goods

436
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:58,915
and checking
all the expiration dates.

437
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:00,284
Well, somebody's got to do it.

438
00:26:01,885 --> 00:26:03,353
Is something wrong?
No.

439
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:11,928
Okay.
Okay. I think

440
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:15,499
Dr. Lim's patient's
diagnosis is wrong,

441
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,467
but I can't prove it
without information,

442
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:20,537
and I'm not allowed
to talk to patients.

443
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,072
Shaun.

444
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,677
I want to run with things.

445
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,648
I want to fix people.

446
00:26:34,184 --> 00:26:36,920
Can you help me become
a surgical resident again?

447
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:40,857
No. I can't, Shaun.

448
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,326
I'm not president...
Yes.

449
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,364
I'm not the president of
the hospital anymore, Shaun.

450
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,500
And even...
Even if I was, it's irrelevant.

451
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:53,537
You have to stand up
for yourself.

452
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:55,572
And you know what?
If you can't,

453
00:26:55,605 --> 00:26:58,375
then the new Head of Surgery,
the Chief, he's right.

454
00:26:59,843 --> 00:27:02,011
Now, I can go
tell him he's wrong.

455
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:03,813
It won't do any good.

456
00:27:03,847 --> 00:27:05,415
Or you can go show him.

457
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,725
I'm doing research
concerning Sadie Barnes.

458
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:18,895
She's asleep.

459
00:27:20,397 --> 00:27:23,367
Perfect. I'm not allowed
to speak with her.

460
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,805
I'm looking for her sister Jess.

461
00:27:30,307 --> 00:27:32,209
I haven't seen her.
Sorry.

462
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,443
What are you doing?

463
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:18,199
Can you explain why, instead of
remaining in pathology as directed,

464
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:21,669
you were in a patient's room,
going through her purse?

465
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:24,405
I didn't speak to her.
She was asleep.

466
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:30,044
Dr. Murphy,
any reticence I had

467
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:32,213
about removing you from
surgery just vanished.

468
00:28:33,414 --> 00:28:36,050
You shouldn't be in
contact with patients.

469
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,219
Or their families.
Or anything they own.

470
00:28:38,253 --> 00:28:40,855
Do you understand, or am I
gonna be forced to fire you?

471
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:48,229
Sadie's social media says that

472
00:28:48,263 --> 00:28:49,864
she finances her climbing travel

473
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:52,066
by working as
a freelance food critic.

474
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:55,770
She reviewed a Japanese
restaurant that used to have

475
00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:58,873
a Restaurant Grading System Score of
"A," but then it dropped to a "C,"

476
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:02,109
which corresponds to very
bad food safety practices.

477
00:29:02,143 --> 00:29:04,645
Bad sushi can lead to worms,
but it usually doesn't

478
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:07,448
because stomach acid almost
always kills fish parasites.

479
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:09,517
But not if someone
is taking an acid blocker,

480
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,452
which 60 million Americans are.

481
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:13,588
I saw a bottle in her purse.

482
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:20,695
Sadie could have sparganosis

483
00:29:20,728 --> 00:29:23,998
with an encapsulated worm that
is mimicking a meningioma.

484
00:29:27,702 --> 00:29:29,003
That's a good idea.

485
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,307
Excellent.
I'll tell the patient.

486
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,309
I will tell the patient.

487
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:36,611
I'll tell her
we're doing a biopsy

488
00:29:36,644 --> 00:29:38,279
to confirm
the initial diagnosis.

489
00:29:38,313 --> 00:29:39,980
But we're...
It will tell us

490
00:29:40,014 --> 00:29:42,082
if the initial diagnosis
is correct.

491
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,885
Your theory is a real long shot.

492
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:47,488
It would be irresponsible
to get her hopes up.

493
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:51,559
Hmm.

494
00:29:51,592 --> 00:29:52,827
The surgery went well.

495
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,830
We were able to extract the
entire tumor without complication.

496
00:29:57,698 --> 00:29:58,699
Thank you.

497
00:30:00,268 --> 00:30:01,302
When can we start chemo?

498
00:30:02,503 --> 00:30:06,106
There are a few follow-up
tests we want to run first.

499
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,775
And we want to retake
your history.

500
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:09,176
Make sure we have a proper list

501
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,778
of all medications
you've been taking.

502
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:15,049
You want to take his history
after the surgery?

503
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:17,485
What's going on?
What are you not telling us?

504
00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:19,287
What went wrong?
Nothing.

505
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,657
The fact is, the surgery went

506
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,124
better than we'd hoped.

507
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:26,227
Your cancer seems to be

508
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,597
going away on its own.

509
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:33,834
We'll run our tests.

510
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:37,505
We're confident that there
is a medical explanation.

511
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:39,874
Oh, Clarence.

512
00:30:55,155 --> 00:30:57,658
Hi.
Hi, Aaron.

513
00:30:57,692 --> 00:31:01,195
Um, what I...

514
00:31:01,228 --> 00:31:04,665
What I told you earlier,
that I'm seeing someone...

515
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:05,866
I'm not.

516
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,303
I mean, I-I-I had one date,

517
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:10,070
but it wasn't, you know... Okay.

518
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:17,378
We're... We're just...
We're not a good match.

519
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:19,179
That's what
I wanted to tell you.

520
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,855
That's not true, you know.

521
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:29,324
You know, that's not true.

522
00:31:29,357 --> 00:31:30,691
You like me. A lot.

523
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:33,227
And I like you
even more than that.

524
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,762
So what is this?

525
00:31:34,795 --> 00:31:36,831
You know, I'd really
rather not get into it.

526
00:31:36,864 --> 00:31:39,367
You came to my house...
To tell you what I told you,

527
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,369
which I just told you.
Okay, you came here to be honest,

528
00:31:41,402 --> 00:31:43,037
and you're only
gonna be honest halfway?

529
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,372
You're not timid.
No.

530
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:45,940
Okay. Then what?

531
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,211
The last time I was here,

532
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:52,647
we were headed upstairs...

533
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:54,949
Yes, we were.

534
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:56,784
You fell.

535
00:31:57,785 --> 00:31:58,853
Yes, I did.

536
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:01,456
I tried to help you,
and you pushed me away.

537
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:03,891
I was embarrassed.

538
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:05,292
You were sick.

539
00:32:05,326 --> 00:32:07,795
You needed help.
And I'm not sick anymore.

540
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:11,031
Maybe.
And I want to go and celebrate.

541
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:13,601
With you.
Specifically with you.

542
00:32:13,634 --> 00:32:15,202
'Cause we have fun.

543
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:18,305
You... You make...
You make me laugh.

544
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:20,908
You make me feel good.

545
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:22,209
I like being with you.

546
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:23,778
Sounds horrible.

547
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:26,213
But bad things are gonna happen.

548
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:29,484
Aaron, I-it can't just be
about having fun together.

549
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:30,985
One of us is gonna get sick,

550
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:32,987
one of us is gonna need
to be taken care of...

551
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,989
Wait, wait, wait.
I just want to go out

552
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:37,425
and have a nice dinner with you.

553
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:40,361
Not to run away to Reno,
find a priest in an Elvis suit.

554
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:45,299
What are we gonna do, Aaron?

555
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:48,936
Just drive to a hill with
a view and neck till prom?

556
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:51,472
And then I'm gonna come home
and hope you call?

557
00:32:58,145 --> 00:33:01,649
Yeah, uh, you know,
I just came to apologize.

558
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:04,519
I'm sorry.

559
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:06,987
And I'm really glad...

560
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:11,191
I'm... I'm glad
you're finished with chemo.

561
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:13,060
And...

562
00:33:14,962 --> 00:33:16,831
You're gonna...
You're gonna beat this thing.

563
00:33:40,455 --> 00:33:42,356
Your immunoglobulins are normal.

564
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:44,191
Everything is normal.

565
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:46,360
We can't find
a scientific explanation.

566
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:52,266
Our prayers...
It's a miracle.

567
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:56,170
Miracle or not,

568
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:58,405
it seems we're
on the same page now.

569
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:03,544
There is no reason not to do the
spinal fusion to eliminate your pain.

570
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:08,683
Do more tests.

571
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,819
Clarence.
There are no more tests.

572
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:14,354
T-T-There must be.
There must be an explanation.

573
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:16,724
Redo your tests.
Find new tests.

574
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:23,664
"Let all bitterness and wrath

575
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:27,234
"and anger and clamor and
slander be put away from you."

576
00:34:31,872 --> 00:34:33,407
Ephesians 4:31.

577
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:37,111
I didn't take you
for a believer.

578
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:38,579
I'm not, anymore.

579
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:41,749
I'm not sure you are either.

580
00:34:44,785 --> 00:34:48,623
God speaks directly to Noah,

581
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:51,759
Moses, Job, and Solomon.

582
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,961
And now apparently
he has singled out

583
00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:55,796
Pastor Clarence of San Jose

584
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,665
to join the ranks
of the prophets.

585
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:02,402
I'm sorry, but unless
there is a burning bush,

586
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:04,639
it is narcissistic
to think that God

587
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:07,174
has made you
his personal project.

588
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:09,844
God speaks to every one of us.

589
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:14,048
You just have to listen.
You are not listening.

590
00:35:15,015 --> 00:35:17,785
People get cancer all the time.

591
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:19,319
Often that results in pain.

592
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:20,888
Those things are not unique.

593
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:22,723
What is unique

594
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:25,292
is having an aggressive
metastatic cancer

595
00:35:25,325 --> 00:35:29,263
start to disappear without
any rational explanation.

596
00:35:30,731 --> 00:35:32,399
The issue isn't God.

597
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:35,703
You have to forgive yourself.

598
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:41,742
What I did...

599
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:43,110
Cannot be undone.

600
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:45,279
But your pain can.

601
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,521
Clarence.

602
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,961
Your pain...

603
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:05,566
Your pain does no one any good.

604
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:14,675
Okay.

605
00:36:21,478 --> 00:36:23,080
Osteotome and mallet.

606
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:31,088
You lied when you said you never
went to church. What happened?

607
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:34,158
I didn't want to have this
conversation is what happened.

608
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:35,259
I'm not judging.

609
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:36,961
My brother took
a year off school to travel

610
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:37,995
and came back a non-believer.

611
00:36:38,595 --> 00:36:39,763
So ask him.

612
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,674
Was it freeing,
or did you feel empty?

613
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:52,876
Hand me the
first polyaxial pedicle screw.

614
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:01,085
It was like losing a loved one.

615
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,604
The moment of truth.

616
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,683
Follow me.

617
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:55,072
Our initial diagnosis was wrong.

618
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,840
You don't have a meningioma.

619
00:37:56,873 --> 00:37:58,075
You have a worm in your brain.

620
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:03,780
And while that sounds fairly gross,

621
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,616
it is completely curable.

622
00:38:11,955 --> 00:38:16,460
So, the sense of doom, it was...
It was wrong?

623
00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:19,530
It saved your life.
As did Dr. Murphy.

624
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,532
This is the pathologist
who noticed

625
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,134
an abnormality
in one of your tests.

626
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,572
That led us to this discovery.

627
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,342
Can I give you a hug, too, Dr. Murphy?

628
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,344
No.

629
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:39,083
You and your sister
will be free to conquer

630
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,718
whichever of the remaining
50 peaks you choose

631
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,987
as soon as my team
surgically removes the worm.

632
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:53,097
Thank you.
Oh! Of course.

633
00:38:55,432 --> 00:38:57,801
There are not a lot of doctors
who would have made the leap

634
00:38:57,834 --> 00:38:59,470
that you made today, Shaun.

635
00:39:01,004 --> 00:39:02,039
Good work.

636
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:07,044
Yes, it was excellent work.

637
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,680
Most people
would say "thank you,"

638
00:39:09,713 --> 00:39:12,483
but technically that's not
an incorrect response.

639
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,651
Hmm.

640
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,853
Have a good evening.
You've earned it.

641
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,560
I don't want to go on walks.

642
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,835
I don't want to move on
from cases

643
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:34,004
after the tests are done.

644
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:40,144
I do not want to be
a pathologist.

645
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:48,185
Dr. Han, you need to make me
a surgical resident again.

646
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,427
I appreciate
you telling me that.

647
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:00,597
I was wondering whether you had it
in you to advocate for yourself.

648
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:06,237
But the truth is, Shaun,

649
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,005
what you did today,

650
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,441
it proved I'm right.

651
00:40:11,908 --> 00:40:14,044
Your skills are tremendous.

652
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:17,181
Your weaknesses,
equally significant.

653
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:22,052
You could be
a great pathologist.

654
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:24,488
Just think of all
the Sadies out there,

655
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,257
waiting for you to save them.

656
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,589
Dr. Browne,
Dr. Reznick.

657
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,991
The surgery went well.
Your spine is stable.

658
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,330
I'm scared.

659
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:10,634
There may still be some residual
pain as you heal, but...

660
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:12,102
No, I...

661
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:17,174
I keep wondering,
what if I disobeyed God?

662
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,349
You have to have faith.

663
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,619
But you lost yours.

664
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,525
I didn't have a miracle to
help me through the dark times.

664
00:41:35,305 --> 00:42:35,942

1
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:06,406
My neighbor Kenny and his
girlfriend go all the time.

2
00:00:06,472 --> 00:00:08,608
The rides were actually fun,
Claire,

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,911
even though they hurl you
through the air very quickly

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,413
without a proper
threepoint seat belt.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,882
It was worth the $300 I spent.

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,625
What kind of carnival will
cost you that much money?

7
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:19,887
It was not just the carnival.

8
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:22,888
Kenny's girlfriend wanted to
go to see a movie afterwards,

9
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:24,890
but I just got
the second edition

10
00:00:24,957 --> 00:00:27,026
of Chaikof's
Atlas of Vascular Therapy

11
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:28,560
so decided not to go.

12
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:29,668
And you paid for everyone?

13
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:31,030
I had to. I lost the bet.

14
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,733
Rounds will have to wait.
We have a consult come up.

15
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,201
Hunter Denoble, 38.

16
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,613
Came into the E.R. this morning
complaining of severe neck pain.

17
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,505
Xrays show anterolisthesis.

18
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,783
A herniated disc. Thirtyeight a
little young for that, isn't it?

19
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:44,310
Unless there's a history
of spinal trauma.

20
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,612
There is.

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,814
Hunter fractured seven
vertebrae in his neck and back

22
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,649
in a motorcycle accident
10 years ago.

23
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,250
He was one of my first patients.

24
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,853
Suffered complete paralysis
from the chest down.

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,456
A few months back,
just gnawing pain.

26
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,490
Ibuprofen usually
took the edge off.

27
00:00:58,557 --> 00:01:00,092
Every day?

28
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,995
Yeah, give or take.

29
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,597
- It's not that bad.
- Last night things changed.

30
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,808
He couldn't move
his neck at all,

31
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:08,834
and the pain medicine
had no effect.

32
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,871
So, he wanted to tough it out,
but I dragged him in here.

33
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,173
Yeah, it sounds like you.

34
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,439
Feel that?

35
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:15,508
Yeah.

36
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,810
And that?

37
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,611
I made partner at the firm.

38
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:20,746
I don't like to call in sick.

39
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:24,650
And let's face it, I've spent enough nights
in hospital rooms for five lifetimes.

40
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,853
Can't argue with that.
Squeeze my hands.

41
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:31,890
You have any tingling
or weakness in your arms?

42
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:33,459
No.

43
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,296
The plain films showed what
looked like a herniated disc.

44
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:38,897
Which would mean...?

45
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,700
Artificial disc replacement.

46
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:44,603
Day procedure, he'd be out
by the morning at the latest.

47
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,673
You married him?

48
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:51,977
Yes, three years ago in Cancun.
It was lovely.

49
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:54,646
Even though
he's in a wheelchair?

50
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:55,914
- Shaun.
- No worries.

51
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,983
I get this all the time.

52
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,291
Sure, she can never wear heels,
but think of the parking.

53
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,455
What happened?

54
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:05,557
Pain shot right down
through my legs.

55
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,627
- Your legs?
- Yeah.

56
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:09,861
I haven't felt anything
below my chest in 10 years.

57
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,298
What the hell is going on?

58

60
00:02:57,643 --> 00:02:58,645
Mom.

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,481
Well, there's my girl.

62
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:07,954
I don't want to see you.

63
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,822
But I haven't seen you in years.

64
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,456
Don't run away from me.

65
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,592
- Can we talk?
- Since I don't want to see you,

66
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,961
it follows that I don't want
to hear from you, either.

67
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:19,831
I just came in
to get antibiotics.

68
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,634
My surgeon doesn't work
on Fridays.

69
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,703
It feels fine.

70
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,572
Sorry, it's not fine.

71
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,606
This implant
is definitely infected.

72
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,442
Just that one, though, right?

73
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,010
Yes. At this point,

74
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:34,614
your butt lift, tummy tuck,
lipo, and breast augmentation

75
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,817
appear to be healthy.

76
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,386
But I need to remove
this one and clean the area

77
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,530
before the bacteria spreads.

78
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,289
Well, can you replace it?

79
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:44,956
Once the infection is resolved

80
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,526
and you have
a few months to heal.

81
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:49,328
I don't want to walk around with
half of a face for a few months.

82
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,497
Isn't there anything you can
do to save the implant?

83
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:53,431
I can't make any guarantees,

84
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:56,218
but if I can replace the implant
without risking reinfection, I will.

85
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,673
Okay, Doctor.

86
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:12,519
I didn't understand the lyrics,
but I liked your mom's voice.

87
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,221
Is she a professional singer?

88
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:19,324
She is a lot of things.

89
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:21,226
Great mom wasn't one of them.

90
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:22,961
How so?

91
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:26,132
A lot of people have issues with
their parents, nothing new.

92
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,568
But everyone's story's
different.

93
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,773
How so?

94
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,843
When I was in high school,

95
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,646
I babysat the kids
in my neighborhood.

96
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,415
I wanted to buy
a laptop for school

97
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,650
like a lot of my friends had,

98
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:47,853
so I saved up 1,000 bucks.

99
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,723
I came home one day,

100
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,859
and the money was gone
and so was my mother.

101
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,895
And three days later,

102
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,331
she came back from Reno

103
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:02,736
with a designer dress
and a guy named Ricky.

104
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,739
I never got the laptop.

105
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,381
My mom made pancakes.

106
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:16,715
They were good.

107
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,587
What is that?

108
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,593
I've never seen
anything like that.

109
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,396
Maybe a spinal column tumor.

110
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:32,063
Hunter's initial
spinal cord injury

111
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,901
from the motorcycle accident that
caused his paralysis was at T1,

112
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,605
but that part looks
almost completely normal now.

113
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:43,543
Hunter's phantom pain is real.

114
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:49,481
My former mentor, Sonya Kung,

115
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:51,383
is head of the surgical
residency program

116
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,951
at Denver Memorial Hospital.

117
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,821
If you want a meeting,
I'll make the call.

118
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,623
Why?

119
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,525
You're gonna need a job
after this year.

120
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,161
You just trying to
screw with my head,

121
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,538
or are you actually
being serious?

122
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:05,063
The opportunity is real.

123
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:07,399
I'm trying to be nice.

124
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,701
I do that
when it doesn't hurt me.

125
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,437
And this definitely
doesn't hurt you,

126
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,873
you getting rid of
some competition.

127
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,877
True, although you're not high
on my list of threats.

128
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,079
This would be a much bigger
benefit for you.

129
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,116
Look, I fought to stay here.

130
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,750
I'm not going anywhere.

131
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,294
It's very rare,
but after many years

132
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,662
with a bruised cord like yours
that isn't severed,

133
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,730
it can start to function again.

134
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,367
So, this mass
is causing Hunter's pain?

135
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:42,668
Yes.

136
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,769
If the cord is healthy,

137
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,771
why aren't I feeling
more than pain?

138
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,540
The mass is compressing
the healthy cord,

139
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,975
just letting the pain through.

140
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,675
We still have to do

141
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:53,480
some more advanced imaging
to map the mass,

142
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,113
but I am fairly confident

143
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,750
that if we removed it
that could change.

144
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,053
You may be able to walk again.

145
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:10,832
We were able to
clean out the infection

146
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:13,225
and swap in a new implant.
I am very pleased.

147
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,559
You think it looks okay?

148
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:18,163
I love it, and you are going
to look great at the beach.

149
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:22,367
Wailea?

150
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,704
We went there on our honeymoon.

151
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,472
Thank you.

152
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:28,806
Ooh.

153
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:30,719
He's taking you to Hawaii.
You should be hugging him.

154
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:33,112
I'm so relieved.

155
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,582
Satisfied customers.

156
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:40,019
This is why cosmetics
is the most fun specialty.

157
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,553
Now, we're gonna
monitor you closely.

158
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,690
There is a risk the infection could
have seeded to other implants.

159
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:46,125
Keep me posted.

160
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:47,258
Yes, Chief.

161
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:48,895
I'll take the early shift.

162
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:56,201
Once I'm on my feet,
I'm never sitting down again.

163
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:58,837
I'm gonna take Cora dancing.

164
00:07:58,904 --> 00:08:00,606
She's a great dancer.

165
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:02,374
No.

166
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,875
I push myself.

167
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:06,445
No offense. It's my rule.

168
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:10,148
Right.

169
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:12,719
If this works,

170
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,219
after a considerable amount
of physical therapy

171
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,955
you may be able to walk,

172
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:19,459
but that doesn't mean
you'll be a very good dancer.

173
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:21,861
After years of atrophy
from not moving your legs,

174
00:08:21,928 --> 00:08:23,396
you will likely be very bad.

175
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,700
You know what the worst part is?

176
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,169
It isn't being in the chair.

177
00:08:31,236 --> 00:08:33,606
It's that people
see the chair first.

178
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:35,073
They don't see me.

179
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,541
You know what I'm talking about.

180
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:39,610
Why would I know
what you're talking about?

181
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:42,548
My brotherinlaw's on the spectrum.
So's my assistant.

182
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:45,418
I make it a priority of hiring
people with disabilities.

183
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:47,127
Let me guess. When you first
started working here,

184
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,420
- no one believed in you.
- They didn't know me.

185
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,924
They didn't know that I was
going to make a good surgeon.

186
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:53,326
No.

187
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,429
You were different.

188
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,997
I guarantee you
every other doctor

189
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:01,132
started with a basic
level of respect.

190
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:03,669
It's implied they're competent.

191
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:07,974
We waste our time and energy
trying to prove that we belong.

192
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:18,384
I'm fine.

193
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:20,319
She's just being thorough,
honey.

194
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:22,654
You've been over my body
three times.

195
00:09:22,722 --> 00:09:24,523
Early infections
often mimic blemishes.

196
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,925
It pays to be thorough.

197
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:28,794
Is this sore?

198
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,730
Maybe a little.

199
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:33,065
What's wrong?

200
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:34,498
It could be nothing,

201
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:37,370
or it could be a carbuncle,
an early sign of infection.

202
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:40,073
Dr. Andrews needs
to have a look at this.

203
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:48,880
This varicocele is raising
testicular temperature

204
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:51,049
and causing your sperm count
to be low.

205
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:54,120
Surgically, I go in,
ligate the varicocele

206
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:55,887
and recheck your numbers
in a few weeks.

207
00:09:55,953 --> 00:09:57,121
It's done under a local,

208
00:09:57,188 --> 00:10:00,159
so no anesthesia risks,
minimal blood loss.

209
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:02,193
There's a risk of low
testosterone and impotence,

210
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,496
but recovery time's
usually a week at most.

211
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,969
So, I could have kids, I just
might not be able to make them?

212
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:12,904
As I said, it's low risk.

213
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:15,016
I only mention it because
I'm obligated to inform you.

214
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,709
Well, you're obligated to
inform me because it's a risk.

215
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:20,712
It's an unlikely complication,
but, yes, it happens.

216
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:22,146
It's outpatient.

217
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:24,150
I do it right here
in the office.

218
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:28,087
What I see here
is a chance to fix a problem.

219
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:29,922
And I see a chance
to create a new one.

220
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:34,744
I'm... I'm sorry, I have to go.
I have a patient.

221
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:39,597
Look, I see a lot of men
with this issue.

222
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:41,733
Sure, they come in
because they want kids,

223
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,435
but I think what they really
want is to reaffirm themselves.

224
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:46,171
And that's a good thing.

225
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:49,508
Thank you.

226
00:10:52,678 --> 00:10:56,015
It's a spinal
arachnoid meningioma.

227
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:57,883
Have you seen
one of these before?

228
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,117
Much smaller.

229
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:00,752
They usually don't get this big

230
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:04,222
because the pain and weakness brings
the patient into the E.R. fast.

231
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,890
But in this case, no pain,

232
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,925
no E.R. visit
until it got this big.

233
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:10,438
And it's wrapped around the spinal
cord tightly and fused with the dura.

234
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,932
Can we get a fiberoptic laser
and take it out in segments?

235
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:16,635
No, I don't think so.

236
00:11:16,702 --> 00:11:20,505
It stopped growing
and settled in this position.

237
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:23,875
But I do think that we can dissect
along the subarachnoid plane

238
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,577
down to the largest
segment at T2

239
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,812
and remove it in one piece.

240
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,981
That's an extension of the mass.

241
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:31,818
No. It's the medullary pyramids.

242
00:11:31,884 --> 00:11:35,454
No.
It's an extension of the mass.

243
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,692
The pyramids are more central
and the color is wrong.

244
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:42,326
Murphy's right.

245
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:45,231
The extension's tightly
adhered to the brainstem.

246
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:49,335
Who caught it?

247
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,736
Jared did.

248
00:11:51,736 --> 00:11:53,005
Nice work.

249
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:54,549
Most firstyear residents
would have missed this.

250
00:11:54,573 --> 00:11:56,308
It's very small on the surface,

251
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,077
but I can feel the fluctuance
under the skin.

252
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:00,913
What do we need to do to fix it?

253
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:04,549
We need to remove
all of the implants

254
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:07,186
and some of the healthy
underlying tissue as well.

255
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:10,622
Unfortunately, it will cause
significant permanent scarring.

256
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,957
No, no, no, you...
You can't do that.

257
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,693
I'll look worse
than I did before.

258
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,837
I... I don't get it. You removed
the bad part from her face,

259
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,463
and it's fixed. Looks
good, no more infection.

260
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,141
Let's just do the same
with the rest of 'em.

261
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:22,667
It's not that simple.

262
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:24,836
When we removed the infection
from Emma's cheek,

263
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:27,806
it was under the pretense
it was a localized issue.

264
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,308
If we just take out the
infection from the new area,

265
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,577
it could jump again.

266
00:12:33,813 --> 00:12:35,847
I won't do it.

267
00:12:35,914 --> 00:12:38,383
When an infection spreads,
it often moves very quickly.

268
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:39,717
What Dr. Andrews is saying...

269
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:41,254
I understand what he's saying.

270
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,525
I'm 50 years old.

271
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:49,928
When I went to drop my
daughter off at Michigan,

272
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:53,065
we went to that bar
on Liberty Street,

273
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,833
where we first met.

274
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,136
I saw myself sitting there
25 years ago,

275
00:12:58,203 --> 00:13:01,774
young, confident,
full of potential.

276
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:05,776
Then you raise a kid

277
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:09,681
and look after your husband,

278
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:12,150
a home.

279
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:18,024
You lose touch
with who you were.

280
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,795
You... You said it was
an infection, right?

281
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:25,630
Like strep throat or something.

282
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,900
That's what antibiotics are for.

283
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,403
Couldn't we just use that?

284
00:13:33,038 --> 00:13:37,109
We could try strong,
broadspectrum antibiotics,

285
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:39,243
but I really don't
want to do that.

286
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,578
You could become septic.

287
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:42,180
You could die.

288
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,588
It'll work.

289
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:51,490
It has to.

290
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,294
The brainstem is complex.

291
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:58,865
Even our best imaging can't
provide a complete picture.

292
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:02,400
So, then, you would just
leave the cyst in him?

293
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,803
Other than the pain,
it's not harming Hunter.

294
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,179
It's stabilized now
and done growing.

295
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:07,772
But what about the pain?

296
00:14:07,838 --> 00:14:12,544
An implanted nerve inhibitor
will completely remove the pain.

297
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,514
But I won't be able to walk.

298
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:18,550
No.

299
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:27,760
Exactly how risky is removing
the mass from the brainstem?

300
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:29,427
Everything that
keeps your heart beating

301
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,163
and you breathing
is right there.

302
00:14:31,228 --> 00:14:33,931
The nerve inhibitor
is a day procedure.

303
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,000
You'd sleep in your bed
tonight painfree.

304
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:37,470
Give me a percentage
on this thing.

305
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:39,003
Don't do this to yourself.

306
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:41,005
I don't like to give
those kinds of numbers.

307
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:42,983
They're populationbased, and they don't
apply to your exact circumstance.

308
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,309
I understand
how statistics work.

309
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:46,511
But there's a number,
and it's relevant.

310
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:52,583
There's a 15% chance
the surgery would kill you.

311
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:01,996
I remember the moment I
accepted I'd never walk again.

312
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,400
It wasn't when Dr. Melendez
told me after the accident.

313
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:11,538
It was a few months later
when I was in rehab

314
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:16,176
and I was trying to
get up in the standing frame.

315
00:15:16,242 --> 00:15:19,282
I looked out the window and there's all
these people just living their lives.

316
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,117
I'm trying to fix something
that I can't change,

317
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:26,920
and life was going on
without me.

318
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,726
So I started living again.

319
00:15:38,432 --> 00:15:39,967
But now there's
something I can do.

320
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:45,673
Hunter...

321
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:51,245
I want to talk to Dr. Melendez.

322
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:57,150
No.

323
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:58,418
Please.

324
00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:00,587
Just go get Dr. Melendez.

325
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:16,637
You curious?

326
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:19,872
About why I gave you the credit?

327
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:21,775
I assume you thought
it was a setup,

328
00:16:21,841 --> 00:16:24,611
that Andrews thought you were wrong
and you tried to throw it on me.

329
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:26,246
That's very cynical.

330
00:16:27,715 --> 00:16:30,284
The other alternative
is that you were being kind,

331
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:31,951
which seems very unlikely.

332
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:34,154
There is a third possibility.

333
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:37,057
I'm proving a point.

334
00:16:37,124 --> 00:16:39,426
When you lose their respect,
no matter what you do,

335
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:40,870
no matter how many wins
you chalk up,

336
00:16:40,894 --> 00:16:42,729
you'll never get it back.

337
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:44,363
The game's already over.

338
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,532
You lost.

339
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,135
Does anyone like you?

340
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:50,837
I like me.

341
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:52,373
I've got results.

342
00:16:57,342 --> 00:16:59,578
I know this is her first cycle
of antibiotics,

343
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,480
but I'm not seeing
any improvement.

344
00:17:01,547 --> 00:17:03,182
Her neutrophils
are through the roof.

345
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,422
You'd be under anesthesia
for nine hours,

346
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:11,099
and I'll need to make sure that your body's
healthy enough to handle the stress.

347
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:13,294
Will you tell him
not to do this, please?

348
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:15,828
You don't care what I think?

349
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:17,296
I'm the one in the chair.

350
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:18,641
You have no idea
what that's like.

351
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:20,601
I'm right there with you.

352
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,269
Who carries you up the stairs?

353
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:24,070
Who pushes you out
through the sand

354
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:25,672
so you can put your feet
in the water?

355
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:27,649
Well, this way you won't have
to do those things anymore.

356
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:30,386
So you just want to gamble the life that
you have for the life that you had?

357
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,745
Cora.

358
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:36,349
We have a great life,

359
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,751
but I want to walk again.

360
00:17:38,884 --> 00:17:40,720
And I want you to see me walk.

361
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,624
I'm not gonna stand by
and watch you die.

362
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:48,995
If you want to selfishly
gamble your life away,

363
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:50,630
you're doing it on your own.

364
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,601
I'm doing this for us.

365
00:17:55,735 --> 00:17:58,272
No, you're doing this for you.

366
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:11,084
She'll be back.

367
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:18,366
Dr. Tolles to Obstetrics,
please. Dr. Tolles to Obstetrics.

368
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,060
Hey. I got a page?

369
00:18:25,832 --> 00:18:28,701
I'm busy, and I don't like being
tricked into coming down here.

370
00:18:28,768 --> 00:18:30,736
- Yeah, I know you hate me...
- I don't hate you.

371
00:18:30,803 --> 00:18:32,572
Seeing you
is not healthy for me.

372
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:35,775
Okay, wait... Well, I just need
to tell you that I was sick.

373
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:41,782
I am sick.

374
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:43,460
I know, you've been telling me
that for years.

375
00:18:43,484 --> 00:18:44,952
You were right.

376
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:47,587
I got help.

377
00:18:47,653 --> 00:18:49,855
They have me
on mood stabilizers.

378
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,890
I'm doing better now.

379
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:54,061
I mean, sometimes the meds
make me feel flat.

380
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:56,697
You know, no highs, no fun.

381
00:18:56,764 --> 00:18:58,564
No lows, though, either.
It's worth it.

382
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:02,769
I'd like to try again
to be your mom.

383
00:19:05,171 --> 00:19:07,975
I mean, maybe we could just
talk some more?

384
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:12,344
I'll think about it.

385
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:14,547
Well, take these.

386
00:19:14,614 --> 00:19:16,416
They need water
or they're gonna die.

387
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,419
My number's on the card.

388
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:35,167
I think I
just won the Tour de France.

389
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:38,604
It's a long surgery. It will put
a lot of strain on your heart.

390
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:44,544
Your cardiovascular fitness
is excellent.

391
00:19:52,886 --> 00:19:54,254
You get it, right?

392
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,390
Get what?

393
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:58,025
Why I want this surgery so bad.

394
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,326
You'd jump at a cure for
autism, wouldn't ya?

395
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:04,430
There isn't a cure for autism.

396
00:20:04,497 --> 00:20:08,367
Well, last week I didn't think
there was a surgery to help me.

397
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,009
The surgery isn't guaranteed
to help you walk.

398
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:18,311
Why would you risk

399
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:20,813
losing a person who accepts
you the way you are?

400
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,650
You may not find another one.

401
00:20:23,716 --> 00:20:26,186
There are a lot of reasons
to marry me, you know?

402
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:29,465
I'm sure there are a lot of
reasons to marry you.

403
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:33,526
Yes. I'm organized, I have
excellent visualspatial memory,

404
00:20:33,593 --> 00:20:36,662
and Lea says I'm refreshingly
honest and fair.

405
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:43,035
I suppose Cora loves me
because I'm determined...

406
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:44,871
I'm pretty smart,

407
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:48,675
committed to helping others,

408
00:20:48,742 --> 00:20:50,577
and most of all,
probably because I'm patient.

409
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:54,414
Were you always those things?

410
00:20:56,315 --> 00:20:58,751
Were you those things before
you were in the wheelchair?

411
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:05,058
Your autism helped you.
That's your point.

412
00:21:05,124 --> 00:21:07,093
You're saying this chair
made me a better person.

413
00:21:09,862 --> 00:21:13,265
The difference is
losing this chair now

414
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:16,335
won't make me lose
the lessons it gave me.

415
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,813
The antibiotics aren't working.

416
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,316
I told you if they didn't,
we'd be doing surgery next.

417
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:34,288
No.

418
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:39,760
She's going to die
if we don't act now.

419
00:21:42,728 --> 00:21:46,667
Honey, we need to
listen to the doctors.

420
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,303
I need you to trust me.

421
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:56,310
I can't go back to being
like it used to be.

422
00:21:57,544 --> 00:21:58,812
You don't have a choice.

423
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:08,387
She wants a second opinion.

424
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:09,889
She's going to die.

425
00:22:09,956 --> 00:22:11,225
I told her that.

426
00:22:27,474 --> 00:22:30,611
Sometimes, it's tough
to actually get out of those doors.

427
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:38,318
When I was a kid,

428
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:41,722
my little sister had an
accident climbing a tree,

429
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:43,691
a traumatic brain injury,

430
00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:47,495
and I woke up every morning
dreaming that she was better,

431
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:51,631
but she wasn't.

432
00:22:51,698 --> 00:22:53,166
I took care of her a lot.

433
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:55,904
Brushed her teeth,
combed her hair, fed her.

434
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:02,810
Hunter was my first patient
as an attending,

435
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:05,378
and I had to walk in
that room and tell him

436
00:23:05,445 --> 00:23:07,581
that there was nothing
I could do for him,

437
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:09,751
nothing I could do to fix him.

438
00:23:11,184 --> 00:23:12,720
And now there is?

439
00:23:15,822 --> 00:23:17,590
But there's no guarantee.

440
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:19,260
There is never a guarantee.

441
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:30,371
I'm sorry, but I can't risk

442
00:23:30,437 --> 00:23:32,506
losing the man
that I fell in love with.

443
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:41,781
You're not just afraid that
the surgery will kill him.

444
00:23:41,848 --> 00:23:43,384
You're afraid
that it might work.

445
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:47,254
You've only known Hunter
in a wheelchair.

446
00:23:47,321 --> 00:23:50,691
Walking would be a fundamental
change in who he is,

447
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:55,930
a fundamental change
in who you are as a couple.

448
00:23:55,996 --> 00:23:58,632
You're worried that no matter what
happens, you're gonna lose him.

449
00:24:03,002 --> 00:24:04,472
Hunter seems to
have a great life.

450
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:06,441
I don't know if I'd risk
giving that up.

451
00:24:06,507 --> 00:24:09,243
What if there was an operation
to make you a perfect doctor,

452
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:13,780
never make a mistake, but it had
a, you know, 5% of killing you?

453
00:24:13,848 --> 00:24:15,048
Would you do it?

454
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:16,784
That's not a fair comparison.

455
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:20,120
Well, you said Hunter's
doing fine the way he is,

456
00:24:20,187 --> 00:24:22,822
but we're talking about
giving him something more.

457
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:24,291
What about 2%?

458
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:27,204
I don't think
there's a number for me.

459
00:24:27,228 --> 00:24:28,763
Of course there's a number.

460
00:24:28,828 --> 00:24:30,463
Every time you get in your car,

461
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,741
hell, every time
you leave your home,

462
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:33,308
you take a risk
something bad could happen.

463
00:24:33,332 --> 00:24:34,701
But you do it anyway,

464
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:36,936
you know,
to make yourself better,

465
00:24:37,003 --> 00:24:38,838
to make the world better,

466
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:39,985
sometimes just to have fun.

467
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,643
Sometimes to go to a carnival.

468
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,444
Kenny's not your friend.

469
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:45,847
He's using you.

470
00:24:47,013 --> 00:24:48,982
I... don't think so.

471
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,183
We have fun.

472
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,486
He's got a rap sheet.

473
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:53,319
Mostly misdemeanors,

474
00:24:53,386 --> 00:24:55,990
but there's a couple
felony theft cases

475
00:24:56,056 --> 00:24:57,691
that were bargained down.

476
00:24:57,758 --> 00:25:01,095
Wait, you ran a background
check on Kenny?

477
00:25:01,162 --> 00:25:04,365
Well, you start by talking,
I start by gathering evidence.

478
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:08,268
I'll forward it to you.

479
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:25,152
In my experience,
there are only two reasons

480
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:27,588
why a married person has
this kind of cosmetic surgery.

481
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:29,723
Either you're halfway
out the door or she is.

482
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:32,559
Emma loves me.

483
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,063
That's what I figured.

484
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:39,366
The antibiotics aren't working,

485
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,868
so your wife is going to die

486
00:25:41,935 --> 00:25:43,703
unless you get in there
and you convince her

487
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,740
that she doesn't need
any of this cosmetic surgery

488
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:48,142
because you are a faithful,
loving husband.

489
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,319
How's the pain?

490
00:26:02,455 --> 00:26:03,757
You know, I think the adrenaline

491
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:05,926
of actually doing this
is helping.

492
00:26:05,992 --> 00:26:07,494
It's the oxycodone.

493
00:26:09,262 --> 00:26:10,630
That's good.

494
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:12,934
I'm glad you came back.

495
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:15,403
I never left.

496
00:26:23,844 --> 00:26:26,414
I don't want to do this
without you.

497
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:28,316
I don't want to do anything
without you.

498
00:26:30,317 --> 00:26:32,419
If you can walk,

499
00:26:32,485 --> 00:26:33,987
you'll be different.

500
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,424
You won't need me anymore.

501
00:26:39,492 --> 00:26:42,692
You think I married you 'cause I was having
trouble hanging clothes in my closet?

502
00:26:44,196 --> 00:26:45,532
You're my girl.

503
00:26:46,634 --> 00:26:48,536
I will always need you.

504
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:51,137
Even if I could fly,

505
00:26:51,204 --> 00:26:54,008
who's gonna remind me to
call my mom on her birthday?

506
00:26:54,075 --> 00:26:55,543
Or to floss?
God, I hate flossing.

507
00:26:58,011 --> 00:27:00,013
Who's gonna remind me
to be a better person?

508
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:05,453
Who's gonna hold my hand
when I'm scared?

509
00:27:14,228 --> 00:27:15,930
That was nice.

510
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:35,049
You have to have the surgery.

511
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:47,828
You were distant before.

512
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:50,798
Since the surgery,
you can't get enough of me.

513
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:54,333
It worked.
You're happy, I'm happy.

514
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:56,303
I love you.
I always have loved you.

515
00:27:56,369 --> 00:27:58,271
- I always will.
- You stopped loving me.

516
00:27:58,338 --> 00:27:59,906
No. Never.

517
00:27:59,973 --> 00:28:02,413
If you were in love with me, you
never would've cheated on me.

518
00:28:03,877 --> 00:28:04,945
Barry,

519
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:10,918
please, no more lies.

520
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:14,555
You were never home.
We never talked.

521
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:17,091
You were never there.

522
00:28:21,962 --> 00:28:23,563
There was never another woman.

523
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:27,300
I was gambling... A lot.

524
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:29,612
I did it because I was ashamed
of the man that I'd become.

525
00:28:29,636 --> 00:28:31,472
When we got married,
I promised you the world,

526
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:33,241
and instead I gave you
a mediocre life.

527
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:39,012
When I was up,
it made me feel like a winner.

528
00:28:41,115 --> 00:28:44,718
And I was too embarrassed to let you see
me like that, so I hid it from you.

529
00:28:55,396 --> 00:28:57,565
She's gonna do the surgery.

530
00:28:57,632 --> 00:28:58,733
Thank you.

531
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:09,209
Andrews needs an O.R.
for Emma Newton.

532
00:29:27,796 --> 00:29:33,468
Claire, you're beautiful, smart,
and very good at your job.

533
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:38,173
Thank you, Shaun. That's a
very sweet thing to say.

534
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,944
Would you ever date someone
with a disability?

535
00:29:43,978 --> 00:29:45,347
Yeah, sure.

536
00:29:48,783 --> 00:29:51,887
You could choose the
ideal mate, Claire.

537
00:29:51,954 --> 00:29:55,057
Why would you want
the unnecessary burden?

538
00:29:55,123 --> 00:29:59,026
Everyone is dealing
with something.

539
00:29:59,093 --> 00:30:03,331
We just have to love
other people for who they are

540
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,167
and hope they love us, too.

541
00:30:10,673 --> 00:30:12,340
O.R. 1's prepped for Hunter.

542
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:18,080
I'll join you in a minute.

543
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:40,670
So, what changed her mind?

544
00:30:41,403 --> 00:30:42,438
Jared did.

545
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,009
Morgan, you're my first assist.

546
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,519
Make the call.

547
00:30:57,586 --> 00:30:59,521
Thanks.

548
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:08,797
This is as far as you can go.

549
00:31:08,863 --> 00:31:10,783
Nurse Matthews will take you
to the waiting room.

550
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:12,200
Okay.

551
00:31:12,266 --> 00:31:14,703
Can I... Can I give him a kiss?

552
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:17,171
Of course.

553
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:30,051
I can't do this.

554
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,387
Yes, you can.

555
00:31:32,954 --> 00:31:35,056
This is what you do
in a relationship, right?

556
00:31:35,122 --> 00:31:37,359
You take chances, together.

557
00:31:42,063 --> 00:31:43,431
Okay.

558
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:03,785
That's a large tissue
defect in the left breast.

559
00:32:03,852 --> 00:32:05,486
If we'd been
in here six hours ago,

560
00:32:05,552 --> 00:32:07,790
I could have salvaged
more underlying muscle tissue.

561
00:32:07,857 --> 00:32:09,391
I'm noticing
her heart rate jump.

562
00:32:09,457 --> 00:32:10,625
You seeing that, JL?

563
00:32:11,926 --> 00:32:13,728
I am now.

564
00:32:13,795 --> 00:32:15,230
How's her surgical sites?

565
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:16,764
I'm not seeing any bleeding.

566
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,976
Morgan, what about your side?

567
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,201
Everything looks good here.

568
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:20,634
Maybe the anesthesia's light?

569
00:32:20,702 --> 00:32:23,372
Nope. No, something's
definitely happening.

570
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:25,440
Jared's right.

571
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:31,746
Suction, Claire.

572
00:32:31,812 --> 00:32:33,982
Give me a 25 on a 130.

573
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:37,920
All right, Murphy, I want you
to cut right under my forceps

574
00:32:37,986 --> 00:32:39,754
very carefully.

575
00:32:43,157 --> 00:32:44,426
Section's cut.

576
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:46,127
How are
the motor evoked potentials?

577
00:32:46,194 --> 00:32:48,554
Signal's coming through,
spinal cord's functioning normally.

578
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:56,071
The mass has fully
encased the medullary cord.

579
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:01,277
Give me the ferromagnetic wand.

580
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,284
I can't get the caudal end
clear of the underlying cord.

581
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,019
Got a big drop in potentials.

582
00:33:10,084 --> 00:33:11,419
We are compressing
his brainstem.

583
00:33:11,486 --> 00:33:12,653
What's his pressure?

584
00:33:12,721 --> 00:33:13,955
Mean arterial pressure's 70.

585
00:33:14,022 --> 00:33:15,357
I got nothing now.

586
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:17,259
Push IV fluids.
Keep that MAP above 90.

587
00:33:17,326 --> 00:33:18,994
Hunter's going
into neurogenic shock.

588
00:33:19,061 --> 00:33:20,427
We need to stop the surgery.

589
00:33:20,494 --> 00:33:21,696
I'm almost there. 20 seconds.

590
00:33:21,763 --> 00:33:23,799
Pressure's 60.
Push vasopressors.

591
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:25,834
The last piece is right there.

592
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:27,936
It's probably edema.
Push 100 of dexamethasone.

593
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:31,440
Still nothing.

594
00:33:31,505 --> 00:33:32,707
He's dying.

595
00:33:32,773 --> 00:33:34,676
It's one
damn centimeter of tissue.

596
00:33:37,646 --> 00:33:38,647
All clear.

597
00:33:40,715 --> 00:33:43,051
That's her second dose of
amiodarone. She's not responding.

598
00:33:43,118 --> 00:33:45,153
She's thrown
her septic embolism.

599
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:46,420
I'm cracking her chest.

600
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:53,495
Ten joules. Clear.

601
00:33:54,795 --> 00:33:56,297
Again.

602
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:57,532
Clear.

603
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:01,802
Starting cardiac massage.

604
00:34:20,054 --> 00:34:21,456
It's time to call it.

605
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,463
Time of death, 10:23.

606
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:43,724
Several
specialists to work with you.

607
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,717
The first will be
a neurophysiatrist...

608
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,719
Thank you. Thank you.

609
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,988
Thank you.
I'm grateful to all of you.

610
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:53,259
Would you mind if we talked
about the rest of this later?

611
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,295
I just want to sit with my wife.

612
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:02,433
Thank you.

613
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:06,271
Hey. Hey. Hey.

614
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,609
I met a couple today
that lost their way.

615
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:48,380
They loved each other,

616
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,193
but by the time they remembered
what really mattered,

617
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,485
it was too late.

618
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,226
I don't want us to be like them.

619
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:05,330
I want to be
fully committed to you.

620
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,268
I love you, too.

621
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,944
There's a surgery I could have
that should make me fertile,

622
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,814
but there's a risk of impotency.

623
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,821
What do you want to do?

624
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,187
I want to give you
what you want,

625
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,523
what we want, a family.

626
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,960
We are a family.

627
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,230
Yes, I want children,

628
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:40,398
and there are many ways
to do that,

629
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:43,099
which we'll explore together.

630
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:46,170
But I draw the line at anything
that risks our sex life.

631
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,808
It's just one night a week,

632
00:36:58,876 --> 00:37:01,678
but I think this could be
my big break, you know?

633
00:37:01,744 --> 00:37:03,264
Well, you always had
a beautiful voice.

634
00:37:04,248 --> 00:37:07,150
Well, everyone's
got one thing, right?

635
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:09,552
But enough about me.
I want to hear about you.

636
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,588
Do you have a man?

637
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:14,291
I did.

638
00:37:14,356 --> 00:37:18,128
Pretty young thing
should have plenty of choices.

639
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:20,075
I'm not looking to
complicate my life right now.

640
00:37:22,197 --> 00:37:25,868
Still looking after
everyone else but yourself,

641
00:37:25,934 --> 00:37:27,670
like you did for me.

642
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:35,144
You know,
I know brag to everyone.

643
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,012
"My baby. She's a surgeon."

644
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,815
Surgical resident.

645
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:39,950
Right, sorry.

646
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,518
You like it?

647
00:37:44,987 --> 00:37:46,889
I love it.

648
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,671
Where are you staying? You're...
Are you in town for a while?

649
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:54,630
Yeah.

650
00:37:54,697 --> 00:37:56,233
I'd like to be closer to you.

651
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,739
I found a place.

652
00:38:04,106 --> 00:38:05,708
You'd like it,

653
00:38:05,775 --> 00:38:09,313
but I just need to put up
first and last.

654
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,016
I'll pay you back.

655
00:38:19,288 --> 00:38:20,690
How much do you need?

656
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,659
$2,500.

657
00:38:22,726 --> 00:38:25,662
Plus I have to get furniture
and, you know, all of that.

658
00:38:25,728 --> 00:38:27,539
I thought maybe you could
help me pick that stuff out.

659
00:38:27,563 --> 00:38:28,841
You've always been
so good at that.

660
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:30,567
I really appreciate it.
I'm good for it.

661
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:04,834
Celeste isn't coming.
She broke up with me.

662
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,269
I hate her.

663
00:39:07,335 --> 00:39:10,639
But I'm not gonna let that
ruin our night.

664
00:39:10,706 --> 00:39:12,007
That's what friends are for.

665
00:39:12,074 --> 00:39:14,610
They got each other's backs,
rain or shine.

666
00:39:14,677 --> 00:39:17,881
By the by, I found a $20
in your battery drawer,

667
00:39:17,947 --> 00:39:19,548
so I got us Chinese food.

668
00:39:19,615 --> 00:39:22,619
- Don't thank me.
- I don't like Chinese food.

669
00:39:22,684 --> 00:39:23,952
Aw, come on now.

670
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:26,722
Trust me, everybody likes
Ma Jong's Kung Pao.

671
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:32,994
There you go.

672
00:39:33,061 --> 00:39:36,164
I'm pretty torn up about that Celeste
thing. She was a real keeper.

673
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:38,134
You said you hated Celeste.

674
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:39,836
I do. I... I hate her 'cause...

675
00:39:39,902 --> 00:39:41,838
I don't know...
I kind of love her.

676
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,607
This tastes terrible.

677
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,376
Okay,
then he hates Chinese food.

678
00:39:47,443 --> 00:39:49,144
More for me.

679
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:50,447
Plain white rice?

680
00:39:53,983 --> 00:39:55,618
I got a gaming console,

681
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,520
and I hooked it up to
your bad boy over there.

682
00:39:57,586 --> 00:39:58,987
We can play some Mortal Kombat.

683
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:02,358
Come on.

684
00:40:07,096 --> 00:40:09,132
We doing this or what?

685
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,835
It sounds fun.

686
00:40:16,905 --> 00:40:18,407
Yeah, there you go.

687
00:40:18,474 --> 00:40:19,843
This one's you.

688
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:24,480
That's you on the left
right there.

689
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,349
- Okay.
- Yeah.

690
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:30,053
You got four arms, but
you're naked, so here we go.

691
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:32,489
I gave you a pneumothorax.

692
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,423
I didn't realize
how bloody this game was.

693
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:36,025
Ooh, a fireball.
I got you there.

694
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,560
Have you played this before?

695
00:40:38,628 --> 00:40:41,864
That looks like
a spinal fracture.

696
00:40:41,931 --> 00:40:44,043
Yeah, I'd say... I'd say
there's a huge fracture there.

697
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,268
You died.

698
00:40:46,594 --> 00:40:49,585

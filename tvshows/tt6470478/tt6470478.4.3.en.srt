1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:03,971
Hello.
I'm Freddie Highmore.

2
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:07,241
The following episode
portrays our hope for the future,

3
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:09,343
a future where no one
will have to wear masks

4
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:12,280
or take other steps to
stay safe from COVID.

5
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:15,283
Until then,
please protect yourself and others.

6
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:19,987
I'm Jordan Allen.

7
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,241
My first year in med school,
I designed an ankle brace

8
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:25,359
that monitors extent of
immobilization via a phone app.

9
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:26,994
When I licensed it to Bioventus,

10
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:29,463
I was able to pay off
over half my student loans.

11
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,466
John Lundberg.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,303
I've worked every summer since I
was 16 at Camp Hope Heartland,

13
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,671
a summer program for kids
with cancer in Des Moines,

14
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:38,805
where I grew up.

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,674
Asher Wolke.

16
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,042
Uh, when I was 18,

17
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:45,879
I left the Hasidic community
that I was raised in.

18
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:47,648
I realized if there
really was a God,

19
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,650
it had to be a cruel being

20
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,052
that I felt nothing
but contempt for.

21
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:55,194
That's also when I
decided to go to med school,

22
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:56,524
and start dating men.

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,398
I'm Olivia Jackson.
I'm 25. From Chicago.

24
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,570
I play ragtime piano
alone in my apartment.

25
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,874
Is that interesting?

26
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,609
Will Hooper.

27
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,146
Technically,
I'm a professional athlete.

28
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,047
Although in a sport
nobody pays attention to,

29
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:22,616
and the stipend barely
covers our training expenses,

30
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,519
but I'm on the US
National Rowing team.

31
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:27,188
Men's Eight.

32
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,525
Hey, I'm Enrique.

33
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,861
I spent last summer
in Costa Rica,

34
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:37,598
where I learned to surf, which I'm
totally obsessed with now.

35
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:42,970
Uh, I had a pretty interesting
encounter with a saltwater crocodile.

36
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,538
I just thought it was a big...

37
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,540
Why are you wearing a swimsuit?

38
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:51,212
Oh,
they're actually hybrid boardshorts.

39
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,914
I like to work hard,

40
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,847
and it's easier to do
when you're comfortable.

41
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:00,621
Plus, I think the casual
dress puts patients at ease.

42
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:06,494
Uh...

43
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,861
And Dr. Lim said that the

44
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:09,862
shorts were fine.

45
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:14,468
Hospital policy
requires all residents to...

46
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,470
He's not a resident.
He's a resident applicant.

47
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,772
One of six finalists
for four openings.

48
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:20,774
Now,
they'll be shadowing for two days.

49
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:22,586
Give them the grand tour,
show them the ropes,

50
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,753
feel free to turn
up the heat a bit.

51
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,088
See how they react
under pressure.

52
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,615
You will be responsible
for supervising them,

53
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,417
so I want your
totally honest input

54
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,918
before I make
any final decisions.

55
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,051
Those shorts...

56
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,687
Let's call them strike one.

57
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,757
Oh,
and in addition to being an Olympian,

58
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,326
Will Hooper is a Rhodes

59
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,794
and graduated top of
his class at Stanford.

60
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,463
He is very handsome.

61
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:43,964
He's very full of himself.

62
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,999
He's ranked first by
every top program,

63
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,569
so whatever you can do
to recruit him to ours, do it.

64
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,504
I can already give you
my input on the sh...

65
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,118
Don't judge a book
by its boardshorts.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

67
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,637
You wanted to see me?

68
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,186
Good morning.

69
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,121
Sorry. Good morning.

70
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:09,790
What'd I do wrong?

71
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:10,958
Just wanted to check in.

72
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,626
See how the new
role was coming along.

73
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,126
Honestly?

74
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,767
You could start our new supervisor-resident
relationship with a lie.

75
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,900
That's always fun.

76
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,638
Internal medicine is

77
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:26,474
boring.

78
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,010
Between smokers
and obese diabetics,

79
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,583
seems like all I'm doing is
protecting people from themselves.

80
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,050
As a surgical resident,

81
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,719
you never treated drunk drivers?

82
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,554
Or extracted random
objects from guys'...

83
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,556
I get it. People are stupid.

84
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,690
Not my point, but true.

85
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,195
Not the same adrenaline rush,

86
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,664
but internal medicine
can be rewarding.

87
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,667
Given time, if you're patient.

88
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:56,303
Thanks.

89
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,547
That is not how I thought
this meeting was gonna go.

90
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,788
I thought one of the nurses
complained about me.

91
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:07,615
Wasn't just one.

92
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,868
And if it happens again, this meeting
will go exactly how you thought it would.

93
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,265
Sorry.

94
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,039
I should've just
canceled the appointment.

95
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,736
You were right.

96
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,179
Dizziness went away
as soon as I stopped

97
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,581
drinking coffee
and Red Bull all day.

98
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,606
No worries.

99
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,184
Can you lie flat on your back,
please?

100
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,208
Yeah.

101
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:38,979
You get that scar in a fire?

102
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,112
Sort of.

103
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,450
A homemade Roman
candle when I was 12.

104
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,184
You'd be surprised

105
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,954
how many of us at the
firehouse were pyros as kids.

106
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,690
I made a potato gun for
my sixth-grade science fair.

107
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,224
Almost got me
kicked out of school.

108
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,839
You'll have to come
visit us sometime.

109
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,366
You'd fit right in.

110
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,065
You see something?

111
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,800
Don't talk. Just
breathe normally.

112
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,161
You have a large tumor
on the wall of your heart.

113
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,379
Cancer?

114
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,847
I don't know.

115
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,649
But you're definitely
gonna need surgery.

116
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,249
As soon as possible.

117
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,576
I appreciate you letting me share
your case with the whole class.

118
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,101
No problem.

119
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,279
I stopped being shy after
the 100th time I had to do this.

120
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:39,407
I'll be using a version of
Lejour's technique I've adapted.

121
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,542
We'll divide the breast
into three pedicles,

122
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,143
and then redistribute the tissue

123
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,545
and insert saline implants

124
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,346
to correct the tuberous
breast deformity.

125
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,216
Why would you
want breast implants?

126
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,989
You're beautiful. And your breasts
look fine just the way they are.

127
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,687
No. No, they don't.

128
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,789
The base is constricted,

129
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,858
horizontal
development is deficient,

130
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,493
and the nipple-areola complex...

131
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:01,695
Murphy. It's okay. He's right.

132
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:02,829
That's why I'm here.

133
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,999
Thank you.

134
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,168
I know that you're
trying to be nice.

135
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,771
My friends and family have
been telling me for years,

136
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,540
"You're beautiful
just the way you are."

137
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,708
But I don't feel beautiful.

138
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,977
You're 17.

139
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,146
Every girl your
age feels like that.

140
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,981
That can't be true.

141
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,383
Tuberous breast
deformity is a rare condition.

142
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:24,985
We're not going to debate

143
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,054
a personal decision the
patient's already made.

144
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:31,525
I've been thinking
about this since I was 13.

145
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,561
Every time I look in the mirror.

146
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,195
I'm about to start college,

147
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,898
and there is no way that I'm
gonna begin this new chapter

148
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,031
until I'm fixed.

149
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:41,702
Great.

150
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,008
You thinking median
sternotomy or right thoracotomy?

151
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,511
I'm thinking I should finish
my review of the imaging.

152
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:51,845
Sure. No rush.

153
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,848
Actually,
there is a bit of a rush.

154
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:57,184
But you know what I mean.

155
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,419
So,
newbies. What up? Where y'all from?

156
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:00,554
Like hometowns, or...

157
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:01,889
Med schools.

158
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:02,756
Why would I care
where you grew up?

159
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,890
Stanford.

160
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,392
Uh, NYU. Harvard.

161
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,526
Preferred specialties?

162
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,361
Ortho. All the way.

163
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:09,597
Neuro.

164
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,131
I'm planning a dual specialty

165
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,833
in neonatal and
pediatric oncology.

166
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,201
Impressive. Also unlikely.

167
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,036
I know, it's a ton of work,

168
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,609
but I'm pretty good
at multi-tasking.

169
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,607
In med school,
I did a combined MD/PhD...

170
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,274
What's your mom do? My mom?

171
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,876
Don't stall. Just answer.

172
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,250
She teaches high-school French.

173
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,213
Homemaker.

174
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,346
Surgeon.

175
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,882
Ouch. Dad?

176
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,016
Also a surgeon.

177
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,451
Double ouch. And yours?

178
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:32,720
Hasidic rabbi.

179
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:33,887
You've left the nest.

180
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,189
Actually,
the... the whole forest.

181
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,158
And yours obviously
works on Wall Street.

182
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,860
But not a trader.

183
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,095
I'm guessing... an M&A lawyer?

184
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,263
How'd you know?

185
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,532
She's read your resume,

186
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:45,933
researched your social media.

187
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,935
She's probably run a credit check,
too.

188
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,388
And you're under 50,
but wear Brooks Brothers button-downs.

189
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,772
Are you done yet?

190
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:53,941
Left thoracotomy

191
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,610
with a possible incision
into the right atrium

192
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,512
and inter-atrial
septum as needed.

193
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,566
Left atrial approach through
Sondergaard's groove

194
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:01,614
makes more sense.

195
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:02,916
Not to me.

196
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:05,786
He's my patient.

197
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,454
But you're not a surgeon.

198
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:09,899
Which is why there is no
reason for you to be grilling them,

199
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,424
or picking the approach.

200
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,326
Stop worrying about
protecting your turf.

201
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,500
Stop stepping all over it.

202
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,730
You're looking at tests
I did for my patient.

203
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,304
How am I stepping
all over your turf?

204
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,668
I think what Dr. Browne
is trying to say is,

205
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,469
given there's no
perfect approach,

206
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:23,637
maybe it's best to defer

207
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,491
to the surgical department's
recommendation.

208
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:27,774
Did he just mansplain?

209
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,053
Not at all. I... I
was just trying...

210
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,357
So you're just
gonna do it again?

211
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:32,512
No, I'm just trying...

212
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:33,646
Shut up.

213
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,242
We're gonna go in
through a left thoracotomy.

214
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,119
Not my preference,

215
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,453
but it'll work.

216
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:43,900
What were you thinking?

217
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,292
You thought you'd impress me

218
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,762
by undermining the patient's
confidence in my judgment?

219
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,363
I'm sorry. That
wasn't my intent.

220
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,165
And you're supposed
to be a mentor now,

221
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,867
modeling professional behavior,

222
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,969
not making it worse, Murphy.

223
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,471
She questioned
your surgical plan.

224
00:08:58,606 --> 00:08:59,740
I defended it.

225
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,041
How can we both be wrong?

226
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,711
I don't need you to defend me.

227
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:07,147
And I never wanna have a
surgical debate in front of a patient.

228
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,982
We're not in front
of the patient now.

229
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,721
The patient's breasts are
small and a bit asymmetrical,

230
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,856
but no woman's breasts
are perfectly shaped.

231
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:20,794
You're wearing Prada shoes
and a Dolce & Gabbana blouse,

232
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,639
which cost more than
most med students' rent,

233
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,497
so, clearly, you understand

234
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:27,234
your appearance has a tremendous
impact on how people treat you.

235
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,570
There's a difference between
nice clothes and a major surgery.

236
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,341
And I also understand the
cosmetic surgery industry

237
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:37,477
is dominated by male
physicians with a sexist bias.

238
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:47,454
I've invited you to observe
as a learning opportunity.

239
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:49,923
So I'd suggest

240
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,158
less lecturing

241
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,425
and more listening.

242
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:57,364
We'll access the
tumor via an incision

243
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,099
in the chest wall
between your ribs.

244
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,367
It'll be an easier recovery

245
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,969
than if we opened your sternum.

246
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,537
Are you sure you don't
want us to call your family

247
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:05,672
before we put you under?

248
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,574
Why? So they can
freak out and worry?

249
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,868
I'd rather just give them
the good news when it's over.

250
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,413
It is going to be good news,
right?

251
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,783
With a bit of cardiac rehab
and a positive attitude,

252
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,384
which I know you have,

253
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,597
you'll be back sliding
down the fire pole in no time.

254
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,188
Our firehouse has stairs.

255
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,422
Hmm. Bummer.

256
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,893
It's a social media group

257
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,306
where we all pretend to be ants.

258
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:29,596
Why?

259
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,266
Because ants don't care about politics,
sports teams,

260
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,402
or anything else people
get so savage about.

261
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:38,438
Male ants develop
from unfertilized eggs,

262
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,608
which means they don't have
a father and can't have sons.

263
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,577
But they do have grandfathers
and can have grandsons.

264
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:45,412
Interesting.

265
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:46,880
And confusing.

266
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:50,283
Is it just me,
or are those doctors watching us?

267
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,820
They're the new
resident applicants.

268
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,555
They're here so Park, Claire,
and I can evaluate them for Dr. Lim.

269
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,264
So,
why are they standing over there?

270
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,729
Park had a video
chat with Kellan,

271
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,731
and I had a real lunch with you.

272
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:08,268
Shaun, you can't just have
them stand there while you eat.

273
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,403
Part of being a good
boss is being a good host.

274
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,105
You need to introduce
them to people.

275
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,109
Like me. Right now.

276
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:19,979
Come here, please.

277
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,852
Dr. Allen, Dr. Lundberg,
Dr. Guerin,

278
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,065
this is my girlfriend, Lea.

279
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,393
She runs the IT department now.

280
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,122
Okay.

281
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,424
Nice to meet you
all. Please join us.

282
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,426
Shaun's been telling
me all about you.

283
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,830
Mmm. N... No. I haven't.

284
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:40,033
So,
I hope Shaun's not being too hard on you.

285
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,169
No, he's been great.

286
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,471
And the case we're
observing is really interesting.

287
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,707
We're correcting a 17-year-old
girl's tuberous breasts

288
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,342
with saline implants.

289
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:52,012
Dr. Allen told Dr. Andrews
it was unethical.

290
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,346
He got mad.

291
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,382
I didn't say it was
unethical. I just...

292
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,019
I suppose I shouldn't
have interfered.

293
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,156
Well,
I don't know what a tuberous breast is,

294
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,058
but I think implants
are way overrated.

295
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,496
That's because your
breasts are excellent.

296
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:10,629
Thank you.

297
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:12,665
That's exactly my point.

298
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,368
Mine aren't huge,

299
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,737
but every guy who's ever
seen them up close and personal

300
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:18,871
has been thrilled.

301
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,775
I definitely was.

302
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,344
I am thrilled by every
part of your body.

303
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:30,017
Sorry. My bad. Total TMI.

304
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,886
I'm not even bothered
by your adenoidal voice.

305
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,055
Except when you talk to
your mom on the phone.

306
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,890
But I just put on headphones.

307
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:45,198
At least you'll know he'll
be a totally honest boss.

308
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,850
The incision's extended superiorly

309
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,408
to meet the atriotomy,

310
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:58,111
and then the inter-atrial
septum is opened up. Retractor.

311
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:01,581
A Carpentier retractor is used
to visualize the mitral valve.

312
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,354
That will allow a
clear view of the tumor.

313
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,784
Can we turn the channel?

314
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,054
Color commentary's
getting a bit annoying.

315
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,065
With the
right atrium opened obliq...

316
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,861
How's Team Browne?
Any early standouts?

317
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,296
Jackson's a bit timid,
but smart.

318
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,798
Wolke is definitely
enthusiastic.

319
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,301
And your star recruit is...

320
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:23,936
pretty full of himself.

321
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,340
I'm looking for surgeons,
and according to his recs,

322
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,809
he can dissect and
suture like a pro.

323
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,345
I thought you were
also looking for our input.

324
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,681
He's ranked first by
every top program.

325
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,854
You really think they're
all wrong and you're right?

326
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,588
So,
what brings you all to the biz?

327
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,924
Had my ACL
reconstructed in high school,

328
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,492
both my rotators in college.

329
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,428
I love the idea
of fixing people,

330
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,330
helping them be
the best they can be.

331
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,934
Surgeons are the ones with the God complex,
right?

332
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:57,803
I have that.

333
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,409
I spent my life speaking
Yiddish and studying the Talmud,

334
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,277
and not shaving
the sides of my hair,

335
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,051
because someone up
there supposedly cares.

336
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,315
Uh, but then I realized

337
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,417
no one's up there.

338
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,088
No one cares.

339
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:18,791
No benevolent higher power
is going to save us, so...

340
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,573
We have to save each other.

341
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,166
Can you top that?

342
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,835
Definitely not. Try anyway.

343
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:32,139
You're obviously smart. You've
got two degrees from Harvard.

344
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,107
My parents are Harvard alums,
so...

345
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,481
I'm sure that helped me get in.

346
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,655
You're not gonna get hired
by undermining your own...

347
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,547
Something went wrong.

348
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,958
Looks like they
nicked a pulmonary artery.

349
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,084
No. If they had,
Browne would be suctioning

350
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,857
instead of Lim reaching
in with her hands.

351
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,263
What are they doing now?

352
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:52,959
Nothing.

353
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,195
We can't access the tumor

354
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,448
without compromising his
entire cardiac outflow tract.

355
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:00,067
What about going in the way I
suggested? The median sternotomy.

356
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,160
The tumor's too far back.
We need to close him up.

357
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,280
Proton beam radiation
would be too toxic to the heart.

358
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,248
So is immunotherapy.

359
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,517
We can't access the
entire tumor surgically,

360
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,520
and we can't kill it without
killing his heart along with it.

361
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,455
What if we cut out the
parts we can access

362
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,725
and try our luck with
chemo on what's left?

363
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:29,129
IV doxorubicin and ifosfamide
might slow the growth,

364
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,663
give him a few more months.

365
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,009
No, I'm not sending my patient
home with just a few extra months.

366
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,067
It's better than nothing.

367
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:35,568
What about a transplant?

368
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:36,736
Not an option.

369
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,972
Heart tumors are
a contraindication.

370
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,541
What if we transplant
his own heart?

371
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,276
If we take it totally
out of his chest,

372
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,112
we'd have access
to the posterior heart.

373
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,285
We could excise the tumor,

374
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,556
fix the defect it left behind,

375
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,948
and then put it back in. Cool.

376
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,517
Mmm. Not cool.

377
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,210
At least with a normal
heart transplant,

378
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,786
you'd be getting
a healthy heart.

379
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,289
Her idea keeps the risk
of removing the heart,

380
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,791
and adds the risk that the
heart we'd be putting back in

381
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,327
has just been
severely compromised

382
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,262
having had a
tumor cut out of it.

383
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:05,355
He's young, and the part of his
heart not infiltrated with tumor is strong.

384
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:12,572
Do a cardiac MRA and see if the
tumor's infiltrated the coronary arteries.

385
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,274
If it hasn't,
Morgan's idea could work.

386
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,408
I'll schedule it.

387
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,157
Dr. Murphy is
dividing the breast parenchyma

388
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,915
into three pedicles.

389
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,118
Anyone know where this
technique is derived from?

390
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:26,419
Breast reduction surgery.

391
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,621
That's right.

392
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,924
And why would I use a
breast reduction technique

393
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,161
to make the patient's
breasts larger?

394
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,614
The technique
frees up the tissue.

395
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,231
You can bring the
pedicles together

396
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,632
to make the breasts smaller

397
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:42,602
or spread them out over an
implant to make them larger.

398
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:45,205
Very good.

399
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,974
And now I'm going
to turn the sound off.

400
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,509
Don't worry. Nothing's wrong.

401
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,122
I just wanna talk about you
behind your backs for a little bit.

402
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,615
So, first impressions.

403
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,350
Murphy?

404
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,119
I like Dr. John Lundberg.

405
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,298
I haven't
even heard him speak yet.

406
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,157
He has the highest
U.S.M.L.E. scores.

407
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,411
And that's important to you?

408
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,493
Yes.

409
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,030
It shows he has a broad
knowledge of medicine.

410
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,867
What is important to you?

411
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,870
Well, I'm more interested in what
they can do with their knowledge,

412
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:21,007
which is why, so far,
I'm most impressed with Jordan Allen.

413
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:25,145
No. No,
you said she undermined you.

414
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:29,382
Which takes courage and an
assertiveness that will serve her well.

415
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:32,685
Then why did you tell
her to stop lecturing you?

416
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:35,288
It's easier to teach an
aggressive resident restraint

417
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,224
than a passive one
to assert themselves.

418
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,358
Oh.

419
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,429
What about you,
Park? What's important to you?

420
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,265
I wanna know who I can stand
to be around for 80 hours a week.

421
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,833
One thing I learned as a cop,

422
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,335
you don't really know a person

423
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,028
until you've had a
few drinks with them.

424
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,621
LAD and circumflex look clean.

425
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,613
What's with the right coronary?

426
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,115
It looks narrowed at the origin.

427
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,650
It's a bit narrow,
but looks like a normal variant.

428
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,154
Yeah, but it seems hazy,

429
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,756
like there could be
some tumor infiltration.

430
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:12,391
What do you guys think?

431
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,060
Us? Yeah.

432
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:15,194
Come take a look.

433
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,466
I guess...

434
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,079
It's angiogenesis
of the left... Stop.

435
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,703
Interrupting a female coworker

436
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,038
is almost as annoying
as mansplaining.

437
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,340
This isn't a rowing race.

438
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:28,914
You don't always
have to speak first.

439
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:34,414
I... do not love
the interruption.

440
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:36,982
But...

441
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,951
I like the enthusiasm.

442
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,087
What were you gonna say?

443
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,558
First, um, I'm not sexist.

444
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,761
Of course not.

445
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:51,298
He's shifting from right
to left dominant circulation

446
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,732
to feed blood to the tumor.

447
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,334
Angiogenesis. I doubt it.

448
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,379
Surgery already showed his tumor
extending to the right side, as well.

449
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:57,404
What were you gonna say?

450
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,758
The pulmonary artery is
right behind that vessel.

451
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,478
It's causing radiographic
scatter in this area.

452
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:06,946
The haze is just an artifact.

453
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:08,747
His arteries are clean.

454
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,484
I think she's right.

455
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:12,885
Hmm.

456
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:16,789
Your idea might just work.

457
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,707
If you invert the
sutures and bury them under the skin,

458
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,599
the scar will be invisible.

459
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,093
No one will ever
know we were here.

460
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:31,737
Nice work, both of you.

461
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,708
Her BP's dropping.

462
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,077
Push fluids,
start IV pressors. Check for bleeding.

463
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,411
She's in
V-tach. Move in the crash cart.

464
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,083
No bleeding. No hematomas.

465
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,192
Charging.

466
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:48,888
Clear.

467
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:59,766
Sinus rhythm. Her
BP is stabilizing.

468
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:06,373
Get her to the ICU. I want post-op labs,
CTA chest,

469
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:07,874
and full 24-hour
cardiac telemetry.

470
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,542
We need to figure out
what just happened.

471
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,353
She's stable,

472
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,021
but diffuse delta wave slowing.

473
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,990
Minimal brain activity.

474
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,793
An undiagnosed metabolic
disorder could've caused

475
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,404
an adverse reaction
to the anesthesia.

476
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,563
Yeah,
but her pre-op labs were all normal.

477
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:33,533
It's gotta be some sort
of hidden heart condition.

478
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,903
You're big on opinions. How are you
with ideas? What would you do next?

479
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:40,840
I'd check train of fours

480
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,810
and reverse the
paralytics with neostigmine.

481
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,878
If Dr. Murphy's right,
she should wake up.

482
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,581
Smart. But risky.

483
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,450
The meds will stress her heart.

484
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,385
If Park's right,
she could arrest again.

485
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:56,556
I saw a similar case
last year. In Borneo.

486
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,491
You interned at a
hospital in Borneo?

487
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,761
Uh, no. I, uh, volunteered at
an orangutan rescue foundation.

488
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,799
Our guide, a local villager,
fell out of a tree.

489
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,234
He was, like, 80 feet up.

490
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:11,103
How is falling out of a tree
similar to a patient arresting

491
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,440
during breast
reconstruction surgery?

492
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,107
Well, he broke his back,

493
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,785
uh,
but when we got him to the hospital,

494
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,821
I found he also had heart
damage from rheumatic fever

495
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:22,415
and metabolic abnormality
from iodine deficiency.

496
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,717
It's rare here,
but it's common there.

497
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,895
We only realized it when we
ran a nuclear profusion scan

498
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:27,919
of his entire body.

499
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,122
Good catch.

500
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:33,426
But a scan that extensive
requires multiple radioactive tracers.

501
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,040
You think her heart
could handle that?

502
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,896
Not tonight.

503
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,131
I'll get consent from the mom.

504
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,785
We'll do it first
thing in the morning.

505
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,235
Once we confirm atrial closure,

506
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,937
we'll put the heart back in.

507
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,806
Dr. Lim will reconnect the aorta

508
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,641
and the superior
venous connections,

509
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,477
while I connect the inferior.

510
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,111
During my sub-internship,

511
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,347
I assisted on multiple
heart transplants.

512
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,881
Even sutured the
atrial cuff in one.

513
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,419
I got to scrub in on a
liver transplant once.

514
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,287
The... The patient died.

515
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,556
What'd you learn?

516
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,258
That bile duct leaks are a lot
harder to detect than bleeds.

517
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:07,736
Good. Next time,
I'd lead with that

518
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,000
instead of the patient's death.

519
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,300
Are you all done yet?

520
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:15,902
Why?

521
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,805
Dr. Park wants everyone
to join him in the break room.

522
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,480
I'm Alex Park.

523
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:30,617
I'm a former amateur
martial arts competitor

524
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,985
who once thought it'd be
fun to spar with a pro boxer

525
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,787
visiting my dad's gym.

526
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:37,156
And that guy was,
uh, Mike Tyson.

527
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,061
Who's Mike Tyson?

528
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,797
He's a guy from The Hangover.

529
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:46,699
With the tiger and
the tattoo on his face.

530
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,470
Nice. You've just revealed
you're crazy and old.

531
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:57,176
I've seen the musical
Wicked over 50 times.

532
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,413
The San Francisco tryout,
Broadway, Chicago.

533
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,815
I've even seen a friend's
boyfriend's niece play Glinda

534
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,016
at Stagedoor summer camp.

535
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,619
Nerd. Next.

536
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,391
I'm Claire Browne.

537
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:15,995
Um, I love music,

538
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:19,466
but I hate musicals,
and, um, I don't...

539
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,134
I don't really like to talk about myself,
so it's Shaun's turn.

540
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,444
My name is Dr. Shaun Murphy.

541
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,245
I used to not like music,

542
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:36,816
but my girlfriend, Lea,
she changed my mind.

543
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:39,852
I also like to watch The
Weather Channel on TV.

544
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,153
And...

545
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,125
I think pickles are disgusting.

546
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,863
Cops know how to manage up.

547
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,198
Managing down's another story.

548
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,400
Well, he's mature, thoughtful,

549
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:55,568
doesn't have an ego.

550
00:23:56,503 --> 00:23:58,237
Neither does Murphy,

551
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,873
but do you think that qualifies
him to supervise First Years?

552
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:03,610
Well, Murphy's smart,

553
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,721
brutally honest,
has no regard for social convention.

554
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:07,013
Mmm.

555
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:08,280
It works for Bill Belichick.

556
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,360
The Patriots are the most corrupt,
dishonest organization

557
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,424
in the history of the NFL.

558
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:15,353
Well, the Seahawks suck.

559
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,791
So,
how's your experience been here?

560
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,193
It's been good.

561
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,799
Did you consider
any other programs

562
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:28,267
or was this your first choice?

563
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,670
This was my only choice.

564
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:33,305
Why do you hate God?

565
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,909
Oh. Uh, actually,

566
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:38,911
I don't believe there is a God.

567
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,081
I thought maybe it was because

568
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,416
you believed he
hated homosexuals.

569
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:46,619
I... I don't
think this is something

570
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:48,193
that we should be
discussing at work.

571
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:52,057
Why not?

572
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,929
Well, because it's personal.

573
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,168
Do you have a boyfriend?

574
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,337
I... I'm sorry, but you can't ask
that question in a workplace.

575
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:09,075
Dr. Park,
he wants us to get to know you.

576
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:13,112
How can I do that without
asking personal questions?

577
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:16,448
I have a girlfriend,
and she is very important to me.

578
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,150
It affects my life in every way.

579
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,429
Probably should've thought
of that before you told her

580
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:22,955
how much her voice annoyed you.

581
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:27,126
I said it didn't bother me.

582
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,995
It... It was a compliment.

583
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:32,298
What I heard is you
criticizing her voice,

584
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:33,966
and you bringing
her mother into it.

585
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,468
You're in trouble.

586
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,678
What about Browne?

587
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:48,147
She may have as much
problem being a leader as Murphy,

588
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,280
and without his gifts.

589
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,550
She has her own gifts.

590
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:54,286
Yeah,
dealing with patients and their families.

591
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,157
But with her colleagues,
she can be insecure.

592
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,202
Her assertiveness has always
been a question mark for me.

593
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,194
They've all got areas
that need improving,

594
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:04,928
but I've gotten to know Browne a
bit better these past few months.

595
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,767
She's stronger than she looks.

596
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:12,615
When's the last time you saw
anyone digging a ditch in a suit and tie?

597
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:14,573
Surgeons don't dig ditches.

598
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:17,944
They help people at the most
vulnerable time in their life.

599
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,847
And you shouldn't
take the responsibility on

600
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,380
if you're not fully
committed to it.

601
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,384
You're entering a new
phase in your career,

602
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:26,753
position of authority.

603
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:28,846
Maybe my clothes are
making you feel disrespected.

604
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:30,156
No.

605
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,791
The truth is,

606
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,026
I just hate wearing anything
that makes me feel like

607
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,061
a suit.

608
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:39,331
Great news.

609
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,585
I was able to get Sowinski
on anesthesia for tomorrow.

610
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,102
Uh, why? What happened to Foley?

611
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,171
Nothing,
I just think Sowinski's better.

612
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:46,915
And we definitely
need the A-team on this.

613
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,374
Yeah, I... I agree.

614
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:51,377
Which is why I went out
of my way to get Foley.

615
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,110
But Foley doesn't do
well under pressure.

616
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:55,848
Remember that time... Morgan.

617
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:58,542
You need to butt out. You're
not a surgeon. This is not your job.

618
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:03,622
My job is to help my patient
through the entire treatment process.

619
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:06,625
The best anesthesiologist for
transplant surgery is Sowinski.

620
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:09,359
And I've already cleared it with Lim,
so that's who it's gonna be.

621
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,696
Deal with it.

622
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,074
Are you mad at me?

623
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:28,748
I said your voice
doesn't bother me.

624
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:32,218
It was a compliment.

625
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:35,454
Actually, what you said is that
you love my breasts so much

626
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,657
that with the help of
noise-canceling headphones,

627
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,860
you're willing to put up
with my annoying voice.

628
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,128
Yes.

629
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,196
Not a compliment.

630
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh.

631
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:49,702
So you are mad at me?

632
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,871
I'm not mad,
Shaun. I'm just busy,

633
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,684
trying to keep, like, a billion bots
and hackers out of our network.

634
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:57,622
Actually,
no. I'm not doing that.

635
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:58,945
Gonna go home.

636
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:01,981
You want to have some tequila,
stat?

637
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:03,983
We also have some pizza left.

638
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:06,518
No,
I don't want tequila or pizza.

639
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:08,687
That must mean you're mad.

640
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:10,957
I'm just... upset.

641
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,760
And confused.

642
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:16,662
And I really don't think there
is anything you can do about it,

643
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:19,598
so you just need to stop
trying and leave me alone.

644
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,110
She's not mad at me.

645
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,945
She's definitely mad at you.

646
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,647
She doesn't usually
hide what she thinks.

647
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:37,149
She's not mad at him.

648
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:41,520
She knows how he is,
how he talks.

649
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,322
She's mad at
herself. And scared.

650
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:47,159
We all have stuff that
we're insecure about.

651
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:48,893
That's why it's so
risky falling in love.

652
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,708
We all hope that when
we let our guard down,

653
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,732
it's for the one person
that doesn't see our flaws.

654
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:02,241
So, what do I do?

655
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:07,013
You were being honest.
You can't apologize that away.

656
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:10,186
You gotta figure out what she needs
to feel secure in the relationship again.

657
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,620
Don't look at me. I'm single.

658
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:23,095
It's not my place to
comment on your personal life.

659
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:24,589
You have an
opinion. Let's hear it.

660
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:26,565
Fine.

661
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,202
Can you zoom in
on her skull base?

662
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:31,637
I can, but why?

663
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,073
We're worried about her heart
and metabolic abnormalities.

664
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:37,709
We shouldn't be. Not anymore.

665
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:40,579
You and Dr. Murphy
were both wrong.

666
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,749
She doesn't have a
cardiac or metabolic issue.

667
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:46,452
She has poor blood flow
in the artery supplying blood

668
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:48,296
to the area of her brain
that controls consciousness.

669
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,390
A small clot in her
artery of Percheron.

670
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:54,593
If we don't remove it fast,
she's never going to wake up.

671
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:08,140
That's amazing.

672
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:10,442
No, it's not.

673
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:13,645
The heart's totally outside
of the body and still beating.

674
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,681
It's like it has a
mind of its own.

675
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,217
She should've started
the reimplantation by now.

676
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,919
Is everything okay, Dr. Lim?

677
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,621
The tumor had tendrils
invading the right atrial wall.

678
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,857
We took so much tissue
to get a clear margin,

679
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:28,160
there's not enough left to
reconstruct his heart's inflow chambers.

680
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:29,828
How about expanded PTFE graft?

681
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:31,907
There's not enough atrial
remnant to attach the graft.

682
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:33,399
You could use the septal wall.

683
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,167
He's got dense
conduction fibers there.

684
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:37,079
It could cause heart
arrhythmias. Not if you use...

685
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:39,263
He's got low arterial pressure.

686
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,383
He's springing leaks
at the cannulation sites.

687
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,318
It's a bleeding disorder
caused by prolonged bypass.

688
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,944
You need to get his
heart back in ASAP.

689
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,646
Morgan, we can't put the heart
back in with two missing chambers.

690
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,299
It's a rare complication,

691
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:59,658
but a blood clot is
a risk in any surgery.

692
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,469
It's too deep in
the brain for open surgery.

693
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,895
If we go rooting
around in there,

694
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:05,831
we'd definitely damage
the PCA and kill her.

695
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:08,334
We could inject a
dissolving agent into the clot.

696
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:12,905
There's a 50% probability
it won't fully dissolve,

697
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,750
which could leave her with permanent
weakness and cognitive difficulties.

698
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:17,376
Assuming she wakes up at all.

699
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:25,117
We need to remove the
clot with a stent retriever.

700
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:29,521
If we rupture the
posterior cerebral artery,

701
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,023
she'll die on the table.

702
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:35,027
Or total recovery.

703
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,530
That's how she
came into this hospital.

704
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:40,232
That's how she's leaving.

705
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:44,403
Prep her for stent retrieval.

706
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,708
I'm hanging platelets
and fresh frozen plasma.

707
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,510
His pressure is
still in the toilet,

708
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,145
but the bleeding
is slowing down.

709
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,513
Not for long.

710
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,983
Small intestine submucosa
has the right compliance

711
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:58,684
to shape the chamber walls,
but...

712
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:00,462
There isn't enough to
cover that much area.

713
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:02,754
Use too little and he'll
have heart failure in a month.

714
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,723
I know. That's the "but."

715
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,016
How thick is his deep fascia?

716
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:06,858
If it's over 2 millimeters...

717
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:07,994
Morgan.

718
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:10,162
Get out.

719
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:11,697
I'm sorry. I'll...
I'll be quiet.

720
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,931
No, you won't. You can't.

721
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,065
So leave the OR gallery.

722
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:17,736
Now.

723
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:27,779
We need 2.6-millimeter-thick
tissue with perfect compliance

724
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:30,282
for arterial filling and
contractile pressures.

725
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:33,552
If it was just the valve,
we'd use a bovine pericardial graft.

726
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:37,389
But cow heart tissue is not durable
enough to do an entire chamber.

727
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,958
But pig bladder
tissue is just right.

728
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:43,229
I've used it for bladder reconstructive
surgeries, but never hearts.

729
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:45,264
Let's rebuild the
entire atrial walls with it.

730
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,775
Get down to the
tissue procurement lab

731
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,759
and get 200 centimeters
of porcine bladder tissue.

732
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,980
Her EEG delta waves
are slowing further.

733
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:04,416
She only has
one vessel feeding her thalamus.

734
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,586
That's why the clot
landed where it did.

735
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,822
I'm approaching the
artery of Percheron.

736
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:12,924
I'm one millimeter
from the clot.

737
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:14,060
Stop right there.

738
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,966
If we disrupt this clot,

739
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,020
we could cause a shower
of emboli into her brain.

740
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:47,792
Deploying the retriever.

741
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,299
EEG just went flatline.

742
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:54,432
Calm down. I'm almost...

743
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:58,103
Got it.

744
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,612
Blood's flowing
through the artery.

745
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,680
Her brain tracing's
looking better.

746
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:19,191
This should fill the gap between
the inferior and superior vena cava

747
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:20,659
when the new
chambers get sewn in.

748
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:23,429
Where's that graft?

749
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,562
I need more sponges. The
bleeding is getting worse.

750
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,209
Oh, he's tanking.

751
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,234
Can you push epi?

752
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,607
I already did. He's maxing out.

753
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,615
I'm running out of ways
to keep his pressure up.

754
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,038
I got it.

755
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,506
They had 205 centimeters of it.

756
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,143
Thank you.

757
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,578
If you want to gown up,
you can watch from down here.

758
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:40,879
Definitely. Thanks.

759
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,751
I thought telling her
how much I love her

760
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:47,844
in front of other people
would make her feel good.

761
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:51,523
But Dr. Guerin said I made
her feel insecure, and scared.

762
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:53,392
Women are sensitive.

763
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,428
When commenting on their flaws,

764
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:59,097
total honesty is a
high-risk procedure.

765
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:00,566
That sounds sexist.

766
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,101
Aren't men also
insecure about their flaws?

767
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,470
Men are much, much worse.

768
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,238
And also, we're really stupid.

769
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:07,372
Okay.

770
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:10,176
What can I do now?

771
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:12,678
I've already said
my stupid stuff.

772
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,546
I don't want her to
be upset with me.

773
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:18,183
I have a thought.

774
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:22,864
I think this run of sutures
will hold it to the annulus,

775
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:24,156
but I'm worried about leaks.

776
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,010
We can put a second
row of pledgeted sutures

777
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,659
to make sure it's hemostatic.

778
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,395
That is unreal.

779
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,062
It's a work of art.

780
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,867
Now let's get it back in

781
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,721
while we can still get
him off bypass alive.

782
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:43,914
Re-perfusing the heart.

783
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:47,551
We've got a rhythm.

784
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,611
Hey.

785
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:22,814
There was a complication

786
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,483
during the
reconstruction surgery.

787
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:28,454
A clot,
which caused you to lapse into a coma.

788
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:32,190
We performed a second
surgery on your brain,

789
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:33,492
which was successful.

790
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,193
Um...

791
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,395
You're gonna be fine.

792
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,230
But my breasts...

793
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:42,133
The clot occurred after we
finished inserting the implants.

794
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:47,791
I think you're gonna be
very pleased with the results.

795
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,141
Thank you.

796
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:51,942
Yep.

797
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,553
I... think I'm sorry.

798
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:10,228
Dr. Guerin said I should never say
anything that might sound negative

799
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:11,897
to a girlfriend.

800
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,734
And Dr. Glassman said total
honesty is a high-risk procedure

801
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,304
with a girlfriend.

802
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:21,172
It's better to show my
love than try to explain it.

803
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:29,448
But I want to be
totally honest with you.

804
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:40,592
I don't like your body
because it's excellent.

805
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,494
I like it because it's yours.

806
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:49,267
And I love hearing you talk.

807
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,702
When I hear your voice,

808
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:54,606
especially when I've
had a difficult day,

809
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,907
I find it comforting.

810
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,715
Now I want to hug you. Can I?

811
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,216
I'd like that.

812
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:18,363
I love you.

813
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:20,998
Thank you.

814
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,202
For your total honesty.

815
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:33,054
Your surgery went well.

816
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:34,245
With some time in rehab,

817
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,860
you should be back
to work in a month.

818
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:37,849
Thank you.

819
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,751
Don't thank me.
Thank your surgeon.

820
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:42,166
She did all the important stuff.

821
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:49,506
Lim's golden boy is in.
Nothing we can do about that.

822
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:51,730
So that leaves three openings.

823
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:54,800
The thought of working with Will
Hooper for the next two years...

824
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,768
If Dr. Lim thinks he'll
be a good resident,

825
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:59,137
I'm sure she has good reasons.

826
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,808
She probably thinks arrogance
is helpful to a surgeon.

827
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:04,610
Well,
we could try to change her mind.

828
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:06,823
Eh, she asked us to evaluate
the applicants, not her.

829
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:09,948
She asked us to
be totally honest.

830
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,050
Eh,
"totally honest" is a relative term

831
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,185
when you're telling your
boss she's totally wrong.

832
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:20,091
So, Hooper's in. Who else?

833
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:23,762
Dr. Andrews likes
Dr. Jordan Allen.

834
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,964
Oh, I do,
too. She's confident, driven.

835
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,933
She won't take a
lot of hand-holding,

836
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,101
and keeping Andrews
happy keeps us happy.

837
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:32,804
That leaves two
more. Who's next?

838
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:38,076
Asher Wolke is very
up-front about who he is.

839
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,812
I like that. He's
definitely eager.

840
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:42,356
And he couldn't be
more open to learning.

841
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,715
Agree.

842
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:44,849
That leaves one more.

843
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:47,686
John Lundberg.

844
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,989
Smart, professional, mature.

845
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,122
He's a no-brainer.

846
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,392
Lundberg's in.

847
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:55,994
Lundberg's out.

848
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,963
He stopped by my
office before he left.

849
00:39:58,096 --> 00:39:59,865
Said he's no longer interested.

850
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:04,002
He said you all
were unprofessional.

851
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,404
Drinking at work.

852
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:08,840
Asking inappropriate questions.

853
00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:10,676
Dating drama.

854
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,212
Mmm-hmm.

855
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,348
So, who's your alt? Olivia
Jackson or Boardshorts?

856
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:21,753
Olivia knows her stuff,
but she's a bit insecure.

857
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:25,190
Her answers
sound like questions.

858
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:27,759
I like Boardshorts.
He's sensitive.

859
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:28,893
Like a woman.

860
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,301
I vote for both of them.

861
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:39,738
That's not an option.
We don't have the budget.

862
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:43,207
Hooper is the worst.

863
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,016
The person I said was the best?

864
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,715
He is arrogant and obnoxious.

865
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:52,050
If he works here,
we'll hate him,

866
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:55,521
the work will suffer,
and we'll either kill patients

867
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:56,654
or we'll kill him.

868
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:06,108
And there is no way that you don't
see that, which makes me think...

869
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,200
You do.

870
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:12,703
This was a test.

871
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:17,609
You just wanted to see
if we'd be totally honest.

872
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:22,047
Well done.

873
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,716
Hooper is definitely the worst.

874
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,218
I only let him shadow as
a favor to a board member.

875
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:28,920
I figured I'd give
him a second chance

876
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:30,254
after his obnoxious interview.

877
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,924
And also do a little experiment.

878
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:37,061
So...

879
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:42,433
It's Jordan, Asher,

880
00:41:42,568 --> 00:41:44,770
Olivia, and Enrique.

881
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,475
To the next phase of
your surgical training.

882
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:52,110
You helped pick them.

883
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,913
As senior residents,
it's now your job to help train them.

884
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,082
And don't take this
responsibility lightly,

885
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:58,655
because if you don't
train them well,

886
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,450
people will die.

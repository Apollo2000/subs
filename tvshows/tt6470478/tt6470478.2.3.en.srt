1
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:13,113
Good morning.

2
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,694
What time is it?

3
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:19,130
6:28.

4
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:22,633
You should be asleep,
but I'm glad you're not.

5
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:28,387
Your post-op pathology and MRI
results are finally in, and...

6
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:30,681
They're good.

7
00:00:31,592 --> 00:00:32,933
Very good.

8
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:37,839
Was the pause for dramatic effect?

9
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:39,064
Yes.

10
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,721
The surgery was a success.

11
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:46,324
The only thing you need now is rest.

12
00:00:46,348 --> 00:00:48,699
And chemo and radiation.

13
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:54,246
Have you been here all night?

14
00:00:55,257 --> 00:00:58,333
I slept in a chair in the lab.

15
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:00,705
Well, you should go home and go to sleep.

16
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:02,807
I can't go home.

17
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:06,377
My next shift starts in 31 minutes.

18
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:11,349
The surgery was a success.

The surgery was a success.

21
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:02,367
All Dr. Glassman needs now is rest.

22
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:03,568
That's great news.

23
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:05,837
And chemo and radiation.

24
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:06,904
How are you?

25
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,639
I don't need rest.

26
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:11,009
I fell asleep in a comfortable chair.

27
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:13,634
Good. Someone screwed
up the on-call schedule

28
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:15,313
and left the ER short-staffed.

29
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:17,412
I need two volunteers to fill in.

30
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:22,387
Good news is you won't have me
breathing down your neck.

31
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:24,655
Bad news is it's a 36-hour shift.

32
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:27,558
This new flex-time policy is ridiculous.

33
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:29,394
Aren't our salaries low enough already?

34
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:31,763
It's not about the money.

35
00:02:31,787 --> 00:02:35,533
Andrews believes that surgeons
need to be at their best

36
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:36,868
even when they're exhausted.

37
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:39,103
The only way for residents
to learn it is to do it.

38
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:40,972
You got to practice like you play.

39
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:43,374
And you can't do either without sleep.

40
00:02:43,398 --> 00:02:45,743
You're free to take it up
with Andrews any time.

41
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,401
Pick a number between one and five.

42
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,403
2.5.

43
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:52,517
- One.
- That's not between...

44
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,949
- Five.
- Three.

45
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:56,454
Aw, damn it.

46
00:02:58,914 --> 00:03:00,725
Good news.

47
00:03:00,749 --> 00:03:04,459
Dr. Melendez won't be
breathing down our necks.

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,498
You're second-year residents.

49
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,667
This is a great opportunity
for you to prove

50
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:12,637
that you don't need a babysitter anymore.

51
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:14,372
And I have a ton of personal crap

52
00:03:14,396 --> 00:03:17,542
I got to take care of today,
so I'm on call,

53
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:20,778
but don't call me
unless you absolutely need to,

54
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:22,713
but you better not need to.

55
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:25,083
You've got a M.I. in one
and compound femur in two.

56
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:26,250
I'm gonna kill that bastard!

57
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,552
He's dead!

58
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:30,955
And a bleeding, angry drunk guy in five.

59
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,680
Get your hands off of me!

60
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:35,116
What the hell are you looking at?!

00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:49,271
Excising the endometrial lesions

63
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,241
should only take about an hour.

64
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:52,910
We'll be operating through a single
incision in your belly button.

65
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:55,246
You won't even be able to see the scar.

66
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,381
How can you operate
through such a small opening?

67
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:59,283
It's a new technique using a single port

68
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:01,853
divided into sections for
the camera and our tools.

69
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:03,536
- New?
- To them.

70
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,123
Don't worry. It isn't to me.

71
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:08,356
I'm confident that this will resolve
your pain and infertility issues.

72
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,693
Thank you, all of you.

73
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:16,000
Being a mother is all I've ever wanted.

74
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:17,268
On our first date,

75
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:20,037
she told me the baby's name
she'd picked out.

76
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:21,272
We were 17.

77
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:23,508
So let's hear 'em.

78
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:27,645
Jackson for a boy and Cameron for a girl.

79
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,704
Very nice. I like them.

80
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,349
So do I.

81
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:35,842
And you are going to be
an amazing mother very soon.

82
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:39,524
Let's get her prepped.

83
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,663
I thought it was just because
she was so pretty and, uh,

84
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:47,899
it had been a while,

85
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:52,442
but after she left, it stayed.

86
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:55,673
You think she roofied me with Viagra?

87
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:57,441
Sure. That could have happened.

88
00:04:57,465 --> 00:05:00,645
Or maybe it was the alcohol, marijuana,
and Molly you pre-gamed with.

89
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:03,714
A lot of different drugs
can cause priapism.

90
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:06,050
Especially those cooked up in a garage.

91
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:07,652
Is it okay if I touch it?

92
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:09,009
Uh, okay.

93
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:15,059
Rigid corpora cavernosa
and flaccid glands.

94
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,395
What's that mean? What's she getting?

95
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:18,930
It's been over four hours.

96
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:21,487
You don't want necrosis to set in.

97
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:24,811
N-Necrosis? Are you saying that my...
My penis could die?

98
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:28,539
It could, but it won't because
we're going to move fast.

99
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:30,241
What the hell are you
going to do with that?

100
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:33,044
We need to remove the deoxygenated
blood to restore circulation.

101
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:35,546
You're going to feel a small
pinch and then some pressure.

102
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,847
Is she lying?

103
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:38,038
I'm not sure.

104
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,919
Holy mother of God, that hurts!

105
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:43,354
Wow!

106
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:52,730
I go out for a short walk so I
can have one moment of peace,

107
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:54,546
and this is what I come home to.

108
00:05:55,557 --> 00:05:56,834
What's the problem?

109
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,869
His mouth was obviously
big enough to get it in.

110
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:01,138
He must have strained his masseter.

111
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:04,208
It's gone into spasm and caused lockjaw.

112
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:06,477
So give him a sedative
and pry it open with a McIvor.

113
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:08,512
I tried. It won't budge.

114
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,621
And he said it hurt like a son of a...

115
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:11,649
Inez.

116
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:13,160
That's what he said.

117
00:06:13,184 --> 00:06:16,087
I put in a bite block,
but I don't know...

118
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:17,278
Call Lim.

119
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,629
We're supposed to be proving
our independence.

120
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:26,931
I will try again with the McIvor.

121
00:06:26,955 --> 00:06:29,166
You don't want to tear the masseter.

122
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,502
If the bite block slips and he gags,

123
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:34,739
he will have broken glass
and vomit in his lungs.

124
00:06:34,763 --> 00:06:37,241
I could put him under.

125
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:40,244
Then I can dislocate his jaw
if I have to.

126
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,417
We definitely can't do that
without calling Lim.

127
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:44,238
That's true.

128
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:51,122
I hope we don't interrupt
anything important.

129
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:53,658
Don't worry. She's either
sleeping or doing laundry.

130
00:06:53,682 --> 00:06:55,899
There's nothing interesting
going on in her life.

131
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:57,561
Not guilty.

132
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,897
Do you have something
against traffic school, ma'am?

133
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:02,500
Your Honor, the defendant's not
eligible for traffic school.

134
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:05,770
This is her third moving
violation in the last year.

135
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:07,772
Alleged violation, thank you very much.

136
00:07:07,796 --> 00:07:11,709
Traveling 100 miles per hour on a
motorcycle? Do you have a death wish?

137
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:13,611
I wasn't going anywhere near 100.

138
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:15,479
So how fast were you going?

139
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:16,981
Excellent question.

140
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:19,000
And one I assure you the
officer who issued my ticket

141
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:20,220
will not be able to answer.

142
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:21,952
California State Vehicle Code mandates

143
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:24,612
that all LIDAR speed-measurement
devices be calibrated...

144
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:26,358
...at least once a...

145
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:27,728
Sorry, I need to get this.

146
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:29,694
No, you need to turn it off.

147
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:32,029
Your Honor, I'm a trauma surgeon at St.
Bonaventure,

148
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:34,098
and I'm on call, so...

149
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:35,666
Five minutes.

150
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,035
The court is adjourned
for a five-minute recess.

151
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:39,437
<i>I thought I was clear.</i>

152
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:41,739
I'm available to help with stuff
you can't do on your own.

153
00:07:41,763 --> 00:07:44,439
Uncle Fester Jr. does not qualify.

154
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:48,952
I think the situation warrants
putting him under a general an...

155
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:51,682
And dislocating his jaw?
He's not a damn snake.

156
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:53,357
So, what should we do?

157
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:55,375
Prove to me you're as capable
as I think you are.

158
00:07:55,844 --> 00:07:57,570
<i>It doesn't make any sense.</i>

159
00:07:57,595 --> 00:08:00,106
We are the only hospital
on the West Coast

160
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,409
that hasn't adopted the ACGME mandate

161
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,911
on a 24-hour max shift length.

00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:07,447
And numerous studies have
shown the negative effects

163
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:09,816
that sleep deprivation has
on critical thinking,

164
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,751
which can cause residents
to make mistakes

165
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,353
that not only harm patients,
but that waste money.

166
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:18,191
You've done your homework.

167
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:20,894
Um, it's something I've been
thinking about for a long time.

168
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,029
I actually did a paper on it
at med school.

169
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:26,900
Well, Dr. Browne,
I've also thought about it.

170
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:30,003
In fact, when the new ACGME
guidelines were released,

171
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:33,106
I joined a nationwide study
analyzing a flextime schedule.

172
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,876
It found that as long as a weekly
max of 80 hours is adhered to,

173
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,813
patient outcomes and resident
satisfaction scores are better

174
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:42,549
than at hospitals with a daily max.

175
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:44,751
So we're just going to
have to agree to disagree

176
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,887
about whether my foolish
new policies "make any sense."

177
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:49,122
No, I didn't say...

178
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:50,847
And I know I told you
to be more assertive.

179
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:54,494
But you also need to make sure
that you don't forsake

180
00:08:54,518 --> 00:08:57,553
your normally excellent
judgment in that effort.

181
00:09:05,663 --> 00:09:07,273
- Whether...
- Excuse me. Yeah, hi, I'm sorry.

182
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,175
- I'm back.
- How wonderful.

183
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:11,177
Take a seat until your case is called.

184
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:12,479
Oh, my case was called.

185
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:14,514
You said I could have
a five-minute break.

186
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:16,282
The court took a five-minute break.

187
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,508
Yours is going to be considerably longer.

188
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:23,746
Continue.

189
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:27,794
Make a stab incision with an 11 blade,

190
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,185
and I'll insert the Veress.

191
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:34,942
He'll get over it. Don't worry.

192
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:37,852
Andrews just likes to hammer
a nail every now and then.

193
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,631
I didn't call him a fool. I just
said his policy didn't make sense.

194
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:45,478
Insufflation's complete.

195
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,869
Ready for the multi-port.

196
00:09:49,907 --> 00:09:51,818
You said it didn't make sense,

197
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,069
and he explained that
in his opinion it did.

198
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,163
What's the problem?

199
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:57,736
The problem is men who tell
women to be assertive,

200
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,727
then as soon as we are,
they criticize us for it.

201
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:02,529
We're the bitch.

202
00:10:02,553 --> 00:10:04,698
You didn't call him a fool.
He didn't call you a bitch.

203
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:05,955
Not to her face.

204
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:10,904
He just suggested she
choose her words more carefully.

205
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:14,407
So, women have to be assertive
but careful?

206
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:17,043
When you're talking to your
boss, yes. Everyone does.

207
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,502
If you're all done
debating, this boss could use some help.

208
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:26,081
You see that?

209
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:29,522
There are lesions on her ovary.

210
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,558
That wasn't visible on the imaging.

211
00:10:31,582 --> 00:10:32,889
It's small.

212
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:35,251
We can excise it without
damaging the ovary, but...

213
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:37,287
There are others.

214
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:41,034
Her bowel, bladder, uterus.

215
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,859
No wonder she's been in so much pain.

216
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,948
We'll start with the Fallopian lesions

217
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,688
just go one by.

218
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:53,992
Browne, I need you to scrub
out and brief the husband.

219
00:10:53,993 --> 00:10:57,172
Explain the endometriosis is way
more severe than we thought.

220
00:10:57,196 --> 00:10:58,940
Why me? Why not Park?

221
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:00,909
Because I think you're better at
talking to anxious relatives.

222
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,644
Is there a problem?

223
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:04,079
No.

224
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:16,514
Retract that tissue.

225
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,494
Why is she so on edge today?

226
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:21,296
No idea.

227
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,687
Just one of those days.

228
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,037
I didn't mean one of "those" days.

229
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:30,605
I just meant, people wake up

230
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:32,974
on the wrong side of the bed sometimes.

231
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:35,877
Dr. Browne explained exactly
why she was "on edge."

232
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,446
Did you forget already,

233
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,771
or were you just not listening
to begin with?

234
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,226
Excuse me?

235
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:50,225
We should cut back on the conversation
and focus on the procedure.

236
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:51,316
I agree.

237
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,464
I want to see her.

238
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:57,532
I'm sorry. You can't go into the OR.

239
00:11:57,556 --> 00:11:59,401
I'll just... I'll just look
through the window, please.

240
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:01,069
Daniel, trust me.

241
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:03,205
Seeing your beautiful wife
on the operating table

242
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:05,029
is not gonna make you less anxious.

243
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:13,081
Hey. Everything is under control.

244
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:14,750
The only thing that's changed

245
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:16,207
is how long the surgery's gonna take.

246
00:12:20,913 --> 00:12:23,191
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

247
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:25,093
I... I... I don't mean to be a pain.

248
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:27,028
You're not a pain. You're just scared.

249
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:28,286
I would be, too.

250
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:31,733
She's getting the best care possible,

251
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:34,779
and as soon as we're done,
we'll bring you to her.

252
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:36,694
Thank you.

253
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:38,229
Okay.

254
00:12:39,965 --> 00:12:41,566
Y-You're... You're good at this.

255
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:52,754
<i>Dr. Monteo to pre-op.</i>

256
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:55,891
<i>Dr. Monteo to pre-op.</i>

257
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:57,492
Shouldn't you be in the ER?

258
00:12:57,516 --> 00:12:59,428
Lea keeps calling me.

259
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:04,099
She wants to talk about why I
told her to go back to Hershey.

260
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:06,234
You told Lea to go back to Hershey?

261
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:09,871
I thought it would solve
the problem, but no.

262
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:12,240
No. It just made it worse.

263
00:13:12,264 --> 00:13:14,209
Now she wants to talk about it more,

264
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,111
but there's no more to be said.

265
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:19,748
That's not the way it works, Shaun.

266
00:13:19,772 --> 00:13:22,651
It can't just be one person
who does the talking.

267
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:24,252
You have to listen, too.

268
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:25,554
I don't want to listen to her.

269
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:27,122
It's too... hard.

270
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:28,824
It's too hard.

271
00:13:28,848 --> 00:13:30,926
Well, relationships aren't always easy.

272
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,661
They get complicated, messy.

273
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:33,862
Exactly.

274
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:36,054
That's why I don't want one.

275
00:13:37,256 --> 00:13:39,267
Well, that's not true.

276
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,404
The reason that you left
the ER to come talk to me

277
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:44,039
is because we have a relationship.

278
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,563
And we both benefit from it.

279
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:49,578
Lea's your friend.

280
00:13:49,602 --> 00:13:52,380
You can't just wall
yourself off from people

281
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:54,172
in the hope that you'll never get hurt.

282
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:02,213
We need to wall it off
so he doesn't get hurt.

283
00:14:10,222 --> 00:14:11,566
Stay calm, buddy.

284
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,858
Just relax your throat
and breathe through your nose.

285
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:17,295
Clamp.

286
00:14:36,782 --> 00:14:38,760
Got it. Cool!

287
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:41,396
Now bite down.

288
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,865
This is a surgical pouch.

289
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:46,034
It can't even be cut by a scalpel.

290
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:47,936
Come on, you can do it.

291
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,871
On the count of three.

292
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:51,273
One...

293
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:53,308
Two...

294
00:14:53,332 --> 00:14:54,776
Three.

295
00:14:56,168 --> 00:14:59,781
Inez! What? He was being a total wuss.

296
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:01,439
<i>Callate la boca!</i>

297
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,978
That was... amazing.

298
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:13,962
You want to create
a plane between the outer serosa

299
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:16,732
and muscularis layer
to avoid disrupting the lumen.

300
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:19,801
Everything go okay with the husband?

301
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:22,804
Yes. And, uh, I apologize.

302
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:24,706
I shouldn't have questioned
your decision.

303
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,141
It's all good.

304
00:15:26,165 --> 00:15:29,578
Two Fallopian lesions down,
and one more to go.

305
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:31,012
You want to take the wheel
on the next one?

306
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:32,347
Sure.

307
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:33,882
Figures.

308
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:35,850
Nurse Flores, do you have a problem

309
00:15:35,874 --> 00:15:37,629
with Dr. Browne taking the lead?

310
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:40,088
No. I just find it interesting

311
00:15:40,112 --> 00:15:44,218
that you only gave her the
opportunity after she apologized.

312
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:47,010
You can scrub out.

313
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:54,160
No. I'll stay.

314
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:56,171
I'm not asking. I'm ordering. Scrub out.

315
00:15:56,195 --> 00:15:57,639
No. I've done nothing wrong.

316
00:15:57,663 --> 00:16:00,241
You're undermining my
management of this procedure.

317
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:02,155
By answering a question you asked me?

318
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:04,697
By making snide comments
questioning my judgment.

319
00:16:06,338 --> 00:16:08,350
I'm not leaving my post,

320
00:16:08,374 --> 00:16:11,329
so why don't we just get back to work?

321
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:20,962
You, me, and Andrews will be
discussing this later.

322
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:22,887
I look forward to it.

323
00:16:45,644 --> 00:16:47,406
Gonna need more saline now!

324
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:57,488
Hi, Daddy.

325
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:13,975
Have you eaten?

326
00:17:14,606 --> 00:17:16,518
N-Not yet.

327
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:19,688
I'll get lunch after I finish this.

328
00:17:19,712 --> 00:17:22,123
Lunch? It's almost 5:00.

329
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:23,591
Then dinner.

330
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:25,593
Look, I'll go now. I'm starving.

331
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:26,695
I'll be back in 30.

332
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:29,198
Hey, your erection's back.

333
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:35,870
She's not talking about me.

334
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:39,841
30-day suspended
sentence and a $700 fine.

335
00:17:39,865 --> 00:17:42,811
Take all these documents to Room 306.

336
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:44,746
Mr. Alex Leon.

337
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,885
No way, Your Honor. I've
been waiting patiently.

338
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:49,168
We'll get to you.

339
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:51,720
When? At 4:59 so you can
tell me you've run out of time

340
00:17:51,744 --> 00:17:53,421
and make me come back
to do this all over again?

341
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:55,966
Well, I guess we'll just have
to see about that, won't we?

342
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,827
No, we won't. Take a seat, kid.

343
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:02,330
Your Honor, I am so sorry
that my two-minute phone call

344
00:18:02,354 --> 00:18:04,531
was such an incredible inconvenience,

345
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:07,839
but I went out of my way to be
here today to have my case heard.

346
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:09,875
And that is exactly what I'm gonna do.

347
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:11,240
Now.

348
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,932
Can I have Dr. Lim's file, please?

349
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,821
Thank you.

350
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:23,222
And I promise this
won't take long because,

351
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:24,721
as I started to explain...

352
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:26,181
Guilty.

353
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,762
$1,500 fine and license
suspension for one year.

354
00:18:29,786 --> 00:18:32,364
The bailiff will have some paperwork
for you to sign on the way out.

355
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:33,599
You can't do that.

356
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:35,835
I have a thick book in my
office that says I can.

357
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:38,037
No. This is America.

358
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:41,185
I pay taxes, which pay
your salary, by the way.

359
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:42,875
- I wouldn't go there.
- Oh, I am definitely going there.

360
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:45,077
I strongly advise
you don't say another word.

361
00:18:45,101 --> 00:18:47,346
You can appeal this verdict
to a different judge.

362
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,781
I don't want a different judge.

363
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:51,322
I want this one to do her damn job!

364
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,494
We keep the TP up front.

365
00:19:01,518 --> 00:19:02,885
Just give a yell if you need some.

366
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:13,422
Is it gonna die?

367
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:15,213
Just relax. Everything's under control.

368
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:19,027
That's not a "no."

369
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:21,602
We're gonna review your lab
results and we'll be right back.

370
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,204
Excuse me.

371
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:31,072
We've already reviewed his labs.

372
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:33,708
There's no sign of a
malignancy, sickle cell,

373
00:19:33,732 --> 00:19:34,910
lymphoma, or leukemia.

374
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:36,511
I know. I just need a minute to think.

375
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:38,447
- I think we should...
- No.

376
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:39,848
We're not calling Lim.

377
00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:41,283
We got our asses chewed out last time,

378
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:42,874
and this is not life and death.

379
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:46,555
We can inject diluted phenylephrine

380
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:47,989
every five minutes for an hour.

381
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:50,725
That's a lot of injections in his penis.

382
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:52,217
I'll give him a lidocaine local.

383
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:55,363
Fine. A dorsal nerve block.

384
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:56,832
You guys are such wimps.

385
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:59,668
That much phenylephrine could
also cause a hypertensive crisis.

386
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:01,893
Okay, Dr. No, what's your idea, then?

387
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:05,521
You already rejected it.

388
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:09,701
We are not calling Lim.

389
00:20:18,777 --> 00:20:20,161
Are you awake?

390
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:23,702
Yes.

391
00:20:23,726 --> 00:20:27,496
If a patient has reoccurring
low-flow priapism

392
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,930
but there's no sign of sickle cell,

393
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:30,599
blood dyscrasia, or Hodgkins...

394
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:33,134
Why are you asking me?
I'm a neurosurgeon.

395
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:35,937
My work is up here, not down there.

396
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:38,273
Because Morgan won't let me ask...

397
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:40,609
Dr. Glassman, why do you insist

398
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:42,410
on ignoring Dr. Ko's medical advice?

399
00:20:42,434 --> 00:20:43,712
I'm not.

400
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:46,481
Really? She advised you to
do consults from your ICU bed?

401
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:48,416
I didn't ask him to come in here.

402
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,607
Go to sleep.

403
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:52,087
What do you think I've been trying
to do for the last 14 hours and...

404
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:53,154
What time is it?

405
00:20:53,178 --> 00:20:54,956
8:17.

406
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,758
...47 minutes?

407
00:20:56,782 --> 00:21:01,630
I would like some more morphine,
please, and an Ambien.

408
00:21:01,654 --> 00:21:03,465
You know you can't have either.

409
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:06,301
Well, then how the hell
am I supposed to fall asleep?

410
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:08,270
Every time I turn, I strangle myself.

411
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:12,143
You nurses come in here every 30
minutes to steal my bodily fluids!

412
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:14,042
Have you tried easing yourself
onto your side

413
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,377
and putting a pillow between your legs?

414
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:17,112
Of course, that's the problem.

415
00:21:17,136 --> 00:21:19,103
I don't know how to use a pillow.

416
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:20,487
Try it.

417
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:22,271
And I will turn the light
all the way off,

418
00:21:22,295 --> 00:21:24,683
and Dr. Murphy will leave you alone.

419
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,980
Winter's procedure.

420
00:21:30,883 --> 00:21:34,902
It's not the solution, but it'll buy you
enough time to maybe find another one.

421
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,839
Thank you.

422
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:39,131
You're welcome.

423
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,160
Good night, Dr. Glassman.

424
00:22:08,053 --> 00:22:11,099
Seems like for every lesion
we excise, we find two more.

425
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:12,434
What time is it?

426
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,935
1:12 in the morning.

427
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,837
And my bladder is about to burst.

428
00:22:15,861 --> 00:22:17,439
After I finish this one,
I'm gonna take a break.

429
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:19,774
While I'm out, Park, you take over.

430
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,643
Start on the lesions
I showed you on the bladder,

431
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:24,312
but be careful...

432
00:22:24,336 --> 00:22:25,503
Her pressure's dropping.

433
00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:30,986
She's bleeding out. I can't see anything.
We're taking out the scope.

434
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,954
We're gonna have to open her up.

435
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:35,256
I've got two units on the rapid infuser.

436
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,225
MAP is still hovering at 60.

437
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:38,627
Moving as fast as I can.

438
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:40,462
Paint her with Chlorhexidine
and don't make it a Picasso.

439
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:41,963
- It's a crash lap.
- On it.

440
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,121
Knife.

441
00:22:54,662 --> 00:22:56,773
Uh, the bleeding's under control.

442
00:22:56,797 --> 00:22:57,841
What about her bladder?

443
00:22:57,865 --> 00:22:59,566
There's infiltrating lesions all over it.

444
00:23:01,302 --> 00:23:02,569
Even the walls are involved.

445
00:23:05,873 --> 00:23:08,162
We're gonna have to remove it.

446
00:23:09,877 --> 00:23:11,955
And give her a urostomy bag?

447
00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:13,423
There has to be another option.

448
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:15,982
If I had another option, Nurse
Flores, I would've suggested it.

449
00:23:26,694 --> 00:23:31,575
What if we excise part of her
bowel, reconstruct a bladder?

450
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,043
That's a lot more dangerous than...

451
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:35,212
Making a 28-year-old woman
urinate through a hole

452
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:36,713
in her abdomen for the rest of her life?

453
00:23:36,737 --> 00:23:38,415
I think the additional risk is worth it.

454
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:39,739
See if the husband agrees.

455
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:44,054
- Okay. I'll go.
- No, Park will.

456
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:46,523
And while he does, I want
everyone but J.L., Dr. Browne,

457
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:47,991
and Nurse Flores to clear the OR.

458
00:23:48,015 --> 00:23:49,081
You, monitor the patient.

459
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:50,417
You two, we need to have a talk.

460
00:23:56,323 --> 00:23:58,802
Do I have a choice?

461
00:23:58,826 --> 00:24:02,005
Do you want to keep
a fully functioning penis?

462
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:05,041
- Of course...
- Then no.

463
00:24:05,065 --> 00:24:08,378
That's even...
Bigger than it was last time.

464
00:24:08,402 --> 00:24:12,349
Winter's procedure requires
an extra-large-gauge needle

465
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:15,886
to poke a hole big enough
to restore blood flow.

466
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,355
We'll give you a lidocaine nerve block.
You won't feel a thing.

467
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:20,590
W-Why wasn't I given that last time?

468
00:24:20,614 --> 00:24:22,292
The risk wasn't worth it before.

469
00:24:22,316 --> 00:24:24,988
Uh, trust me,
it was worth it before, too.

470
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:28,031
Good choice. We'll be right back.

471
00:24:28,055 --> 00:24:31,835
W... You said that we needed
to do this right now!

472
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:35,249
We do. I just need to confer
with my colleague for a moment.

473
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:42,145
You're talking to Lim behind my back?

474
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:43,380
No.

475
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:45,682
Don't lie. You're not good at it.

476
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:47,517
I saw you delete her text.

477
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:49,553
I knew Glassman didn't give
you the Winter's idea.

478
00:24:49,577 --> 00:24:52,622
The text wasn't from Dr.
Lim. It was from Lea.

479
00:24:52,646 --> 00:24:55,592
If it was from Lea, then
why'd you delete it so fast?

480
00:24:55,616 --> 00:24:59,896
Claire thinks I shouldn't
push a good friend away,

481
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,242
but thinking about her...

482
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:05,487
I don't want to talk to her.

483
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:11,141
You shouldn't listen to them.

484
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:12,832
Either of them.

485
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:16,079
Lea and Claire are nice to you.

486
00:25:16,103 --> 00:25:20,984
But... they're not your friends.

487
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:24,688
They want to take care of you,
like a cute pet.

488
00:25:24,712 --> 00:25:28,047
They take you seriously
as a doctor but not as a man.

489
00:25:32,953 --> 00:25:35,098
Lea kissed me.

490
00:25:35,122 --> 00:25:37,423
After we sang karaoke.

491
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:40,760
Shaun, it was a pity kiss.

492
00:25:42,663 --> 00:25:45,108
You've never even met Lea.

493
00:25:45,132 --> 00:25:46,366
True.

494
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,445
But I know that she's not
in middle school,

495
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:51,114
which means if she really
thought of you as a man,

496
00:25:51,138 --> 00:25:53,911
she wouldn't have settled
for just one innocent peck.

497
00:26:05,452 --> 00:26:06,886
I just...

498
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:15,695
What're you looking at?

499
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,204
Hey, Shaun.

500
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:44,334
What's going on? I thought I couldn't
be released until I was arraigned.

501
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:47,070
The judge decided nine hours
was enough punishment.

502
00:26:47,094 --> 00:26:49,606
She's the one who should be punished.
I should sue her.

503
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,678
What you should do is learn
to keep your mouth shut.

504
00:26:55,756 --> 00:26:57,457
You're lucky I'm hungry.

505
00:26:58,973 --> 00:27:00,750
This stops now.

506
00:27:00,774 --> 00:27:02,686
We need to work together.

507
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,154
We are.

508
00:27:04,178 --> 00:27:06,056
That's how we came up with the
idea to rebuild her bladder.

509
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,525
There's a way to offer your input
without undermining my authority.

510
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:10,427
The only thing that undermines
your authority

511
00:27:10,451 --> 00:27:12,829
is your comments about
Dr. Browne's supposed PMS.

512
00:27:12,853 --> 00:27:15,398
- What?
- I never said you had PMS.

513
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:16,900
I just asked Park if he knew

514
00:27:16,924 --> 00:27:18,203
why you were more irritable than usual.

515
00:27:18,227 --> 00:27:20,370
I'm not irritable, and I'm not a whiner!

516
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:21,525
I never said you were...

517
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:23,707
You told me to take it up with
Andrews. This was your idea.

518
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:25,041
If anyone's a whiner, it's you.

519
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:26,710
That's enough.

520
00:27:26,734 --> 00:27:28,545
You're 12 hours into an operation

521
00:27:28,569 --> 00:27:30,580
you thought was gonna take one,
so I think it's safe to say

522
00:27:30,604 --> 00:27:32,048
you're all more irritable than usual.

523
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:33,969
But you need to get a grip.

524
00:27:34,742 --> 00:27:36,586
Dr. Melendez, maybe it's time
you took a little break.

525
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,622
Get an energy bar and some juice.

526
00:27:38,646 --> 00:27:39,723
I don't need a...

527
00:27:39,747 --> 00:27:40,780
Do it anyway.

528
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,897
And when he gets back,
I expect everyone in this OR

529
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:50,610
to conduct themselves with
the utmost professionalism.

530
00:27:52,793 --> 00:27:54,571
Can I get two brisket tacos, please?

531
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:55,828
You know what? Actually, make it three.

532
00:27:57,431 --> 00:27:59,175
Thank you.

533
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,710
You're out of order!

534
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:02,379
Hmm.

535
00:28:02,403 --> 00:28:03,513
She's out of order!

536
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:07,651
This whole traffic court
hearing is out of order!

537
00:28:07,675 --> 00:28:09,686
Okay, very funny, smart-ass.

538
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,855
Actually, I gotta give you props.

539
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:13,723
You were right
about the LIDAR calibration.

540
00:28:13,747 --> 00:28:17,594
Hmm. If your phone hadn't rung,
you might've gotten off.

541
00:28:19,153 --> 00:28:20,964
Next time, I will turn my phone off.

542
00:28:20,988 --> 00:28:23,066
Next time? You're done.

543
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,768
Case closed.

544
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:26,236
You're gonna start having to work on

545
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,871
upping your rideshare rating.

546
00:28:27,895 --> 00:28:29,072
I'm obviously gonna appeal.

547
00:28:29,096 --> 00:28:31,541
She was biased against me from the start.

548
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:34,279
I see it all the time... Women
in power are worse than men.

549
00:28:35,069 --> 00:28:36,413
No comment.

550
00:28:36,437 --> 00:28:38,492
Order up. Brisket tacos.

551
00:28:41,575 --> 00:28:42,742
Thanks.

552
00:28:44,745 --> 00:28:46,723
Oh, thank you.

553
00:28:46,747 --> 00:28:48,058
Want one?

554
00:28:48,082 --> 00:28:49,526
I would love a beer. But I can't.

555
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,862
I'm on call for the next 17 hours.

556
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:54,397
You're still on call?

557
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,901
What would you have done if they
needed you while you were locked up?

558
00:28:57,925 --> 00:29:00,103
I would've had them phone
my secondary coverage.

559
00:29:00,127 --> 00:29:02,405
I didn't see the point
in waking another doctor.

560
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:04,441
Or publicizing your predicament.

561
00:29:04,465 --> 00:29:06,443
I'm competing for a promotion,

562
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:09,279
and I didn't feel the need to
tell my boss I was locked up

563
00:29:09,303 --> 00:29:10,536
unless I absolutely had to.

564
00:29:11,238 --> 00:29:12,472
No harm, no foul.

565
00:29:27,654 --> 00:29:28,732
Husband consented.

566
00:29:28,756 --> 00:29:30,056
We're good to go whenever you are.

567
00:29:32,693 --> 00:29:34,227
Scrub back in. I'll be right there.

568
00:29:39,566 --> 00:29:41,377
Oh, I'm gonna kill them.

569
00:29:41,401 --> 00:29:43,646
- Oh, God.
- Oh.

570
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,204
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

571
00:29:46,874 --> 00:29:48,284
What?

572
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:51,888
We had a patient come in this
morning with low-flow priapism.

573
00:29:51,912 --> 00:29:53,723
We thought it was drug-induced,

574
00:29:53,747 --> 00:29:55,391
but then I noticed a foot drop...

575
00:29:55,415 --> 00:29:56,693
<i>Cut to the chase.</i>

576
00:29:56,717 --> 00:29:58,928
We found an epidural abscess
with pelvic extension and...

577
00:29:58,952 --> 00:30:00,830
Get him prepped. I'll be there in 15.

578
00:30:00,854 --> 00:30:02,031
What?

579
00:30:02,055 --> 00:30:04,534
- I gotta go.
- No.

580
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:05,735
Is someone dying?

581
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:07,226
Not if I can get there in time.

582
00:30:10,063 --> 00:30:13,128
Oh, um, can you give me a ride?

583
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:23,674
Irrigate with diluted bacitracin.

584
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:25,373
Morgan, irrigation.

585
00:30:25,397 --> 00:30:28,610
Sorry. It's been a long day.

586
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:32,213
And you only have another
nine and a half hours to go.

587
00:30:32,237 --> 00:30:34,749
Only 9 hours, 21 minutes.

588
00:30:34,773 --> 00:30:37,786
Browne's right. This
flextime schedule is absurd.

589
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,888
Yeah, it has its drawbacks.

590
00:30:39,912 --> 00:30:42,490
But if this penis had been
passed on to the next shift,

591
00:30:42,514 --> 00:30:43,925
they would've assumed
you missed something,

592
00:30:43,949 --> 00:30:46,561
and they would've
done a whole new work-up.

593
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:48,029
The delay could've paralyzed him.

594
00:30:48,053 --> 00:30:50,498
Or maybe they wouldn't be so tired

595
00:30:50,522 --> 00:30:52,934
and would've noticed
the foot drop faster.

596
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:54,803
You guys are doing fine.

597
00:30:54,827 --> 00:30:56,404
And you'll get used to the fatigue.

598
00:30:56,428 --> 00:30:58,139
After a while, it won't even bother you.

599
00:30:58,163 --> 00:30:59,574
That's easy for you to say.

600
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:01,801
You were on home-call chilling
on your couch all day.

601
00:31:08,627 --> 00:31:09,727
Good point.

602
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:15,824
Orthotopic neobladder is in place.

603
00:31:15,848 --> 00:31:18,059
Let's make sure it drains
properly before we move on.

604
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:19,360
Flow looks good.

605
00:31:19,384 --> 00:31:21,018
Hold on, push it back again.

606
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:25,967
What's that? At the base of the uterus?

607
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:27,368
It looks dusky.

608
00:31:27,392 --> 00:31:28,726
Can I get some more dye?

609
00:31:38,737 --> 00:31:41,116
It's a polyploid mass.

610
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,385
It extends from the uterine
to the ovarian artery.

611
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:47,180
All collateral blood supplies
have been invaded.

612
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:50,600
We're gonna have to do
a full hysterectomy.

613
00:31:52,985 --> 00:31:54,629
What if we resect the mass

614
00:31:54,653 --> 00:31:56,831
and graft a saphenous vein for bypass?

615
00:31:56,855 --> 00:31:59,943
Risk of graft occlusion
is too high. She'd go septic.

616
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:04,656
The last thing she told us was her
lifelong dream was to be a mother.

617
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:10,870
It's an innovative idea. But...

618
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:13,915
It's not our decision.

619
00:32:13,939 --> 00:32:15,820
I'll scrub out and talk to the husband.

620
00:32:15,844 --> 00:32:17,607
No, I'll do it.

621
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,626
No, I... I... I can't
make that decision for my wife.

622
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,227
Yes, you can.

623
00:32:26,251 --> 00:32:27,896
You've already done it once.

624
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,531
This is different.

625
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:31,800
But this is what Gina wants.

626
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,235
I... I... It's why
she made you her proxy.

627
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:37,071
No. I'm... I'm her proxy
because she didn't think

628
00:32:37,095 --> 00:32:39,582
she should ask her mother and sisters

629
00:32:39,607 --> 00:32:42,210
to fly from Maine for a minor surgery.

630
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:44,345
Look, you have to call them.

631
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:47,657
No, Gina chose you.

632
00:32:48,373 --> 00:32:52,912
You are the one who knows her,
who truly understands her.

633
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:55,256
What would she want us to do?

634
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,914
I don't... I don't know.

635
00:32:58,517 --> 00:33:01,171
I mean, how... How can any man...

636
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,500
Please, just tell me what to do.

637
00:33:05,524 --> 00:33:08,236
I met her yesterday. I barely know her.

638
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,238
So you can be objective. You...
You can make the right call.

639
00:33:10,262 --> 00:33:11,773
No, Gina didn't choose someone
to be objective.

640
00:33:11,797 --> 00:33:13,908
- She chose you.
- Please, just tell me what to do.

641
00:33:13,932 --> 00:33:16,102
- I can't.
- You have to! Because I won't.

642
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:18,775
I can't do that to her.

643
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:22,901
Please. Just... Just help me.

644
00:33:23,942 --> 00:33:27,113
Whatever you say, that's...
That's what I'll do.

645
00:33:27,913 --> 00:33:29,413
Whatever you say.

646
00:33:36,054 --> 00:33:37,932
<i>Do you feel sorry for me?</i>

647
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:39,868
Why would I?

648
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:43,404
Morgan says Lea is only nice to me

649
00:33:43,428 --> 00:33:45,773
because she feels sorry for me.

650
00:33:45,797 --> 00:33:48,776
Does Morgan have a theory for
why Morgan is so nice to you?

651
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,846
I'm being honest,
which is better than nice.

652
00:33:52,971 --> 00:33:54,115
Cut this fibrinous tissue.

653
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:55,406
Bipolar.

654
00:33:57,042 --> 00:33:58,753
Some women put a guy in the friend zone

655
00:33:58,777 --> 00:34:01,481
and they end up treating him
more like a pet than a person.

656
00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:04,692
Morgan has a point. Some women do that.

657
00:34:04,716 --> 00:34:07,946
But the only way to find out if
Lea does that is to talk to her.

658
00:34:08,186 --> 00:34:09,430
The wound is clean.

659
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:11,576
No more macroscopic signs of infection.

660
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,005
Any spinal nerve damage?

661
00:34:13,029 --> 00:34:15,370
Won't be able to tell until he wakes up.

662
00:34:34,046 --> 00:34:36,557
What'd he decide?

663
00:34:36,581 --> 00:34:38,552
He didn't.

664
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,428
He refused to make a decision.

665
00:34:40,452 --> 00:34:45,191
He, um, insisted that I do it for him.

666
00:34:50,662 --> 00:34:52,607
She really wants to be a mom,

667
00:34:52,631 --> 00:34:54,565
- so I think that we should try to...
- No.

668
00:34:56,578 --> 00:34:58,830
He chose me to make the decision.

669
00:35:10,415 --> 00:35:13,052
Her life matters more than a dream.

670
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,246
Do a full hysterectomy.

671
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:26,874
You're right.

672
00:35:26,898 --> 00:35:28,373
Let's go.

673
00:35:28,397 --> 00:35:29,711
She's already been under for 22 hours

674
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:31,412
and we got a lot more work to do.

675
00:35:31,436 --> 00:35:33,156
Metz and a forcep.

676
00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:42,707
DR. MELENDEZ E uterosacral ligament.

677
00:35:46,097 --> 00:35:47,974
Large pan.

678
00:35:52,957 --> 00:35:54,235
Time?

679
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,883
4:10. She's been under
26 hours, 10 minutes.

680
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:59,653
All right, let's close
her up so we can wake her up.

681
00:35:59,677 --> 00:36:01,388
I'll go tell the husband.

682
00:36:01,412 --> 00:36:03,213
No. I'll do it.

683
00:36:05,516 --> 00:36:07,050
Dr. Browne, you take lead on the close.

684
00:36:13,991 --> 00:36:15,769
Wiggle your toes.

685
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:23,143
All 10 are going to market.

686
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:25,011
You're gonna be fine.

687
00:36:25,035 --> 00:36:27,447
And, uh, w-what about my...

688
00:36:27,471 --> 00:36:29,072
He'll be fine, too.

689
00:36:30,141 --> 00:36:31,184
Thank you.

690
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:32,486
Oh, don't thank me.

691
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,121
Those two are the ones who saved you.

692
00:36:34,145 --> 00:36:36,156
All on their own...

693
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,213
Almost.

694
00:37:11,282 --> 00:37:13,047
What happened?

695
00:37:14,452 --> 00:37:17,170
The endometrial lesions
were much more invasive

696
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:19,099
than we saw on the imaging.

697
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:21,301
In order to remove them all,
we needed to reconstruct

698
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:23,660
a new bladder out of a section
of your intestine.

699
00:37:24,962 --> 00:37:26,696
And we had to remove your uterus.

700
00:37:33,971 --> 00:37:35,820
Honey, I am so sorry.

701
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,380
It's gonna be okay.

702
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:50,954
I love you so much.

703
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:53,755
I love you, too.

704
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:06,913
Now that we've handled
the surgical crisis,

705
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:09,272
it's time we deal with
the unprofessional behavior.

706
00:38:11,442 --> 00:38:14,567
The only question I have is,
who exactly is to blame?

707
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:21,328
It was a 27-hour surgery.

708
00:38:21,352 --> 00:38:23,326
There were some tense moments.

709
00:38:23,754 --> 00:38:25,499
But I was very pleased with how everyone

710
00:38:25,523 --> 00:38:27,371
ultimately worked together as a team.

711
00:38:29,527 --> 00:38:32,839
I was especially impressed
with how Dr. Browne

712
00:38:32,863 --> 00:38:36,734
aggressively stood her ground
and insisted

713
00:38:36,758 --> 00:38:38,793
that I respect the husband's
final decisions

714
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,436
regarding his wife's hysterectomy.

715
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,878
Is there anything the two
of you would like to share?

716
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:53,216
No. I'm good.

717
00:38:57,755 --> 00:38:59,487
Well, I'd like to say...

718
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:07,841
I was very impressed
with Dr. Melendez's openness

719
00:39:07,865 --> 00:39:11,545
to hearing input from all
of the surgical team.

720
00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:13,513
It's definitely something all of us

721
00:39:13,537 --> 00:39:15,795
on the nursing staff appreciate.

722
00:39:20,945 --> 00:39:22,145
Very good.

723
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:26,950
Go home, get some rest.

724
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:50,750
You're here.

725
00:39:50,774 --> 00:39:52,456
Yeah, I am.

726
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,888
I shouldn't have told you to go away.

727
00:40:09,994 --> 00:40:13,436
It wasn't very nice and you've
always been nice to me.

728
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:18,201
You've been a good friend.

729
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:25,241
If you want to talk, I will listen.

730
00:40:30,547 --> 00:40:34,394
You're right. I have been a good friend.

731
00:40:34,418 --> 00:40:36,759
Actually, I've been an awesome friend,

732
00:40:36,783 --> 00:40:39,003
but you have been a total jerk!

733
00:40:39,342 --> 00:40:42,035
You are so worried about me hurting you?

734
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:43,536
What about how you hurt me?

735
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,739
What? You think you're
the only one who has feelings?

736
00:40:45,763 --> 00:40:47,941
You think you're the only one
who needs someone

737
00:40:47,965 --> 00:40:50,744
who doesn't judge them, doesn't
make them feel totally alone,

738
00:40:50,768 --> 00:40:52,345
like there's not one person in the world

739
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:53,613
who actually gives a damn about them?

740
00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:54,881
Okay. I'm sorry.

741
00:40:54,905 --> 00:40:55,873
No, you're not!

742
00:40:55,897 --> 00:40:57,517
You're... You're just uncomfortable

743
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:58,692
and you're trying to get me to shut up.

744
00:40:58,716 --> 00:41:00,053
Which, don't worry, I will.

745
00:41:00,077 --> 00:41:01,421
Just as soon as I finish telling you

746
00:41:01,445 --> 00:41:03,456
that friendship
is a two-way street, Shaun!

747
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,548
A two-way street, you jackass!

748
00:41:09,753 --> 00:41:11,131
Guess I was wrong.

749
00:41:11,155 --> 00:41:12,755
She does think of you like a real man.

750
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:31,174
Are you awake?

751
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:35,978
Hi, Daddy.

752
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:42,285
Maddie?

753
00:41:47,057 --> 00:41:48,291
How are you feeling?

754
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:54,063
It's so good to see you.

755
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:57,366
You're dead.

756
00:41:58,202 --> 00:41:59,635
Don't you think I know that?

757
00:42:01,672 --> 00:42:02,872
Am I dead?

758
00:42:03,874 --> 00:42:08,008
No, dummy. You're just tired.

759
00:42:23,346 --> 00:42:27,500

1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,636
Previously,
on The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,938
You work together and
you are sleeping together.

3
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:07,241
You don't see any way
that can go wrong?

4
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:08,676
You went out
on a limb for me.

5
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:11,179
You fire me now, you look 
like a fool in front of the board.

6
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:13,681
Dr. Andrews, I don't think you 
have the votes to carry it.

7
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:14,982
But I don't
need the votes.

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,684
Just as you have the power
to fire someone

9
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,352
under your supervision,
so do I.

10
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:19,587
Did you
hear about Han?

11
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,589
Can't imagine Andrews
will survive the fallout.

12
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,191
They're gonna need
a new Chief of Surgery.

13
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,159
Aoki should be calling you 
with the offer any minute.

14
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,996
Here are flowers
and chocolates.

15
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,831
Are you asking me out?
Yes.

16
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:32,533
I would love to.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,074

Why are you
smiling?

19
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:46,247
I don't know.

20
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,319
I just...
I wanted you to know that

21
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:52,886
things are okay.

29
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:15,809
I saw a movie
last weekend.

30
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:17,211
Which one?
Was it good?

31
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:18,346
What kind of movies
do you like?

32
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:21,982
<font color="#ffff00"><i> What a shame</i></font>

33
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,084
Oh. This looks delicious.
Thank you.

34
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:25,219
<font color="#ffff00"><i> Ever fallen in love

35
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:26,820
<font color="#ffff00"><i> Ever fallen in love</i></font>

36
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:28,822
I said no pickles.

37
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:30,158
<font color="#ffff00"><i> Ever fallen in love 
Pardon me?</i></font>

38
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,493
It's okay. They can
just take that off...
I said no pickles.

39
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:33,727
Oh. I am so sorry.

40
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,363
I said no pickles.

41
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,803
It was a disaster.

42
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,808
What happened?

43
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:50,578
Don't you all
have work to do?

44
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,779
Sorry.
We were just...

45
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,614
Shaun was on a date.

46
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:54,882
Hmm.

47
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,850
Congratulations
on your promotion.

48
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,919
I believe you're our first
female Chief of Surgery.

49
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:03,624
That's nice.
Uh, thank you. Yes.

50
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,125
And you're still
not working.

51
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,364
Not you.

52
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:12,300
We need to go to H.R.
and break up.

53
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,312
We need a head CT
and a trauma panel.

54
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,914
Please! Someone!
Help my wife!

55
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,833
We've been married
for 45 years.

56
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,967
Two children.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,068
Eh, so far.

58
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,403
Oh, stop it.

59
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:50,604
Ricky and Tammy.

60
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:53,106
Ricky's got two kids
of his own.

61
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,675
When did you
first notice the pain?

62
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,344
This morning.
No, on Saturday.

63
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,146
He has a history
of kidney stones.

64
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,614
I try to get him
to drink more water...

65
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:02,015
You "try"?

66
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,017
When did I ever
say no to you?

67
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,855
It's probably another stone,
but we'll do some imaging

68
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,490
to rule out anything
more serious.

69
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,991
Oh, thank you.

70
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,360
Did you tell them
about the kids?

71
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,295
We have two, you know.

72
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:15,829
So far.

73
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,466
That's nice.

74
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:23,871
Not it.
What?

75
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,473
He's got dementia,
and even worse, it's boring.

76
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:26,840
Probably stones.

77
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,276
Best case scenario,
it's a kidney tumor.

78
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,210
We've assisted
on eight nephrectomies.

79
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,979
It's your case,
your chart, you're primary.

80
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,547
Kellan's coming to town.
I need to be out of here

81
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,549
at a decent hour,
and we are not children.

82
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,486
We do not decide things
by who called it.

83
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,053
You touched the chart first.
It's yours.

84
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,389
Did not.
Did so.

85
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,524
We walked up together,
Petringa handed the chart to you.

86
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,658
Did not.
Did so.

87
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,126
Did not.
Did so.

88
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,361
Why?

89
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,564
It just wasn't
working out.

90
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,801
Oh. Well, I certainly hope
it's not because in light of

91
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,969
Dr. Lim's recent promotion
to Chief of Surgery

92
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:57,971
that she's now
your supervisor?

93
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,240
We knew that arrangement
would be unacceptable,

94
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:01,542
and since
we only recently

95
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,710
started seeing
each other...

96
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,513
You were seeing each other
secretly for some time

97
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,214
before you reported it,
correct?

98
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,685
So, maybe you've
just gone back

99
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,120
to seeing each other
in secret.

100
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,757
No. Uh, we made

101
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,492
the decision
that this opportunity

102
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:19,593
for Dr. Lim is just...

103
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,331
You're... What...
What are you writing?

104
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,733
I have accepted
your explanation and report.

105
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,001
Thank you.

106
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,670
But I don't believe it.

107
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,071
You're going to keep
seeing each other,

108
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,708
and I can't do anything to stop that,
nor do I even want to.

109
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:37,545
But know this.
Love doesn't conquer all,

110
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:40,948
lust doesn't either,
and like doesn't even come close.

111
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,585
This is gonna be a lot more complicated
than either of you think.

112
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,857
Looks like you have a large 
uterine fibroid that's bled.

113
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,625
It has to be
removed surgically.

114
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,727
Yes, routine surgery.
You should be fine.

115
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,029
Uterine? Am I gonna
be able to have...

116
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,466
The surgery won't affect your 
ability to have children.

117
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,404
I didn't let her finish
her question because

118
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,606
I anticipated what
she was going to ask

119
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,608
because the uterus
has very few functions.

120
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,544
Nicely done.
Yes.

121
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:12,145
To improve O.R. access,

122
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,814
we're going to
automatic block release

123
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,617
and implement staggered
starts for anesthesia.

124
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,818
Any questions?

125
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,286
Dr. Andrews
and Dr. Han

126
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,721
wouldn't authorize
staff overtime.

127
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,789
Now, our nurses...

128
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,724
Good point. Thank you.

129
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:24,858
Yes. Authorized.

130
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,229
One other thing, and this is
really for our third years,

131
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,399
but it will affect
all of you.

132
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:34,067
Traditionally, you don't get to lead 
surgeries until fourth year.

133
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,503
That will be changing.

134
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,406
The earlier you get in there
and take responsibility,

135
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,441
the more chance
you have to learn.

136
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:41,942
When the right
surgery comes along,

137
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,478
something simple,
basic,

138
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,313
it'll be yours.

139
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,481
Start prepping.

140
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,356
Maybe I did touch
the chart first.

141
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,459
Relax. It's okay.

142
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,961
I can stay late now and again.
This is my job.

143
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,295
Stop it.

144
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,932
You don't want the case.
It's boring. I get it.

145
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,968
I know you get it.
Boring is now exciting.

146
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,170
Boring means
it's a routine surgery,

147
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,005
which means it's a surgery
that Lim just said

148
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,474
one of us may well lead.

149
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,108
This one's probably
no surgery at all.

150
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,978
It's probably just kidney stones and late nights
with a man with dementia.

151
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,680
I'll take that chance.

152
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,848
You hate people.

153
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,149
People don't know that.

154
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:23,817
People like me.

155
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:25,719
You need to be
with your family.

156
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,621
Kellan's 16.
He barely talks to me.

157
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:29,790
It's who touched the chart first, 
which, as you said, was me.

158
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,258
And as you said...
Excuse me.

159
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,895
Y-Yes, Harvey?
Is everything okay?

160
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:36,664
Why am I in here?

161
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,567
Nothing to worry about.

162
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,234
It's likely just a kidney stone.
You just have to...

163
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,203
Yes!
It's cancer.

164
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,640
Nicely isolated,
simple surgery.

165
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:49,142
Perfect for a resident.

166
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,580
Put some
traction on the uterus

167
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,747
to expose
the broad ligament.

168
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:58,051
I'll slide the pelvic
retractor under the fundus.

169
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,856
Did the wine
spill all over you?

170
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,424
Um...

171
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,228
Did it spill
all over Carly?

172
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,262
S-Stop.

173
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,901
Look above
the posterior cul de sac.

174
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,073
Cancer.
Yes.

175
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,643
Very extensive,
I think.

176
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,882
It appears to have
metastasized everywhere.

177
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,585
Liver, kidney,
abdominal wall.

178
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,561
Close her up.

179
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,307
I rang the doorbell.

180
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:56,610
Yes, you did.

181
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,045
Are you gonna spend
the rest of your life

182
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,947
lying around
in this backyard?

183
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,983
That, and lying next
to my future wife.

184
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,418
Congratulations.
I heard.

185
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,020
But what are you going to
do professionally?

186
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,326
When people think they're
going to die, like you did,

187
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,097
they assess their life,
reevaluate what's important.

188
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,268
You're going to need
to make a difference.

189
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,972
Do you have a puppy
for me to adopt?

190
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,774
I have a vacancy
at President.

191
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,009
Again?

192
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,111
You're interested,

193
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,746
but you think things
have to change.

194
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,314
They don't.

195
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,950
You led a meaningful life
before cancer,

196
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,886
and you will lead
a meaningful life after.

197
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,492
Well, thank you.
I'm very inspired.

198
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,194
Think about it.

199
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,529
Also, sunscreen.

200
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,672
What's going on behind
the pancreas at the root

201
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,373
of the superior
mesenteric artery?

202
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,042
We need
a better angle.

203
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,677
We're not gonna get
a better angle.

204
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:06,146
Definitely not when
we're actually operating.

205
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,215
So what's the solution?

206
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,284
There isn't one.

207
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:12,786
Not surgically.

208
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,922
We should refer them
to an oncologist.

209
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:17,324
Chemo might help,
but I'm not hopeful.

210
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,593
What are you
gonna tell them?

211
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,063
You guys are third year.

212
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,564
You want stuff
to learn by doing?

213
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,900
How about sympathetic
communication?

214
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:30,838
Shaun, let the bride know
she's probably dying.

215
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:43,316
This morning, who did you
give the Calderon chart to?

216
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,752
I gave it to you guys.

217
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,053
Uh, but you handed it
to one of us.

218
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,520
One of us actually
took it from you.

219
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:48,989
It was me, right?

220
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,191
I don't know. What does it matter?
You just came up and...

221
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,826
From the right.
I came up on Morgan's left.

222
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,861
You're left-handed?

223
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,897
It only makes sense
that I would be closer to...

224
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,598
Excuse me.

225
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,567
Is there any news
about my husband?

226
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:09,509
Harvey, you remember
Drs. Park and Reznick.

227
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,644
They did your scan.

228
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:12,012
R-Right.
For my, uh...

229
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,947
They were looking
for kidney stones.

230
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,716
Unfortunately,
we found some cancer.

231
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,985
It's on your
left kidney. Cancer?

232
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,920
The good news is
it's isolated

233
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,454
and in a very
operable location.

234
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,791
Cancer.

235
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,292
I have cancer?

236
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,361
We have to tell
the children.

237
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:29,797
We'll do
a biopsy to confirm,

238
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,899
but I'm confident
that we caught it early.

239
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,403
This is terrible.
I... I can't die.

240
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,305
I...You need me.

241
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,142
I know.

242
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,311
But with surgery, radiation,
and immunotherapy,

243
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,046
the prognosis
is excellent.

244
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,525
You're supposed to be
talking to our patient.

245
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,261
They can wait
until we're sure.

246
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:04,832
We are sure.
Dr. Melendez is sure.

247
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:08,168
Dr. Lim told us we're ready for
more responsibility,

248
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,670
so I decided I can make
a decision on my own,

249
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,639
and I decided to do
some more research.

250
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,975
Shaun, you need to learn
how to do this,

251
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,643
and stalling
just makes it worse.

252
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:25,418
I think maybe you're feeling
bad about your date,

253
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,587
and you're in here
burying yourself in things

254
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,823
you subconsciously think
you can control.

255
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,625
How do people know what's 
going on in their subconscious?

256
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,364
What happened, Shaun,

257
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,033
when you jumped up?

258
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,274
<font color="#ffff00"><i> Fallen in love with someone,
ever fallen in love</i></font>

259
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,676
<font color="#ffff00"><i> In love with someone,
ever fallen in love</i></font>

260
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,978
<font color="#ffff00"><i> In love with someone</i></font>

261
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,545
<font color="#ffff00"><i> You shouldn't
have fallen in love with </i></font>

262
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,089
Your phone is ringing.

263
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,858
It can wait.
Mm.

264
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,526
It's your mother.

265
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,028
It can wait.

266
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,863
What went wrong?
What was the disaster?

267
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,298
She called earlier, too.

268
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,600
If stalling is bad,
then why are you

269
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,235
avoiding your
mother's calls?

270
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,742
Did you ever forgive your mother
for not protecting you?

271
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:25,745
Is that what your mother
wants to know?

272
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,347
My mother was
a terrible mother.

273
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,582
It wasn't all her fault.
She was bipolar.

274
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:32,519
That doesn't change the fact
that she was terrible.

275
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:36,356
I... I don't think it's good
for her to be in my life.

276
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,697
Are you looking
for guidance...

277
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:45,933
From me?

278
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,639
Am I a role model
to you?

279
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,310
On some issues,
absolutely.

280
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,223
I don't usually think
about the past.

281
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,324
It doesn't help.

282
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:16,997
But the date.

283
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,331
Mm-mm.

284
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,733
Yesterday is part
of the past,

285
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,170
and the past matters.

286
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,404
What happened?

287
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,879
I... Told a joke.

288
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,780
No.
Yes.

289
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,748
Lea said I should.

290
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:39,052
No. That is not
what I said.

291
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:40,720
Does this tie
look good?

292
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,655
Yes. But not
with those pants.

293
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,291
And what I was saying
was that jokes are

294
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,726
the types of things
people do on dates.

295
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,728
They talk about
the weather, hobbies,

296
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,030
where they went
to college.

297
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,564
I'm a person.

298
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,533
Should I change my pants
with you in the room?

299
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,801
No.

300
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,436
And, yes, I know
you're a person, Shaun,

301
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,105
but we all have strengths
and weaknesses.

302
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:01,774
Telling jokes is easy.
There are books full of them.

303
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:02,842
I said no.

304
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,778
Yes, there are
a lot of jokes,

305
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,948
but you have to know
how to tell them.

306
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,283
You have to know
when to tell them.

307
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:15,022
So, I took a gap year
before college, which,

308
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,124
in hindsight, I think
might have been a mistake.

309
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,127
Staying at home.

310
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,528
My relationship
with my dad...

311
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,196
Caesar walked
into a bar

312
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,665
and asked the bartender
for a martinus.

313
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,135
The bartender said,
"Do you mean a martini?"

314
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,536
And Caesar says,
"If I wanted two,

315
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,837
"I would have
ordered two."

316
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,208
Uh... Did she laugh?

317
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,010
I'm not sure.
Well, what did she say?

318
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,588
SHAUN: She made a sound.

319
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,690
"Heh.

320
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,858
"Heh heh heh."

321
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,293
You got a chuckle,
I think.

322
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,561
That's... That's good.
No, it's not.

323
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:57,164
I read six joke books,
and all I got was a...

324
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,465
"Heh. Heh, heh, heh."

325
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,532
It was a disaster.

326
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,001
Because of a joke?

327
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,506
Something bigger
must have gone wrong.

328
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,674
What happened?

329
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,417
A young woman
may be dying.

330
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,286
I have a lot
of research to do.

331
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,172
Boom. My chart, my case,
my patient, my surgery.

332
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:40,240
You took it from me.

333
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,574
It touched my fingers.
I know it did.

334
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,675
And then you
took it from me.

335
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,011
All I know is I'm the one
holding the chart.

336
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,378
That's the evidence
we got to deal with.

337
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,446
If you could prove...
Angles.

338
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,614
We need more angles.

339
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:48,982
How many cameras
do we have in that section?

340
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:02,129
Dr. Lim,I'm glad you made that
decision on the overtime.

341
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,296
Oh. You're welcome.

342
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,098
But I thought you'd want to know
the real issue

343
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,067
isn't the overtime.
It's being understaffed.

344
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,203
We need two more nurses on 
this floor alone, one in ICU...

345
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,139
I'm sorry.
I'm sure you're right,

346
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,973
but we just don't
have the budget.

347
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,477
Excuse me?

348
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,711
Nothing, ma'am.

349
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,513
I gave you the OT.
You're not being fair.

350
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:21,614
Aren't I?

351
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:22,882
You told me I was right,

352
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,951
then you told me
you're not gonna do it.

353
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,519
Who's being unfair?

354
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,658
Nobody said this job...

355
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,509
Shaun.

356
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,112
Come with me.

357
00:16:58,485 --> 00:16:59,986
Is everything okay?

358
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,888
The nurse told us
you didn't finish the surgery.

359
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,994
Suzanne...

360
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:14,334
3...you have
very extensive cancer

361
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,036
throughout your
abdomen.

362
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,744
It appears
to be malignant.

363
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,080
(SOBS)

364
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:36,656
And it appears to have metastasized
around every organ.

365
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,901
But there's hope
with surgery.

366
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,782
We can't see the retrohepatic
part of the cancer because of the liver.

367
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,585
We can't see the retroperitoneal part
because of the right kidney.

368
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,887
Yes, I know. That's why we should
take out the organs.

369
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,760
You want to remove
her liver and right kidney?

370
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:17,364
Yes. And also her left kidney
and her pancreas

371
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,532
and her intestinal tract
and the stomach.

372
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:22,034
You do know that several of those organs
are quite essential.

373
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,236
We'll put them back.

374
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:28,107
We remove them,
clean up the cancer,

375
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,142
then put them back.

376
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,912
Ex vivo surgery.

377
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,714
It's been done
for pancreatic cancer.

378
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:35,782
Without much success.

379
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,285
No. You think it'd work
better here?

380
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,687
Not really.

381
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,989
But the alternative
is death.

382
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,274
Hi.
Hi.

383
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,609
How are you?

384
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,776
Good.

385
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,547
N-Not working?

386
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,915
Yeah.

387
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,050
It's been 72 hours,
and I still haven't found a job.

388
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,785
Relax.
I'll be fine.

389
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,922
I got some irons in the fire.
What do you need?

390
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,725
How do you say no
to a person?

391
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,260
I don't think
I'm doing it right.

392
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,995
Okay.
Watch closely.

393
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,775
Really?

394
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:36,976
If you're gonna
give up that easily,

395
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,645
you might as well
just quit now.

396
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:52,191
The biopsy confirmed that the kidney cancer is
a renal cell carcinoma.

397
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:55,161
Cancer?
I have cancer?

398
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,663
Yes.

399
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,198
Why didn't you tell me?

400
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,434
We did.

401
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:04,003
The good news is that
it's treatable with surgery

402
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,838
and immunotherapy
and radiation.

403
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,940
We have to tell
the children.

404
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,108
The children know.

405
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,377
How do they know?

406
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:12,912
What's going on?

407
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,682
Am I dying?

408
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,450
The cancer is serious,
but...

409
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:19,586
Ruby, we'd like to
talk to you outside.

410
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,025
I'll be right back.

411
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:33,866
The problem isn't
how you said no.

412
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,635
The problem is how
you said yes.

413
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,270
She seemed quite happy
with the yes.

414
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,505
It came too quickly.

415
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,006
You made her think
she was helping you

416
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,140
instead of the
other way around,

417
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,241
so she came
asking for more,

418
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,710
feeling she was
entitled to more.

419
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,814
So I should have said no
when I wanted to say yes?

420
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,416
You shouldn't tell her
what you want to tell her.

421
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,217
You should tell her
what she needs to hear.

422
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,754
See, it's your job to figure out
what you can give them,

423
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,489
convince them
that's what they need,

424
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,190
and then make them feel
like they owe you.

425
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,528
N-None of that sounds
like me.

426
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,363
And you want to
do the job your way,

427
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,164
without changing
who you are?

428
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,900
Is that amusing to you?
Yes, I do.

429
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,037
Yesterday,
you were an attending.

430
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,905
Today, you're Chief.

431
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,441
You are
a different person.

432
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:17,944
Want an espresso?

433
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:23,783
Without surgery,
your husband would

434
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,585
probably live another
two to five years.

435
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,388
He would have
very little discomfort

436
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:32,191
until very close to the end,
and that can be managed.

437
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,226
You said
it was treatable. It is.

438
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,363
But fighting cancer's
never easy.

439
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:40,266
We have to weigh the benefits
against the suffering,

440
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,870
and the surgery itself
is usually the easiest part.

441
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,372
He's strong.
He's healthy.

442
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,640
He's not healthy.
Not mentally.

443
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:50,042
And the burden
on you...

444
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:53,045
I am not letting
my husband die

445
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,582
because caring for him
is inconvenient,

446
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:58,651
because I'm gonna have to
repeat a conversation.

447
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,387
Just go to hell.

448
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,629
This type of surgery's never 
been done for this condition.

449
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,131
We'd be dealing with every one
of your abdominal organs,

450
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,601
and something could
go wrong with any of them.

451
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:18,971
You could be on dialysis for
the rest of your life.

452
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,442
You could have a very compromised
digestive tract,

453
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:24,110
lifelong diabetes.

454
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:25,978
You could
have liver failure.

455
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,949
That's not
a complete list.

456
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,451
You could die.

457
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:37,590
And, um,

458
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:39,191
if we don't
do the surgery?

459
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:41,093
Chemotherapy
and radiation.

460
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:44,897
Although the likelihood of
success is slim, about 25%.

461
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,300
You may prefer
hospice care.

462
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:51,804
You'd probably live
maybe a year,

463
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,039
but it'd be a good year.

464
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:05,752
Could you give us
some time to think about it?

465
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:08,254
Of course.

466
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,907
We're supposed
to be at lunch.

467
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,642
We're gonna be late.

468
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:30,977
Why?

469
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,646
Why? Because I need
meaning in my life.

470
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,747
Your heart seems fine.

471
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:37,484
Your liver seems to be
in the right place.

472
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:40,052
You're a brain surgeon.

473
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,756
You don't think you can get 
meaning being a brain surgeon?

474
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,626
This is a boring patient
with boring symptoms.

475
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,031
Shaun,
meet Marco Higgins,

476
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,233
diesel mechanic,
currently in between jobs.

477
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,402
Three sons, two of whom
he hasn't spoken to

478
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,370
in quite some time,
but he's working on that.

479
00:23:58,404 --> 00:23:59,606
Open.

480
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,575
Wide.

481
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,577
It's good to get
to know people, Shaun.

482
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,945
It makes you
a better doctor.

483
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,179
Say, "Ah."

484
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:09,215
Ah.

485
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:12,552
You have boring symptoms.
That's a good thing.

486
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:14,420
You do not want
exciting symptoms.

487
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,790
You had a date last night,
didn't you?

488
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,426
Mm. I want to hear
about this.

489
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:22,662
Marco, you want to
hear about this?

490
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:25,364
Yes, please.

491
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,466
Yes, please.
Open.

492
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,042
It was a disaster.

493
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:42,381
Oh, thank you, Shaun,
but it's really not...

494
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,550
No, it's polite
and chivalrous...

495
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:47,419
...and even though chivalry
is a problematic notion,

496
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,155
politeness is a good thing,
no matter which...

497
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,389
Ohh!
Shaun!

498
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,593
Are you okay?
Oh, my.

499
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,962
I'm okay.
She might not be okay.

500
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,798
No, I am okay.
Okay. Don't get up.

501
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,499
I'm pretty sure
she's okay.

502
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,037
Take off his boots.

503
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,106
What?

504
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,275
Do you think
Marco's diabetic?

505
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:12,812
Based on the color of his skin in 
the crease of his neck, I do.

506
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,147
Based on what it says
on his chart, I do, too.

507
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,483
He could have
an infection in his feet,

508
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,252
and the pain is being masked
by diabetic neuropathy.

509
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:23,189
That infection could be causing
the abdominal symptoms.

510
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,959
Marco, would you mind
taking off your boots?

511
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,680
I was wrong.
It's not boring.

512
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:57,489
I can do it myself.

513
00:25:57,523 --> 00:26:00,960
I'm sure,
but our job here
is to help each other,

514
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,696
and today
I didn't do that.

515
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:08,234
I'm trying to make up for that
with a jar of pickles.

516
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,042
I overstepped and...

517
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,210
...undercut you in front
of the patient's wife.

518
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,815
I accept your apology.

519
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:24,283
What I should have done

520
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:27,720
was privately tell you
that you're wrong.

521
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,356
Give me the jar back.

522
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:31,423
And let you,
as lead doctor,

523
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,292
tell them that
this surgery's a bad idea.

524
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,029
Because we should let
a 70-year-old man die

525
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:38,497
of a treatable
condition?

526
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,066
Because we shouldn't
condemn a 70-year-old man

527
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,868
to years of confusion
and fear.

528
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,070
His life
still has value.

529
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,574
Seriously?

530
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,977
He has memory issues.
He's not a vegetable.

531
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:54,580
He's funny,
he's charming.

532
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,383
They've lived
a life together.

533
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,421
He brings happiness to his wife,
to his children.

534
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,224
He's happy.

535
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,592
Exactly.

536
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,195
Let him stay happy
for whatever time he has left.

537
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,312
Nurse Petringa.

538
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,082
I'm sorry
if I overstepped.

539
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:32,084
I didn't track you down
for an apology.

540
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:34,386
You gonna get us
the additional staff?

541
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,055
No.

542
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,724
If I get you
the additional staff,

543
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,491
you lose hours,
you lose overtime.

544
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,560
So you're doing us
a favor by making sure

545
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,495
we never
see our families?

546
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:44,997
Your problem
isn't the staff.

547
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,432
Your problem
is the actual work,

548
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:49,702
the crap part of the work
that takes too long and too many of you.

549
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,473
I authorized the purchase
of two Hoya patient lifts

550
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,475
and a mechatronic
ICU bed.

551
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,144
A smart bed?

552
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,282
Those are actually
supposed to be kind of fun.

553
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:05,584
You got to promise
to let me try it.

554
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,486
You got it.

555
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,522
Dr. Lim?

556
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,491
Thank you.

557
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,160
You owe me.

558
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:21,133
I'm well aware of what
he'll be going through.

559
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,534
My sister had cancer.

560
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:25,671
The chemo,
the radiation...

561
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,541
They beat the crap out of her,
didn't they?

562
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:32,378
Yeah.

563
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,015
Now imagine
going through that

564
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:39,418
and not understanding,
every day.

565
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:44,056
Throwing up
and not knowing why,

566
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,994
losing your hair
and not knowing why,

567
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,900
learning he has cancer
and being devastated by it

568
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:55,534
day after day.

569
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,836
But at the end...

570
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,370
There are
no guarantees.

571
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,943
He's old, and his
body's breaking down.

572
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,415
His mind
is breaking down,

573
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:15,187
and it's gonna end,
no matter what we do.

574
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:25,932
In 45 years, I have never
once lied to him.

575
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:35,307
When memory goes,
all that's left is emotion.

576
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:39,678
What we've learned
doesn't matter.

577
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:43,249
What we had for lunch,
where we went for vacation,

578
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,385
none of it matters.

579
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:50,389
But how we feel,

580
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,060
who we're close to...

581
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,431
He's the same man
I've always loved.

582
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,469
Same sense of humor.

583
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,006
Same everything.

584
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,609
He hasn't changed.

585
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,184
And what I owe him
hasn't changed.

586
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,656
Have you decided?

587
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,225
Not yet.

588
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,427
Take your time.
There is no urgency to...

589
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,795
What are
you waiting for?

590
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,934
Dr. Murphy, they are kind of 
facing an impossible choice.

591
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:36,335
But they
have to make it.

592
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,874
What additional information
are you waiting for?

593
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:43,609
Shaun...
I'll be a better doctor

594
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:45,177
if I understand
the patient.

595
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,013
True, but right now, your skills 
are secondary to their...

596
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:51,250
Are you debating whether you 
should find somebody else

597
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:54,286
to fall in love with,
someone healthy?

598
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,388
No.
No, of course not.

599
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:58,690
You should be.

600
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:03,896
We're kids.

601
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,033
You shouldn't have to
spend the rest of your life

602
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,567
taking care
of an invalid.

603
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,837
You think that's
the issue?

604
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,840
Me?
A-A burden on me?

605
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:18,110
This is so much easier
on me than you.

606
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:19,745
No, it's not.

607
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,085
Whatever happens to me
is gonna happen,

608
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,821
and I have to
live with it.

609
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:34,994
You...

610
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,929
You have a choice.

611
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:45,171
"In sickness
and in health."

612
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:49,108
That was the commitment
I made...

613
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:53,612
This morning.

614
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,318
Now, if this had
happened yesterday...

615
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,996
So, it's not that difficult
a decision then, right?

616
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:15,934
I guess not.

617
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,932
I can feel her humeral head 
outside the glenoid fossa.

618
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,536
It's an anterior
dislocation.

619
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,271
I can reduce that.

620
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,372
Here?

621
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:56,442
Yes, with traction
and external rotation.

622
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,410
Ow!

623
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,415
Oh. Oh.

624
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:05,484
Oh, my, that... That...
That feels better.

625
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:06,652
I bumped you.

626
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,287
Oh, d-d-don't worry.

627
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,589
It happens. I-I wasn't watching,
either.

628
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:16,528
Come on.

629
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:20,466
That's it?

630
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,469
You bumped into
a very understanding woman,

631
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:26,605
you amazingly caught
a bottle of wine.

632
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:27,873
Where was the disaster?

633
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:33,345
Unclamp the superior mesenteric
to perfuse the organs.

634
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:46,892
The small intestines
look dusky and cyanotic.

635
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,995
We'll need to resect
all the necrotic segments.

636
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,198
Claire, find the first
viable part of the ilium

637
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,332
and clamp proximal
to it.

638
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,316
I don't think your irons
in the fire are very hot.

639
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:13,585
Any job interviews you get,
you're gonna spend

640
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,854
a large chunk of time
trying to explain why

641
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,624
you lasted less than a year as President
at St. Bonaventure.

642
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:21,293
I mean, how do you put
a positive spin on

643
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:23,162
why you spent a fortune
on a Chief of Surgery

644
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:26,132
you fired weeks later
to protect a second-year resident?

645
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:27,233
You think
I made a mistake?

646
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,501
No, I think you did
the right thing.

647
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:32,704
I admire you, which is why
I want to do you a favor.

648
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,244
What you need to dois prove that you haven't
burned any bridges,

649
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:41,113
which means you have to come back to work
at St. Bonaventure.

650
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,184
As what? As a surgeon
working for you?

651
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,754
And the fact that you're
undoubtedly in need of

652
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:51,757
a surgical attending to replace yourself
is just a coincidence?

653
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,293
It's what you need.

654
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,697
I admire the effort.

655
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,766
But don't con a con man.

656
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,045
Your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness

657
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,081
as a leader
was your stubbornness.

658
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,217
Don't let it be
a weakness today.

659
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,156
My back hurts
on the left side.

660
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,892
That's where
you had your biopsy.

661
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:28,194
It's gonna hurt
for a little while.

662
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:29,428
What biopsy?

663
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:34,700
Harvey, you came in here
because you thought you had kidney stones.

664
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:37,169
We did some imaging,
and you don't.

665
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:39,305
What is it? What...
What's wrong?

666
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:44,643
What?
What's going on, Ruby?

667
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,144
I...

668
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:49,281
Why isn't anybody
saying anything?

669
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:53,519
Am I dying?

670
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,121
Ruby?

671
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,624
I... I can't die.

672
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,159
I need to
take care of you.

673
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,861
I... I can't...

674
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:05,464
They didn't
find stones.

675
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:10,536
Everything is okay.

676
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:16,775
The pain will go away.

677
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,877
We're gonna
go home tonight.

678
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,182
Okay? Okay?

679
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,508
I had a nice time.

680
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,270
That's it?

681
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,972
It's over?

682
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:22,908
Where's the disaster?

683
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:24,310
I've listened to
an hour of this.

684
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:25,677
I was promised
a disaster.

685
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,178
Where's the disaster?

686
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:33,251
It...was exhausting.

687
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:39,858
Everything was always
out of control.

688
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:43,495
Anything could happen
at any time.

689
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:44,763
Anything did.

690
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:49,200
There was too much
to remember to do,

691
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:51,269
too much to
remember not to do,

692
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:52,704
and none of it made sense.

693
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:57,909
It was hard, uncomfortable,
unpleasant.

694
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,712
I spent the whole evening
doing unnatural things

695
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:03,615
to make her happy, and I have
no idea if she was happy,

696
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:06,618
and I know I wasn't happy.

697
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,228
It was all a disaster.

698
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,106
I want you to meet our new attending,
Dr. Marcus Andrews.

699
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,379
Pleasure to meet you.

700
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:38,917
How long have
you been working here?

701
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:41,620
Ms. McDougal?

702
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:42,921
She didn't ask for ID.

703
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:43,989
It's policy.

704
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:45,757
We take a lot
of immigrants here.

705
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,125
She also
didn't look at me.

706
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,594
Check the symptom
I told her I had...

707
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,430
A cut
over the left eye.

708
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:53,399
You heal very nicely,
Ms. McDougal.

709
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:56,001
You hate it here.

710
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,969
"Hate" is a strong word.

711
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,938
What would you do
differently?

712
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:03,609
Give me five things.

713
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:08,179
Diabetes clinical educator,
onsite lab and X-ray,

714
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:10,682
mental health advisor,
multidisciplinary care team,

715
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,183
electronic
medical records.

716
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:14,085
We had the clinic
at the hospital

717
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,922
and had to shut it down
because it was a money pit.

718
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:19,891
Come back as President,
and we'll re-open it.

719
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,231
Your office can be
in the clinic.

720
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,634
Do I have to wear a tie?

721
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:38,577
Hey.

722
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,079
Welcome back.

723
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:43,682
Am I okay?

724
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,283
The surgery
went very well.

725
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,252
We're confident that
we got all of the cancer.

726
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,291
There's a bag
by her side.

727
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,193
Is that just to drain
stuff post-surgery?

728
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,663
There were
complications.

729
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,165
We had to remove
a large portion of your bowel

730
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:02,768
and divert the waste
through a stoma in your skin.

731
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:04,269
That's an ileostomy bag.

732
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,505
How long
will I have that?

733
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:08,940
Forever.

734
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,478
So I have to go
to the bathroom

735
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:13,945
in this thing
for the rest of my life?

736
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,247
Yes.

737
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:19,618
We'll teach you how to change it,
how to dispose of it.

738
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,054
They'll teach both of us.

739
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,135
Now, this is
why we do it, Shaun.

740
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,238
Every date is a disaster.

741
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,207
Every relationship
is out of control.

742
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,678
But if you stick with it,
you wind up with someone

743
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:50,248
in your life who will help you
when you need to be helped,

744
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,885
love you when
you do not feel lovable,

745
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:55,787
be with you
no matter what.

746
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,294
It's not worth it.

747
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,635
Hi, Mom.

748
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:12,804
My son's coming
to town.

749
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,172
Think I'll pick him up
at the airport.

750
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,183
<font color="#ffff00"><i> And when I see</i></font>

751
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:32,991
<font color="#ffff00"><i> And if I walk</i></font>

752
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:40,999
<font color="#ffff00"><i> And when I run away</i></font>

753
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,272
Hi, Grandpa.

754
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:54,212
<font color="#ffff00"><i> And when I run away</i></font>

755
00:41:55,781 --> 00:41:59,384

756
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:03,722

757
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:13,131
<font color="#ffff00"><i> Don't let go</i></font>

758
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:16,702
<font color="#ffff00"><i> And when I see </i></font>

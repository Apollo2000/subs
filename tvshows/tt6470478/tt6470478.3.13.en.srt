1
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,181
Someone had
a good night.

2
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:12,946
Do you think all of these
people have had sex?

3
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:15,061
And if so,
shouldn't they be more happy?

4
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:16,763
Maybe their experiences

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,579
weren't as recent
as yours.

6
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,446
I think about sex
with everyone.

7
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:22,869
But mostly with Carly.

8
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,172
She and I
are very compatible.

9
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,415
That's great, Shaun,
but H.R. might not approve.

10
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:28,977
About me
thinking of sex?

11
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:31,858
No, about saying
you're thinking about sex.

12
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,449
And stop it.

13
00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:36,287
Smiling while talking
to a dying man is not cool.

14
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,405
Dr. Blaize recommended
we speak to you

15
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:39,632
about a permanent port.

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,696
It would simplify
your chemo sessions.

17
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:44,134
No more hunting
for a vein every time.

18
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:48,938
Anything to help
with the nausea?

19
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:51,415
It's a normal
side effect.

20
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,884
Anything you can do
for the... exhaustion?

21
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,001
Anything...

22
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:03,102
So that my muscles
don't ache?

23
00:01:09,017 --> 00:01:12,259
But you can keep me from
being stuck by a needle.

24
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:15,412
They're just trying
to help.

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,547
I know.

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,017
All the doctors
are trying to help.

27
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:25,876
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:27,625
Thank you.

29
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,624
But I-I don't need the port.

30
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:39,415
And I don't need
any more chemo.

31
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:42,657
Of course you do.

32
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:44,481
It's going to give you
more time.

33
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:47,837
Honey, I'm miserable.

34
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,132
Cerebral cavernous
malformations.

35
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,434
Leads to bleeding, clots,
seizures, muscle weakness,

36
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,736
even paralysis.

37
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,671
You have clusters of them.

38
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:05,839
And they're getting worse.

39
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,874
The woman at Hopkins
gave me a year.

40
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,910
Mass General, two years.

41
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,392
So, what, you figured
I'd give you three?

42
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:14,440
Some new treatment?

43
00:02:14,528 --> 00:02:16,843
You know the treatment,
Caroline... A lobectomy.

44
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,619
I love the way surgeons
blithely suggest

45
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,355
cutting through
my cerebral cortex

46
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,290
to remove part of my brain.
Hmm.

47
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:26,760
Why not just take an egg
slicer to my ability to paint?

48
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:30,297
Yes, it will likely lead
to a curtailment

49
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:32,299
of your ability
to be creative,

50
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:35,302
but all of your other
faculties will remain intact.

51
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:46,446
I had a severe prognosis
of my own recently.

52
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:51,745
Surgery, chemo,
radiation, the works.

53
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,622
My greatest fear wasn't at
the edges of the spectrum.

54
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,957
It wasn't life or death.

55
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,425
My greatest fear

56
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,394
was survival
as something lesser.

57
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:01,628
Then you know.

58
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,664
And then I had
a revelation of sorts.

59
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:05,466
Who I am,
how I think of myself

60
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:08,962
isn't defined by
my skill as a surgeon.

61
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,238
Uh, I'm seeing
you as a courtesy.

62
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,439
I don't do this anymore.

63
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,423
And guess what?
I'm fine.

64
00:03:16,308 --> 00:03:17,676
I'm happier.

65
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,596
You could have 20,
30 more years with your family.

66
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:26,024
A balanced life isn't
necessarily a lesser life.

67
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:29,323
I disagree.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,074

69
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,770
Twenty bucks says
Shaun mentions sex

70
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,972
in front of a patient
in the next 24 hours.

71
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,107
He's excited.

72
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,191
I'm sure you were when
a new world opened up.

73
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,344
But he knows better.

74
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:51,712
- Twenty bucks.
- No.

75
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,580
Morgan.

76
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:56,591
Oh, I was hoping
I'd see you.

77
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:57,680
Hello.

78
00:03:58,225 --> 00:03:59,372
Perfect.

79
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,558
I was just wondering where
to get lunch around here.

80
00:04:01,646 --> 00:04:04,480
Any genre,
as long as it's locally sourced.

81
00:04:06,283 --> 00:04:07,589
Is this a friend?

82
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,162
I'm Caroline Reznick.

83
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,264
Oh, hi.

84
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,870
My mother.

85
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,144
What are you doing here?

86
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,511
What beautiful eyes.

87
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:22,125
I hope...

88
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:23,814
S-someone...

89
00:04:24,924 --> 00:04:25,925
P-paint...

90
00:04:26,238 --> 00:04:27,252
Mom!

91
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,597
Mom? Mom.

92
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,083
Mom, can you hear me?

93
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:33,339
Code blue.
We need a crash cart.

94
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:40,192
<font color=#FF00FF>*THE GOOD DOCTOR*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 03  Episode 13</font>

95
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,279
<font color=#FF00FF>*THE GOOD DOCTOR*</font>
Episode Title: <font color=#FFc30f>"Sex and Death"</font>

96
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:51,495
I've come to take you
to lunch.

97
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,262
It's only 11:15.

98
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,364
M-Morgan told me

99
00:04:56,452 --> 00:04:58,495
that it might be
considered unprofessional

100
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,835
to discuss sex on the job.

101
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,070
So, when you say "lunch"...

102
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:04,425
It's sex.

103
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,667
I am expected
to be here working.

104
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,378
People in the Pathology Lab

105
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:12,703
take two 15-minute breaks
on their shift.

106
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,077
If they were combined
into one

107
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:16,570
and we used the bus that
stops out front at 11:25,

108
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:17,925
with one returning
at 12:15,

109
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,588
and we borrowed some
of your lunch hour...

110
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:21,956
You only require 22 minutes
to eat a sandwich...

111
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:23,647
There would be
just enough time

112
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:25,486
to get to your apartment
and back.

113
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:35,853
Have you noticed the time
you've allotted for "lunch"

114
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:37,569
is fairly short?

115
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,355
Long enough.

116
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:44,167
Long enough for you,
not for me.

117
00:05:47,078 --> 00:05:49,159
You've only had sex
once in your life.

118
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,316
No one expects you
to win awards,

119
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:54,191
and it was lovely
sharing the moment.

120
00:05:56,893 --> 00:06:01,691
Are you implying the sex
could be improved on?

121
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:05,396
Yes.

122
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,305
Does that bother you?

123
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,589
No.

124
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:16,353
I have no objection
to improving sex.

125
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,863
Although, I thought it was
already excellent.

126
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,299
I'll work on it.

127
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,991
Found the source
of the bleed.

128
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,597
Suctioning and evacuating
the clot cavity.

129
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:34,739
The Cav Mals
are everywhere.

130
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,931
She could have a massive
bleed at any time.

131
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:40,222
I thought Morgan's
parents were doctors.

132
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,048
I heard that, too.
Why would Morgan let us think...

133
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,851
Maybe
you should save the speculation

134
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:45,619
until your hands aren't
in my mother's skull.

135
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,252
Use your inside voice,
Morgan.

136
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,859
Turn down the volume.

137
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:53,493
Irrigate and remove
the cottonoid.

138
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,649
Why didn't she tell us
she was one of those Reznicks?

139
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,610
Caroline Reznick,
painter.

140
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:12,566
Her son's a sculptor.
Daughter's a composer.

141
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,644
Didn't know she had
another kid.

142
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:16,868
They're famous, if you're
into the arts at all.

143
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:18,739
Mia got you going
to galleries?

144
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:19,728
Yeah,
I'm kind of loving it.

145
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:21,892
I've failed Carly twice.

146
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,729
Did you forget her birthday
or stand her up?

147
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:29,491
Are you talking
about sex?

148
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:34,136
Uh, Morgan says H.R. would
prefer I avoid that word.

149
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:39,761
Just to be clear,
are you saying she...

150
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:44,009
Are you saying
she didn't...

151
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,308
There was no parade.

152
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:51,308
Oh.

153
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:56,157
There was a parade for me,

154
00:07:56,555 --> 00:07:58,524
but there was no parade
for Carly.

155
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,931
I want to give her
a parade.

156
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,628
I'll continue reading.

157
00:08:09,262 --> 00:08:10,870
Wait, Shaun,
reading's a great start,

158
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,259
but Carly's a person.

159
00:08:12,347 --> 00:08:15,107
You need to communicate with
her, ask her what she likes.

160
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:18,165
Yes. I'll make an extensive
list of questions.

161
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:20,540
It's not just about
questions and answers.

162
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,404
Nonverbal communication
is pretty key in this area.

163
00:08:23,492 --> 00:08:25,317
I'm not good with
nonverbal communication.

164
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,507
Watch her reactions.

165
00:08:26,595 --> 00:08:28,096
See what Carly
responds to.

166
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:30,117
You'll figure this out.

167
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,303
Mrs. Reznick,
I'm Dr. Park.

168
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,868
This is Dr. Murphy,
Dr. Browne.

169
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:39,597
- How are you feeling?
- Excellent.

170
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,394
And flattered
that three surgeons

171
00:08:41,482 --> 00:08:43,135
are here to check on me.

172
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,474
They're curious.

173
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,550
About what monster
created me.

174
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:49,963
I'm sure that's not true.

175
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:54,151
Morgan, you're smart and nice
and perfectly normal.

176
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:59,339
I don't think she's
all of those things.

177
00:08:59,468 --> 00:09:00,721
You guys here
to take her vitals,

178
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:01,972
check her
for any deficits,

179
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,176
and maybe let her know

180
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:05,434
that she's just gonna keep
getting worse and die?

181
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:07,993
Your daughter is right,
Mrs. Reznick.

182
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,995
- If you don't...
- Dr. Browne, the day lilies

183
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,652
go so well
with your eyes.

184
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,032
Please take them.

185
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,538
This variety
is from the Himalayas.

186
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:19,206
Please.

187
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:23,475
I really am grateful
to you all.

188
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,289
I'm asking other people
to take over my cases.

189
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:37,044
Check your in-box, and you'll
see the three I've given you.

190
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,680
In your language,
the word "ask"

191
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:41,178
must mean
something different.

192
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,851
You're a caring,
empathetic person,

193
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,435
and my mother is sick.

194
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:51,947
As long as we're having
a moment of honesty,

195
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,128
why do you hate
your family?

196
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,399
You told me your mother
was a cardiologist.

197
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,536
No, you told me my mother
was a cardiologist.

198
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,721
I can't correct
all your mistakes.

199
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,542
Was that the mother
you wanted to have?

200
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,992
Cardiac
perfusionist, call the cath lab.

201
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,131
I used to daydream
my mother was a lawyer.

202
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:18,035
That's just weird.

203
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,488
I'm Oliver.

204
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,376
I have a malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumor,

205
00:10:27,464 --> 00:10:29,483
so I've only got
six months to live.

206
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,064
I'm Dr. Melendez.

207
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,368
What happened
to your foot?

208
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:33,614
Skydiving.

209
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:35,803
First time.

210
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,472
They coached me how to roll,
but it didn't quite work out.

211
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,040
He rented a plane.

212
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,995
A small one.

213
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,293
All the classes were full.
I did not want to wait.

214
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:46,113
You should've come with me.

215
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,426
I'm afraid of heights.

216
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,062
So was I.

217
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,250
Not anymore.

218
00:10:50,338 --> 00:10:51,723
Hmm.

219
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,166
Nothing's broken.
Ice it tonight.

220
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,939
Try to stay off it
for a few days.

221
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,975
I'll give you
12 hours.

222
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,279
Lots to do, so I might
be okay with limping.

223
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:03,997
As long as I'm here,

224
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:06,540
can I get vaccinated
for tropical diseases?

225
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:07,853
Thinking about
moving somewhere

226
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:10,187
the weather will be perfect
for the next six months.

227
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:14,053
The dry season in Costa Rica
is just beginning.

228
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:15,652
Excellent.

229
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,499
I've always wanted
to see Costa Rica.

230
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,381
They have
mantled howler monkeys

231
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:24,852
that make this haunting call
at dawn and dusk.

232
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,630
Wouldn't that be great
to wake up to?

233
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:29,022
Oliver...

234
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,562
Skydiving
doesn't bring happiness.

235
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:36,269
Neither do monkey howls.

236
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,415
You gonna tell a dying guy he
can't do what he wants to do?

237
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,570
No.

238
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:47,857
Get me the shots.

239
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,995
What happened to the patient
who was in here?

240
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,669
She checked herself out.

241
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,617
I knew I had to be
in early,

242
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:13,340
so I tried
not to wake you.

243
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,503
Appreciate it.

244
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:15,569
I've brought you

245
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:17,693
a jelly doughnut and coffee...
Thank you.

246
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:19,785
...to celebrate
last night's breakthrough.

247
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,524
What breakthrough
was that?

248
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,461
Last night.

249
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,073
You had a parade.

250
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,042
During lunch.

251
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:35,502
You made a lot of noise.

252
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,050
One fairly loud noise...
A moan.

253
00:12:38,361 --> 00:12:39,595
Oh.

254
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,312
Right, right.

255
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,349
You had your elbow
on my hair.

256
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,318
I had a great time
last night,

257
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:54,875
and I really appreciate

258
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,727
how much effort you put
into my happiness.

259
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,173
But no parade.

260
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:02,616
Parades
aren't always required.

261
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:04,029
I'll keep working on it.

262
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:13,017
Cassie,
stay in Hong Kong.

263
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,042
It would be ridiculous to miss
the premiere of your symphony

264
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,231
because of
a medical glitch.

265
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:20,579
I have to go.
Your sister's here. Bye.

266
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,770
You're in time
for brunch.

267
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:24,526
I didn't know where
you were staying,

268
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:27,319
if you'd left town,
if you'd gone home.

269
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,476
I finally got your new
housekeeper on the phone

270
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,057
and convinced her
I was your daughter.

271
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,330
She said you
never mentioned me.

272
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:34,597
Oh, Blanca's very forgetful.
Pull up a chair.

273
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:36,028
Your brother's
out getting salmon.

274
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,963
Ariel's here?
He got great news.

275
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:41,321
Million-dollar commission...
A bronze piece on the mall.

276
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,455
I'm thrilled.

277
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:44,204
Can we talk about the fact
that you're dying?

278
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,490
No.

279
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:47,467
I'm having
a good arthritis day.

280
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:49,124
Why shouldn't
I feel happy?

281
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:51,936
You're so lucky you didn't
inherit anything from me.

282
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,381
Morgan.

283
00:13:56,858 --> 00:13:59,306
I thought Mom ditched
the medical police.

284
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,381
Right, the bad guys trying
to keep her alive.

285
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:04,224
We've all tried to get her
to change her mind,

286
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,370
but you know
what she's like.

287
00:14:05,457 --> 00:14:06,358
I'm using
a little sriracha

288
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,649
just to throttle
your taste buds.

289
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:09,142
Thank you.

290
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:12,252
I've been strategizing
with Cassie via e-mail,

291
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,566
trying to figure out a way
to convince Mom...

292
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,768
Did it occur to either of you
to mention any of this

293
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,692
to the only doctor
in the family?

294
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,710
Plenty of doctors
already involved.

295
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:23,889
And you barely consider
yourself part of this family.

296
00:14:24,022 --> 00:14:25,677
You exclude me,
and it's my fault?

297
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,368
Morgan, in high school,
kids kept asking

298
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:30,035
about my parents,
the spies.

299
00:14:30,123 --> 00:14:31,972
And my friend Joel
at Georgetown

300
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,550
said you told people your
parents were in the Peace Corps.

301
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:36,379
And that you
were an only child.

302
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:37,796
I got tired

303
00:14:37,884 --> 00:14:39,592
of fielding questions
about my famous mother.

304
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,982
It doesn't mean...
Only child.

305
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:45,518
You're offended that you weren't
in the family I completely made up?

306
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,326
I got tired of hearing
"Your mother is so talented.

307
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:55,030
"How wonderful
your brother's an artist.

308
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:57,320
"How amazing
Cassie writes music.

309
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,882
"What do you do?"

310
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,116
Mom!

311
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,504
Grab a towel.

312
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,469
It's not just about
what you do physically.

313
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:13,463
It's about setting a scene,
offering inspiration.

314
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:16,850
I mean, do you know
what movies she likes

315
00:15:16,938 --> 00:15:19,688
or what actors
she thinks are sexy?

316
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:24,477
She likes
the Alien movies.

317
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:26,930
Something else?

318
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:29,922
She loves Outlander.

319
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:31,859
That is a good idea.

320
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:33,707
Where the hell is everybody?

321
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,268
Complex partial seizure.

322
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:36,953
Cut her finger off
with an electric knife.

323
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,446
Knuckle's still there,
but we need to get her to an O.R.

324
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,698
Whoa, whoa!
No one touches that but the surgeon.

325
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:47,012
Bloody towels get
thrown out all the time.

326
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,482
I'm not dumpster diving
while cells die.

327
00:15:56,423 --> 00:16:00,093
The last of
the circumferential sutures.

328
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,130
Good capillary
refill in the fingertip.

329
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:09,586
What if this wasn't caused
by the Cav Mals?

330
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,930
First the bleeding,
then the seizure...

331
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,186
Pretty typical progression.

332
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:18,626
It's also possible the
bleeding caused the seizure.

333
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:24,184
Microbleeds can cause gliosis,
and that can cause a seizure.

334
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,153
And if the seizure
was caused by gliosis,

335
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:28,793
we could simply remove that
one bit of damaged tissue.

336
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:31,462
She'd still be terminal,
but...

337
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,605
Shaun is right,
but he's wrong.

338
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,044
Volume!

339
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:39,986
Shaun's idea
could stop the seizures

340
00:16:40,074 --> 00:16:42,264
and let her keep painting
for the time she has left.

341
00:16:42,352 --> 00:16:44,083
That's something
she'll agree to.

342
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,055
Which is why he's wrong.

343
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,151
If she stops having
the seizures,

344
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,425
there's no way she'll have
the lobectomy

345
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:52,713
that will save her life.

346
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:55,795
We don't choose procedures in
order to manipulate patients.

347
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:57,177
No, we choose procedures

348
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,579
based on what will have
the greatest benefit.

349
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,590
Dr. Melendez, I'd like
to excuse myself

350
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:05,287
to speak with
the patient's daughter.

351
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,376
Please.

352
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:13,357
I know not disclosing
a treatment

353
00:17:13,444 --> 00:17:14,711
is borderline unethical,

354
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,116
but when there is a cure that
the patient is ignoring...

355
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,610
You don't want her
to die.

356
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:19,787
Thanks
for the summation.

357
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,501
But have you considered
it might be more than that?

358
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:26,038
This cure, it doesn't come
without a cost.

359
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:27,593
To your mother.

360
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:29,113
But to you...

361
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:33,859
...if your mother loses
her artistic ability,

362
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:36,390
your relationship changes.

363
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,378
If she loses the thing
she lords over you, she...

364
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:43,870
Maybe she'd be nicer.

365
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,852
You hate the way
she looks at you.

366
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,273
But that is who she is.

367
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,331
Let's try it Shaun's way.

368
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,079
Sorry about
this all-nighter,

369
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,701
but sleeplessness

370
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:25,884
will increase the odds
of a seizure event.

371
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:27,975
Which isn't pleasant,
but we need.

372
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:29,436
All this equipment
will tell us

373
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:32,729
if it was caused by the Cav
Mals or by a remote microbleed.

374
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,661
You want me
to put on the TV?

375
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,521
I can find something
suitably irritating.

376
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:40,922
Don't bother.
I'll be staying.

377
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:51,602
"Cavernous malformations
may leak blood,

378
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,334
"leading to brain
hemorrhage, seizures,

379
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:57,249
"loss of sensation,
risk of paralysis..."

380
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,438
If you have to do this,

381
00:18:58,526 --> 00:19:00,962
can't you find some
Harry Potter or something?

382
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:02,909
We can look forward.

383
00:19:03,594 --> 00:19:04,911
Or we can look back.

384
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:07,346
Do you want to discuss what
a lousy mother you were?

385
00:19:08,516 --> 00:19:11,596
Baby, I know
that stress and anger

386
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,286
can increase the chance
of a seizure,

387
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:14,775
and you're
so sweet to try...

388
00:19:14,884 --> 00:19:16,253
Shall we go
chronologically?

389
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,359
First day of preschool,
when you promised to pick me up,

390
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:21,640
but you forgot because
you were showing Ariel

391
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,513
how to underpaint
with raw umber.

392
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,868
You wore a kilt?
How'd it go?

393
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:33,890
We binge-watched
six episodes of Outlander,

394
00:19:33,978 --> 00:19:35,438
she fell asleep
on the sofa,

395
00:19:35,526 --> 00:19:37,362
so I came back
to work.

396
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:39,946
Hi. I'm Oliver.

397
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:41,569
I have six months to live.

398
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,450
Hello, Dr. Murphy.

399
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,196
I'm Dr. Park.

400
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:48,445
I went out.
In a new Ferrari.

401
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:54,696
But when I got home,
I started to feel... dizzy,

402
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:56,378
sick to my stomach.

403
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:58,331
Fainted and hit my head.

404
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:01,751
I think I might have been
poisoned by the fugu fish.

405
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,404
You ate a fish
you knew might kill you.

406
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:06,239
You're emptying
the bank accounts.

407
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:10,092
Only my retirement savings,
which I'm not gonna need.

408
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:12,954
You don't have
fugu poisoning.

409
00:20:13,816 --> 00:20:16,360
I know because you're not
already paralyzed or dead.

410
00:20:17,703 --> 00:20:18,907
Ow.

411
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,315
We'll keep you for observation
and run some tests.

412
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,176
Uh, how long?

413
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,896
We have a room booked
in Costa Rica.

414
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:31,243
Enough.

415
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:36,515
I can't quit my job
and move to the jungle.

416
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,120
Actually, you can.

417
00:20:39,193 --> 00:20:40,970
I won't stay here.

418
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,938
You're gonna leave me?

419
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,847
I've invited you
to come with me.

420
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,317
I want us to see
Costa Rica together.

421
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,624
You're choosing the
howler monkeys over me?

422
00:20:52,712 --> 00:20:54,117
That's where I rank,
behind the monkeys?

423
00:20:54,204 --> 00:20:57,173
Bella, I love you.

424
00:20:58,746 --> 00:21:00,698
I've loved our 20 years
together.

425
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,445
I want to see Costa Rica.

426
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:06,048
I want you
to come with me.

427
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,736
But I'm going either way.

428
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:18,911
Go.

429
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't want to spend whatever
time is left with...

430
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:26,764
Whoever you are now.

431
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,624
I'm happy.

432
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:38,280
I thought I made you happy.

433
00:21:50,283 --> 00:21:53,343
Jumping ahead. The day I won
the regional science fair,

434
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:54,671
beating five
other schools,

435
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,631
including those nerds
from Alston Prep,

436
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,637
do you know what
you said to me?

437
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:03,305
That you were so glad I had
something to fall back on.

438
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:07,660
I'm aware of your feelings
about me as a mother.

439
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,747
I'm aware that our values
are different.

440
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:13,972
It doesn't mean
I don't love you.

441
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,584
I always have.

442
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:21,608
It didn't matter
that you weren't creative.

443
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:31,117
You seriously don't think
there's creativity in what I do?

444
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,903
I think that's something
technical people tell themselves.

445
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:39,192
But it's not
a moral judgment.

446
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:41,261
It's the luck
of the draw.

447
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:42,907
I'm an artist.

448
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,797
You're a...

449
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,733
Hard worker.

450
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:54,015
August 12, 2014...
Times art section.

451
00:22:54,103 --> 00:22:55,134
I don't want to hear it.

452
00:22:55,222 --> 00:22:56,962
"Caroline Reznick's showing
at the Armory

453
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,254
"is a lesson in what happens
when a once-interesting artist

454
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:01,813
"sits too long
on her laurels."

455
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:03,515
That woman hated me
for years.

456
00:23:03,603 --> 00:23:05,400
She was waiting
for an opportunity.

457
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:07,168
"Bad judgment

00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:14,111
I mean, really, how many negative
words can you pile together?

461
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:15,821
And she hasn't even gotten
to that part

462
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:17,509
about that
Modern Madonna piece

463
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,199
that you
were so proud of.

464
00:23:19,287 --> 00:23:21,226
What... Remember what she...
What she called it?

465
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:23,415
What was that?
Put that thing down!

466
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:54,314
I'm sorry.
It's not gliosis.

467
00:23:55,656 --> 00:23:57,440
I went through that
for nothing?

468
00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:00,525
Mom, we eliminated
a possibility.

469
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:02,020
That's not nothing.

470
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,222
It's a day I spent
in this hospital

471
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,062
when I could've been
home working.

472
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,790
How soon
can I be discharged?

473
00:24:12,713 --> 00:24:14,689
You need to rest
for a day.

474
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:18,822
And then we
can say goodbye.

475
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:35,074
If I only had
six months to live,

476
00:24:35,162 --> 00:24:37,751
I would not stop
being a surgeon.

477
00:24:43,164 --> 00:24:44,251
I would.

478
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:46,018
I'd move from spa to spa,

479
00:24:46,108 --> 00:24:48,642
having massages and drinks
with little umbrellas.

480
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:51,993
Then I'd throw a party in the
penthouse of the Four Seasons.

481
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,579
And after everybody left,

482
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,296
I'd go into
the marble bathroom

483
00:24:56,384 --> 00:24:57,835
and painlessly
self-euthanize.

484
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,569
I'd obviously leave
a big tip for housekeeping.

485
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:04,620
You're very like
your mother.

486
00:25:05,914 --> 00:25:08,292
That's not something
I hear a lot.

487
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:10,056
Well, he's right.

488
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,779
You would reign like a queen
over your own death,

489
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:15,269
insisting
on absolute control.

490
00:25:17,003 --> 00:25:19,130
I just meant you each
have a funny way

491
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,904
of picking things up
with both hands sometimes.

492
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:28,112
I don't think this is
anatomically correct.

493
00:25:28,597 --> 00:25:29,829
Hmm.

494
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,347
Hmm.

495
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:50,233
Stereotactic laser ablation.

496
00:25:50,527 --> 00:25:52,898
You worked with one of the people
who developed the technique.

497
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,599
We never used to
call it that.

498
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,322
I never liked that name.

499
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:59,859
Also, it's never been used in
Cerebral Cavernous Malformations.

500
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,173
Not yet.

501
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:03,615
It would allow us
to target the malformations

502
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,032
without needing to slice
all those cerebral fibers

503
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,888
or remove a chunk
of my mother's brain.

504
00:26:07,976 --> 00:26:10,749
It would have to be applied
to each malformation

505
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:12,038
with exact precision.

506
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,841
Okay, so do that.
You can't.

507
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,956
You're gonna make a mistake
on one or two of them.

508
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,245
And then you got
more bleeding, seizures,

509
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:23,037
you got inflamed malformations
growing out of control.

510
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:24,472
You can.

511
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,888
Even if I was still
a neurosurgeon,

512
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,990
which I'm not,
I wouldn't.

513
00:26:31,078 --> 00:26:33,430
You don't get to quit
who you are.

514
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:37,341
How long has it been
since you had your hands

515
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,734
inside the source
of what makes us human?

516
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:45,116
That flow, in surgery,
knowing every move

517
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:48,057
and just feeling
how right it is...

518
00:26:48,388 --> 00:26:50,040
That's peak existence.

519
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:58,134
I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna do the surgery.

520
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:07,177
Are you s...

521
00:27:07,443 --> 00:27:09,950
Are you scared
to pick up a scalpel?

522
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,499
You had months of chemo
and radiation.

523
00:27:14,587 --> 00:27:16,214
Maybe it took its toll.

524
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:20,082
E-Even a 10% drop in
performance would be unbearable.

525
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,788
Why risk finding it out?

526
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,925
Get out.

527
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:42,474
Skydiving?

528
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,643
Fugu?

529
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,431
And apparently a yellow suit.

530
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:47,299
Do you think a deadline
like he has

531
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,769
burns you down
to who you really are?

532
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:53,822
Or does it just make you
nuts and desperate?

533
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,891
Why can't it be both?

534
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,643
Hmm.

535
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,129
Okay, um...

536
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,299
A little house
in the middle of nowhere.

537
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,302
Two chickens.
One dog.

538
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,598
Nobody who expects
anything from me.

539
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,708
Nobody who is even verbal.

540
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:12,859
I'm tired of trying
to fix myself.

541
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:14,583
And I'm tired of being known
as a soft touch.

542
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,685
Not buying it.

543
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:21,512
There's no way
you would get a dog

544
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,770
if you only had
six months to live.

545
00:28:22,857 --> 00:28:24,441
Wouldn't be fair.

546
00:28:25,736 --> 00:28:29,774
Okay, then I would foster
a series of rescue dogs.

547
00:28:29,997 --> 00:28:32,112
You said you're tired
of being a soft touch,

548
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,430
and yet your fantasy
involves helping.

549
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,349
We are who we are.

550
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:09,916
It's called stereotactic
laser ablation.

551
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:11,600
Never liked the name.

552
00:29:24,177 --> 00:29:27,111
He said it's minimally
invasive, and if it works,

553
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,716
it would save my life

554
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,136
and allow me
to continue painting.

555
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:35,153
If I win,
I win everything.

556
00:29:36,377 --> 00:29:38,112
And if I lose, it's over.

557
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:41,245
When you first came to see Dr. Glassman,
he didn't offer this option.

558
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:42,540
Why not?

559
00:29:43,411 --> 00:29:45,874
Stereotactic laser ablation
is a new technique,

560
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:48,621
and it's never been used
on a Cav Mal patient.

561
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:50,405
So, he just
didn't think of it?

562
00:29:50,493 --> 00:29:52,556
But then it came to him?

563
00:29:55,248 --> 00:29:56,819
It was my idea.

564
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,975
Dr. Glassman
didn't sugarcoat the risks.

565
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:07,280
This is the last chance
you've got to keep your art.

566
00:30:08,483 --> 00:30:11,122
I'm not going to complete
my work if I'm dead.

567
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:15,535
No.

568
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,567
But thank you so much
for trying.

569
00:30:28,758 --> 00:30:30,894
Why didn't you
back me up?

570
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:33,747
I didn't know you were gonna
throw this crapshoot at us.

571
00:30:34,286 --> 00:30:36,093
Do you even listen
to what she's been saying?

572
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:37,671
She wants
to finish her work.

573
00:30:37,788 --> 00:30:39,672
She could live
another 40 years,

574
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,440
and her art
would grow with her.

575
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:43,356
Don't pretend those words
mean anything to you.

576
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,077
You don't give a damn
about art.

577
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:47,020
Her family
could grow with her...

578
00:30:47,108 --> 00:30:49,811
Her children,
her grandchildren.

579
00:30:50,008 --> 00:30:53,124
You and her don't give a damn
about anything except for art.

580
00:30:54,454 --> 00:30:57,116
You need to listen to me
and do what I tell you.

581
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,429
This is why
we didn't call you.

582
00:31:12,077 --> 00:31:13,387
The competition
in that family

583
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:14,755
must have been
like a buzz saw.

584
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,322
- Okay.
- Please.

585
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,571
It's perfectly reasonable to
get out of a game you can't win.

586
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:31,457
You did everything right...

587
00:31:31,545 --> 00:31:34,193
Moved 3,000 miles,
found your own calling,

588
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:36,574
a career people respect
and value.

589
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:39,736
Actually, there's a good comparative
measure for how people value things.

590
00:31:39,824 --> 00:31:41,010
We call it money.

591
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:43,057
And my brother's already
a million dollars ahead.

592
00:31:43,145 --> 00:31:45,548
See how you went straight
to your brother?

593
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:48,757
Did you ever think he might be
tired of being your competitor?

594
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,542
He won a long time ago.

595
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,666
That's why I left that
dysfunctional world behind.

596
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,193
Really?

597
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:57,237
Because it seems to me you re-created
the competition you grew up with

598
00:31:57,377 --> 00:31:58,834
the very first day
you got here.

599
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:06,509
Shingles?
Like, from chicken pox?

600
00:32:07,088 --> 00:32:08,206
The virus was dormant,

601
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,229
then your chemo suppressed
your immune system,

602
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,880
and the virus woke up.

603
00:32:12,072 --> 00:32:13,532
It can be painful,

604
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,369
but the treatment
is very simple.

605
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:19,085
Do you want us
to call your wife?

606
00:32:20,596 --> 00:32:23,375
No, thank you.

607
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:27,496
Just fix me up and
release me into the wild.

608
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:29,898
Back to the bucket list.

609
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:32,869
She was right.

610
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,888
I'm not the same person.

611
00:32:35,976 --> 00:32:38,536
I'm doing what we all
should be doing.

612
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,559
We all want to cut loose,

613
00:32:40,696 --> 00:32:42,273
but we're
just too practical.

614
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:43,996
If this had not happened,

615
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:48,237
I might've lived to be 90,
never looking up.

616
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,330
Dr. Murphy,
what do you want to do

617
00:32:52,424 --> 00:32:54,353
that you just haven't done yet?
What makes you happy?

618
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,725
I want to give Carly...
Shaun.

619
00:32:58,838 --> 00:32:59,839
Oh.

620
00:33:02,572 --> 00:33:04,491
I like a crisp apple.

621
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:08,537
The way the sunlight
hits my bedsheets

622
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:11,194
in the morning
in a perfect square.

623
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:14,111
I like the movement
of wind in leaves.

624
00:33:14,873 --> 00:33:17,666
And the way the
circumference of a circle

625
00:33:17,754 --> 00:33:20,658
is always equal to pi
times the diameter,

626
00:33:20,821 --> 00:33:22,728
no matter what numbers
you put in.

627
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:26,689
You like the happiness
of small things.

628
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,221
Yes.

629
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,255
Your happiness
is too loud.

630
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,600
Shake your head again.

631
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:43,467
Didn't he have
a muscle issue?

632
00:33:43,562 --> 00:33:45,197
His range of motion
seems good.

633
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:49,627
All the better for zip-lining
in Costa Rica, right?

634
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:52,398
Not right.

635
00:33:54,184 --> 00:33:55,955
We need more tests.

636
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:07,830
I'm sorry.

637
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:11,486
I know we want
the same things.

638
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,664
I'd like
to show you something.

639
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:25,313
Neurons that
fire together wire together.

640
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:29,401
One neuron goes off,
exciting the next,

641
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:31,358
creating a pathway
in the brain

642
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:32,804
that wasn't
there before.

643
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,907
Every time Mom
takes a brushstroke,

644
00:34:34,995 --> 00:34:36,831
every time
you use a chisel.

645
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:40,712
It's like we're creating
ourselves in the choices we make.

646
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:43,031
We are creating this.

647
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,119
It's beautiful.

648
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,137
We target
each malformation

649
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:54,660
with a thermal laser probe.

650
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:56,566
Just the malformation.

651
00:34:57,633 --> 00:35:00,502
The trajectory
has to be perfect.

652
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:03,151
You can't
paint over it.

653
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,189
You could show this
to Mom.

654
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,618
But from you,
she'll accept it.

655
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,562
Inserting the laser
probe into the cooling catheter.

656
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,717
Locked and loaded.
Ready to fire.

657
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:38,344
Dr. Glassman,

658
00:35:38,432 --> 00:35:40,172
are you sure
of this location?

659
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:41,707
It seems significantly far

660
00:35:41,795 --> 00:35:43,847
from what we saw
on her pre-surgical MRIs.

661
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:49,148
You know what the brain and
breakfast cereal have in common?

662
00:35:49,236 --> 00:35:51,921
Contents tend to shift
during transport.

663
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,403
Yes, I'm quite sure.

664
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,072
First ablation complete.

665
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,106
Now we just have to do it
perfectly nine more times.

666
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,037
It's gone?

667
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,826
Well, not quite.
But close.

668
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:36,590
The recent infections
got into the tumor.

669
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:39,814
Which allowed your
immune system to find it.

670
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,531
But they said it was
an aggressive cancer.

671
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:45,062
What makes
a cancer aggressive

672
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,706
is its ability to evade
the immune system.

673
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:49,424
That's no longer true
about yours.

674
00:37:00,138 --> 00:37:04,619
The tumor has become small
enough to remove surgically.

675
00:37:04,742 --> 00:37:07,593
We can make an appointment
to do that in a few days,

676
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:09,773
once the infection has
fully cleared your system.

677
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:13,135
Meanwhile,
you can go home.

678
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,666
Congratulations.

679
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:21,039
Home?

680
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:27,778
How do you feel?

681
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,394
Tired.

682
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,066
Of being in this place.

683
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,051
Reasonable answer.

684
00:37:33,141 --> 00:37:35,126
Do you feel
your creativity's impaired?

685
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:44,978
Isn't that the graphic
you use to sign your paintings?

686
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,166
Thank you
for knowing that.

687
00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:49,807
Ariel was afraid
you'd feel vandalized.

688
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:53,352
Ah, don't be silly.
We'll auction off the door.

689
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:01,828
Mom, you've thanked
your doctors,

690
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,665
but you haven't said
anything to Morgan.

691
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:07,079
You know, getting out
of this mess intact,

692
00:38:07,427 --> 00:38:08,697
that's down to her.

693
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,135
Oh, yes, I know.

694
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:16,411
I owe you everything.

695
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:24,455
Thank you...

696
00:38:24,656 --> 00:38:26,475
For saving my life.

697
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:30,924
You're welcome.

698
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:43,695
Our little plodder
came through.

699
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,791
Not everybody
gets a parade.

700
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,580
Maybe Carly
doesn't have them.

701
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:59,838
Maybe I haven't
practiced enough.

702
00:39:00,092 --> 00:39:02,219
I've worked on
my surgical technique

703
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:03,541
for hundreds of hours.

704
00:39:03,629 --> 00:39:06,642
You can't just take the pizza
out of the freezer and dig in.

705
00:39:08,153 --> 00:39:10,205
You have to put it
in the microwave first.

706
00:39:12,577 --> 00:39:14,252
Actually, Dr. Lim,

707
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:17,272
a toaster oven
is better for the crust.

708
00:39:18,324 --> 00:39:20,910
She's not talking
about pizza, Shaun.

709
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,377
Mm.

710
00:39:23,465 --> 00:39:25,455
Men your age
run out of patience.

711
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:29,799
They turn off the microwave
before that pizza's ready.

712
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:36,439
You want to give
a parade, Shaun?

713
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,289
Yes.

714
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,845
You want to give
a great parade?

715
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:42,297
Are there differences
in parades?

716
00:39:44,096 --> 00:39:47,267
Some have balloons
and marching bands.

717
00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:50,635
Other parades
are sparsely attended.

718
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:54,805
I want Carly to have
the best parade possible.

719
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,736
I know you do.

720
00:39:56,954 --> 00:39:59,385
Just as you want to be
the best surgeon possible.

721
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:03,117
When you're in the O.R.,
you commit totally.

722
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:06,037
You persevere.
Everything else falls away.

723
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:08,912
You focus entirely
on what you're doing.

724
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,059
That's your superpower.

725
00:40:14,806 --> 00:40:17,227
Now I want you
to take Carly home

726
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,884
and work that parade route

727
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,814
and don't stop until
the band begins playing.

728
00:40:25,054 --> 00:40:27,106
And then go 3% longer.

729
00:40:32,234 --> 00:40:33,603
I will.

730
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,791
See you tomorrow.

731
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:52,818
All that focus.

732
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:55,149
Strangely intriguing.

733
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:11,213
If I only had
six months to live,

734
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:14,037
I wouldn't want to be
anywhere but where I am.

1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,738
Wes Keeler, 49,

2
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:07,341
pricked in the upper right arm
by a cactus four days ago.

3
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:08,942
Temp 102.5.

4
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,579
Wound is seriously infected.

5
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,457
He was leading
a camping trip on Mount Thayer.

6
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:15,116
We couldn't leave 'em
up there alone.

7
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,218
BP's 86/51. Tachycardic.

8
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,386
Rapid, shallow breathing.

9
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:19,787
Signs of sepsis.

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,930
You gonna have to
cut his arm off?

11
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,056
I'll be fine!

12
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,824
We need to debride
the wound stat!

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,074

14
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:36,937
Shaun, I've been
looking all over for you.

15
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,807
Hey, uh, h-how about getting
some breakfast? Some pancakes?

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,375
No. I'm not hungry.

17
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:42,843
Okay.

18
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,313
Um,
how about coming over for dinner tonight?

19
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:46,980
Is Debbie making lasagne?

20
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:48,082
She could.

21
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:49,850
No, thank you.

22
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,519
Okay, Shaun.

23
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,387
Um, can we just stop and...

24
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:55,656
And talk for just a minute?

25
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:00,328
Why are... Aren't you, uh,
responding to my texts?

26
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,529
Are you upset?

27
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,264
Are you sad because
of Lea? Yes. Yes.

28
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,833
I am very sad.

29
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,401
But it will be okay.

30
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,104
Yeah, of course it'll be okay.

31
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:12,206
I'm still going to be with Lea.

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,274
Wait. What?

33
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,744
She said she loves me.

34
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,546
She also gave you
a hundred reasons

35
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,257
why she can't be with you,
Shaun. Yes. Yes.

36
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,216
She gave me
very specific reasons

37
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,684
why we can't be together,

38
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,919
but I've overcome
other challenges...

39
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,265
No, Shaun, it's not... to become
a good doctor, a good friend.

40
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,824
It's not about
overcoming challenges.

41
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,226
It's not about you.

42
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,627
It's about Lea.

43
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,434
I can't take two steps
without falling down.

44
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:41,745
Is the issue
balance or weakness?

45
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:42,836
All of the above.

46
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,105
Fatigue, dizziness,
light-headedness, headaches,

47
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,540
occasional bouts of nausea.

48
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:47,708
And when d...

49
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:50,311
Five years ago, just after
the birth of my daughter.

50
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,655
And there's
no discernible fluctuation

51
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,647
based on time of day
or time of the month.

52
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:56,116
Temp 98.2. BP 111/78.

53
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,119
That'll drop to 80/50
when I'm upright.

54
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:01,222
I don't drink, smoke,
or take drugs.

55
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:02,856
I haven't traveled
outside of the country

56
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,091
in the last ten years.

57
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,204
And there's no family history
of a similar condition.

58
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,829
You've been through this before.

59
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,799
Seventeen times. Eighteen if
you count the naturopath in Seattle.

60
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,301
Which I don't.

61
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,069
No one has been able
to give me a diagnosis.

62
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:20,040
We need to do an EKG
and stress test,

63
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,443
get a CT of your chest,
abdomen, and pelvis.

64
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,911
Let me save you some time.

65
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:27,781
Five years' worth of tests,
labs, scans, reports...

66
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:30,851
My entire medical odyssey.

67
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:34,655
Fun.

68
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,771
Set up in the lounge

69
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,015
and get me copies
of each of those...

70
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,374
Claire!

71
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,809
Dash. Oh, my God!

72
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:56,944
Why are you here?

73
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,712
Uh, you changed your number.

74
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:01,114
Right. Um, it's a long story.

75
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:04,318
Uh, Dash, you remember
Dr. Melendez, Dr. Murphy?

76
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:05,386
Yeah, of course.

77
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,788
Uh, you gave my wife
six more good months.

78
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:11,091
We considered
renaming our cat after you.

79
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,994
That would have been foolish.
Cats remember their names.

80
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,665
Sorry for your loss.
Wish we could've done more.

81
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,733
Let you two catch up.

82
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,573
Hi.

83
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,648
I think the
infection spread quickly

84
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:36,960
because of the underlying
damage to your liver and kidney.

85
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:39,162
We'll need to keep you on a
prolonged course of IV antibiotics.

86
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,988
Hey, you hear that, guys?

87
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:44,558
Hep C and heroin aren't
as much fun as they sound.

88
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,035
Although one was more fun
than the other...

89
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,127
For a while.

90
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,129
Don't they have
somewhere else to go?

91
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,731
Not likely.

92
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:54,234
Most of them haven't seen their
parents in years, so they're with me...

93
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,770
Survivalist training program
for at-risk youth.

94
00:03:56,804 --> 00:04:00,674
We prefer "young adults
with unrealized potential."

95
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,786
I'm supposed to be teaching
these yahoos responsibility

96
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,380
and good decision-making.

97
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,383
Hell of an example.

98
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,920
Oof.

99
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,724
He's got a new murmur.

100
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,258
BP's dropping.

101
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,932
Wes,
we need to take a look at your heart.

102
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,033
Wes, the infection's spread.

103
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,635
It's damaged your aortic valve.

104
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,870
You need emergency surgery.

105
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,586
Mm... What about vasculitis?

106
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,887
Or dysautonomia?

107
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,423
Both are consistent
with weakness and fatigue.

108
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:51,000
Her temporal artery biopsy
was negative.

109
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,926
That rules out vasculitis. Mm.

110
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,429
And I thought I saw something
about dysautonomia in here.

111
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:58,231
There are 15 different causes
of dysautonomia.

112
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,600
Seven have been ruled out.

113
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,135
The rest are inconsistent
with Alice's symptoms

114
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,472
or have no definitive
diagnostic test.

115
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,740
How did you make Dr. Lim
fall in love with you

116
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,609
after you had been friends
for so long?

117
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,216
I assume that's directed at you.

118
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,855
I don't think you make anyone

119
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,256
fall in love with you, Shaun.

120
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,225
It unfolds naturally over time.

121
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,028
That's not true.

122
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,564
Everyone starts off
not loving you.

123
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:33,033
Then you say and do things
that make them love you.

124
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,068
Or not. That's the
point of romance.

125
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:36,937
But romance is harder

126
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,807
if you're already friends
with the person.

127
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,611
You can't hide the less
attractive parts of yourself.

128
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,979
It can be an advantage.

129
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,615
You already know
what pisses them off.

130
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,985
That's very true.

131
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,625
Shaun...

132
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,494
Did Carly tell you she
just wants to be friends?

133
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,898
Or are you talking about
someone else?

134
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,638
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

135
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,205
I'm... I'm looking
for my dad. Mm.

136
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,083
I just... I'm here visiting,
and I locked mys... Yes. Okay.

137
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,809
Dr. Park is not here,

138
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,745
and we're discussing
something important.

139
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,747
Right. Sorry.

140
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,516
Kellan, your dad's in surgery.

141
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,717
It could be a couple hours.

142
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:25,753
Thanks.

143
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,524
Shaun.

144
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,725
That was a little harsh.

145
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,902
We're talking
about your love life.

146
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:36,497
Talking about
my love life is important.

147
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,065
It helps clear my head

148
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,767
so I can focus on the medicine.

149
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,273
Intracranial hypotension.

150
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:51,211
It is consistent
with Alice's headaches

151
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,714
and dizziness getting worse
when she's upright.

152
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,183
And a leak in spinal fluid
can be triggered

153
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,418
by severe intracranial
pressure during childbirth.

154
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,753
To confirm I'm right,

155
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:02,255
we need to insert a lumbar
drain into Alice's spine,

156
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,526
infuse her with fluid,
and see if her symptoms improve.

157
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,594
But if you're wrong,

158
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,962
she'll have an
excruciating headache,

159
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,499
massive brain pressure,
temporary vision loss...

160
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,866
She'll give her consent.

161
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,669
It's a reasonable diagnosis,

162
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:18,706
and the patient's desperate
for an answer.

163
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:29,116
Can you do the procedure alone?

164
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:32,252
Only one doctor is needed
to insert a lumbar drain,

165
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,188
and I have a time-sensitive
matter to take care of.

166
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,058
Sure.

167
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,466
You okay? You look okay.

168
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,801
I'm fine.

169
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,638
Your text said
it was urgent, a...

170
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,906
My text said it was
"time sensitive."

171
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,307
I have to get back to work

172
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,810
before my lunch break is over.

173
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,278
I was at work, too, Shaun.

174
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,550
I know we left things
in a weird place,

175
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,952
but now is not a good time.

176
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,792
The pinto beans
are next to the tomatoes.

177
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,129
That is not
in alphabetical order.

178
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,368
There's more.

179
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,338
The toilet paper
is in the wrong direction.

180
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,774
The way you like it.

181
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,511
You got angry
when we were roommates

182
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,013
because I sometimes
couldn't accept

183
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,015
your way of doing things.

184
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,652
But I can learn to accept things

185
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,021
I'm not comfortable with.

186
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,857
This is not bothering me at all.

187
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,197
I can deal with your messiness

188
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,532
and neediness

189
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,067
and selfishness...

190
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,202
Stop.

191
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,971
Your way of proving

192
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:01,308
that you're flexible
and attentive to my needs

193
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,176
is to pull me away from work

194
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,411
with no notice,

195
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:07,080
make me drive
all the way across town,

196
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:10,550
just so you can show me you
un-alphabetized your beans?

197
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:15,088
Doesn't that seem a little...

198
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,824
Inconsistent?

199
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,594
Oh.

200
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,898
That is a good point.

201
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,734
I should have waited
until evening,

202
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,703
when you are done with work.

203
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,071
We can discuss this later.

204
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,840
I have to get back
to the hospital.

205
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:41,581
Resecting
necrotic tissue around the annulus.

206
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,884
Dr. Reznick,
trim down the patch from the pericardium.

207
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:50,290
The infection caused a fistula,

208
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,458
and we need to remove it.

209
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,794
Repair the annular defect
with a pericardial patch.

210
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,582
He's gonna have
permanent heart damage.

211
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,935
The guy survives IV drugs,
Hep C, hard time

212
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,937
and gets taken down
by a cactus spike

213
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,106
on his road to redemption.

214
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,941
That's... ironic.

215
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,076
Predictable.

216
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,577
He ignored dangerous symptoms

217
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,246
because he wanted to be
a tough guy for those kids.

218
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,191
He's trying to keep them
from repeating his mistakes.

219
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,316
It's admirable.

220
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,085
Narcissistic waste of time.

221
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,287
You can't undo
a lifetime of abandonment

222
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,189
with a couple weeks
in the woods.

223
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,858
The kids are all still here,
aren't they?

224
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:26,426
Finish the closure
of the fistula tract

225
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,961
with pledgeted sutures.

226
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,298
Park.

227
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:32,599
I need you to come with me.

228
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,667
Now?

229
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:35,102
Go. We got this.

230
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,079
Security agreed to let us
keep this between us.

231
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,248
No need to call the cops.

232
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:55,889
Everyone needs to chill.

233
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:58,658
We weren't cooking meth
in the dumpster.

234
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:01,494
You have any idea how many
people die from vaping pot?

235
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:02,996
What were you thinking?

236
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,135
We'll give you two some space.

237
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,737
You. With me.

238
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,014
You have asthma, Kellan.

239
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,916
I know you're not this stupid.

240
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,494
Heart rate's tachy at 148.
Systolic's in the 200s.

241
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,396
I removed the drain
a half-hour ago.

242
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,299
I was wrong.
My idea made things worse.

243
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,510
We need to do a lumbar
puncture to relieve the built-up fluid.

244
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,936
But it didn't make her worse

245
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,313
the way it should have
made her worse.

246
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,573
She should have a headache
or upward brain herniation.

247
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,008
Heart rate should be low.

248
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,311
Something is causing her heart
to beat too hard, too fast.

249
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,046
Mm. I missed something...

250
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,281
Shaun, you need to give her

251
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,759
a 10-milligram bolus
of labetalol now,

252
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:57,484
or she is going to die.

253
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:58,819
I missed something.

254
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,053
Shaun!

255
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,757
Mommy?

256
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,192
Alice?

257
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:13,066
There was significant tissue
damage from the infection,

258
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,135
but it should be manageable
with medication

259
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,870
and some modifications
to your diet.

260
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,842
So... no more
Flamin' Hot Cheetos?

261
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,344
That's not a thing any
self-respecting adult should eat.

262
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,248
You'll need long-term
follow-up with a cardiologist,

263
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,250
beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors...

264
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,087
What'd you do?

265
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,759
Mr. Reed was found vaping THC
on hospital grounds.

266
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,395
I'm emancipated,
so I'm basically an adult.

267
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,873
You're only emancipated

268
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:47,400
'cause your parents do even
dumber stuff than you do.

269
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,036
Thanks for letting me know.

270
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,504
There'll be consequences
for his behavior.

271
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,173
Starting with an apology.

272
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,808
And not some smartass one,
either.

273
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:57,544
Uh, Mr. Keeler,
your hand is swollen.

274
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:58,937
I need to take a look
at your feet.

275
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,581
Less than a hundred milliliters.

276
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,816
What's wrong with his piss?

277
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,984
Max.

278
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,418
What's going on?

279
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,620
We're gonna need to run
some additional tests.

280
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,757
We've done a lumbar puncture
to remove the excess fluid

281
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,535
and bring your spinal pressure
back to normal.

282
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,261
When will she be able
to go home?

283
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,829
I'm not going home.

284
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,135
Honey, their test
just about killed you.

285
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,271
In front of your daughter.

286
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,473
She wasn't supposed to be here.

287
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,746
That's because you told me
you were visiting your sister.

288
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,013
Since when do we lie to each other,
Alice?

289
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,954
You have to stop
doing this to yourself.

290
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,755
They're only gonna confirm
the same diagnosis

291
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,257
you've already been given.

292
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,794
You said you don't
have a diagnosis.

293
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,034
They told her she has
idiopathic dysautonomia

294
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,869
six months ago.

295
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:58,305
It was confirmed
by two other doctors.

296
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,648
You left it out
of your medical records?

297
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,674
"Idiopathic" is just
a doctor's fancy way

298
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,719
of saying that they don't know
why I'm sick or how to fix it.

299
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,946
You haven't given
the treatments a chance.

300
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:09,249
Because even on them,
I can barely sit up most of the time.

301
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,853
Ruby deserves a mother

302
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,156
who can teach her
how to do a cartwheel...

303
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,893
and scoop her up when
she's having a nightmare.

304
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,528
She deserves a mother
who's around.

305
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,971
Ruby...

306
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,708
doesn't need to learn
how to do a cartwheel.

307
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,478
She needs you to watch her,
cheer her on.

308
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:42,082
And lay down next to her
when she's scared.

309
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,352
And eat the cookies she bakes
and pretend to be enjoying them.

310
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,190
You're a great mother.

311
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,892
And...

312
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:56,229
There's good
in the life we have.

313
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,330
And you're missing it

314
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:00,767
by constantly searching
for something better.

315
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,202
Something that may not exist.

316
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,146
Are you feeling overheated?

317
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:15,782
No.

318
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:19,686
Scared?

319
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,532
No, I'm feeling sad that my
husband thinks there's no hope.

320
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:24,591
You are sweating.

321
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,727
Sweat is a response
to fear, not sadness.

322
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,431
Your temperature is normal.

323
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,103
You may have an adrenal tumor.

324
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,938
Is that good? Yes.

325
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,473
Tumors can be removed.

326
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,754
I'm not mad.

327
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,124
I'm a little mad.

328
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,326
But I want to understand
what's going on.

329
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,727
Dad, not now.

330
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,729
I mean, it's not like you
to be this reckless

331
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,631
with your health, your future.

332
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,100
I can't...

333
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,070
Kel, are you having
an asthma attack?

334
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,171
Where's your inhaler?

335
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,572
I don't... It's...

336
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,007
It's not the asthma.

337
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,108
What is it?

338
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,011
Tell me what you're feeling.

339
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,846
My heart's... Beating fast.

340
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,350
Do you feel dizzy?

341
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:26,019
Like the walls are closing in?

342
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,587
I think you're having
a panic attack.

343
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,622
Take a deep breath.

344
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,625
One, two, three...

345
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,694
Now out.

346
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,597
Keep breathing.

347
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,204
Good.

348
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,708
Does this happen a lot?

349
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:57,284
I know vaping is stupid, but...

350
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,789
It helps this feeling go away.

351
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,832
Hey, give it back, asshat!

352
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,966
Victor, Max!

353
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,302
Cut it out.

354
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,869
Mr. Keeler.

355
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,838
We have some test results
we need to discuss.

356
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,307
In private.

357
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,509
Whatever you have to say to him,
you can say to us.

358
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,776
Oh, wish you could.

359
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,012
Would love your input.

360
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,681
But, clearly,
you're far too busy watching...

361
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:29,916
Pimple-popping videos.

362
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,186
Go away.

363
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,533
The damage to your heart

364
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,102
temporarily cut off blood
flow to your kidneys.

365
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,771
They were already weak
and couldn't handle the stress.

366
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,375
You've progressed
to complete renal failure.

367
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,177
I'm sorry.

368
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,587
You'll need a transplant.

369
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,581
But dialysis can keep you going
until a matching donor is found.

370
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:07,053
I'm guessing
a guy with a bad heart

371
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,423
and damaged liver,
history of hepatitis

372
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,024
isn't first up.

373
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,863
Your best bet is to
find a living donor,

374
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,465
most likely, a family member.

375
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,569
I'm an addict...

376
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:27,174
Who stole and lied like one
and then went to prison.

377
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,276
My Christmas card list
is pretty short.

378
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:33,922
We'll connect
you with our transplant coordinator.

379
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,848
She'll help you
reach out to family

380
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,917
and answer any
questions they may have.

381
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,356
Should've taken those twerps
sailing.

382
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,135
Her husband's not wrong, Shaun.

383
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,405
Sometimes, people need to accept

384
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,115
that things are
as good as they're gonna get

385
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,441
and make peace with it.

386
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,278
Wanting more can only lead

387
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,514
to disappointment
and heartbreak.

388
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,087
What good does it do to give up

389
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,490
if you're already heartbroken?

390
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:25,965
Hmm.

391
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,867
You were right. No tumor.

392
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,005
Well, you were also right.

393
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:36,676
The bright color.

394
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,945
It means there is
an increase in the uptake

395
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,381
of radioactive material
in the medullary space.

396
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,351
Which is enlarged
and overproducing adrenaline,

397
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,686
so the gland itself
is acting like a tumor.

398
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,523
We have a new diagnosis.

399
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,900
The quiet
is a nice change of pace.

400
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,404
I told the boys to get some air,

401
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,607
try to avoid committing more
criminal offenses on hospital grounds.

402
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,111
I know they can be
annoying and loud

403
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,580
and constantly in the way,

404
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:16,115
but I can't make them leave.

405
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,417
Want me to give it a shot?

406
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,852
I'd like to see that, actually.

407
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,290
Nah, they just scared.

408
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:26,493
They think if they
leave, then...

409
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,495
I'll be the latest
in a long line of people

410
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,263
they didn't have a chance
to say goodbye to.

411
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,534
Wes?

412
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:36,836
Code blue!

413
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,080
You do not have
idiopathic dysautonomia.

414
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,316
You have a rare condition

415
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:52,151
called bilateral adrenal
medullary hyperplasia.

416
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,087
Unfortunately, Alice,
there's only one cure for this condition,

417
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,324
and that's to remove
your adrenal glands.

418
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,101
You would need to be on
steroid replacement therapy

419
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,192
for the rest of your life.

420
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,161
And that comes with a
whole new set of symptoms.

421
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,196
Fragile bones,
high blood pressure,

422
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,265
G.I. issues, mood disorders,

423
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,801
increased chance of diabetes,
serious infections.

424
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,372
I-I understand. I want to do it.

425
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:16,208
Medullary hyperplasia is
not terminal or progressive.

426
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:18,645
You could have
a normal life expectancy

427
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:19,946
in your current condition.

428
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,181
My "current condition"
is pathetic.

429
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,450
I'm having the surgery.

430
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,751
Alice.

431
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,586
This could kill you.

432
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,991
I love you.

433
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,860
I won't risk your life.

434
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:39,231
If you insist on
going through with this...

435
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:44,270
Ruby and I are leaving.

436
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:54,747
If you love her,
you shouldn't leave her.

437
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,949
It's not her fault she's sick.

438
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,318
And she just wants
to make things better.

439
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:01,020
- It isn't fair.
- Shaun.

440
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,790
There is nothing worse than
losing the person you love.

441
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:07,794
I'm sorry.
This isn't Dr. Murphy's call.

442
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,496
Nor is it mine.

443
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,631
We'll give you two some time.

444
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,870
He's right.

445
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,009
I-I can't lose you and Ruby.

446
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,044
I won't do it. I won't...
I won't do the surgery.

447
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,825
Wes suffered
major cardiac damage.

448
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,593
We can't solve one
problem with this guy

449
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:41,861
before the next one hits.

450
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:44,631
He's stable now,
but his heart can't handle

451
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:46,733
the fluid volume shifts
of standard dialysis.

452
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,811
So the only thing keeping
him alive will also kill him.

453
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:50,603
We could put him
on low-flow dialysis.

454
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:52,204
Keep him in the ICU
'round the clock.

455
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,706
That'll buy him a little time.

456
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,608
Very little.

457
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:57,610
Call UNOS. See if
they'll move him up the list.

458
00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:58,921
Where are we
with family members?

459
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,813
Two of Wes' cousins
agreed to be tested.

460
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:02,515
We're waiting on
the results. Good.

461
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,384
Get on the phone with
any other family you can find.

462
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:07,830
Tell them if their man doesn't get
a kidney in the next couple days,

463
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:10,490
they should make arrangements
to say their goodbyes.

464
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,305
New kicks won't help
you outrun me.

465
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,743
Um, they're recipes.

466
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:31,844
From Dash.

467
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,113
Well, from Kayla.

468
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,915
Kayla by way of Dash.

469
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,116
It's complicated.

470
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:43,456
He asked me on a date.

471
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:53,600
What did you say?

472
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:56,102
Nothing. I stammered,
and then I fled.

473
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,710
What did you want to say?

474
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:06,312
Ohh. I don't know.

475
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:11,350
Shaun was right.

476
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,354
Coming home to an empty
apartment really sucks.

477
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:20,993
I...

478
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:23,730
Used men to make me feel better.

479
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,798
Most of them didn't mind.

480
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,734
But...

481
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:30,402
I...

482
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:34,106
Don't trust myself not to hurt
someone I care about.

483
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,913
Claire, it's not
that complicated.

484
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:45,151
You lit up this morning
when you saw him.

485
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,655
He seems to make you happy.

486
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,293
You deserve to be happy.

487
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,381
Mmm.

488
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,018
How you feeling?

489
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,689
I'm not high,
if that's what you're asking.

490
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,090
It's not.

491
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:29,495
You know, earlier in the car,

492
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,230
I pushed too hard,

493
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,400
made you feel cornered.

494
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:35,668
I'm sorry.

495
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:38,504
You didn't know.

496
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,343
I, uh...

497
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,012
I talked to your mom.

498
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,015
Is she totally freaking out?

499
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,182
She's concerned.

500
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:54,520
And we talked about
finding a therapist in Phoenix

501
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,090
who specializes
in treating anxiety.

502
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:02,328
So you're pawning me off
on a total stranger?

503
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,896
No. No. I...

504
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,801
I thought you'd be
more comfortable

505
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:10,269
talking to someone who's not...

506
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,140
She said you've been
pretty withdrawn lately.

507
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:23,549
I know things between
your mom and I are a little...

508
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,751
Screwed up?

509
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:28,788
Unsettled.

510
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,558
Is that making you feel anxious?

511
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,727
No.

512
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:35,895
It's not you.

513
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,899
It's nothing. It's... It's okay.

514
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,868
No, it's obviously not.

515
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,105
Some of this is on you.

516
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,874
You know, every time we talk,

517
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:49,742
you don't tell me anything
about your life.

518
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,253
That's because you don't
want to know anything.

519
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:52,578
That's not true!

520
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:57,516
You're busy saving patients
a hundred hours a week.

521
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,329
You don't want to feel guilty
about being a thousand miles away.

522
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,757
You just want to know
that I'm okay.

523
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,893
So I say I'm okay.

524
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,237
Ew!

525
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,305
That's annoying.

526
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:22,742
Can you do that some place else?

527
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:26,345
I'm trying to find a better
solution for my patient.

528
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,114
Your patient
is being discharged.

529
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,882
I'm trying to get a kidney
for a dying guy.

530
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,818
You're watching gross videos.

531
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,385
I'm waiting to hear back
from UNOS.

532
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,522
Ew!

533
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,996
Do you prefer
being called or texted?

534
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,597
Neither.

535
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:48,768
Do you like surprises or
do you find them irritating?

536
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,669
I find this irritating.

537
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:52,071
It's research.

538
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,639
Lea said we can't be together

539
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,608
because she is too needy and
selfish to deal with my issues.

540
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:58,153
You are the most
selfish person I know,

541
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,812
so you are a good subject.

542
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:08,254
Lea's right.
She is needy and selfish.

543
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,156
Find someone who loves you
the way you are.

544
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:15,261
People always say that,
but shouldn't we be with someone

545
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:18,130
who makes us a better
version of ourselves?

546
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,702
Maybe.

547
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:28,440
But trying not to be autistic
won't make you better.

548
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,359
I'm sorry you still don't
feel good, Mommy.

549
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,361
Well, I'll feel better
when I'm home.

550
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,697
Eating those delicious cookies
that you make for me.

551
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,733
You don't have to go home.

552
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,402
I invented a better surgery.

553
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,871
Instead of removing
both your adrenal glands,

554
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:02,541
we can just squeeze out the
hyperplastic medullary part...

555
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,910
Like popping a pimple.

556
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,846
You "invented" a surgery?

557
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:09,015
Dr. Murphy's come up
with a surgical plan

558
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:11,483
that could curb overproduction
of your hormones

559
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,152
while leaving you
some adrenal function.

560
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,262
What are the chances it'll work?

561
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,355
Oh, we don't know.

562
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:17,900
Since
it's never been done before,

563
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,491
it's difficult
to predict the outcome,

564
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:22,694
but it is a safe
and viable treatment option.

565
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,978
Is Wes dying?

566
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:49,956
We're doing everything
we can to help him.

567
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:52,391
I snuck a look at his chart
when no one was around.

568
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,126
You know that's a crime, right?

569
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,294
Only a misdemeanor.

570
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,199
You should talk to Wes.

571
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:06,839
We all got tested.

572
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:09,508
I'm a match.

573
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:12,879
I'm gonna give Wes my kidney.

574
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:28,794
We've discussed your offer
at length, Max.

575
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:33,099
It's incredibly admirable
and generous.

576
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,500
But you're 16.

577
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,136
Living donors have to be
18 years old.

578
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,938
I'm emancipated.

579
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,672
I can give consent for myself.

580
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,308
But it's still
up to the hospital

581
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,243
to decide
if this is a good idea.

582
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:47,379
We don't feel this is
in your best interest.

583
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,716
Max.

584
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:54,520
The surgery's much harder
on the donor than the recipient.

585
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:57,023
You could have postoperative
bleeding or infection.

586
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:58,824
And it's incredibly painful.

587
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,427
I've been through more crap
than any of you.

588
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,828
I can handle it.

589
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,530
There are also
long-term consequences...

590
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,432
High blood pressure,
renal failure.

591
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,610
If something happens to your other kidney,
you don't have a spare.

592
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:11,003
I know how to subtract.
I'm cool with it.

593
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:13,039
And the recovery
is long and hard.

594
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:16,142
You would need someone to
help you get dressed and bathe

595
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:17,886
and make sure you take
all your medications.

596
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,947
I've been taking care of
myself just fine for a long time.

597
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,618
Actually, Max,

598
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:29,855
you've been in juvie
and on drugs.

599
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,258
You're not
taking care of yourself.

600
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:38,464
Okay, I get it.

601
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:39,498
I'm a screw-up.

602
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,401
But Wes isn't.

603
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:46,205
He's bailed me out of jail.

604
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,715
He's picked me up
in the middle of the night

605
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,775
when I was
too messed up to drive.

606
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,843
He's cleaned me up after fights.

607
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:57,583
He came
with me to my sister's funeral.

608
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:02,054
If I manage to stay out of jail,

609
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:04,223
it's because of Wes.

610
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:07,426
If I'm a halfway decent
father someday,

611
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,063
if I'm not a lost cause,

612
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:15,567
it's because
Wes never gave up on me.

613
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,606
He shouldn't die

614
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:23,409
because I made
dumb-ass decisions.

615
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:44,796
It's your surgery.

616
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,866
And we have the exact same
amount of experience with this.

617
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:58,410
Free up the medulla along
the inner cortical surface.

618
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:00,346
Careful not to penetrate
the cortex.

619
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,286
Mm.

620
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,920
Nothing's coming out.

621
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:11,357
Try using your fingers
to pinch the gland.

622
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,225
Use a circular motion
to coax it out.

623
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:17,763
I've popped my share of pimples.

624
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,593
That's cool.

625
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,962
One down, one to go.

626
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,602
Wes is like a father to Max.

627
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:57,712
If he were his actual father,

628
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,214
we wouldn't hesitate
to let him do it.

629
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:00,372
I think we should.

630
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,009
Me, too.

631
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,511
The little punk got to me.

632
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,549
We've explained all the risks.

633
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,384
Max was unwavering.

634
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:15,754
I vote yes.

635
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,195
One admirable decision

636
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:25,297
doesn't wipe away
a lifetime of bad ones.

637
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:31,002
It's three against one.

638
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:37,376
This isn't a democracy.

639
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,415
I'll tell the patient.

640
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,566
One of the boys
get into trouble again?

641
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,434
No.

642
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:04,270
No, they've given you
a reason to be proud.

643
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,940
They all got tested to
see if they were a match.

644
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,276
Max is.

645
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:11,977
He wants to give you his kidney.

646
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,950
That little turd is full of
surprises.

647
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,703
I can't approve
the transplant, Wes.

648
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,772
I'm sorry.

649
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:46,478
Max is a good kid.

650
00:35:46,512 --> 00:35:50,216
He's gonna make a good man
one day, thanks to you.

651
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:52,150
But, for now,

652
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:54,620
he still needs grown-ups
to have his back.

653
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:55,887
The risks to his health...

654
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:56,955
It's okay.

655
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,630
It...

656
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,465
It's the right call.

657
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:15,974
It's my job to save those kids.

658
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,576
Not the other way around.

659
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,481
You're still on the UNOS list.

660
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,184
We'll keep reaching out
to your family.

661
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,686
We're not giving up.

662
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:39,498
I need you to do
one other thing for me.

663
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:59,117
Sorry to interrupt.

664
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,519
It's okay.

665
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,888
No one's probably
listening anyway.

666
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,535
Your kidney's not a match.

667
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:21,139
They said I was.

668
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,775
Your blood and tissue type
were good.

669
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:25,777
But the serum crossmatch showed

670
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:29,915
that Wes produces antibodies
in reaction to your cells.

671
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:32,050
His body
would reject your kidney.

672
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,288
I'm sorry.

673
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,793
Figures.

674
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:43,495
I can't do
one stupid thing right.

675
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:45,096
That's not true.

676
00:37:46,532 --> 00:37:48,300
You did everything you could.

677
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,270
Wes is so proud of you.

678
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,470
Any dizziness or nausea?

679
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:26,805
No. No headaches, either.

680
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,840
You need to try
getting out of bed

681
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:30,742
to see if your symptoms return.

682
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:31,810
She ready for that?

683
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:33,679
No cartwheels yet,
but hopefully.

684
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,032
How's it feel?

685
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,604
Room's not spinning.

686
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,439
Mommy! You're all better!

687
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:03,041
Whoa! Careful, sweet pea.

688
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,143
Mama's still recovering.

689
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,381
I'm okay.

690
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:12,984
Ooh!

691
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,066
Here's the Big Dipper.

692
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,135
If you extend a straight line
through these two,

693
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:33,204
this bright star is Polaris.

694
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:34,706
All of our phones
have compass apps.

695
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,342
Hey, just shut up and listen.

696
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,544
This crap's important.

697
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,548
Polaris is your true north.

698
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:47,318
You keep your eye on that,
you're gonna find your way out

699
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:48,887
of whatever mess
you've gotten into.

700
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,184
O... kay.

701
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:20,486
All right. Mm.

702
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,303
That's, uh...

703
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:30,762
Even worse than it looks.

704
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:34,566
It's so bad. It's so bad!

705
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:37,769
Mm. Cooks, we are not.

706
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:48,847
I think we should go on a date.

707
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,881
A real date.

708
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,752
Shaun, I already said no.

709
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:57,088
Yes, because you think there
are problems that can't be fixed.

710
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,090
But I am very good
at solving problems.

711
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:01,893
I saved a woman today who
nobody thought I could save.

712
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:03,562
I don't need saving, Shaun.

713
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,430
Okay. I understand.

714
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,132
I can fix this.

715
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:10,301
Yes. You have to
give me a chance.

716
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:12,003
You need to let me try.

717
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:13,605
No. I don't need to do anything.

718
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:14,973
You need to listen to me.

719
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,417
No. No... This is
only proving my point.

720
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:17,876
I have... I have a plan.

721
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,410
I can fix it!

722
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,146
I-I will fix it!

723
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,815
Shaun, you're autistic.
You can't fix that.

724
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:33,592
You are who you are.

725
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,160
And I am who I am.

726
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:39,164
And the two of us
will never work.

726
00:41:40,305 --> 00:42:40,288

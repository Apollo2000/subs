1
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:10,174
Good morning.

2
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,414
Morning.

3
00:00:14,877 --> 00:00:16,583
I'm Jake, we met last week.

4
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:19,153
Yes, we did.

5
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:22,822
I was just gonna get some juice.

6
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:24,758
- Hope you don't mind.
- Are you a drummer?

7
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:28,929
Am I a drummer? No. No, I'm a chef.

8
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:30,431
Well, actually, just a cook, but...

9
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:31,965
Lea dates drummers.

10
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,515
I played clarinet in junior high.

11
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:38,672
Hmm.

12
00:00:42,888 --> 00:00:44,411
What are you doing out here?

13
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:46,396
I told you to stay in my room.

14
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:48,749
I just snuck out to grab some O.J.

15
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:49,950
Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:49,952 --> 00:00:51,653
I was really thirsty. Okay.

17
00:00:59,412 --> 00:01:00,850
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,171
I should've told you
he was spending the night.

19
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,396
I like Jake.

20
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:09,185
That's nice of you to say.

21
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:12,035
I know it's difficult
to have a stranger in your home.

22
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:15,934
I have to drive Dr. Glassman
to his chemo appointment.

23
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:19,542
He's five days in and doing very well.

24
00:01:19,544 --> 00:01:21,211
I'm helping him.

25
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:23,546
Jake is very sweet.

26
00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:25,215
You know, when you get to know him,

27
00:01:25,217 --> 00:01:26,711
I'm sure you really will like him.

28
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,878
I said I like him.

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,880
Will he be spending
the night here a lot now?

30
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,493
No, not a lot.

31
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,318
But...

32
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,820
would that be a problem?

33
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:39,989
- No.
- So is it cool

34
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:42,377
if I have him over tonight
to watch a movie?

35
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:44,713
It's cool.

36
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,377
I have to go.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,074

38
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:10,353
Good morning, Dr. Glassman.

39
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:14,523
I let myself in. I'm downstairs.

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,787
How are you feeling today?

41
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:49,108
Good, actually. Better than yesterday.

42
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,459
Yes, your skin was a bit pale yesterday.

43
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:53,460
Today your color looks much better.

44
00:02:53,462 --> 00:02:55,462
I brought you your electrolytes.

45
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:57,798
Thank you.

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,499
Cheers.

47
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:11,111
Why did you do that?

48
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,209
I don't like the flavor, the grape.

49
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:15,835
Are you experiencing nausea?

50
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:18,385
No, I didn't like the flavor, I told you.

51
00:03:19,922 --> 00:03:21,922
I'm fine.

52
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,826
I'm glad you're feeling well.

53
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:29,895
Let's go, or we're going to be late.

54
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:32,898
Yep. Cancer's not gonna kill itself.

55
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:38,737
Hey.

56
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,912
I was just thinking about you, too.

57
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:43,242
Actually, can I call you at lunch?

58
00:03:43,244 --> 00:03:45,078
I'm with some people right now, and...

59
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,913
Yes, exactly.

60
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:49,421
We'll talk later.

61
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:51,923
Love you.

62
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:00,932
New girlfriend?

63
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:04,797
Still in the call-each-other-
the-next-morning phase?

64
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,897
Yeah, you got me.

65
00:04:08,774 --> 00:04:10,970
Actually, no. It was Mia.

66
00:04:10,972 --> 00:04:12,972
We're giving our relationship
another shot.

67
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:15,875
Wow. Park, that's great.

68
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:19,618
Yeah, I told you because part
of the thing with Mia is...

69
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:22,447
I'm trying to be more open.

70
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,451
Thanks. You didn't need to explain,

71
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:28,453
but sounds good.

72
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:30,990
She sounds like she's good for you.

73
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:34,007
Yeah.

74
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:35,793
Of course, if it doesn't work out,

75
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:36,961
I'll have to talk to you about that, too,

76
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:38,963
admit I failed.

77
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:41,133
Or I can be a supportive colleague

78
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:43,001
regardless of what happens.

79
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:54,479
70-year-old female. Neighbor
saw her collapse in her yard.

80
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:58,483
Unresponsive. No heartbeat.
EKG is flatlined.

81
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:00,718
Then she'd be cyanotic.

82
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Good capillary refill... she's perfusing?

83
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:04,388
Stop CPR.

84
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,557
And she's breathing.
Your EKG must be broken.

85
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,392
Worked fine on our call right before her.

86
00:05:08,394 --> 00:05:10,261
Everything works fine
up until it doesn't.

87
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:14,635
- Nothing.
- Told you.

88
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:17,283
Hook her up, let's check her vitals.

89
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:21,105
Blood is definitely flowing
to her extremities.

90
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:32,950
Should we push epi, get the crash...

91
00:05:32,952 --> 00:05:35,118
Wait. Everyone quiet.

92
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:44,894
Listen.

93
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:51,967
Is that...?

94
00:05:57,542 --> 00:05:59,041
She doesn't have a rhythm

95
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:01,478
because she has a mechanical heart.

00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:13,989
Lana Moore. 34-year-old female,

98
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:16,158
was slurring her words, symptom passed,

99
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,624
but we found a grade two
arteriovenous malformation

100
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,829
- in her brain.
- Are we going to do

101
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:22,664
endovascular embolization

102
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,667
or stereotactic radiosurgery
or resection?

103
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,503
Endovascular embolization.

104
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:29,838
Patient requests she's only
served green Jello

105
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
and that we dim all of
our incandescent light bulbs?

106
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:33,335
Lana has autism.

107
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:35,677
What're you looking at him for?

108
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,345
It's not like they all know each other.

109
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:39,180
I was just curious
what his thoughts might be.

110
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:42,017
I think we should go with
endovascular embolization.

111
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:43,518
Hmm. Now you know.

112
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,087
The AVM is dangerous,
but the embolization

113
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:47,756
is a relatively minor procedure.

114
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:49,991
We'll make a small incision in your leg

115
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,359
so we can insert a catheter into your...

116
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:52,527
Are you okay, Javi?

117
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:55,463
The lights aren't bothering you too much?

118
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:58,068
A little.

119
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:10,944
Please continue.

120
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:15,113
We'll insert the catheter
into your femoral artery.

121
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:17,451
Then we'll feed it up
into the arteriovenous malform...

122
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:19,287
You brought a dictionary?

123
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:20,954
Uh, is there something I'm saying

124
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:23,624
- that you don't understand?
- Lana loves learning new words.

125
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:25,125
She's memorized the scientific Latin name

126
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:26,860
of every bug in South America.

127
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:29,363
Go ahead, name any six-legged critter.

128
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,665
I love being quizzed.

129
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:35,203
Rhinoceros Beetle.

130
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:38,539
Megasoma Actaeon. Found in Guyana.

131
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,039
It's the heaviest insect in the world

132
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,809
and weighs as much as 300 grasshoppers.

133
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:45,851
Is she right?

134
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:47,826
I have no idea.

135
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,078
I have to go.

136
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,458
Javi...

137
00:07:56,057 --> 00:07:57,294
Javi.

138
00:07:58,393 --> 00:07:59,726
Where are you going?

139
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:01,894
It's 11:15. I have to be home by noon

140
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:03,230
to watch "Judge Judy" before work.

141
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,564
I-It's important to us

142
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,399
that your girlfriend
doesn't get stressed out,

143
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:08,568
so we'd prefer it if you stayed with her

144
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,237
as long as you can.

145
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:13,940
Lana's not my girlfriend.
We're just roommates.

146
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:23,716
Still stable?

147
00:08:23,718 --> 00:08:25,551
The diuretics have her O2 SATs up,

148
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:27,386
- but she's hypotensive.
- And we checked every center

149
00:08:27,388 --> 00:08:29,222
approved to implant mechanical hearts,

150
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:31,257
but none have any record
of her as a patient.

151
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,759
Check overseas. I'd start with...

152
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,026
Mom?

153
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,395
Is it her heart?

154
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:38,931
The implanted device
appears to be malfunctioning.

155
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:40,266
Do you have any contact information

156
00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:41,768
for the surgeon who implanted it?

157
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,969
Yes, of course.

158
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:46,305
Dr. Li Wei. He's in Beijing.

159
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:48,053
When did she have it implanted?

160
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:50,476
A little over nine months.

161
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:53,949
She just went back

162
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,648
for a follow-up exam last month.

163
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,978
She was fine.

164
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:00,257
Can you fix it?

165
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,168
I'm gonna find out.

166
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:13,203
Hello.

167
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:16,368
Hello.

168
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,874
Don't be stupid.

169
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:25,043
What? There's no cameras in here.

170
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:30,515
Dr. Lim, Dr. Melendez.

171
00:09:30,517 --> 00:09:32,517
How was your respective weekends?

172
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,853
Good. Checked out some bikes.

173
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:37,189
- Brushed up on some reading.
- Excellent.

174
00:09:37,191 --> 00:09:39,024
I hear the search for
Chief of Surgery is back on.

175
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:40,859
As is our legal department's response

176
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:42,527
to the DPH complaint against both of you,

177
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,196
so I wouldn't get your hopes up.

178
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:45,864
Probably just as well.

179
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:48,033
I'd rather not see the two
of you competing again.

180
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:51,870
You seem to be getting along better.

181
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:04,170
It's weird.

182
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:06,951
Is it weird?

183
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:08,785
They act like a couple, right?

184
00:10:08,787 --> 00:10:11,288
I live with Lea, but we're not a couple.

185
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,490
Yeah, but you wish you were.

186
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:17,019
Do you?

187
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:19,529
Lea has a new boyfriend.

188
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:22,299
You must be a little jealous.

189
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:25,169
Why?

190
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:28,004
Lea's my friend and Lea's happy.

191
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:29,672
Okay.

192
00:10:29,674 --> 00:10:33,176
Jake, Lea, and I can
all be friends together.

193
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:37,046
Shaun, Lea's new boyfriend
doesn't want to hang out

194
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:38,547
with the three of you.

195
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:40,549
If Lea really likes this guy,

196
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:43,052
she's gonna want to
spend time just with him.

197
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:45,388
I know.

198
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,622
For the sex.

199
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:54,397
Her AVM has microbleeds.

200
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,232
Her risk of rupture is doubled.

201
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,539
They paged Sunny's surgeon.

202
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,874
He's gonna call you in an hour.

203
00:11:05,876 --> 00:11:07,209
Tell them I can't wait that long.

204
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:08,643
- Her cardiac output is low and...
- Got it.

205
00:11:23,593 --> 00:11:25,127
He's in surgery.

206
00:11:27,264 --> 00:11:29,431
Excuse me. Uh, Dr. Melendez?

207
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm Grace Lee. Sunny Lee's daughter.

208
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:34,836
They told me downstairs
that you're my mother's doctor.

209
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:37,005
Yes. Get them to send her records

210
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:38,505
and everything they can about the device.

211
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:40,975
Manufacturer, model number, manuals.

212
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:43,844
Your mother's stable,
but we're struggling

213
00:11:43,846 --> 00:11:46,013
to get the information we need
from her doctor in China.

214
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:48,682
I don't understand.
Her doctor's in China?

215
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:50,451
Like on vacation?

216
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:52,186
No, her cardiac surgeon.

217
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:55,522
Your sister can fill you in
on everything we've done so far.

218
00:11:55,524 --> 00:11:56,965
I really need to get
back on this phone call.

219
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,259
- Wait.

220
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:00,194
I don't have a sister.

221
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,050
We met 10 years ago

222
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:13,354
while I was volunteering
at a senior center.

223
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:15,121
We hit it off.

224
00:12:15,123 --> 00:12:18,137
Neither of us had anyone
in our lives at the time.

225
00:12:19,694 --> 00:12:21,194
People assumed we were
mother and daughter

226
00:12:21,196 --> 00:12:23,863
because we did everything together.

227
00:12:23,865 --> 00:12:25,895
After a while, we just went with it.

228
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:29,235
She'll be glad to see you.

229
00:12:29,237 --> 00:12:31,637
You look like you've put
your problems behind you.

230
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,206
Problems?

231
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,405
She told me about your issues with drugs.

232
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,445
Oh, my God.

233
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:41,948
She caught me smoking pot.

234
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,534
Once. I was a teenager.

235
00:12:44,536 --> 00:12:47,787
- So you're fine?
- Of course I'm fine.

236
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:49,289
Then you don't really have an excuse

237
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:52,088
for not calling for 15 years, do you?

238
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,274
They want her back.

239
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,775
They've arranged for transport...

240
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,943
they'll do the repairs in Beijing.

241
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,612
Is that safe?

242
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,280
Can she travel for that long
in her condition?

243
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,115
It's a specially equipped plane
for patients

244
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,750
requiring urgent medical assistance.

245
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,818
And 20 hours in the air is much safer

246
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,887
than at least that long
on an operating table here

247
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,256
while we basically fly blind.

248
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,590
- Okay.
- Okay.

249
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:18,462
Prep her for transport.

250
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
The microbleeds indicate

251
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:33,309
that it may already
be starting to rupture.

252
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,645
If it goes, you could suffer
permanent brain damage

253
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:37,313
or death. Because of that,

254
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:40,149
embolization is no longer
our preferred approach.

255
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,851
We want to open you up and cut it out.

256
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:46,922
Can you try talking to her?

257
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,492
Just because I have autism doesn't...

258
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:51,160
I'm not asking you
because you have autism.

259
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:53,028
I'm asking you because you're her doctor

260
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,230
and I'm getting nowhere.

261
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:11,180
The sting of the Japanese Giant Hornet

262
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:14,349
can dissolve human flesh
and attack the nervous system.

263
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:16,518
Recommended treatment
includes oral antihistamine

264
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,986
and acetaminophen.

265
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:23,959
Comforting choice of words.

266
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:37,038
It's 6:30. Dinner time.

267
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,541
I brought burgers and Jello.
This one's yours.

268
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:41,042
Lana can't eat now.

269
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:42,811
We're trying to schedule a surgery to...

270
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:44,011
I could die.

271
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:51,185
The surgery sounds scary
but necessary, so I'll do it.

272
00:14:55,836 --> 00:14:58,025
"...big feet got there first.
Johnny stumbled caught himself

273
00:14:58,027 --> 00:14:59,361
and swung silently about at Dove.

274
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:01,028
'Gosh, Johnny, I'm sorry, '
snickered Dove.

275
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,697
'Sorry, eh, you're going
to be a lot sorrier.'

276
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:03,701
'I just didn't notice.'
'You do that a... '"

277
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,333
Shaun. What are you doing?

278
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:07,568
Reading to you from "Johnny Tremain."

279
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,737
You're reading words.
You're not reading sentences.

280
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:13,574
This edition of "Johnny Tremain"
is 320 pages long.

281
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:14,742
To get through the entire thing,

282
00:15:14,744 --> 00:15:16,910
I need to read 270 words per minute.

283
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:19,747
You don't have to finish
the book in one sitting.

284
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:21,415
Oh, yes, that's how I read novels.

285
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,250
I want to know
where the characters end up.

286
00:15:23,252 --> 00:15:24,718
You know what? Let's just stop.

287
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,053
I can go slower.

288
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:29,423
- I-I'm not listening, anyway.
- Are you in pain?

289
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:31,592
- No, no, I'm not...
- You seem fatigued.

290
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:33,761
You know what? I have a good idea.

291
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:36,096
Why don't you take out the garbage?

292
00:15:43,772 --> 00:15:45,305
Thank you.

293
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:50,543
Where is your recycling?

294
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:52,512
It's under the sink.

295
00:15:57,219 --> 00:16:01,388
Dr. Glassman, this cannot be recycled.

296
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,057
If it's broken, it cannot be recycled

297
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:06,259
- because shards of glass...
- I don't care, Shaun!

298
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:08,728
I didn't ask you to re-sort the garbage.

299
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,631
I just asked you to take it out.
Can you do that?

300
00:16:19,307 --> 00:16:21,574
Your call light is on.
How can I help you?

301
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,980
Any new symptoms or discomfort?

302
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:29,982
Lana?

303
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:35,394
Rhinoceros Beetle...?

304
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,160
I'm gonna get Javi on the phone.

305
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:42,495
You can talk to both of us.

306
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:43,629
Do these doors lock?

307
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,446
No.

308
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:47,467
Do you want them to?

309
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,170
Is there someone you're worried about?

310
00:16:52,172 --> 00:16:54,372
Is it Javi? Or someone else?

311
00:16:55,342 --> 00:16:57,250
I'm nervous about the surgery.

312
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,288
Dr. Lim is an excellent surgeon.

313
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,397
I've seen her do...

314
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,382
I'd like Javi to come
and have sex with me.

315
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,620
I think an orgasm would help calm me.

316
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,690
Do the blinds close?

317
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:17,496
She's gonna need a norepinephrine drip

318
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:19,925
to maintain her pressure
during transport.

319
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:27,371
Mom?

320
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:35,178
You look pretty.

321
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:39,583
Mom, I've been so worried.

322
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:42,620
You shouldn't have.
Teresa takes good care of me.

323
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,891
I'm so glad.

324
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:53,681
Why did you never call me?

325
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,601
You made it clear you wanted
nothing to do with me.

326
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:01,103
I just wanted to live my own life.

327
00:18:01,105 --> 00:18:04,908
So that's what you got.
Your own life... without me.

328
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:07,209
This isn't a good time to...

329
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,377
You were so good,

330
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,714
straight A's, always so smart.

331
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:15,051
- You threw it all away...
- You never understood.

332
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,286
Dad did. Dad wanted me to be happy...

333
00:18:17,288 --> 00:18:19,121
He wanted you to have fun...
as a<i> child...</i>

334
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:20,957
not waste your life.

335
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,192
Singing is not a career.

336
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:26,062
Sunny, you need to calm down.

337
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,898
Grace, your mother cannot
handle this stress right now.

338
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,700
Teresa... Teresa is a teacher.

339
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:34,269
Mom, stop. Listen to the doctor.

340
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:36,471
You forgot about me.

341
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:40,642
I wish you'd... stayed away.

342
00:18:40,644 --> 00:18:42,609
Would... have...

343
00:18:42,611 --> 00:18:44,165
Her arterial blood pressure is dropping.

344
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:47,049
Start bagging and give her 40 Lasix.

345
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:48,116
I'm calling a code.

346
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:08,017
- Mm.

347
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,102
- Shaun?
- Yes, it's Shaun.

348
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:17,084
I've picked out a very good movie

349
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:18,919
that we can all watch together.

350
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:21,755
Not the... Not the time, Shaun.

351
00:19:25,016 --> 00:19:26,427
I made popcorn.

352
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:27,650
Mm.

353
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:30,264
That's okay. You just stay here.

354
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:31,432
Stay here. Sorry.

355
00:19:36,004 --> 00:19:38,204
Shaun, we kind
of need some privacy right now.

356
00:19:38,206 --> 00:19:40,873
I also bought orange juice for Jake.

357
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,842
He was looking for some in the fridge.

358
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:46,612
Okay.

359
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,452
I thought you said
you were okay with this.

360
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:54,120
Jake will like the movie, Lea.

361
00:19:54,122 --> 00:19:55,355
It's about a chef who...

362
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:57,357
Shaun, but you're not
respecting boundaries.

363
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,691
If Jake and I are friends,

364
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:01,100
then we can all spend time together.

365
00:20:03,664 --> 00:20:04,998
Shaun...

366
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,666
Of course, we can all be friends.

367
00:20:07,668 --> 00:20:09,167
That would be great.

368
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:13,838
It's just sometimes
it's gonna be just me and Jake.

369
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,007
Without you.

370
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,809
For the sex?

371
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:22,079
And some other times, too.

372
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:24,039
Okay?

373
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,386
Okay.

374
00:20:31,158 --> 00:20:33,658
Just give us a minute

375
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,195
and we can watch the movie
in the living room together.

376
00:20:42,102 --> 00:20:43,268
Okay.

377
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,936
Having sex right now
is extremely dangerous

378
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:47,604
for someone in Lana's condition.

379
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:50,607
I studied the pre-op list
of things I couldn't do.

380
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:52,910
Sex was not on the list.

381
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,414
We'll update the list.

382
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,249
Anything that elevates her blood pressure

383
00:20:58,251 --> 00:21:01,018
could rupture the AVM before
we get a chance to remove it.

384
00:21:01,452 --> 00:21:03,687
You'll definitely need to abstain

385
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:05,022
until you're fully recovered.

386
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,835
Seems like you two are more
than just roommates.

387
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:12,963
Why?

388
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:15,899
You care for each other, you have sex...

389
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:18,068
It's convenient. He's available.

390
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,437
And it's frequently better
than masturbation.

391
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:23,106
- High praise.
- And he leaves afterward.

392
00:21:23,108 --> 00:21:25,108
She doesn't like being touched
when she sleeps.

393
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,110
- Hmm.
- Are you two exclusive?

394
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,547
Lana and Javi don't have to
define their relationship

395
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:32,382
in order to make it
more digestible for you.

396
00:21:32,384 --> 00:21:34,817
Clearly whatever it is,
is working for them.

397
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:36,819
Now, you need to get some rest.

398
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:38,656
We're gonna do your surgery at 10:00 a.m.

399
00:21:41,206 --> 00:21:42,959
Sunny's on full life support.

400
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:46,296
Unfortunately,
she can't be flown to China.

401
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:48,465
Her condition is beyond the scope

402
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:50,366
of the plane's medical facilities.

403
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,269
Dr. Melendez is discussing next steps

404
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,972
with Sunny's surgeon in China.

405
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:00,977
No daughter would treat a wonderful woman

406
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:02,311
like Sunny the way you did.

407
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:04,480
Does a wonderful woman refuse

408
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:06,082
to go to her daughter's recitals?

409
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:08,484
Then, when she gets
accepted to Juilliard,

410
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:10,486
cut her off?
Tell her she'll never make it,

411
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:13,089
that she'll wind up broke
and on the streets?

412
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:31,125
Gently incise the dura.

413
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:35,377
Nicely done.

414
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:37,345
And there's our AVM.

415
00:22:37,347 --> 00:22:38,591
Aneurysm clips.

416
00:22:40,843 --> 00:22:43,685
It'd be nice to have
what Lana and Javi have.

417
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:45,186
All the benefits of a relationship

418
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:46,682
without the emotional baggage.

419
00:22:47,936 --> 00:22:50,525
The emotional baggage
<i>is</i> the relationship.

420
00:22:50,894 --> 00:22:52,694
Everybody has their issues...

421
00:22:52,696 --> 00:22:54,529
the point is to sort them out together.

422
00:22:55,565 --> 00:22:57,565
Yeah, that's all it takes...

423
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:59,767
agreed all the single people in the room.

424
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,571
I can't get under the AVM.

425
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:08,120
It's much closer to Broca's area
than the MRI indicated.

426
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:11,712
Any damage could destroy
her ability to speak.

427
00:23:11,714 --> 00:23:13,847
What if we use stereotactic
image guidance?

428
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:15,683
That would only show us where we are.

429
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,584
It wouldn't tell us
if we're affecting function.

430
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:25,092
But if we track Lana's vocal
function during the operation,

431
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:29,063
it will help us avoid
the speech center nerve tracts.

432
00:23:30,131 --> 00:23:32,131
You want to operate on her
while she's awake?

433
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,867
We can barely get answers out of her

434
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:36,535
at the best of times.

435
00:23:36,537 --> 00:23:38,037
How do you think it'll go
while her skull is open

436
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,505
in the middle of an O.R.?

437
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,409
Well, it's a good thing she
has a "roommate" who can help.

438
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:55,793
It's hard to walk away.

439
00:23:57,391 --> 00:23:59,558
We get angry, we want to run away,

440
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,895
but when it's family...

441
00:24:02,897 --> 00:24:04,697
I'm not angry.

442
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,703
When I got the call
telling me she was here,

443
00:24:10,705 --> 00:24:15,312
all I could think about
was how my lousy, bitter mother

444
00:24:16,377 --> 00:24:18,190
was about to die alone.

445
00:24:19,714 --> 00:24:22,648
That it wasn't her fault,
it was just her nature.

446
00:24:24,785 --> 00:24:28,120
So I needed to be here to let her know

447
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:31,277
that she was loved
in spite of everything.

448
00:24:34,388 --> 00:24:36,595
And then I found out about Teresa.

449
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:39,431
Saw them together.

450
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:43,268
Saw that my mother
was capable of caring...

451
00:24:44,604 --> 00:24:47,938
...capable of warmth... and love.

452
00:24:50,412 --> 00:24:53,110
Just... not for me.

453
00:24:54,614 --> 00:24:56,814
<i>Dr. Park, please report to ICU 2.</i>

454
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:06,157
She's bleeding from her cannula site.

455
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,990
She's intolerant to the ECMO.

456
00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:10,995
We can't wait for the new heart.

457
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:12,997
We have to try and repair
this one ourselves.

458
00:25:20,088 --> 00:25:22,222
China thinks Sunny's heart
failure is most likely due

459
00:25:22,224 --> 00:25:24,058
to a broken blade in the impeller.

460
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,726
They're suggesting
we weld it back together

461
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:27,227
using an intraoperative device...

462
00:25:27,229 --> 00:25:28,729
which we don't have.

463
00:25:28,731 --> 00:25:30,431
We could repair it with fibrin bioglue.

464
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:32,433
The blade spins at 1,200 RPMs...

465
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:34,224
the glue won't hold.

466
00:25:34,938 --> 00:25:37,838
What if we used the schematics
to 3D print a new impeller?

467
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,740
The plastic replacement probably
wouldn't hold up long-term.

468
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:42,576
We don't need long-term.

469
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:43,743
We just need it to work until

470
00:25:43,745 --> 00:25:45,579
the replacement arrives from China.

471
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:47,237
Let's get these to the lab.

472
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:51,585
You need me in the O.R.?

473
00:25:51,587 --> 00:25:52,819
Yes.

474
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:55,388
While you operate on her brain
with her head open?

475
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,414
You wouldn't be able to see
what we're doing.

476
00:25:58,627 --> 00:25:59,726
You won't see any blood...

477
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:02,128
What's the central
illuminance of the O.R.?

478
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:05,923
- I don't know.
- 140,000 Lux.

479
00:26:07,216 --> 00:26:10,303
140,000 Lux is way worse
than a grocery store.

480
00:26:10,305 --> 00:26:12,472
I can't go to grocery stores.

481
00:26:12,474 --> 00:26:14,473
We can provide you with protective gear

482
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:17,109
and eye shades that can
filter out some of the lights.

483
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:18,777
Bright lights are like
needles in my eyes.

484
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,252
Megasoma Actaeon.

485
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,054
Found in Guyana.

486
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:30,555
It's the heaviest insect in the world

487
00:26:30,557 --> 00:26:33,408
and weighs as much as 300 grasshoppers.

488
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:39,131
Do you like playing
insect trivia with Lana?

489
00:26:40,374 --> 00:26:41,634
This is crazy.

490
00:26:41,636 --> 00:26:44,136
You shouldn't do it
because of trivia night.

491
00:26:44,138 --> 00:26:46,471
You should do it because...

492
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:47,940
you love her.

493
00:26:52,096 --> 00:26:54,388
Your life is better with her.

494
00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:58,558
You're a better person with her.

495
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:02,621
Y-You need her. That's what love is.

496
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:04,982
Do it because you love her.

497
00:27:07,818 --> 00:27:09,794
I don't love her.

498
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:13,031
She's my roommate.

499
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,285
Impeller blades are fine.

500
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:36,554
The bearings are functioning properly.

501
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,393
Electrical consumption is good.

502
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,968
Maybe the machine isn't the problem.

503
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,396
Heart failure is either caused

504
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:48,129
by insufficient pumping
or a constricted outflow.

505
00:27:48,131 --> 00:27:49,800
Since her "pump" is fine...

506
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,838
She doesn't have valvular stenosis.

507
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,506
The surgeons removed her aortic valve

508
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,741
when they implanted this device.

509
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,642
It could be the aorta itself.

510
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,812
If it narrowed,
that would reduce her outflow,

511
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:03,146
cause her pressure to drop.

512
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,548
If we do an intraop-angio,
we'd see evidence of that.

513
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,218
Call X-ray... have them
bring a C-arm, STAT.

514
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,758
Dr. Glassman?

515
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:17,894
I got you cherry Gastrolyte.

516
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:20,563
Shaun, I'm fine. You can go back to work.

517
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:23,734
At the Nathan County Fair, I was 14

518
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:27,270
and you got a cherry slushee
and said it was your...

519
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:31,273
Why do you have an I.V.?

520
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:35,510
It's just fluid, Shaun, with potassium.

521
00:28:35,512 --> 00:28:39,076
I had a nurse come by from the hospital.

522
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:41,951
I could have done this.

523
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,679
You're busy.

524
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,687
I'm helping you.

525
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:47,189
You wouldn't need the fluids

526
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:49,358
- if you listened to me.
- I know.

527
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,137
You didn't drink
the Gastrolyte I brought you.

528
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:54,596
- But now...
- Shaun.

529
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:56,885
My head really hurts right now.

530
00:28:57,735 --> 00:29:00,402
How long have you been experiencing pain?

531
00:29:00,404 --> 00:29:02,371
It pretty much never stops.

532
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,538
That's not true.

533
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,707
I asked you if you
were in pain last night,

534
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:08,042
and you said you weren't.

535
00:29:08,044 --> 00:29:10,044
I was in pain last night, Shaun.

536
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:11,846
I just didn't want you to worry.

537
00:29:15,285 --> 00:29:18,286
Why would you lie about a symptom?

538
00:29:19,555 --> 00:29:21,555
Why would you lie, Dr. Glassman?

539
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:23,557
- This c...
- This is why, Shaun.

540
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,226
<i>This</i> is why.

541
00:29:25,228 --> 00:29:28,963
I can handle the pain.
I can handle the nausea.

542
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:31,632
- You have nausea?
- Yes. Yes, I have nausea.

543
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:34,002
Okay, you should stop the PCV Chemo.

544
00:29:34,004 --> 00:29:36,337
- Shaun.
- Okay, you should stop.

545
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:37,805
I'm going to call Dr. Blaize.

546
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:39,807
No. Shaun! No!

547
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:43,644
I am trying to help you!

548
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,415
I am trying to help you,

549
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:50,418
but you are not a compliant patient.

550
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,370
- You don't rest...
- Shaun...

551
00:29:52,372 --> 00:29:53,763
...when I tell you to rest.

552
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:55,243
You don't follow
the diet that I am giving you.

553
00:29:55,245 --> 00:29:56,457
Will you please go?

554
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:58,125
Shaun, will you just go, please?

555
00:29:58,127 --> 00:30:01,094
- Will you just go?
- I-I promised that I would help you!

556
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:03,535
You're not my doctor, Shaun!

557
00:30:07,793 --> 00:30:09,332
I don't...

558
00:30:12,474 --> 00:30:14,141
I don't want you here.

559
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:19,752
I'm sorry. I don't want you here.

560
00:30:28,557 --> 00:30:32,226
I don't know how to help you.

561
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,828
Then stop trying.

562
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:38,799
You're not helping.

563
00:30:40,135 --> 00:30:41,801
You can't help, Shaun.

564
00:31:03,852 --> 00:31:06,416
He's in pain and frustrated

565
00:31:06,418 --> 00:31:08,838
and nauseous, and taking it out on you.

566
00:31:08,838 --> 00:31:11,505
He's in pain and frustrated and nauseous,

567
00:31:11,507 --> 00:31:13,173
and I can't help him.

568
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:15,308
- That may be true.
- So what do I do?

569
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,279
When there's nothing you can do,

570
00:31:19,281 --> 00:31:20,980
you have to accept that.

571
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:26,353
You have to stop trying to help.

572
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:30,823
That's what he said.

573
00:31:40,402 --> 00:31:41,901
Thank you, Lea.

574
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:46,906
My life is better with you.

575
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:56,582
Mine, too.

576
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:20,272
- We're in the aorta now.
- If there is a narrowing,

577
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:22,474
we should see a sudden rise in pressure.

578
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:40,058
We should be able to
replace the narrow part

579
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,727
with a graft. Metz.

580
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:45,864
This is a...

581
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,399
Horse.

582
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,938
This is a...

583
00:32:54,908 --> 00:32:57,312
Lana, what do you see here?

584
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:02,747
We need you to keep talking to us.

585
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,450
Have we already done damage?

586
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:07,552
It's too soon, I think.

587
00:33:07,554 --> 00:33:08,753
We need to stop.

588
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:11,256
If we leave the AVM
intact and it ruptures,

589
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:12,688
it will kill her.

590
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:22,442
Lana, do you understand?

591
00:33:22,969 --> 00:33:25,136
I have to keep going,
but if you stop talking,

592
00:33:25,138 --> 00:33:26,771
you may never talk again.

593
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:38,782
Hand me the bipolar forceps.

594
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:40,116
Dr. Lim.

595
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,452
There's a Javi Maldonado
insisting he should be in here.

596
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:06,443
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

597
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,444
The surgery was a success.

598
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,198
You can see her when she wakes up.

599
00:34:13,338 --> 00:34:14,670
Thank you.

600
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,633
She wasn't great with you,

601
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,969
but she's great with Teresa.

602
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:35,839
That doesn't mean
she loves her more than you.

603
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,642
It may just mean...

604
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,343
she's not the same person anymore.

605
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:43,648
As soon as she saw me,
she started giving me crap.

606
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:45,647
The same crap.

607
00:34:47,651 --> 00:34:51,186
Actually, the first thing she said was...

608
00:34:52,189 --> 00:34:54,189
...you look pretty.

609
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:17,765
Lana, what's on the screen?

610
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:20,214
A lion.

611
00:35:26,816 --> 00:35:28,996
And what is that?

612
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:34,228
Lana, what's on the screen?

613
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:45,239
Javi...?

614
00:35:54,082 --> 00:35:56,316
Madagascan Hissing Cockroach.

615
00:36:01,824 --> 00:36:05,647
Gromphadorhina portentosa.

616
00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:09,275
One of the few insects

617
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:13,667
who give birth to live young,

618
00:36:13,669 --> 00:36:15,990
rather than laying eggs.

619
00:36:16,472 --> 00:36:18,939
Keep going. You both are doing great.

620
00:36:20,643 --> 00:36:24,477
Long-tailed South African Scorpion.

621
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:26,960
Hadogenes troglodytes.

622
00:36:27,482 --> 00:36:29,816
Reaches a length of over 8 inches,

623
00:36:29,818 --> 00:36:32,257
the longest scorpion in the world.

624
00:36:35,046 --> 00:36:37,051
You'll still need to fly
to China to get checked out...

625
00:36:37,076 --> 00:36:38,934
but everything looks great.

626
00:36:38,936 --> 00:36:40,478
Thank you.

627
00:36:45,297 --> 00:36:48,165
Mom, Grace is outside.

628
00:36:52,692 --> 00:36:54,240
I think you should talk to her.

629
00:36:54,242 --> 00:36:55,393
Why?

630
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:58,062
Because...

631
00:36:58,064 --> 00:36:59,492
she's your daughter.

632
00:37:06,672 --> 00:37:09,039
I'll step out. It's okay.

633
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:14,965
Mom.

634
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:18,048
Since we stopped talking,

635
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,305
there hasn't been a day
I haven't thought about you.

636
00:37:21,887 --> 00:37:23,386
That I haven't missed you.

637
00:37:27,226 --> 00:37:28,855
I'm sorry.

638
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:31,228
For everything.

639
00:37:44,408 --> 00:37:45,674
I sat in the back.

640
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:51,180
At the Troubadour.

641
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:53,782
You were singing "I Wish It Would Rain"

642
00:37:53,784 --> 00:37:55,184
with that band.

643
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:02,096
I cried.

644
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:05,161
It was beautiful.

645
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:53,040
Can you tell me your name?

646
00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:00,047
You remember your name?

647
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:08,579
Of course I remember my name...

648
00:39:09,225 --> 00:39:10,581
Lana.

649
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:14,895
And you're Javi.

650
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:23,002
I think I love you.

651
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,739
I think you do, too.

652
00:39:32,948 --> 00:39:34,948
Do you want to stay in bed with me

653
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,615
after we have sex?

654
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,153

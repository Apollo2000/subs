1
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,674
Good morning.

2
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,243
That's your third ding.

3
00:00:09,277 --> 00:00:11,112
Good morning. It's Carly.

4
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:14,715
She has arrived
at her pathology conference.

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:15,816
Hmm.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,218
Hmm.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,656
Shaun, you need to
text her back.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,394
Her text wasn't a question.
It doesn't require a response.

9
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:31,565
True. But it sucks
to be left hanging.

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,034
You didn't like how it felt

11
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,628
when you thought
Carly was ignoring you.

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,446
I have received your message.

13
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,415
Sent.

14
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:51,785
Hmm.

15
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:53,354
You made me breakfast?

16
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,823
Oh, God, no.
I ordered breakfast.

17
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,325
But I managed to keep it warm.

18
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,095
You don't have to do this.
I'm fine.

19
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,399
Did you get any sleep?

20
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,102
I got enough.

21
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,239
Her death's not your fault.

22
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,475
She knew the risks.

23
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,245
She made a choice
to save her baby.

24
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:19,713
I bet she'd make
the same choice again,

25
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,382
even knowing how it would end.

26
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,052
Thank you.

27
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,427
Thanks for breakfast.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

29
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,373
We do a complete enucleation
of the right eye,

30
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,341
then replace it
with the temporary implant,

31
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,418
and in a few weeks, you'll...

32
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,211
You know why blind people
don't skydive?

33
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,114
It scares
the hell out of the dog.

34
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,851
Let the doctors finish.
Okay, bud?

35
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,288
Yeah, cancer eye out.
Fake eye in.

36
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,889
Just like last time. I got it.

37
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,960
Check it out.

38
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,763
It even moves and everything.

39
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,131
You can't even tell it's fake.

40
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,968
Very cool.
Like a bionic superhero.

41
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,539
Yeah, and my superpower
is tripping over stuff.

42
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,942
What time is the surgery?

43
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,043
3:00.

44
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,079
Which means
I've got six hours left

45
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,948
to blast some aliens.

46
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,355
If anyone utters the word
"Bubble Girl,"

47
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,314
I will transfer
to a different hospital.

48
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:21,435
When you were his age,

49
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:25,339
would you have faced
going blind with h-humor,

50
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:27,475
maturity, and acceptance?

51
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,209
I would have burned things down.

52
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,846
He's dealing with it
in his own way.

53
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:35,383
We'll check in with him

54
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,361
while you're taking care of
the rest of the paperwork.

55
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,229
Make sure Charlie knows
there's people he can talk to.

56
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,722
Thank you. Thank you.

57
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,293
Dr. Reznick, take
Charlie's blood to the lab.

58
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,560
Dr. Browne, talk to him.

59
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,228
Maybe he'll open up to you.

60
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,845
Heart sounds are normal.
No sign of pericardial effusion.

61
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,582
You are the oldest
SCID-patient I am aware of.

62
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:11,018
People with your condition
usually die very young.

63
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,121
Yay. I win.

64
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:17,425
Tara, imaging confirms that you have
infected tissue on your right lung,

65
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,360
that's what's causing
your breathing issues.

66
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,995
And we're gonna remove it with a
procedure called decortication...

67
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,064
And you'll use
the thoracoscopic approach

68
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,099
to decrease risk of infection.

69
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,436
And I'll be in an enclosed
chamber in the O.R. What else?

70
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:32,072
I assure you, we'll be taking
every precaution to keep you safe.

71
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,742
Dr. Melendez, this building
is a glorified incubator

72
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,010
for every infection
on the planet.

73
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,979
Considering I don't come
with an immune system,

74
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,414
I don't need assurances.

75
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,550
I need you to tell me
how you're gonna not kill me.

76
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,119
We will administer a course

77
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,255
of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

78
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,525
You will be transported to the O.R.
under a respiratory hood.

79
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,561
The room will be equipped
with laminar air flow

80
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,696
and kept at a positive
pressure of 8 Pascals.

81
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,441
Surgical instruments
will be double-sterilized

82
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,767
and all blood products
will be irradiated.

83
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,901
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

84
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:06,974
Visitors will also have to go
through a strict decontamination...

85
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,776
There won't be any.

86
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,978
The less time I spend
with people, the better.

87
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,245
Are we done?

88
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,551
How'd your talk with Charlie go?

89
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:19,152
He wants to be left alone.

90
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,822
No, you want to be left alone.
And yet here we are.

91
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,657
Precocious pre-teen going blind.

92
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,994
Come on, that's Claire catnip.
You have to talk to him.

93
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,833
Did he have any tests scheduled?
No.

94
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,624
No one's seen him, heard him, smelled him.
I'm calling Security.

95
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,383
Hold on. What are you doing?

96
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,919
Where's Charlie?

97
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,253
Did something happen?
Is he okay?

98
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,354
He's in imaging.

99
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,925
We'll have him back very soon.

100
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,996
He ordered a ride
15 minutes ago.

101
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,532
To where? It's close.

102
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,309
We could have him back
before anyone knows he's gone.

103
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,968
Are you insane? You're right.

104
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,603
It's much better
if we go back in there

105
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,381
and freak out two
already-freaked-out parents,

106
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,016
and while you're at it,
explain to Andrews

107
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,720
that you didn't do
what he asked you to do.

108
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:23,517
Hmm.

109
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,060
Which emoji was it?

110
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,201
Just send it to me.

111
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:47,975
Oh...

112
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,310
You told me I have to respond.

113
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,246
There is no response to...

114
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:58,652
Okay, I think Carly's
saying she misses you

115
00:06:58,686 --> 00:07:00,488
and wants to know
that you miss her, too.

116
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:03,390
You know all of that
from one fake face?

117
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,860
Just text her back
something flirty, casual.

118
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:10,197
Say something like, "I can't
stop thinking about you."

119
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,501
I have stopped thinking
about her many times today.

120
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,168
Do not text Carly that.

121
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,406
I have to go.

122
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,741
Okay.

123
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,425
This popcorn is terrible.

124
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,195
We have to get you back before
your parents start to worry.

125
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,397
We're gonna be three years,
five months too late.

126
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,769
The game is a blowout.
So, we leave now...

127
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,103
What's her name?

128
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,338
What?

129
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,817
I dunno.

130
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,953
The only words
I've ever said to her are,

131
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,287
"Can I have a slushy?"

132
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,258
I just wanted to see her
one last time.

133
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,260
Go say hi. Are you crazy?

134
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,128
I was asking her that earlier.

135
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,265
Tell her you think she's the most
beautiful girl you've ever laid eyes on,

136
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,576
and with your last
few hours of sight,

137
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,669
you wanted to see her
face one more time.

138
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,351
As lovely as this is...
Don't ruin the moment.

139
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,526
The necrotic debris has completely
encased the visceral pleura.

140
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,960
- Follow me with the camera.
- I don't want to spring a leak.

141
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,002
Tissue's fused her lungs
to her chest wall.

142
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,336
I need the Kaiser Forceps.

143
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,312
Damn it.

144
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,214
Tissue's too thick to fit
through the ports.

145
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,949
We need to do a thoracotomy.

146
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,827
And we can't open her up
in an air-tight chamber.

147
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,061
If we have to cauterize a bleed,

148
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,285
the whole thing could explode.

149
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,225
We have to take our Bubble
Girl out of the bubble.

150
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,605
Lemonade!
Get your ice-cold lemonade!

151
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,546
We've been gone too long.

152
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,382
Calm down. It'll take the kid
15 seconds to chicken out.

153
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:48,255
Or less.

154
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,597
I'm a wuss.

155
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:00,801
Most kids wouldn't have gone over at all.
Good for you.

156
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,440
Can I... No.

157
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:09,777
I'm just... No.

158
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,712
It better be fast. What?

159
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,580
We're giving a sad,
nearly blind kid

160
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,048
a few more minutes in the sun.

161
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,322
We could get an award for this.

162
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,193
Change gloves every 20 minutes.

163
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,461
We need to be fast,
but extremely careful.

164
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:31,832
Knife.

165
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,127
It's a Northern flying squirrel.

166
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,129
They don't fly so much as glide.

167
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,964
You're lucky it's not infected.

168
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,966
Well, it's
a fascinating species.

169
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,635
They're uncommonly high-strung
for a nocturnal rodent.

170
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,774
Is the squirrel in the bag?

171
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:14,842
Yes.

172
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,810
Henry comes everywhere...
No, no, no, no, no.

173
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,545
That's okay.
I don't need to see him.

174
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,814
Okay.

175
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,516
Has he bitten you before?

176
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,220
It was my fault. I provoke him.

177
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,456
Henry's a good boy.

178
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,590
It's not your fault.

179
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,892
You can't take him from me.

180
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,328
He's not allowed to hurt you.

181
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,497
Hi. It's 12:47.

182
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,631
Thank you.

183
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,009
You're 17 minutes late
for your 12:30...

184
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,502
Mrs. Pryce and I
need to have a little talk.

185
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,972
It's okay. Henry and I are fine.

186
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,379
Who's Henry?

187
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:02,522
You hesitated
before cutting her open.

188
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,325
We had to work fast
once I made the incision.

189
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,198
I was running through
the procedure in my head.

190
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,898
There's no shame in needing
to process a tough loss.

191
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,267
You should talk to someone.

192
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,870
I'd prefer to focus
on my current patient

193
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,338
rather than my last one.

194
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,882
Hey. Dr. Browne,
where's my patient?

195
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:29,959
And before you say, "Imaging,"

196
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,094
I already know that's not true.

197
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,086
He's with me and Morgan.

198
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,898
He just needed to process
a few things. Everything's...

199
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,056
Watch out!

200
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:38,859
What's going on?

201
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,563
Morgan just missed a turn.
She's a terrible driver.

202
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,765
Uh, no, we're on
our way back now.

203
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,600
Hurry. Okay.

204
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,549
How long was I out in the open?

205
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:03,884
Thirteen minutes.

206
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,819
We got all of
the infected tissue.

207
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,587
That's annoying.

208
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,723
It was necessary
to save your life.

209
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,092
No, I meant your phone.

210
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,393
Oh. It is.

211
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,962
I bet it's your girlfriend.

212
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,098
How did you know?

213
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,768
Only annoying girlfriends
text that much.

214
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,237
I used to text my
boyfriend all the time.

215
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,438
It annoyed him, too.

216
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,810
I am supposed to flirt with her,

217
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,345
and I don't know how.

218
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,747
Did your boyfriend
break up with you

219
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:35,983
because you were annoying?

220
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,184
No. He died.

221
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:42,155
That's the downside
of outliving your prognosis.

222
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,324
You outlive everyone else's too.

223
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,126
That is a downside.

224
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:49,429
Get out your phone.

225
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,098
Hmm.

226
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,499
I'll tell you what to type.

227
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,601
I'm really good at phone sex.

228
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,970
It's the only kind
of sex I can have.

229
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,538
We haven't had sex.

230
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,474
I'll stick to foreplay.

231
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,742
No, thank you.

232
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,513
Do you text your parents?
Or are they dead too?

233
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,518
My parents are in Denver.

234
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,923
My dad's job
transferred them there.

235
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,891
They always wanted
to live near the snow.

236
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:25,398
They're outdoorsy,
and I'm, you know, not.

237
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:31,471
I am not close
to my parents either.

238
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,306
I have autism, and they don't.

239
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,244
I need to listen to your lungs.

240
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,485
I just got really dizzy.

241
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,357
What's going on?

242
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,770
You have an infection.

243
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,845
Temperature is 103.6.
BP is 80/50.

244
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,747
She's showing
early signs of sepsis.

245
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,883
Start her on a course
of IV immunoglobulin therapy,

246
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,352
ADA-enzyme replacement
and GM-CSF.

247
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:20,653
Okay.

248
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,922
I think we can do more
than treat her infection...

249
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,891
Gene replacement therapy.

250
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,094
We harvest her stem cells
and use a retroviral vector

251
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,497
to transduce her DNA
with the modified ADA gene.

252
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,831
If it works, she's cured.

253
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,500
And if it doesn't work,
she dies.

254
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,203
There's a 50% chance her body
will have an acute toxic reaction.

255
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,413
We're going to treat
the infection.

256
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,838
She'll get another infection.

257
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,340
And another, and another,

258
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,375
and eventually,
one of them will kill her.

259
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,253
You don't know that.
She's already beaten the odds.

260
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,779
By cutting herself off
from the world.

261
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,116
Traditional treatment
is the safer course.

262
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,355
He's blowing off steam.

263
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,823
He's with the doctors.
He's safe.

264
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,758
He's scared and overwhelmed,

265
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,469
and obviously he felt like
he couldn't tell us...

266
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,063
Because you've been keeping
him under lock and key.

267
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,331
I'm protecting him.

268
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,705
We have to stay strong.

269
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,643
I think Charlie
knows you're strong.

270
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,612
And he knows you love him.

271
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,391
But the moment you all
heard the word "cancer,"

272
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,584
everything in
Charlie's life changed.

273
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,121
And I think he needs to know
that, at some point,

274
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,790
it's going to start to feel
like his life again.

275
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,640
My mom and dad used to do
these things called

276
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,243
spontaneous
family adventure days...

277
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:51,444
SFADs.

278
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,549
They were pretty lame.
But they let me skip school.

279
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,487
Got to go to baseball games,

280
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,156
drive around with blaring music.

281
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:08,061
I got to eat food that was
inorganic and genetically modified.

282
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,798
Sometimes I even got to
stay up past midnight.

283
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,679
Now we go
to doctor's appointments.

284
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,517
And my mom makes lists.

285
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,186
And cries.

286
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,027
And my dad's... quiet.

287
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,200
Just one more quick stop.

288
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,836
Morgan, Andrews is
expecting us to...

289
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,205
Please, just 20 more minutes.

290
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,841
Fifteen.

291
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,584
Park told me you rejected
his gene therapy idea.

292
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,822
We can't dismiss plausible
treatment options out of fear.

293
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,858
It's not fear.

294
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,526
It's a reasonable
degree of caution.

295
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,862
Since when are you cautious?

296
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,568
The benefit of the cure
may be worth the risk.

297
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,835
Let Park take it to her.

298
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,374
No. It's not worth it.

299
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,276
The cure is riskier
in the short term,

300
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,244
but the long-term upside
is much greater.

301
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:34,147
We can give you the chance to live a
long, healthy, normal life.

302
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,983
No, you can't.

303
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,286
I've been a freak my whole life.

304
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,889
And curing my disease,
letting me take a breath of fresh air,

305
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,224
it's not gonna make me normal.

306
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,959
Increase the oxygen
to 15 liters.

307
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,295
Start her on the IVIG.

308
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,134
We need to let her rest.

309
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,310
I'm a freak, too.

310
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,747
People have called me that

311
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,916
because I am not neurotypical.

312
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,287
And I used to be alone,

313
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:16,823
like you.

314
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,294
Sometimes that was easier.

315
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:25,832
Because it is hard
to be around people

316
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,900
when you're not like them.

317
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:31,938
But now I have Dr. Glassman,

318
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,806
and a roommate who is a girl,

319
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,709
and a girlfriend who is only
annoying some of the time.

320
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:40,380
And I think it is better
than being alone.

321
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,753
If you're... cured,

322
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:50,357
you can be... "outdoorsy"

323
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,425
like your parents.

324
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:55,127
Or you can stay inside
and have phone sex.

325
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,966
It will be your choice.

326
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,711
The next time you go over
my head will be the last.

327
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,183
Prep her for
the gene replacement.

328
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,589
Nice work, Shaun.

329
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,528
No. No way.

330
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:30,997
He's going blind.

331
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,500
It's his last chance
to see a naked woman.

332
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,703
You're a woman.

333
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,536
I bet under those clothes,
you're a naked one.

334
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,541
I'm his sister.

335
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,545
I'll slip you 50 bucks.

336
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,293
My budget proposal,
for your approval.

337
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,696
Surgical cases, for your review.

338
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,998
Before the board meeting
tomorrow night.

339
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,071
The pregnant woman...

340
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:14,407
How's Neil taking it?

341
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,909
Five minutes, please.
I'm with Dr. Lim.

342
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:20,079
I see there's a new member
on the clinic team.

343
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,247
How's that going?

344
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,983
Well, it's been half-a-day.
We're working out the kinks.

345
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,422
Well, if it's still smooth-sailing
by close of business,

346
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:31,257
let me know your secret.

347
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,192
I guess that answers
my initial question.

348
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,796
He keeps telling me he's fine.

349
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,165
You're the last person
he'd tell if he weren't.

350
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,201
I'd be the second to last.

351
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,605
I'm almost done.

352
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,742
You're the President.

353
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,913
He has to listen when you talk.
Or, pretend to.

354
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,885
Hey, the four-year-old with the ear
infection has been here half an hour,

355
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,320
his mother just pulled
out fingerpaints.

356
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:02,422
You need to go.

357
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,793
Debbie, this is Dr. Lim,
Chief of Surgery.

358
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,662
I know. It's very impressive.

359
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:12,064
Come back if you get
an ear infection.

360
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,670
One more. No.

361
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:19,839
We're done.

362
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,408
The surgery can't start
without me.

363
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:24,544
Where are we going next?
Yosemite? The Great Wall?

364
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:26,121
The top of Everest?
It's never gonna be enough.

365
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,480
Claire, stop.

366
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:31,250
You can't pack a lifetime of things
you're gonna miss into one day.

367
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,621
Your situation sucks,
and it is unfair.

368
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:37,023
But you know what, life
sucks, and it's unfair,

369
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,192
and things end
before we're ready.

370
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,328
We are going back. Now.

371
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,039
No.

372
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,050
I'm not gonna have the surgery.

373
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:15,895
How long before I know

374
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:18,831
if I've let you talk me
into something really stupid?

375
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:23,135
You could have an acute
toxic reaction and die

376
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:24,571
in the next 24 hours.

377
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:28,074
But we hope to see some positive
sign your body is responding soon.

378
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,713
Okay.

379
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,215
Your transfusion is done.
We'll check on you in a half-hour.

380
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,417
Dr. Murphy.

381
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:43,590
Would you... Sit with me?

382
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,111
What do you want to know?

383
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:08,848
Nothing. I...

384
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,883
I just want someone to be here.

385
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,056
In case I croak.

386
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:20,827
Hmm.

387
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:25,832
It's probably all your
annoying girlfriend wants, too.

388
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,301
Just to know you're there.

389
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:35,141
Carly's in good health
and unlikely to die soon.

390
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,245
Some girls have all the luck.

391
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,323
Debbie!

392
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,494
You bellowed?

393
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:56,929
This thing is broken.

394
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:59,174
Can you call someone from I.T.
and send them over, please?

395
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:02,434
Oh, I meant to tell you that
I, um, upgraded our software.

396
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,303
It's gonna be faster,
more efficient.

397
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,205
Not if I don't know
how to use it.

398
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:09,475
You can't just change my entire
software system without asking me.

399
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,310
I didn't change it.
I upgraded it.

400
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,444
There.

401
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:14,080
Or kick out my Chief of Surgery.

402
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,616
Or interrupt my appointments.

403
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,184
You'll be here 20 hours a day

404
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,852
if you don't stick
to a schedule.

405
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,353
It's my call.

406
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,255
I'm not here
to slap on Band-Aids

407
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,291
or to write prescriptions.

408
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:27,960
That woman had serious issues
we needed to discuss.

409
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:30,262
The one with the rodent
in her purse?

410
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,799
It's a squirrel.
It's a Northern flying squirrel.

411
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:34,601
You weren't gonna fix
whatever issues she has

412
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:35,678
with an extra five minutes.

413
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:38,805
It's my clinic, okay?
I decide how it runs!

414
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,142
Okay.

415
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:47,379
I thought that you wanted
me to be a part of it.

416
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,682
You know,
to actually help and to...

417
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:52,985
Make changes, have opinions.

418
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:56,155
But if that's not what you
want, then I...

419
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,657
I should do what I promised...

420
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,459
I quit.

421
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:07,199
You're out of sutures.

422
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:25,718
I'm sorry.

423
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,856
I... I shouldn't
have said any of that.

424
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,729
I lost somebody recently.

425
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,068
And it hurts.

426
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,602
A lot.

427
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:48,775
And I took it out on you,
and that is unfair.

428
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,148
But if you don't
have this surgery,

429
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:02,755
you won't ever drink another
slushy at a baseball game.

430
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:06,558
Or feel the wind in your hair
when you speed down the road.

431
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:07,727
Or...

432
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:11,030
Or touch a naked woman.

433
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:17,937
Now, this sucks.

434
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,471
It really, really sucks.

435
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,409
But it will get less sucky.

436
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:29,749
And the part that
hurts so much right now

437
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:32,618
will start to hurt less.

438
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:37,957
And life goes on,

439
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,959
and you will have
wonderful moments,

440
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,828
and you will have sucky moments.

441
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,764
And it will be your life.

442
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:47,934
And it'll be a good life,
Charlie.

443
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,772
I suspect it might
even be a great life.

444
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,852
Oh, thank God.

445
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:07,019
Sorry it took a while.

446
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:09,188
Car trouble.

447
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:13,459
Welcome back, Charlie.

448
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:14,972
You had some good
people very worried.

449
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,263
I'm really sorry.

450
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:20,132
You guys can ground me forever for
this, but I just...

451
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,168
I just wanted to have
one last day of fun.

452
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,839
We can be fun, too. Again.

453
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,010
I was thinking

454
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,813
it might be time
to reintroduce the SFADs.

455
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:38,017
Baseball games, concerts,
staying up late.

456
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,551
That sounds pretty lame.

457
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:44,824
We're running a little late,

458
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,158
and we need to get you prepped.

459
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:55,534
I'm sorry. I need
some 5-0 nylon sutures.

460
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:59,872
And apparently we need to talk.

461
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,576
You can report back to the
Chief of Surgery that I'm fine.

462
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,328
You don't have to talk to me.
You don't have to talk to her.

463
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,387
But you need to talk to someone.

464
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:18,157
I'm not a med student, Aaron.
I've lost patients before.

465
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,692
But you never lost someone
who should have lived.

466
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,929
No one would be fine.
I wouldn't be.

467
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:24,196
You're not fine.

468
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,433
If for no other reason than
your boss doesn't think so.

469
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:28,634
And the bigger problem

470
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,837
is your girlfriend
agrees with her.

471
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,062
We'll be right there
as soon as you wake up.

472
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,988
We love you so much.

473
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:24,756
I love you, too.

474
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:46,578
We'll take good care of him.

475
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:47,679
Thank you.

476
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:00,326
You ready?

477
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,166
Yeah.

478
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,709
I forgot to take his vitals.

479
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:20,646
I'm sorry.

480
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,119
Go ahead, I'll...
I'll bring him out.

481
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,394
I-I thought
you already took my...

482
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,863
Shut up.

483
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,804
We're bringing the patient down now.
Vitals okay?

484
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,207
Temp might be a little up,
but he's ready now.

485
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:02,321
I just need you
to count back from 10.

486
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:05,224
Ten...

487
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,226
Nine...

488
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,228
Eight...

489
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,863
Seven...

490
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:14,666
Six...

491
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,402
Five...

492
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,088
You were right.

493
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:38,991
I'm not fine.

494
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,928
It's okay not to be fine.

495
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:51,803
You can't blame yourself.

496
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,139
I was the one holding the knife.

497
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:54,606
The blame lies with me.

498
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,648
But the responsibility is ours.

499
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,919
Yours and... mine?

500
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:10,189
Yes.

501
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:12,991
You're not objective about me

502
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:14,293
because of our relationship.

503
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:16,528
If we weren't together,

504
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:18,882
I'm not sure you would've agreed
to let me do that surgery.

505
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:25,537
You honestly believe
I approved a procedure

506
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:26,681
that I didn't think you could do

507
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,307
because we're sleeping together?

508
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,976
No. You thought I could do it.

509
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,044
That's the problem.

510
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:37,616
I think your personal feelings

511
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,918
may have led you
to overestimate me.

512
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:44,623
You came to me.

513
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:48,360
You sold me the surgery,

514
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:50,196
told me that
you could pull it off.

515
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:54,600
And now I'm at fault because
I believed that you...

516
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:55,701
It's not about fault.

517
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,104
It's about being aware

518
00:33:58,137 --> 00:33:59,971
so that this doesn't
happen again.

519
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:02,441
It will happen again.

520
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:06,478
I will make decisions.
You will have bad outcomes.

521
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:10,316
That doesn't mean
either of us was wrong.

522
00:34:12,118 --> 00:34:15,087
My approval had nothing to
do with our relationship.

523
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:19,091
We can't know that for sure.

524
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,330
If we weren't dating,
that woman might still be alive.

525
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,067
And we both have
to live with that.

526
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,344
Mom?

527
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:39,911
Dad?

528
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,046
We're here, honey.

529
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,181
We're right here.

530
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,818
You did so good.

531
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:48,220
We're so proud of you, buddy.

532
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,190
Charlie.

533
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,525
It's Dr. Reznick.
How are you feeling?

534
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,595
Not awesome.

535
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:00,466
Are you in any pain?

536
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:02,534
No.

537
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:03,769
No, I'm okay.

538
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:07,506
I'll let you rest.

539
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:10,108
Wait, Dr. Reznick.

540
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:12,611
Yes?

541
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,781
Thank you so much.

542
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,249
For everything.

543
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,785
You're welcome.

544
00:35:21,387 --> 00:35:22,788
And Dr. Browne?

545
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:26,758
Dr. Browne, are you here?

546
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,429
Your T-cell count has increased.

547
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,264
And your fever dropped to 99.3.

548
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:33,608
Your body's fighting
the infection.

549
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,034
So, what does that mean?
I'm cured?

550
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,036
It's too early
to use that word exactly.

551
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,381
We'll need to keep you
in isolation

552
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:40,706
for a few more weeks
to make sure

553
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,541
that your immune system
is developing on pace.

554
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:48,347
And there is still a 5% to 7%
chance of a toxic reaction.

555
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:52,150
But yes, the cure
appears to be working.

556
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,729
You should tell your
parents the good news.

557
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:57,723
What are they gonna do?
Feed me juice through a straw?

558
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:01,960
They could just be here.

559
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,232
I'm fine.

560
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,435
Let us know
if you need anything.

561
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:10,868
I'll check in on you
in the morning.

562
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,007
Thank you.

563
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,511
For not killing me.

564
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,448
You're welcome.

565
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:25,517
Oh, there is still
a 5% to 7% chance of a...

566
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:27,619
Shaun. She knows.

567
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:50,536
Aaron, you...
You do not owe me a gift.

568
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:53,672
I owe you an apology.

569
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:58,243
I was out of line today.
I was pushing way too hard.

570
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,645
It's not a gift.

571
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:04,483
Oh...

572
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,053
Is it punishment?

573
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,388
Nurses swear by them.

574
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:12,391
The arch supports are
supposed to be spectacular.

575
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,927
I'm not coming back
to the clinic.

576
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:20,332
It was a bad idea,
terribly executed.

577
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,540
Two of the smartest
women I know,

578
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:31,810
my wife and my
new office manager,

579
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:35,080
think that I need
to make some changes.

580
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,282
You wanted to help,
you wanted to be a part of my life,

581
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,784
I fought it.

582
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,588
I proposed,
and then I freaked out.

583
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:43,789
Mm-hmm. We got married...

584
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,491
You freaked out again.
Yes, I did.

585
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:46,725
But for a legitimate reason.

586
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:49,495
There was a gun in the house,
but that's not the point.

587
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:52,598
The point is that,
in the midst of all of this...

588
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:55,233
I took on not one,

589
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,102
but two jobs at the hospital.

590
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:58,169
Yeah, which you love.

591
00:38:58,203 --> 00:38:59,805
Not more than you.

592
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:05,110
Mm.

593
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,014
Come back to the clinic.

594
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,885
Do I get to boss you around?

595
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,022
A little.

596
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,358
Let's go upstairs.

597
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:41,547
Charlie asked for you.

598
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,518
You connected with him.

599
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,522
I said what I had to
to get him into surgery.

600
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:52,190
Nah.

601
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,525
You were your old self again.

602
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,993
My old self...

603
00:39:57,763 --> 00:40:00,432
Was always there for everyone.

604
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:05,871
Was giving away pieces
of herself over and over.

605
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,580
Charlie is still blind.

606
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,121
It was a hell of a day.

607
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,125
The blind kid
didn't get me depressed.

608
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,028
You, on the other hand...

609
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:35,033
Deal with your crap

610
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:36,902
before this is
who you really become.

611
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,357
Hey, this is Audrey.
You know what to do.

611
00:41:33,305 --> 00:42:33,797

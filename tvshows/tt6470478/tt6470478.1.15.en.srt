No, it's a swanky,

You think a hospital

That's even older
than Dr. Melendez.

40
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:46,653
DR. MELENDEZ: Dr. Murphy
is a talented doctor who has autism,

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,823
which sometimes causes him to ask
inappropriate questions.

42

No worries. Inappropriate 
questions can be very revealing.

Park's being modest,
which is very unlike him.

Why didn't they repair it
when she was an infant?

00:03:12,711 --> 00:03:14,679
They couldn't. Her rib cage

00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,023
It doesn't matter
if it's true.

161
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,592
What matters is that
we find a replacement.

162
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:15,660
I need you to get me
a meeting with Aiden Coulter.

163
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:17,093
Oh, Aiden Coulter?
Yes.

164
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,562
Oh. What?
I sat next to him once

165
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:20,863
at an A's game.

166
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:22,164
And the story I remember
is that you two

167
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,331
were talking smack
that entire game,

168
00:06:24,398 --> 00:06:26,100
and after he spilled
his beer on you

169
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,234
and insisted on buying you
a new jacket,

170
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:29,402
you refused him.

171
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,104
So he owes you.

172
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:33,507
Just get me a meeting. I'll handle 
everything from there.

173
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:36,341
Okay.

174
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:38,143
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.

175
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,512
You're welcome.

176
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:49,423
Huh.

177
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:52,260
JARED:
You'll be fine.

178
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:53,896
You've had
liver biopsies before.

179
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:56,432
And they've always
hurt a lot.

180
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,469
Please,
isn't there another way?

181
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:00,639
Well, the other way, Eric,
would going through your neck,

182
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:02,341
and I don't think
you'd like that anymore.

183
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:04,377
Eric, do you know
why NBA players

184
00:07:04,444 --> 00:07:06,014
all wear headphones
before games?

185
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,682
Don't look at him.
Look at me.

186
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:09,216
I need you to answer me.

187
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:11,884
Why do NBA players wear
headphones before games?

188
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:13,553
I don't know.

189
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,187
I guess they like music.

190
00:07:15,254 --> 00:07:16,822
No, they need music.

191
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:19,024
Music helps them forget
about everything else

192
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,525
and focus
on what's important...

193
00:07:20,591 --> 00:07:22,693
The game.

194
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,028
Who's your favorite player?

195
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:25,095
Curry.

196
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:26,831
Okay.

197
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:30,068
This is the song he listens to
before every game.

198
00:07:30,936 --> 00:07:32,037
How do you know?

199
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:34,673
Because he's my favorite
player, too.

200
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,709
I want you to close your eyes
and focus on this.

201
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:39,810
Just this.

202
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:43,412
It's cold.

203
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,481
Yeah, now it is,
but if you stay focused,

204
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,015
pretty soon,
it'll stop feeling cold

205
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:48,283
and start to feel warm.

206
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,252
When that happens,
I want you to nod your head,

207
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:53,590
and you'll feel some pressure
and a small pinch.

208
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:54,891
What if it does...

209
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,461
Then close your eyes
and focus.

210
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:04,302
You ready?

211
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:19,453
Two minutes
and he'll be good to go.

212
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,122
How'd you know
he was a basketball fan?

213
00:08:22,056 --> 00:08:23,925
His shoes.

214
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:25,425
He's not wearing
any shoes.

215
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:26,960
Yeah, they're in
a backpack in his room.

216
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:30,163
You searched
his backpack?

217
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,397
Well, it's, um, less invasive
than a rectal,

218
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:35,297
and most of the time
more useful.

219
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,801
Okay, Spirit,
just keep still and...

220
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:42,969
And during a few parts
of the exam,

221
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:44,171
we may ask you
to hold your breath,

222
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:45,907
but it'll only be
a few seconds.

223
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:47,743
You got it.

224
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,647
(WHIRRING)

225
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:52,682
You gonna buy a tux
or rent one?

226
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:55,953
The fundraiser
is black tie.

227
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,322
I have a suit.

228
00:08:57,388 --> 00:08:58,757
It's new.

229
00:08:58,824 --> 00:09:01,460
I bought it
for my resident interviews.

230
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:03,263
It doesn't matter
how new it is.

231
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,798
It's not a tux.

232
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:08,834
Wearing a uniform at work
reassures patients.

233
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,768
Wearing a uniform
at a party

234
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:13,302
does nothing but make you
hot and uncomfortable.

235
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:15,303
This party is work.

236
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,571
Get a tux.

237
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,674
And not a crappy one
from some outlet store.

238
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:21,109
Get fitted by a pro and
spend a minimum of two grand.

239
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:23,178
You're gonna meet rich people
who can help your career,

240
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:24,613
and they're not gonna want
to help some slob in a...

241
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,381
I'm not a slob.

242
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:28,317
No, I am very clean

243
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:30,387
and make sure my clothes
are never wrinkled.

244
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:32,089
And it's too big.

245
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:35,193
Her heart.

246
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,365
It's enlarged 53%
since her last exam.

247
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:42,369
Her last exam was only
six months ago.

248
00:09:42,435 --> 00:09:44,204
It won't fit.

249
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:46,374
Too big.

250
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,877
The biopsy confirmed
acute cellular rejection.

251
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:50,779
We maximized his 
immuno-suppressives, but, uh...

252
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:53,180
I found one.
A Type-O liver.

253
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:54,782
Are you sure?

254
00:09:54,848 --> 00:09:56,784
Park and I checked the registry,
and there weren't any.

255
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,417
I found it online.

256
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:00,218
He, uh... He already tried
to make a direct donation

257
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:01,318
a few months ago,

258
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:03,052
but the patient died
before the surgery.

259
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:05,953
I contacted him,
which wasn't easy,

260
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,053
but he still wants
to be a donor.

261
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,389
That's amazing.

262
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:10,457
Great job.

263
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:12,729
What's the catch?

264
00:10:12,796 --> 00:10:14,599
He wants to be a donor,
but he's not on the registry?

265
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,904
I mean, there's got
to be a catch.

266
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,840
He, uh... He can't
be on the registry

267
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:21,775
because he is in prison.

268
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:24,377
For murder.

269
00:10:24,444 --> 00:10:27,314
Actually, um,
seven murders.

270
00:10:33,286 --> 00:10:37,524
Boris Tirayan was a Russian Mafia 
enforcer convicted of seven murders.

271
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,291
Who now wants
to make amends.

272
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:41,060
He tried to be a donor
a few months ago,

273
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:43,762
but the patient died before 
the red tape could be worked out.

274
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:45,530
But now that it has...

275
00:10:45,596 --> 00:10:48,432
Are there any laws against
an inmate becoming a donor?

276
00:10:48,498 --> 00:10:50,934
No, but there is
a ton of liability.

277
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,269
What if he attacks
someone here?

278
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,638
He'll be guarded
by state prison guards

279
00:10:53,705 --> 00:10:54,874
on a separate level,

280
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:56,744
away from patients
and all non-essential staff.

281
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,012
Everyone deserves the chance
to turn their life around.

282
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:00,480
The guy wants
to do something decent,

283
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:01,781
we should let him.

284
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:04,183
I don't think we owe
a murderer anything.

285
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,086
But maybe he owes us something.
He has a debt to society.

286
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:10,724
Which he would repay by
donating his inner organs.

287
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,059
Isn't it
a slippery slope

288
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,626
between a guy
who wants to make amends

289
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:14,895
and turning
our prison system

290
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:16,663
into a superstore
for body parts?

291
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,866
A slippery slope that
saves a child's life.

292
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:22,300
It'll never happen. He's just trying
to get a hospital,

293
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:23,769
where it'll be
easier to escape.

294
00:11:23,835 --> 00:11:26,070
You have no idea
what his motivation is.

295
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:28,137
I know he's a
lying sociopath

296
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:29,305
who doesn't care
about anyone but himself.

297
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:31,673
He's been a model inmate
for nine years.

298
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,341
Tutors other prisoners
in the library...

299
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:35,043
Yeah, because he's trying
to get someone to trust him,

300
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,979
to give him an inch,
and as soon as they do...

301
00:11:37,712 --> 00:11:39,281
We got approval.

302
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:41,083
He's gonna stall,
make excuses,

303
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:42,950
and when he sees his chance,
someone's gonna get hurt.

304
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:45,419
I think it's worth
taking that chance.

305
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:48,722
Anybody who doesn't agree,
feel free to sit this one out.

306
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,295
DR. REZNICK: When you started
menstruating,

307
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:57,232
the increased oestrogen
caused pulmonary hypertension,

308
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,468
which isn't a surgical issue
in itself,

309
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:01,604
but along with your
atypical vascular system...

310
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,241
Your heart's
grown too big.

311
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,377
DR. LIM: We will control
your blood pressure

312
00:12:06,444 --> 00:12:09,249
so that you will keep growing
but your heart won't,

313
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:10,851
and then, by the time you're 18,
we'll able to...

314
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:11,953
No.

315
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,788
I'm not waiting
any longer.

316
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:15,123
Spirit, honey,
it will be okay.

317
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:16,524
No, it won't!

318
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,893
I'm sick of being stuck inside
all the time.

319
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:21,395
I'm sick of this!

320
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:26,667
I don't ever want to text,
call, or video chat again.

321
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:28,436
Mom,
I want to be touched.

322
00:12:30,771 --> 00:12:32,206
I want to be shoved.

323
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,344
I want to be punched.
I don't even care, just...

324
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,445
Please.

325
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,248
Please.

326
00:12:42,582 --> 00:12:44,351
I want this surgery now.

327
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:52,192
I need it.

328
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:57,198
I'm sorry.
We can't.

329
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:06,507
We need to get rid of
all the furniture and artwork.

330
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:09,243
I get removing the paintings,
but the furniture?

331
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,845
Don't want the prison guards
sitting down on the job.

332
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:13,679
He's gonna be
in full restraints,

333
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:14,880
cuffed to the bed.

334
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:16,380
Well, that's our plan,

335
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:19,547
but we also need to be
prepared for his plan.

336
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:21,916
Okay, we need to get rid of 
the window blinds, curtain rods,

337
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:23,683
jacket hooks, and make sure
there's no metal rivets

338
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,384
or eyelets
on the mattress.

339
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,420
Um, what's he gonna do
with a metal eyelet?

340
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:29,356
Tear it off the mattress
and file it down

341
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:31,326
to cut your jugular, or
bend it into a handcuff key,

342
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,496
or shove it into
an electric socket

343
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,333
to create a spark
and start a fire.

344
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,735
I've seen knives made out of
toilet paper, soap, and salt

345
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:41,704
that could amputate
a fat guy's femur.

346
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:53,813
Not quite sure he needed
the part about the guy being fat.

347
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,450
(BOTH LAUGH)

348
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:59,754
So, I've been thinking.

349
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:01,456
You want to go to
the fundraiser together?

350
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:03,927
It's not a prom.
We don't have to bring a date.

351
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:06,463
Yeah, we don't have to.

352
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,901
But we can,
if we want.

353
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:11,402
Everyone basically knows
we're seeing each other,

354
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:13,304
but still...

355
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:15,241
I think it might be
a nice opportunity

356
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:18,678
to take our relationship
out into the open.

357
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,447
Unless
you don't want to.

358
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:25,013
No, it's a good idea.

359
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,214
Are you sure?

360
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:27,682
Because, you know,
we don't have to.

361
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:29,985
Yeah.
Let's do it.

362
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,288
(CELLPHONES CHIME)

363
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:37,393
Let's go.

364
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,594
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

365
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:40,097
What's wrong?

366
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:41,666
WALLACE: It's fine.
He'll be all right.

367
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:43,334
No, I won't. I don't
want a murderer's liver!

368
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:44,703
It's evil!

369
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,772
(SIGHS) Eric,
there's no such thing

370
00:14:46,838 --> 00:14:47,839
as a good
or bad liver.

371
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:50,008
It's just a...
Just an organ.

372
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:52,010
CLAIRE: Eric,
this is your only choice.

373
00:14:52,077 --> 00:14:55,113
If we don't do the transplant,
you will die.

374
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,714
ERIC: I don't want him
to be a part of me,

375
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:58,649
inside me forever,
all right?

376
00:14:58,716 --> 00:15:00,685
I don't care what you
or anybody else says, okay?

377
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:02,853
It's my body,
and I don't want it!

378
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:08,994
That's ridiculous.

379
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,361
Personality traits aren't transferred in
an organ transplant.

380
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:12,562
It's also irrelevant.

381
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:13,896
Children don't consent
to surgeries,

382
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:15,598
their parents do.

383
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,532
But if he doesn't cooperate
with the anti-rejection regimen,

384
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:19,833
we could be wasting a liver
that could save someone else's life.

385
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,468
DR. PARK: No one's
getting saved by Tirayan.

386
00:15:21,535 --> 00:15:22,904
I found a Type-A donor.
It's not a perfect match, but...

387
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:25,173
His body's already
rejected a perfect match.

388
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,373
There's no way it can tolerate
an incompatible blood type.

389
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,175
CLAIRE: No, the only way
to save Eric

390
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:31,044
is to do the transplant
with Tirayan's liver.

391
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:32,178
That is it.

392
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:33,980
We have
no other option.

393
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,785
Let the O.R. know we're gonna
need more restraints.

394
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:43,689
Dr. Clinton Ford
out of Alberta

395
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:46,392
developed an experimental
resorbable material.

396
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,461
It would allow us
to expand her rib cage

397
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:50,663
and create room
to fit her heart inside.

398
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,234
DR. LIM:
An artificial sternum.

399
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,802
DR. REZNICK: That would actually
grow along with the patient.

400
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:57,506
The surgery
isn't reversible.

401
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:58,941
If it doesn't work,

402
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:01,511
we can't just move her heart
back to where it was.

403
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:03,213
It would allow her
to have a life.

404
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,050
She has a life,
and she'll be healthy

405
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,683
as long as she stays
out of crowds,

406
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,851
doesn't hug anyone,

407
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,486
or do anything
where she might fall.

408
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,421
I get you're autistic,
but I know even you realize

409
00:16:13,488 --> 00:16:16,124
when a patient cries and throws
her phone against the wall,

410
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:18,192
they're not happy
with their current health.

411
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:19,893
There's no reason
to make this personal.

412
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,828
DR. REZNICK: There is if his medical
judgement is biased.

413
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:25,033
I saw she was upset.

414
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,236
You saw it,
but you didn't understand it.

415
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:31,106
You're very competitive.

416
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:34,243
Are you trying to make
Dr. Lim think I'm biased,

417
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,313
or are you trying
to undermine my confidence?

418
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,548
I'm actually trying
to help you and the patient.

419
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:41,250
She wants to be able
to rub elbows,

420
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:44,287
and you need to learn
how to trade elbows.

421
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:48,691
DR. LIM: The resorbable plate
is experimental and risky.

422
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:52,695
But my medical judgement
is that it's worth it.

423
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,299
Make sure she agrees
and then get her prepped.

424
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,641
Why me?

425
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,444
I'm not famous, I don't know
anything about medicine,

426
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:08,813
and giving the keynote speech
at your fundraiser

427
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:11,250
is a steep price to pay
for a beer-stained jacket.

428
00:17:15,655 --> 00:17:17,824
You grew up
in San Jose.

429
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:23,093
You went to San Jose State despite 
being accepted by both Princeton and MIT,

430
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,760
and you headquartered
your company here,

431
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:28,096
despite huge tax breaks offered 
by Chicago and Minneapolis.

432
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:29,563
And it was
his favorite jacket.

433
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,303
Well, when I offered
to have it cleaned,

434
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,172
he said not to bother because 
he didn't even like the jacket.

435
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:35,340
He was being polite.
Polite?

436
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:36,874
I take it you've never been
to a game with him.

437
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:41,778
You did some homework,
but not enough.

438
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:43,613
I love this city,
but I have giving speeches.

439
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,015
So don't give a speech.

440
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:48,050
Tell us a story.

441
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:49,685
Like the one you told
at the wrap party

442
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,019
at the Youth Dance company's
fall musical.

443
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:53,020
The one where you got lost
at the Paris catacombs.

444
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,991
I stand corrected.

445
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:59,628
Your success
is inspiring, Aiden,

446
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:02,699
as well as your loyalty
to this city.

447
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:05,503
And the fact that you're young,
apparently very funny...

448
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,538
I'm in.

449
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:08,973
Actually, I was in
as soon as Aaron told me

450
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,376
what you wanted
to meet about.

451
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:14,011
But I was curious what
your attack strategy would be.

452
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:15,513
So, how was it?

453
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,047
It was very effective.

454
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:50,382
DR. PARK:
Now, don't worry.

455
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:51,917
He's been a model inmate
for nine years

456
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:54,521
and tutors the other
prisoners in the library.

457
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,436
Coke nail come in handy
up at Pelican Bay?

458
00:19:09,502 --> 00:19:10,770
I make jewelry.

459
00:19:10,837 --> 00:19:13,072
Helps me
pick up the beads.

460
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:16,309
Is there a history of cancer
or liver disease in your family?

461
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:17,844
I went through this
a couple of months ago.

462
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,710
You have my file.

463
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:21,510
We need to do
our own exam.

464
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,610
CLAIRE: And there's nothing
about your family in previous records.

465
00:19:23,677 --> 00:19:24,744
Are they still alive?

466
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,044
They're dead to me.

467
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,180
Quit stalling, or we'll
send you back right now.

468
00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:34,757
I haven't spoken to anyone
in my family since I was 15 years old.

469
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:37,661
Last I know, uh, both my parents
were healthy enough

470
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:40,466
to kick the crap out of me
on a daily basis.

471
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:43,603
Any other questions?

472
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,203
Why do you want
to do this?

473
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:48,139
Maybe I just like, uh,
cute nurses and bad Jell-o.

474
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:50,241
Why do you care?
We don't.

475
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:52,141
As long as you do
what you're told.

476
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:54,777
Don't worry.

477
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:57,145
I'm very good
at following orders.

478
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,756
Councilman Burns must be
very happy with his facelift.

479
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:10,658
He just bought another table
for the fundraiser.

480
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:13,597
I aim to please,
but you already knew that.

481
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:15,633
And I need to get into surgery,
so stop being so coy.

482
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,901
What's up?

483
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,340
You and Isabel always
seem very happy,

484
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:24,075
able to manage both your 
professional and personal lives.

485
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:27,980
I'm flattered you think so,
but still a bit coy.

486
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:30,283
When I met with Aiden Coulter
about being our keynote,

487
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,551
I thought there was a spark.

488
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:33,853
Okay, so now we're
getting somewhere.

489
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,622
Surgery can wait
a few minutes.

490
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:40,790
Is it unprofessional of me
to explore it?

491
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:42,157
He's not
a hospital employee,

492
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:44,959
but potentially
a significant donor

493
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:46,927
and younger.

494
00:20:46,993 --> 00:20:47,993
Quite a bit.

495
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,262
Mm-hmm.

496
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:52,970
I don't know, maybe I'm
just imagining something

497
00:20:53,037 --> 00:20:54,373
that doesn't even exist.

498
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,573
Oh, I doubt that.

499
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,541
You're an attractive, smart,
interesting woman.

500
00:20:57,607 --> 00:20:59,543
I'm sure
there was a spark.

501
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:02,243
But you can't date a donor
like Coulter.

502
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,479
Sorry.

503
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:06,380
There's no actual policy
against it.

504
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:09,115
I'm not talking policy,
I'm talking optics.

505
00:21:09,182 --> 00:21:11,017
The last thing you want
is someone thinking

506
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:13,553
you'd use sex
to get a big donation.

507
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,324
It's a double standard,
I know,

508
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:19,462
but it's the world
we live in.

509
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,565
I said no!
I don't want it!

510
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:24,903
I thought you gave him
something to calm him.

511
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,505
We did,
but he's too agitated.

512
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:28,573
I'm gonna start him
on IV midazolam now.

513
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:31,875
Eric. Eric, remember what Dr. Park said
earlier about focusing?

514
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:33,676
I know you can do that.

515
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:34,943
How about we get those earbuds
you had earlier?

516
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,546
No! Leave me alone!
Eric! Stop it.

517
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,314
Look at me!

518
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,117
Do not move.

519
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:59,705
SHAUN: You wear
very stylish clothes.

520
00:22:00,572 --> 00:22:01,973
Um, thank you.

521
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,175
I assume you mean
when I'm not in surgery.

522
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:07,713
Yes. Do you think people
believe you're a better doctor

523
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:08,779
because of that?

524
00:22:10,415 --> 00:22:12,016
Some people.

525
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:15,352
Others probably just think
I'm a show-off or arrogant, gay.

526
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,988
I don't care.
I do it for myself.

527
00:22:18,055 --> 00:22:19,256
You look good,
you feel good.

528
00:22:19,323 --> 00:22:21,325
Does it help you
make friends?

529
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,029
Feeling good about yourself
helps with everything.

530
00:22:27,897 --> 00:22:30,634
Do you know where I can buy
a stylish tuxedo?

531
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,069
I can pay $2,000.

532
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,671
Okay.

533
00:22:34,738 --> 00:22:36,741
Dr. Reznick says

534
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:39,209
if I want people who matter
to help my career,

535
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:43,281
I need to wear a tuxedo
that costs $2,000 to the fundraiser.

536
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:45,283
Have you talked
to Glassman about this?

537
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,052
No. I make
my own decisions now.

538
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,555
Murphy, people who matter
will help your career

539
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:55,256
because they're impressed
with your talent

540
00:22:55,322 --> 00:22:56,957
and potential
as a surgeon.

541
00:22:57,023 --> 00:22:59,091
And I could send you
to my tailor,

542
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:01,493
where you'll definitely
spend two grand.

543
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,562
But my advice would be
just rent one.

544
00:23:03,628 --> 00:23:05,129
Make sure you get fitted
by the manager,

545
00:23:05,196 --> 00:23:07,365
and for a couple-hundred 
bucks, you'll be fine.

546
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:18,077
I'm gonna need you to count
backwards from 10.

DR. MELENDEZ:
Looks like you were wrong.

00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,993
DR. PARK: I said he'll do anything
to convince us to trust him,

550
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:35,060

So is his tongue. He's having an
allergic reaction.

553

Stop the anesthesia.

Give me 0.5 MGs
epinephrine I.M. now.

We had to intubate you

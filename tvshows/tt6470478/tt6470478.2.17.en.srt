1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,306
<i>Previously on "The Good Doctor"...</i>

2
00:00:02,308 --> 00:00:05,104
<i>Dr. Murphy, you shouldn't
be in contact with patients.</i>

3
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:07,295
Or their families. Do you understand?

4
00:00:07,297 --> 00:00:08,487
Don't be stupid.

5
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:09,708
What? There's no cameras in here.

6
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:15,768
Dr. Lim, Dr. Melendez.

7
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:21,474
I do not want to be a pathologist.

8
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:25,611
Dr. Han, you need to make me
a surgical resident again.

9
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:35,054
Hey.

10
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:38,324
What are you doing up so early?

11
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:39,692
I'm not up early.

12
00:00:39,694 --> 00:00:41,060
I never went to bed.

13
00:00:41,062 --> 00:00:42,895
Oh, my God. Didn't you get my text?

14
00:00:42,897 --> 00:00:44,903
I told you I was spending
the night with Jake.

15
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:51,118
I don't want to be a pathologist.

16
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:52,939
Oh.

17
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:55,608
It's... that still.

18
00:00:57,111 --> 00:00:58,667
Shaun...

19
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:02,921
no one's life goes exactly
like they dreamed as a kid.

20
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:08,154
You're still a doctor.
Still saving lives.

21
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:10,957
Just in a lab instead of
an operating room.

22

23
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:21,934
Where are you going?

24
00:01:21,936 --> 00:01:24,237
I'm going to walk to work.

25
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,239
The hospital's four miles away.

26
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:31,077
Studies have shown that walking
boosts creative inspiration.

27
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,579
- Shaun, I just think...
- You don't understand.

28
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:35,581
You don't understand.

29
00:01:40,054 --> 00:01:41,921
Neither does Dr. Han.

30
00:01:45,893 --> 00:01:48,895
I need to change his mind.

31
00:01:48,897 --> 00:01:50,463
I don't know how.

32
00:01:59,173 --> 00:02:01,774
Mm, we're gonna be late.

33
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:03,276
So stop.

34
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,049
Mm.

35
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:12,451
And don't be smiling at me
when you see me in the hall.

36
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:15,454
I smile at everyone. I'm a friendly guy.

37
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:17,290
You'd be a horrible poker player.

38
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,538
- What're you doing?
- Murphy's on the corner.

39
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,739
Move it.

40
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:35,208
That's not where his bus drops off.

41
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,742
Do you think he saw us?

42
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:37,910
He's not looking over here.

43
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:39,946
Well, that doesn't
mean anything with him.

44
00:02:39,948 --> 00:02:41,848
We got to get out of here
before the light turns.

45
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,218
Let's go! Move it!

46
00:03:02,637 --> 00:03:06,038
Through the generous support of St.
Bonaventure Foundation,

47
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,608
we've been able to transport
Kenny and his mother

48
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,176
from their home in Mississippi.

49
00:03:10,178 --> 00:03:11,444
And we'll be covering the costs

50
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:14,013
of surgery and post-op recovery.

51
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:16,048
And all I have to do
is buy one CD a month

52
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,350
for the next 100 years.

53
00:03:19,187 --> 00:03:21,754
No repayment necessary.

54
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:24,891
We appreciate you allowing us
to share your case

55
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:27,793
as an educational opportunity
for our staff.

56
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:31,030
You know what they say...
those who can't... teach.

57
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:33,633
And as you can see,
I can't do much of anything.

58
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,838
Actually, y'all haven't
really seen anything yet.

59
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,746
How about we get this party started?

60
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:45,244
The neurofibroma started as a small bump

61
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:47,079
near the base of the spine.

62
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:54,553
In less than six months,

63
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:57,957
it encircled his abdomen
and grew to over 100 pounds,

64
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,860
the blood supply becoming so
intertwined with the patient's,

65
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:03,329
it was deemed inoperable.

66
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:05,831
But we've been able to come up
with an innovative surgical plan

67
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,100
that will allow us
to slowly peel the tumor

68
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:11,537
off the front and back
of his torso in one piece

69
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,839
and give Kenny his life back.

00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:27,586
We didn't expect to see you.

72
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:31,023
This is just about logistics,
witness lists, scheduling.

73
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:32,224
The hospital's attorney

74
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:33,960
could've handled this
on his own, Dr. Han.

75
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:36,862
I understand, but I wanted to be here.

76
00:04:36,864 --> 00:04:38,464
Three reasons really.

77
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:40,333
If my doctors are gonna be
judged in this room,

78
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:41,901
I wanted to see the place,

79
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:43,703
see all of you, and see the mood...

80
00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:45,504
Well, we try to make it very casual.

81
00:04:45,506 --> 00:04:48,007
I know.

82
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:49,942
But have you ever been judged?

83
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:51,577
I have.

84
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:53,012
It's scary.

85
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:54,280
Someone has gone to the trouble

86
00:04:54,282 --> 00:04:56,515
of checking out
every aspect of your actions,

87
00:04:56,517 --> 00:04:58,150
every decision you've made.

88
00:04:58,152 --> 00:05:01,220
You don't know what they know,
what they're gonna ask,

89
00:05:01,222 --> 00:05:03,662
what could be misunderstood,
misinterpreted.

90
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:07,693
Also, and this is kind of embarrassing,

91
00:05:07,695 --> 00:05:10,830
but our lawyer...

92
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:13,399
probably not the best.

93
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:15,034
I decided to save a few dollars on him.

94
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:17,470
So I could hire a private investigator...

95
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:19,805
check all of <i>you</i> out.

96
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,274
We're not the ones on trial here.

97
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:24,210
See?

98
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:27,013
You say you make it casual,
and then you call it a trial.

99
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:29,048
Now, I'm sure she won't find anything.

100
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,017
I mean, nothing too crazy, right?

101
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,776
Maybe just something... embarrassing.

102
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:38,238
Maybe a lapse of judgment here or there.

103
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,159
I mean, like I was saying,

104
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:43,095
you parse every choice anyone has made,

105
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:45,297
gonna be a few things
they'd rather not revisit.

106
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:46,532
Am I right?

107
00:05:49,002 --> 00:05:50,202
And the third reason?

108
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:55,107
I thought maybe you'd want
to work out a compromise.

109
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:09,088
The surgery went well.

110
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,956
We were able to fully evacuate

111
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,626
the subdural hematoma
without any complications.

112
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,899
It's a good thing you didn't
hesitate to bring her in.

113
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:22,201
Oh. One advantage of being
an insecure, first-time mom

114
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:24,904
who panics every time
her child has a slight fever.

115
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:27,506
Did I just hear you admit
that you're insecure?

116
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:29,842
The girl who double-majored
in Physics and Chemistry

117
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:31,844
because the Dean told her
they were the two toughest?

118
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:34,047
Mom guilt ruins us all. You'll see.

119
00:06:34,049 --> 00:06:35,714
Whenever you decide
to give up the motorcycle

120
00:06:35,716 --> 00:06:36,749
and settle down.

121
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:37,983
No way.

122
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:39,985
My kid's going to kindergarten
on the back of a Ducati.

123
00:06:41,756 --> 00:06:43,522
I'm sorry. I need to go
check on another patient.

124
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:45,847
Oh, how long will she need to stay here?

125
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:48,461
I'm still not sure
what caused the bleeding.

126
00:06:48,463 --> 00:06:52,898
I didn't see any signs of an
aneurysm or AVM, so that's good.

127
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,468
I'll have a better idea when
I get the post-op test results

128
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,169
back from Pathology.

129
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,574
Thank you.

130
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:07,146
This is why I love Pathology.

131
00:07:07,148 --> 00:07:09,148
We don't just fix stuff.

132
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,348
We figure out how it got broken

133
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:12,585
and why.

134
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:14,220
Good morning.

135
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:16,355
Just checking to make sure
you got my clot specimen

136
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:18,057
- and blood draws.
- Just logged them in.

137
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:21,393
Great. And if there's any way
to expedite, I'd appreciate it.

138
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:25,131
The mom's a friend of mine
and stressed to the max.

139
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,676
I'm pretty sure the bleed was caused...

140
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:28,234
Stop.

141
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:31,937
I'm sorry. I meant... please stop.

142
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:33,873
I'd rather not know what you think.

143
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,742
It causes confirmation bias.

144
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:38,177
Copy that.

145
00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:43,115
Hey. Um...

146
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:46,241
Did I see you on Hanover Street
this morning?

147
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:49,622
I... don't know.

148
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:54,126
Were you on Hanover Street this morning?

149
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:56,061
Yes.

150
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:58,920
I walked to work.

151
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:03,736
Did you... see anything interesting...

152
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:05,135
on the walk?

153
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,055
Hmm...

154
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:11,810
S-Shaun?

155
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,814
We can't both expedite your results

156
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:17,983
and reminisce about our morning walks.

157
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:19,818
Sorry. Carry on.

158
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:26,192
You're totally freaking out, aren't you?

159
00:08:26,194 --> 00:08:28,527
No, I'm not freaking out.

160
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:29,762
All my patients freak out

161
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:31,330
waiting for their final test results.

162
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:34,099
For 48 hours, you don't know
if you've won the lottery

163
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:37,002
or... if you're gonna be dead
in a few months.

164
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:38,270
Hell, I freak out, too.

165
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:39,805
It's the only time I feel helpless.

166
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:40,940
The treatment's over.

167
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:43,275
There's nothing left to do but... wait.

168
00:08:43,277 --> 00:08:45,244
I'm a little stressed.

169
00:08:45,246 --> 00:08:47,279
That speech... not helpful.

170
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:50,316
My advice. Embrace it.

171
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:51,584
You're experiencing emotions

172
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:53,986
only a few people on Earth
will ever understand.

173
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:56,555
The kind Hemingway wrote about.

174
00:08:56,557 --> 00:08:58,518
- I'm more of a Faulkner guy.
- You would be.

175
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,093
- You don't like Faulkner?
- No, I don't like Faulkner.

176
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:02,628
Nobody really likes Faulkner.

177
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,902
I like Faulkner.

178
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:06,738
Right.

179
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:11,409
Anyway...

180
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:14,079
if there's anything you need from me,

181
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:16,642
even if it's just to talk,

182
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:18,277
you have my direct number.

183
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,712
Do not hesitate to use it.

184
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,381
I appreciate that.

185
00:09:25,686 --> 00:09:30,422
And I would like to show my gratitude.

186
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:31,957
I know I haven't been

187
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,392
the easiest patient to deal with.

188
00:09:33,394 --> 00:09:35,461
That's not necessary.

189
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:37,062
I mean, if you want,

190
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:38,430
you can make a donation
to cancer research.

191
00:09:38,432 --> 00:09:39,732
I already donate.

192
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:42,001
I wanted to thank <i>you,</i>
<i>not society at large.</i>

193
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:46,038
How about... Have you ever tried
Macallan's Sherry Oak 25?

194
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,306
I don't drink.

195
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:48,841
And I just said it's not necessary.

196
00:09:48,843 --> 00:09:51,377
How about a weekend in Ojai?
I hear the spa is amazing.

197
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:53,812
- No means no.
- I'm not trying to molest you.

198
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:55,247
I just want to thank you.

199
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:57,116
And you have, and you are very welcome.

200
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:58,417
Why do you have to control
every little thing?

201
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:00,686
I have pepper spray in my purse.
Don't make me use it.

202
00:10:09,563 --> 00:10:12,598
Carly, I am gonna need 60 units

203
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,533
of type B-positive packed red blood cells

204
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:15,734
held for O.R.

205
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:16,869
- 60?
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:19,004
You operating on a hemophiliac elephant?

207
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:22,541
Our patient has a 200-pound neurofibroma.

208
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:23,842
Cool.

209
00:10:23,844 --> 00:10:25,744
There's more blood in the tumor
than the patient,

210
00:10:25,746 --> 00:10:29,181
so we're gonna have to follow
Massive Transfusion Protocol.

211
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:30,349
You...

212
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:35,854
You might need antifibrinolytic agents

213
00:10:35,856 --> 00:10:37,996
to control the bleeding.

214
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:40,726
That's a good idea. Thanks.

215
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:45,130
I could do some research
on cell salvage techniques.

216
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:46,832
Cancer is a risk, but if we were...

217
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,767
I'm sorry, Shaun.

218
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:53,205
Melendez has put together
a pretty big team, so...

219
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:55,107
we have everything we need.

220
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:05,818
I talked to Murphy. He definitely saw us.

221
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,952
What'd he say?

222
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:08,354
It's not what he said. It's how he acted.

223
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:10,856
He was clearly uncomfortable
talking to me.

224
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:13,359
He's uncomfortable talking to <i>everyone.</i>

225
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:14,693
We need to get out in front of this.

226
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:16,428
Tell Andrews before someone else does.

227
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,697
We need to figure out
exactly what Murphy saw.

228
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:21,834
How? We can't just ask him
if he saw us making...

229
00:11:21,836 --> 00:11:23,202
bread.

230
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:25,404
We're not gonna get anywhere
with indirect questions.

231
00:11:25,406 --> 00:11:27,005
I'll talk to him.

232
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:28,874
You think you can read him
better than I can?

233
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:31,477
No, but if at first you don't succeed...

234
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,178
Let the man try?

235
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:36,348
Dr. Han wants to see you two.

236
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,250
- Both of us?
- Yep.

237
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:39,418
Yep.

238
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:53,024
Have a seat.

239
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:58,785
Actually, we've been meaning
to talk to you.

240
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,541
- The issue is...
- Dr. Han met with the medical board.

241
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:05,778
We're not going to be suspended
or reprimanded.

242
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,613
The hospital will pay fines
on your behalf,

243
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:08,680
and you'll need to complete

244
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:10,582
a few continuing education classes.

245
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:13,091
But overall, not bad.

246
00:12:13,554 --> 00:12:15,154
Thank you.

247
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:17,189
Yeah, thanks.

248
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:19,758
Does this mean I'm back
on the surgical team?

249
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,827
No. It does not.

250
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:24,363
You convinced the Board
that he's competent.

251
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:27,699
You're welcome.

252
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,585
We got a big problem.
With our tiny patient.

253
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:49,388
I did a repeat assessment
of the pre-op CT's

254
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,090
and found a trace subarachnoid bleed.

255
00:12:52,092 --> 00:12:54,493
But there was no bruise on her scalp.

256
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:55,727
I know.

257
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:57,396
The only way she could get this injury

258
00:12:57,398 --> 00:12:58,964
is if someone shook her,

259
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:00,866
and they would have to shake her hard.

260
00:13:03,102 --> 00:13:05,871
S-Someone abused her.

261
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:13,329
No.

262
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:14,463
I've known Laura since high school.

263
00:13:14,465 --> 00:13:15,698
She's the most composed,

264
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,399
even-tempered person I've ever met.

265
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:19,468
And she's totally devoted to that baby.

266
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,502
What about the father?

267
00:13:20,504 --> 00:13:21,971
She conceived via a donor.

268
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:23,639
A nanny, a relative,

269
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:25,674
a-a boyfriend who's been helping out?

270
00:13:25,676 --> 00:13:27,443
She waited so long for this...

271
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:29,712
wanted to do everything herself.

272
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:31,669
Then it has to be her.

273
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:34,049
We need to call
Child Protective Services.

274
00:13:34,051 --> 00:13:35,089
No.

275
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,686
Not yet.

276
00:13:37,688 --> 00:13:39,221
I'm gonna do an MRI

277
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:42,324
to rule out benign enlargement
of the extra-axial space.

278
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:45,027
- Before we ruin her life...
- Good idea.

279
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:48,464
Except for the part
about <i>you</i> doing the test.

280
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:50,065
She's your friend.

281
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:51,866
You think I'd try to help
someone cover up child abuse?

282
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:53,068
I don't know you well enough

283
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,203
to know what you would or wouldn't do

284
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:55,735
to protect a friend.

285
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,941
I could do the MRI.

286
00:13:58,943 --> 00:14:00,576
I'm not the mother's friend.

287
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,578
But you are a pathologist.

288
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,702
Giving MRI's is not your job.

289
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:08,484
Page Farmer. Have him do it.

290
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:09,818
On it.

291
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,130
Murphy.

292
00:14:21,132 --> 00:14:22,364
We need to talk.

293
00:14:28,738 --> 00:14:30,506
I don't have a girlfriend.

294
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,565
Okay.

295
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:39,648
Is that consistent with what
you've deduced and seen

296
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,849
regarding my life?

297
00:14:42,686 --> 00:14:44,053
Yesss?

298
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:47,122
Good.

299
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:50,826
Enjoy your apple.

300
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:06,208
It's not fair.

301
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,643
Shaun is being punished for mistakes

302
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:09,945
that Han thinks
he <i>might</i> make in the future.

303
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:11,747
He's not punishing him.

304
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:13,415
He just saved his ass.

305
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:15,617
Okay, Kenny. The MRA's gonna help us map

306
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:16,986
the blood supply to the tumor.

307
00:15:16,988 --> 00:15:18,420
If you could just lie still.

308
00:15:18,422 --> 00:15:19,755
No talking until we're done.

309
00:15:19,757 --> 00:15:21,423
Sure, no problem.

310
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:23,025
We should take a stand.

311
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:25,260
- Meaning what?
- Stage a walkout?

312
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:28,297
How much does one of these
bad boys cost, anyway?

313
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:29,565
About $3 million.

314
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:32,134
But it's worthless
unless you stop talking.

315
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:34,203
Sorry. My bad.

316
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:36,338
Us getting fired is not gonna do
anything to help Shaun.

317
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,671
And I'm not even sure
we should be helping him.

318
00:15:39,243 --> 00:15:40,342
Did you ever stop to think

319
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:42,644
that maybe Han knows what he's doing?

320
00:15:42,646 --> 00:15:44,179
Shaun has made mistakes,

321
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:46,682
but he has three more years of residency.

322
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:49,318
That is plenty of time to improve.

323
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,720
Yes, you can build a winning team

324
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:53,255
through supportive training,

325
00:15:53,257 --> 00:15:55,457
but you can also do it
by recruiting the best

326
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,192
and pushing them. Relentlessly.

327
00:15:57,194 --> 00:16:00,429
No feelings. No charity. No loyalty.

328
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:02,131
Those who thrive and get better

329
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:03,632
than they ever thought
they could, you keep...

330
00:16:03,634 --> 00:16:06,201
...and those who don't, you cut.

331
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:07,341
That's not good.

332
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,138
It works for Jeff Bezos
and Bill Belichick.

333
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,672
I'm not talking about
your leadership lecture.

334
00:16:10,674 --> 00:16:12,007
I'm talking about this.

335
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:16,167
We need to page Melendez.

336
00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:20,115
What are you talking about? You know me!

337
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:22,484
How could you possibly believe
I could hurt my baby?

338
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:25,954
I don't. Which is why I ordered
the additional tests.

339
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:29,458
But did you never leave her
with anyone else?

340
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,261
Even for just a few minutes
so that you could take a nap?

341
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:34,060
Or a bath?

342
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:37,399
Taking care of a newborn.
It's... It's exhausting.

343
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:39,768
No. It isn't.

344
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,570
After waiting for so long,

345
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:44,320
every single moment,
no matter how hard...

346
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:47,281
It's not exhausting.

347
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,511
It's a joy.

348
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:57,083
Laura, I know you love her...

349
00:16:57,822 --> 00:17:00,122
but you're still human.

350
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:01,924
You must get tired sometimes.

351
00:17:01,926 --> 00:17:03,826
I don't! Really.

352
00:17:03,828 --> 00:17:05,761
You don't understand because you...

353
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:07,763
because you haven't experienced it.

354
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:10,099
But when you love someone so much...

355
00:17:12,335 --> 00:17:14,002
The tests.

356
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:16,138
They have to be wrong.

357
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:22,377
We expected the tumor to grow
since the last scans,

358
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:24,360
but not to this extent.

359
00:17:24,682 --> 00:17:25,747
Blood vessels that I thought

360
00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:27,282
we'd be able to quickly cauterize

361
00:17:27,284 --> 00:17:29,282
are now thicker than my thumb.

362
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,420
It's impossible to remove the tumor

363
00:17:31,422 --> 00:17:33,322
without causing you to bleed to death.

364
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:37,659
No.

365
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,063
I don't care how risky it is.

366
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:45,000
I'd rather die in surgery
than continue to live

367
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:47,936
with this huge, damn tick

368
00:17:47,938 --> 00:17:49,138
sucking the life out of me.

369
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,374
Kenny, as long as your heart
remains healthy,

370
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:54,598
you basically will be, too.

371
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,513
And we can do a better job
treating the pain.

372
00:17:57,893 --> 00:18:00,313
I don't want to be treated.

373
00:18:00,818 --> 00:18:02,818
I want to be cured.

374
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,753
I want my life back.

375
00:18:06,022 --> 00:18:07,923
I always thought all...

376
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:10,192
all I had to do was get enough money,

377
00:18:10,194 --> 00:18:12,158
or find the right doctors...

378
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:15,230
But if you're telling me
there's no hope...

379
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:26,380
I appreciate everything y'all done.

380
00:18:27,411 --> 00:18:29,545
Or at least tried to do.

381
00:18:41,928 --> 00:18:44,563
The injuries from shaking a baby
are much different

382
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:46,231
than from blunt force trauma.

383
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:49,167
Oh, that's awful... but also interesting.

384
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,803
It's like you're a detective
in a murder mystery.

385
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:53,972
Only, thank God, the baby's not dead.

386
00:18:53,974 --> 00:18:56,975
That's exactly what Carly said.

387
00:18:56,977 --> 00:19:00,078
She likes solving medical mysteries.

388
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,248
She's very smart. And aggressive.

389
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,951
Well, how do she treat you? Is she nice?

390
00:19:05,953 --> 00:19:08,820
Yes, she's very nice.

391
00:19:08,822 --> 00:19:11,022
She wants me to stay in her department.

392
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,425
She thinks we make a good team.

393
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:16,228
So it sounds like you have
a case you're interested in

394
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,308
and a coworker you like
who's nice to you.

395
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,728
Maybe Pathology won't be
that bad after all.

396
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:29,174
I have work to do.

397
00:19:35,816 --> 00:19:37,516
Since it seems we're gonna be
working together

398
00:19:37,518 --> 00:19:39,518
for a while longer...

399
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,254
maybe it is time
we came out of the closet.

400
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:43,388
Maybe?

401
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,457
Are you saying you want to?

402
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:46,958
Do you want to?

403
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,827
Maybe.

404
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:51,129
You're afraid it would
make things awkward?

405
00:19:51,131 --> 00:19:52,797
People seeing us as a couple?

406
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,966
Yes, obviously.

407
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:56,601
But at the moment, I'm more afraid

408
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:58,336
that we wouldn't
be having this conversation

409
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:00,324
if Murphy hadn't almost busted us.

410
00:20:01,341 --> 00:20:04,743
Which makes me think we're not
ready to have this conversation.

411
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:10,609
It's understandable if we aren't.

412
00:20:11,118 --> 00:20:12,551
We've both been in relationships

413
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:13,852
we thought were gonna last...

414
00:20:16,203 --> 00:20:19,724
Yeah. Understandable,
but why should we even care

415
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:21,526
what people at work think?

416
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:26,464
So, should we talk to Andrews?

417
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:32,590
Maybe. What do you think?

418
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:35,974
Maybe.

419
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:41,640
Uh, Sawchuck?

420
00:20:42,382 --> 00:20:44,483
- Sorry for the wait.
- Oh. Thank you.

421
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:46,585
Excuse me, duck curry and rice?

422
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:47,986
40 minutes? Really?

423
00:20:47,988 --> 00:20:49,788
Sorry, the kitchen fell a bit behind.

424
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,323
- It shouldn't be much longer.
- You're not just behind.

425
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:52,824
People have come in after me,

426
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:55,393
they've gotten their food,
gone home, eaten.

427
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:57,128
They're in their PJs, watching a movie.

428
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,698
I'm so sorry. I'll check right now.

429
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,234
- Duck curry.
- Here you go, sir.

430
00:21:02,236 --> 00:21:04,135
Duck curry, brown rice.

431
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,871
- White rice.
- Um, excuse me.

432
00:21:06,873 --> 00:21:08,473
- Duck curry with brown rice?
- Yes.

433
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,842
- Connelly?
- That's me. Thank you.

434
00:21:10,844 --> 00:21:12,477
What are you guys doing back there?

435
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,778
I'm so sorry, Sir.

436
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,347
You know what? I'm tired of sorry.

437
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:16,848
I just... I want my food!

438
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,416
I'm sorry. It should just be
another minute.

439
00:21:18,418 --> 00:21:20,452
I don't want to wait any longer!

440
00:21:23,257 --> 00:21:24,823
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,991
Sorry. I'm sorry.

442
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,158
I didn't... I didn't mean to yell.

443
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,627
I'm so sorry.

444
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:32,831
Carry on. Carry on. Enjoy your...

445
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,771
She's always trying to one-up us.

446
00:21:39,773 --> 00:21:41,039
Morgan.

447
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,974
She's not staying late because
she wants to do research.

448
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:45,744
She's staying late so that Han
can <i>see</i> she's staying late.

449
00:21:45,746 --> 00:21:47,812
It's just who she is.
Don't take it personal.

450
00:21:47,814 --> 00:21:49,124
Mm.

451
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,916
My dad's a Taekwondo grandmaster.

452
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:53,318
Coached me growing up.

453
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,887
He always used to say,
"Only you can beat you."

454
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:57,856
Well, my mom's a lounge singer,
and she used to say,

455
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,291
"Upstage me and I'll beat your ass."

456
00:21:59,293 --> 00:22:00,792
You'd think if you're selling boba,

457
00:22:00,794 --> 00:22:01,993
you'd have straws wide enough

458
00:22:01,995 --> 00:22:03,361
to get the balls through the damn thing.

459
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,796
I can't believe you drink that stuff.

460
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:07,866
It's like putting gummy bears in a drink.

461
00:22:10,771 --> 00:22:12,070
You give up?

462
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:13,338
Want a soda instead?

463
00:22:17,744 --> 00:22:19,611
I see you.

464
00:22:19,613 --> 00:22:22,533
Which is, I assume,
your primary objective.

465
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,451
I didn't even know you were still here.

466
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:28,253
I've been reading
the latest journal articles

467
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:30,989
- on neurofibroma...
- Go home.

468
00:22:30,991 --> 00:22:33,258
There's nothing you can do
for Kenny Grimm.

469
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,293
And you're gonna have
other patients tomorrow.

470
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:41,166
I got an idea.

471
00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:43,773
If we embolize the larger
blood vessels to the tumor

472
00:22:43,775 --> 00:22:44,836
before surgery,

473
00:22:44,838 --> 00:22:46,538
we can use your body's clotting factor

474
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,039
to help clog them.

475
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,108
This should reduce
hemorrhaging during surgery

476
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,605
and allow us to excise the tumor
without you bleeding out.

477
00:22:53,947 --> 00:22:56,715
We'll steer a catheter through
an artery in your thigh...

478
00:22:56,717 --> 00:22:58,316
- Yes.
- Kenny...

479
00:22:58,318 --> 00:22:59,984
maybe you should let them finish.

480
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:03,021
No, I shouldn't.

481
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:04,556
And, yes, you should.

482
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:07,392
Yes, yes, yes. As soon as possible. Yes.

483
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:11,196
Thank you.

484
00:23:17,336 --> 00:23:18,570
The tests came back.

485
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:20,105
They confirm the previous results.

486
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,774
Well, they're wrong.
There must be some other...

487
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,243
There has to be another test! Please.

488
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:26,611
Ma'am, you're gonna need to come with us.

489
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,380
- You need help.
- From <i>you!</i>

490
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:30,515
You're my friend,
and you called the police?!

491
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:32,217
Well, someone hurt your baby.
If it wasn't you...

492
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:34,319
No one hurt my baby! You're wrong!

493
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:35,887
How can you not believe me?!

494
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,389
Just need to get a few more
branches off the aorta

495
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:45,699
and we're done.

496
00:23:49,543 --> 00:23:51,275
Well done, Dr. Browne.

497
00:23:56,383 --> 00:23:57,416
What's the fluid status?

498
00:23:57,418 --> 00:23:59,051
CVP is 14 and rising.

499
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:01,320
Get diuretics on deck.
40 milligrams I.V. Lasix.

500
00:24:01,322 --> 00:24:03,155
Careful. If his pressure goes too low,

501
00:24:03,157 --> 00:24:04,556
his kidneys won't perfuse.

502
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:06,892
I need you to keep his CVP
between 8 and 12.

503
00:24:06,894 --> 00:24:08,560
He can't tolerate much more of this.

504
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:09,962
We need to get him to an O.R.

505
00:24:09,964 --> 00:24:12,631
Embolizing his vessels caused
third spacing of fluids

506
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:14,166
to the body and lungs.

507
00:24:14,168 --> 00:24:15,300
We saved the operation,

508
00:24:15,302 --> 00:24:17,235
but now we only have half the time do it.

509
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:22,274
Hey.

510
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:23,308
Any word?

511
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,409
No, not yet.

512
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:27,045
Well, I-isn't there someone
from Radiology

513
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:29,348
who can expedite,
someone who owes you a favor?

514
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,884
Even if there was,
I would not waste it on you

515
00:24:32,886 --> 00:24:34,920
because <i>you</i> do not need it.

516
00:24:38,492 --> 00:24:41,026
You are one of the most willful
patients I've ever had,

517
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:43,395
and the finish line is in sight.

518
00:24:43,397 --> 00:24:46,260
All you need to do
is just run through the tape.

519
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:49,835
Look, if it helps, as soon as
I'm done with this patient,

520
00:24:49,837 --> 00:24:51,236
we can talk some more.

521
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:53,071
I can write you a script

522
00:24:53,073 --> 00:24:54,706
for something to help you
with the anxiety,

523
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,241
but I don't think you need it.

524
00:24:56,243 --> 00:24:57,642
You got this.

525
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:05,817
- More suction.
- Me, too.

526
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:07,252
More sponges.

527
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,558
Retract.

528
00:25:15,695 --> 00:25:17,165
That's it.

529
00:25:17,531 --> 00:25:19,398
What's his estimated blood loss?

530
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,666
About 8 1/2 liters.

531
00:25:21,668 --> 00:25:23,802
The entire human body

532
00:25:23,804 --> 00:25:27,384
typically only has 5 1/2 liters of blood.

533
00:25:27,841 --> 00:25:30,142
Yeah, I know.

534
00:25:30,144 --> 00:25:32,110
Let's get 30 more units on deck of PRBC.

535
00:25:33,447 --> 00:25:35,847
Add cryo, fresh frozen plasma,
and platelets to that.

536
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:51,830
We should have checked
for blood breakdown products.

537
00:25:51,832 --> 00:25:53,498
If you don't mind, I'm trying
to pay attention to this.

538
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,233
I wasn't talking to you.

539
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:57,169
Or about this patient.

540
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:05,143
We need to reexamine the
subdural blood clot specimens.

541
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:07,746
If there's hemosiderin
deposition and chronic membranes

542
00:26:07,748 --> 00:26:09,114
including fibrous wall,

543
00:26:09,116 --> 00:26:11,817
it could prove it was not abuse.

544
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:13,118
What else could it be?

545
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,153
The tests proved non-accidental trauma.

546
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:17,622
Yes. The tests were right.

547
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:25,297
Resected portion is secure.

548
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:26,765
I.V.'s and central line?

549
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,066
- Secure.
- Secure.

550
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:29,468
Okay, everybody, get in position.

551
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,470
Let's flip this pancake.

552
00:26:31,472 --> 00:26:32,737
On three.

553
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:36,174
One, two, three.

554
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:39,411
Wait. His heart rate spiked.

555
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:40,512
Lay him back down.

556
00:26:40,514 --> 00:26:42,814
Softly. Softly.

557
00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:46,985
We okay?

558
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:48,420
Yeah. Just a blip.

559
00:26:48,422 --> 00:26:49,621
Once more with feeling.

560
00:26:49,623 --> 00:26:53,492
Ready? One, two, three.

561
00:26:57,731 --> 00:26:59,865
- How are we doing?
- Good. He's stable.

562
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:01,900
All right, swab the posterior
incision site.

563
00:27:01,902 --> 00:27:04,069
Okay, scalpel and sponge on a stick.

564
00:27:04,071 --> 00:27:05,937
He's crashing.

565
00:27:05,939 --> 00:27:07,139
He's ventilating fine.

566
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:08,907
We've got no immediate
blood loss or hemorrhaging.

567
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:10,375
It looks like distributive shock.

568
00:27:10,377 --> 00:27:12,878
I need stat labs and
initiate shock resuscitation.

569
00:27:16,284 --> 00:27:18,651
He's got a high white count
and what looks to be

570
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:20,614
a systemic pro-inflammatory
cytokine release.

571
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,972
Cutting off the blood supply to the tumor

572
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,106
is causing post embolization syndrome.

573
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,541
I need intra-arterial lidocaine,

574
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,176
130 milligrams of methylprednisolone,

575
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:27,444
and start antibiotics.

576
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,079
Should we be trying
to reverse the embolization?

577
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,447
Restore blood flow to the tumor?

578
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,748
Well, then, we'd risk him
bleeding out even faster.

579
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,083
We need to abort.

580
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,785
Cut off what we already excised
and leave the rest.

581
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:37,131
- No. We can't give up.
- We're not giving up.

582
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:38,438
We're stopping a futile procedure

583
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,523
to save the patient.

584
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,860
We need to get Murphy in here.
It's a blood flow problem.

585
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,530
Murphy has a special talent
for visualizing complex anatomy.

586
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:48,817
We don't have time.
We need to stop the P.E.S. now.

587
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:51,242
- Page Dr. Murphy.
- No. Do not page Dr. Murphy.

588
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:52,299
I get it. You like him.

589
00:27:52,301 --> 00:27:53,600
But we don't have time for an audition.

590
00:27:53,602 --> 00:27:54,968
I'm trying to save my patient's life.

591
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,704
<i>My</i> patient. Which means it's <i>my</i> call.

592
00:27:56,706 --> 00:27:58,672
I am also trying to save
your patient's life,

593
00:27:58,674 --> 00:28:00,541
so I'm urging you to stop wasting time.

594
00:28:00,543 --> 00:28:01,909
Now we've cut away almost half.

595
00:28:01,911 --> 00:28:03,110
That's all we can do right now.

596
00:28:03,112 --> 00:28:04,578
So let's remove it and give him a chance

597
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,413
to live and fight another day.

598
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:10,684
The breakdown products show

599
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:12,319
the injury that caused the hematoma

600
00:28:12,321 --> 00:28:14,988
happened at least seven weeks ago.

601
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,824
When was she born?

602
00:28:16,826 --> 00:28:19,389
A little over seven weeks ago.

603
00:28:20,262 --> 00:28:22,996
But the vacuum delivery
must've caused a subdural bleed

604
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:24,965
which re-bled two days ago.

605
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:27,968
The baby wasn't abused.

606
00:28:32,975 --> 00:28:35,542
Shaun, we need you in the O.R.

607
00:28:49,325 --> 00:28:51,759
Any thoughts, Dr. Murphy?

608
00:28:53,963 --> 00:28:56,830
You don't have enough time.

609
00:28:56,832 --> 00:28:59,399
You can't fully map
the circulatory system

610
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:01,602
and remove the tumor
without killing the patient.

611
00:29:01,604 --> 00:29:02,936
It's too complex.

612
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:08,809
Well, at least he was brief
and to the point.

613
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:09,943
Now, can we do what I...

614
00:29:09,945 --> 00:29:11,879
But you don't have to do it quickly.

615
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:15,315
We slow down, he bleeds out.

616
00:29:15,317 --> 00:29:16,750
If you clamp the aorta,

617
00:29:16,752 --> 00:29:18,786
it could lower the blood flow
to the tumor enough

618
00:29:18,788 --> 00:29:20,587
to slow the release of the cytokines.

619
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:21,855
Clamping the aorta

620
00:29:21,857 --> 00:29:24,291
will kill the intestines,
kidneys, and legs.

621
00:29:24,293 --> 00:29:27,294
Not if we release the clamp
every 10 minutes.

622
00:29:27,296 --> 00:29:29,429
Give it just enough blood
to stop the cytokines

623
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:31,598
but not so much that he bleeds to death.

624
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:41,388
Let's do it.

625
00:29:42,311 --> 00:29:44,478
Thank you for the consult, Dr. Murphy.

626
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:48,782
Reposition him to lateral.

627
00:29:48,784 --> 00:29:50,647
Secure I.V. and central line.

628
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:53,775
- Secure.
- 10 blade.

629
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:57,257
Starting midline laparotomy.

630
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:59,155
Debakey.

631
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:02,162
Opening up the lesser sac.

632
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:03,797
Vessel loops.

633
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:08,790
Get a Rumel ready.

634
00:30:09,705 --> 00:30:11,438
I need umbilical tape.

635
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:27,855
MRI exams show chronic changes
of surgery and radiation,

636
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:32,526
but no sign of residual tumor detected.

637
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:33,827
No signs.

638
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:35,362
None.

639
00:30:35,364 --> 00:30:38,365
Zero. Zippo. Zilch.

640
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:46,573
Wow.

641
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:49,109
We'll do another MRI
in six months just to be sure,

642
00:30:49,111 --> 00:30:51,211
but you are in the clear.

643
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:55,148
This is exactly what we hoped for.

644
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,316
<i>Kinehora.</i>

645
00:30:56,318 --> 00:30:57,351
Tuh, tuh, tuh.

646
00:30:57,353 --> 00:30:59,086
Knock on wood.

647
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:15,135
- Thank you.
- Oh, you son of a bitch.

648
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:16,303
I told you.

649
00:31:16,305 --> 00:31:17,537
You told me no.

650
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:23,377
It's too heavy for diamonds.

651
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:25,312
Is it a Magic 8 Ball?

652
00:31:25,314 --> 00:31:26,446
Will you just open it?

653
00:31:33,421 --> 00:31:35,622
I don't like baseball.

654
00:31:35,624 --> 00:31:37,291
I do.

655
00:31:38,693 --> 00:31:41,261
So you got me something <i>you</i> like?

656
00:31:41,263 --> 00:31:44,719
I caught that foul ball
down the third base line...

657
00:31:45,768 --> 00:31:47,968
on my 13th birthday.

658
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:52,105
My dad was amazed that I snagged it.

659
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:55,742
After the game,
we went outside the stadium.

660
00:31:55,744 --> 00:31:57,878
And I was a shy kid,
but my father pushed me

661
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,403
to ask my favorite players
to sign it, and they all did.

662
00:32:02,217 --> 00:32:04,985
Bert Campaneris, Rollie Fingers,

663
00:32:04,987 --> 00:32:07,087
Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter.

664
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:12,326
If it happened today,
it'd all be on video.

665
00:32:12,328 --> 00:32:15,829
But all I have to remember
that awesome day...

666
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:17,497
is that ball.

667
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:22,803
I wanted you to have something

668
00:32:22,805 --> 00:32:24,805
that mattered to me.

669
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:33,647
- Aaron, I can't.
- Oh, yes, you can.

670
00:32:42,858 --> 00:32:43,991
Bye.

671
00:32:47,229 --> 00:32:49,200
Cancer changes people.

672
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:52,799
I've had patients tell me
it was a blessing.

673
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:55,135
That their lives were better after.

674
00:32:55,137 --> 00:32:56,624
They're idiots.

675
00:32:57,373 --> 00:32:58,905
Maybe.

676
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:06,246
Would you have thought of such
a wonderful gift 11 months ago?

677
00:33:31,703 --> 00:33:33,303
Care to do the honors?

678
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:44,848
Let's take it up.

679
00:34:29,592 --> 00:34:30,794
I'm so sorry.

680
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,710
I should've trusted you.

681
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,197
Please talk to me, Laura.

682
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,731
Yell at me if you want. I deserve it.

683
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:47,193
- It's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.

684
00:34:47,672 --> 00:34:49,506
I should have done more research,

685
00:34:49,508 --> 00:34:52,375
looked harder
for an alternative diagnosis.

686
00:34:52,377 --> 00:34:55,345
I mean it's not your fault
you are the way you are.

687
00:34:57,582 --> 00:35:00,583
You don't understand
the love a mother feels.

688
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:06,156
I understand that a lot of
mothers abuse their children.

689
00:35:06,158 --> 00:35:08,715
You don't understand love.

690
00:35:09,294 --> 00:35:13,029
Because you've never allowed
yourself to be vulnerable.

691
00:35:15,065 --> 00:35:17,333
Even when you were married to Kashal,

692
00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:20,003
you never really committed.

693
00:35:21,672 --> 00:35:23,973
You always expect the worst in people.

694
00:35:25,509 --> 00:35:27,721
Because that's all you see in yourself.

695
00:35:33,952 --> 00:35:35,618
Okay.

696
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,792
I've never been in so much pain...

697
00:35:45,297 --> 00:35:47,497
but felt so good.

698
00:35:47,499 --> 00:35:49,165
We'll up your pain meds.

699
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:51,935
You're still gonna need some
skin and soft tissue grafts,

700
00:35:51,937 --> 00:35:53,736
but the hard part's done.

701
00:35:53,738 --> 00:35:56,105
Your prognosis is excellent.

702
00:35:56,107 --> 00:35:58,174
Thank y'all so much.

703
00:35:59,744 --> 00:36:01,144
What am I taking this thing home in?

704
00:36:01,146 --> 00:36:03,613
A glass bottle?
Y'all got something that big?

705
00:36:03,615 --> 00:36:06,182
He's just being a smart ass.

706
00:36:11,957 --> 00:36:13,656
Are you sure you want to do this?

707
00:36:13,658 --> 00:36:14,924
Shut up.

708
00:36:34,044 --> 00:36:36,546
I saved the patient.

709
00:36:36,548 --> 00:36:38,615
I deserve to be a surgeon.

710
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:41,584
Dr. Murphy...

711
00:36:41,586 --> 00:36:46,562
Dr. Han, I want my old job back.

712
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,427
You're making a mistake.

713
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:52,662
Am I, Shaun?

714
00:36:52,664 --> 00:36:54,264
Yes.

715
00:36:54,266 --> 00:36:57,367
Because it seems like you're
doing really well in Pathology.

716
00:36:57,369 --> 00:36:59,569
You made a great save on an earlier case

717
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:01,804
and a great save today.

718
00:37:01,806 --> 00:37:04,674
You keep doing well, and, over time,

719
00:37:04,676 --> 00:37:07,477
we can build to you having
more responsibility.

720
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,054
No.

721
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:24,060
I'm a surgeon.

722
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:33,936
I am not leaving your office
until you reinstate me.

723
00:37:39,978 --> 00:37:41,577
What are you doing, Shaun?

724
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:43,279
Do you think ordering me to do something

725
00:37:43,281 --> 00:37:44,714
will change my mind?

726
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:47,483
Do you really think it's
a good idea to try and bully me?

727
00:37:50,054 --> 00:37:53,754
I am a surgeon.

728
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:56,993
I am a surgeon.

729
00:37:56,995 --> 00:38:00,229
Do you realize that
you're proving my point?

730
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:01,964
That you're acting immature?

731
00:38:01,966 --> 00:38:04,400
Showing that you don't know
how to communicate

732
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:06,369
and you can't control your emotions?

733
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:09,939
I am a surgeon!

734
00:38:09,941 --> 00:38:12,523
But you do have a talent that I value.

735
00:38:13,678 --> 00:38:15,545
So I'm gonna give you one last chance

736
00:38:15,547 --> 00:38:17,213
to maintain your dignity

737
00:38:17,215 --> 00:38:21,150
and leave my office... now.

738
00:38:23,254 --> 00:38:25,021
Because if I have to call Security,

739
00:38:25,023 --> 00:38:28,224
you understand that I'm also
gonna have to fire you.

740
00:38:34,332 --> 00:38:38,134
I am a surgeon!

741
00:38:38,136 --> 00:38:41,471
I am a surgeon!

742
00:38:41,473 --> 00:38:44,507
I am... I am a surgeon!!

743
00:38:44,509 --> 00:38:47,977
I am a surgeon, Dr. Han!

744
00:38:47,979 --> 00:38:50,413
I am a surgeon!

745
00:38:51,305 --> 00:39:51,693

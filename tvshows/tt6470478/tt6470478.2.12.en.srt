00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,800
Holy crap,
Shaun!

21
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:37,831
You're a good dancer.

22
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:41,492
No, I'm not.
So don't be a lurker.

23
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:43,210
You've gotta
give a girl a warning

24
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:45,606
before she makes a total fool
out of herself.

25
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:46,774
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:49,688
Why are you even up?
You've just gone through hell.

27
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:51,657
You should be sleeping
till noon,

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,710
then go out for a Bloody Mary
Brunch

29
00:01:54,796 --> 00:01:56,790
and a credit crashing
shopping spree.

30
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,061
Those are all
unhealthy ways

31
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:00,718
to cope with stress.

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,186
Fine. But,

33
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:05,350
whatever you choose to do
to decompress on your day off,

34
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:07,133
it can't start before 9:00.

35
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:09,864
And it absolutely
cannot involve you

36
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,366
sitting around all day
reading medical journals.

37
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:15,643
You... have got to get out
and do something.

38
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:21,690
I'm so sorry
for pushing you.

39
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:23,567
But you know
I am right.

40
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:25,645
Ooh.

41
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:31,238

43
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:52,996
How can you
investigate a response

44
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:54,152
that's not even over
yet?

45
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,668
We just began
the Terminal Clean.

46
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:58,285
The Governor believes
an immediate D.I.S. review

47
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:00,723
is essential to restore
public confidence.

48
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:04,334
The CDC confirmed
the virus originated in Malaysia.

49
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,412
And that there was nothing
my staff could've done

50
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,678
to prevent the three deaths
or Dr. Lim's infection.

51
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:12,708
I'm going to need access
to every patient record

52
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:14,553
and all staff communication

53
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,506
from the moment
the first outbreak patient arrived.

54
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:53,220
Look at you. Already back at work.

55
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:56,447
It's either that
or watch the news.

56
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:59,538
And I'd rather be back on ECMO
with a rusty cannula.

57
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:02,312
- Anything you need?
- Thanks, but not necessary.

58
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,890
You sure?

59
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,120
Magazines, a book,
a Maple Bacon doughnut?

60
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:09,518
Yeah, you don't have to play
"supportive friend"

61
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:11,354
just because
we slept together.

62
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:14,463
I'm not "playing,
" I'm being nice.

63
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:17,713
Which I've done for people
I haven't slept with

64
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:19,151
many times in my life.

65
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:20,815
No doubt.

66
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,744
But until we did,
you were always more interested

67
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:25,846
in competing than supporting.

68
00:04:26,596 --> 00:04:28,377
And that's how I prefer it.

69
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:30,916
Okay.

70
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:32,987
I'm not sure
that's true, or fair...

71
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:37,344
I'm also exhausted,
unshowered, and constipated,

72
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:40,049
so, if you could shut the door
on your way out,

73
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:41,495
I'd really appreciate it.

74
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:46,706
Will do.

- Hello?
- You up for mimosas?

81
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:26,894
I was just about to
head out to Hollander's,

82
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:28,579
and I thought
you might want to join me.

83
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:29,783
You
thought

84
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:32,238
I might
want to join you for mimosas?

85
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,431
Why not?

86
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:36,303
Because we don't
like each other?

87
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:38,806
We don't really know
each other.

88
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:41,666
Hollander's has the absolute
best brunch in San Jose.

89
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:43,345
I'll drive. I'll buy.

90
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:44,782
Morgan,
how about you just cut

91
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,247
to what
it is you really want.

92
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:47,689
What else are you gonna do?

93
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:50,322
Sit around, play guitar,
and sing into your phone?

94
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:51,931
How did you know
what I was doing?

95
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:53,010
I didn't.

96
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:54,493
But that's what
your profile

97
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:56,048
on a certain dating app
says

98
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:58,531
- you like to do on your days off?
- Are you stalking me?

99
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:01,486
One mimosa and I'll tell you
the fake profile

100
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:02,930
I use for "oppo research."

101
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:05,766
The guy I used
for my pic is gorgeous.

102
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:08,635
You really want to risk
swiping right on me?

103
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:11,772
I'll drive myself.

104
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:14,074
It'll be fun.
Meet you in an hour.

105
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,728
Call me every night.

106
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,233
I already said
I would.

107
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:19,799
Okay.

108
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:22,983
Thanks for letting me
stop by.

109
00:06:23,046 --> 00:06:24,385
No problem.

110
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:28,236
Okay, well...

111
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:30,386
Bye.

112
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,792
Bye.

113
00:06:31,986 --> 00:06:33,213
Bye.

114
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,846
Okay.

115
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:37,947
Bye.

116
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,971
Mia, wait.

117
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,447
Why don't you stay and fly back
with Kellan on Sunday?

118
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,783
I know it's crazy,
but it's been so long

119
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:52,146
since we've all been together.

120
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:53,908
Like old times.

121
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:57,025
I think that virus
may've affected your memory.

122
00:06:57,572 --> 00:06:59,564
Come on.
Hang with us a bit.

123
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:02,380
Just take a break
for a few days.

124
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:04,208
I'm sure
you could use one.

125
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,295
It does sound nice.

126
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,411
But I can't.

127
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:13,716
Okay.

128
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:17,310
Have a safe flight.

129
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,912
But I could take
a later flight out tonight.

130
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:27,974
Perfect.

131
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:34,802
What are you doing?

132
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:37,091
I am buttoning
my shirt.

133
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,318
The procedure was
a success.

134
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:42,818
The CSF leak was fixed.
What are you doing here?

135
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:44,396
Thought this was your day off.

136
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:46,906
Lea said I'm not allowed
to read medical journals,

137
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:50,927
and Dr. Blaize said you can't
be discharged for two days.

138
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:53,192
Ah, yes,
and yet the U.S. Constitution

139
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:55,169
says I can leave
whenever I want.

140
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:57,244
I am sick and
tired of being sick.

141
00:07:57,307 --> 00:07:59,372
I'm sick and tired of being
around sick people.

142
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:03,685
Surgery... and radiation
and blood draws,

143
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:05,779
CT's, MRls...

144
00:08:05,922 --> 00:08:07,694
I've had it. I need a break.

145
00:08:07,757 --> 00:08:09,630
If you delay
the chemotherapy,

146
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:11,599
you will weaken
its effectiveness.

147
00:08:11,677 --> 00:08:14,261
- It'll be fine.
- Y-You can't quit.

148
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,482
I'm not quitting,
Shaun!

149
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:18,599
I'm just...

150
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:24,185
I appreciate your concern,
but you just have no idea.

151
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:26,318
No, it hasn't had time to heal.

152
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:28,882
If it leaks, it would be bad.

153
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,380
You could develop
a subdural hematoma...

154
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:34,146
And yet if I stay one more
minute in this place,

155
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,576
I will lose my mind.

156
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:52,285
Where are you going?

157
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,504
Anywhere I don't smell iodoform.

158
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:56,355
- I'm coming with you.
- You don't have to come with me.

159
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,396
I don't like that smell
either.

160
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:01,558
But where are we going?

161
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:03,293
Are we friends?

162
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:05,496
- Yes.
- Why?

163
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:06,949
'Cause I helped you through school,

164
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,535
because I helped you
get a job?

165
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:11,691
Or is it because neither one
of us have any other friends?

166
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:14,363
- You have lots of friends.
- Who?

167
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,121
And if I did, why did I have
somebody drive me around

168
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,387
who I barely know and who
I don't really like very much?

169
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:23,233
And by the way, why doesn't
she have any other friends

170
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,716
besides you?

171
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:26,743
She does.

172
00:09:26,863 --> 00:09:29,988
She goes out
with people all the time.

173
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:32,847
And yet she slept
on your floor for a month.

174
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:35,347
So unless the people she goes
out with are homeless...

175
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,422
Hello, Lea.

176
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:37,648
You better not be studying.

177
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,237
- I'm not.
- <i>Good.</i>

178
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:41,406
You want to come have
lunch with me?

179
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:44,105
Lea wants us
to have lunch with her.

180
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,723
Wait, us? Who are you with?

181
00:09:45,805 --> 00:09:47,328
Dr. Glassman.

182
00:09:47,894 --> 00:09:49,941
Fine. Glassy can come, too.

183
00:09:50,043 --> 00:09:52,027
Glassy never said
he wanted to come.

184
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,432
Tell him the food at my office
is amazing.

185
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:55,553
Okay.

186
00:09:55,635 --> 00:09:57,933
She says that the food at her...
I'm not hungry!

187
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,656
Go. You just go.

188
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:05,582
I can't come.

189
00:10:05,957 --> 00:10:07,565
Come on, Shaun. Please?

190
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:09,480
I'm having a really crappy day,

191
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:11,472
and you're, like,
my only friend.

192
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:18,058
You know what?
I changed my mind.

193
00:10:18,621 --> 00:10:21,559
I would love to come and have
lunch with your friend Lea.

194
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:22,699
Yes!

195
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:24,746
Okay, I will text you guys the address.

196
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:34,996
Diego Luis.

197
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:37,074
My pseudonym.

198
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,629
I think Latin names are sexy.

199
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:41,785
You might want to pace yourself.

200
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:43,648
We don't even have
the menu yet.

201
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:45,653
I'll be fine.

202
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,074
I'm really sorry
about that EMT.

203
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:51,441
Tyler, right?

204
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:54,106
I heard you guys were
kinda close.

205
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:56,661
Well, you heard wrong.
I barely even knew him.

206
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:57,886
Okay.

207
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,809
But as long as I'm here.
If you want to talk about...

208
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,590
I don't.
I wanted a brunch partner.

209
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:04,129
Not a shrink.

210
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:05,621
I'm not trying to be a shrink.

211
00:11:05,684 --> 00:11:08,106
I'm trying to be
a decent human being.

212
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,473
Of course you are.

213
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,871
St. Claire to the rescue.

214
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:14,481
What is your problem?

215
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,520
You literally blackmailed
me to be here,

216
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,114
and now you have the nerve
to act like I am the one...

217
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:25,308
I'm gonna take this outside.

218
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:27,793
If you wanna just get the check
that's fine with me.

219
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:33,300
- Ho!
- Yeah!

220
00:11:33,363 --> 00:11:34,619
Damn, I'm gonna have
to wear a helmet

221
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:35,955
next time I pitch to you.

222
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:40,003
- Yeah!
- There you go.

223
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:45,088
You seeing anyone?

224
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:49,228
Sorry, don't mean to interrogate.

225
00:11:49,306 --> 00:11:52,250
It's all right.
And no, I'm not.

226
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:53,671
What about you?

227
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:55,620
Yeah, but it's nothing serious.

228
00:11:55,702 --> 00:11:57,041
It's okay if it is.

229
00:11:57,385 --> 00:11:58,704
I'd tell you if it was.

230
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,174
You don't have to tell me
anything.

231
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,681
It's none of my business.

232
00:12:04,221 --> 00:12:06,580
Could you imagine us
ever getting back together?

233
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:09,031
Yeah, sure.

234
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:11,135
I mean, the same way
I can imagine what it's like

235
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:13,002
to walk across hot coals

236
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:16,416
or to be waterboarded
or attacked by a great white...

237
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:18,806
All right, I get it. Very funny.

238
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:33,958
Dr. Andrews, can I help you?

239
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:36,761
I just wanted to make sure you
have everything you need.

240
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,697
Yes, we do. Thank you.

241
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,965
Any update? Anything I should know?

242
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:44,244
It's best if we wait until
the investigation is complete

243
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:45,970
before discussing any findings.

244
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:47,492
You already have findings?

245
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:49,994
- None that I'm prepared to discuss.
- Okay.

246
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:51,909
Although, I was a bit surprised to learn

247
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:54,427
that you have a part-time
Chief of Surgery.

248
00:12:57,091 --> 00:12:59,450
What're you talking about?
I was here around the clock.

249
00:12:59,532 --> 00:13:01,216
In your role as Chief of Surgery

250
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:03,357
or as the hospital's President?

251
00:13:05,023 --> 00:13:07,278
My dual role was a benefit.

252
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,613
It sped up decision-making

253
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:10,778
and ensured that
there was no miscommunication

254
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:13,349
between administration
and the surgical staff.

255
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:17,922
Not to mention
this is none of your business.

256
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:20,748
D.P.H. has no oversight
of our management structure.

257
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:23,107
If it adversely affects patient care...

258
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:27,295
Oh, it didn't.
And it never has.

259
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:33,177
You bureaucrats
have no idea

260
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,638
how a hospital runs

261
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:36,380
or what doctors and nurses

262
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:38,042
have to do
on a daily basis

263
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:40,228
to provide
optimum care for patients.

264
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:43,193
And you can tell that
to the Governor.

265
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,810
- I have to go.
- Mimosas. Plural.

266
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:48,911
That was the deal.

267
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:50,474
I've had one.
You've had one quarter.

268
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:52,748
Yeah, well,
my mom is getting evicted.

269
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,513
Fine. I'll come along.

270
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,534
I'm not lying.
I have to help her move.

271
00:13:57,616 --> 00:13:59,388
- I could use the exercise.
- No.

272
00:13:59,492 --> 00:14:01,662
- Two cars are better than one.
- Stop.

273
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:03,670
What is going on?

274
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,920
You were right.

275
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:12,836
Tyler's death was...

276
00:14:13,614 --> 00:14:15,294
upsetting.

277
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,138
I can carry a lot.

278
00:14:18,318 --> 00:14:20,521
And I'm great with moms.

279
00:14:23,556 --> 00:14:24,881
Okay.

280
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,076
She doesn't think I can be both
President and Chief of Surgery.

281
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:31,824
Really?

282
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:34,529
You agree with her?

283
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:39,045
I never was a fan
of your staying on

284
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:40,646
as Chief
after your promotion.

285
00:14:41,091 --> 00:14:42,670
You really think anything
would've been different

286
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,646
if someone else was Chief
during the outbreak?

287
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:47,459
You used to have more time
to manage scheduling issues.

288
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:50,368
And staffing shortage
did complicate our response.

289
00:14:50,543 --> 00:14:54,129
Every hospital in this country
is facing a nursing shortage.

290
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:56,716
I'm not gonna
reverse my decision now.

291
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:58,473
I'd look like
an indecisive fool.

292
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:01,037
Or like someone
who's realized

293
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,099
they've made a mistake
and reconsidered.

294
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,179
Welcome.

295
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,322
Wow.

296
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:12,857
How are you
not all 300 pounds?

297
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:14,796
We also have
an amazing gym,

298
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:16,881
a basketball court,
and an ice rink.

299
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,656
You have
a very generous boss.

300
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:19,951
And idiot investors.

301
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,654
The founder's from Minnesota.

302
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:23,521
He's obsessed with hockey,
so there's pickup at lunch

303
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:25,240
and a beer league
after work.

304
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:28,132
- No Flying Glass Elevators?
- Get anything you want.

305
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,680
There's also a pasta bar

306
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:32,751
and a deli and Spanish tapas
next door.

307
00:15:32,836 --> 00:15:35,802
And then we'll meet back out
in the atrium for our feast.

308
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:38,662
Any of your co-workers
gonna be joining us?

309
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:41,209
Why?

310
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:43,857
I don't know.
Just trying to be social.

311
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,201
You didn't want to come,
then you did.

312
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:49,513
What changed?

313
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:52,006
She always this suspicious?

314
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:55,302
I'm in the mood for Thai.

315
00:15:55,376 --> 00:15:56,748
- Shaun?
- No, thank you.

316
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:58,284
- Sherlock?
- No.

317
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:00,654
Okay, so I'll see you two
in a few.

318
00:16:00,748 --> 00:16:03,443
By the way, the lobster rolls
are amazing.

319
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,396
Thank you.

320
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,934
Since when do
you eat bratwurst?

321
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:20,266
Oh, thought I'd try
something new.

322
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,438
- You a Bulls fan, Breeze?
- Bulls?

323
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:27,633
Oh, no, that's from when
I played South by Southwest

324
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,399
with Danny Attie's band.

325
00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:33,016
That was Austin.
The Bulls are from Chicago.

326
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:40,969
Mom, who else is living here?

327
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:43,466
It's someone else's mug,
but he is not living here.

328
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,511
He just dropped you off
after a date

329
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:48,032
and left his coffee mug
and bratwurst behind by mistake?

330
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:49,672
What do you guys care?

331
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:52,051
Okay, I am not a child.
It's my damn apartment.

332
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:53,232
Yeah, and it was my money

333
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:55,258
that was supposed to be
paying for it.

334
00:16:56,294 --> 00:16:57,641
What was it this time?

335
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,008
You guys were gonna start
a new record label?

336
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:01,516
A restaurant?
What?

337
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,103
I didn't rip you off.
And he didn't rip me off.

338
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:06,534
I was just a little... late.

339
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:08,676
So you're getting evicted
because your landlord

340
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,368
is a stickler
for prompt payments.

341
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:11,657
It's the truth.

342
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,014
Mom, why the hell do you
have to get out of here so fast?

343
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:18,024
There is no way it's because
of a mean landlord.

344
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:24,344
Because he beat my ass,

345
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,094
and I'm terrified
that he's gonna do it again.

346
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:36,844
And I'm not going to the cops.

347
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:39,040
I just want to get the hell out
of this apartment

348
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,883
and never come back.
That's it.

349
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:45,651
Nananana-nananana-nananana-nananana,

350
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,907
nananana-nananana-nananana-nananana.

351
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:51,094
Putting's all about
process.

352
00:17:54,922 --> 00:17:56,649
Apparently not.

353
00:17:57,096 --> 00:18:00,141
Front nine's for posers.
Back nine's for closers.

354
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:02,227
You just know
I hate that movie,

355
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,180
and you're trying
to get me off my game.

356
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:08,351
But it's not gonna work.

357
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,766
Nice.

358
00:18:11,868 --> 00:18:13,774
So, what's she do?

359
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:15,688
This woman
you're not serious about?

360
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:19,993
Come on. You started it.

361
00:18:20,508 --> 00:18:22,329
And it was a mistake.

362
00:18:22,662 --> 00:18:24,399
All right, what about work?

363
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:27,883
Kellan said one of the other
residents has autism?

364
00:18:28,162 --> 00:18:30,571
Yeah. Dr. Murphy.

365
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,712
So what's he like?

366
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:38,176
He's a bit immature.
But nice.

367
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:42,375
Wow, I feel like
I totally know him now.

368
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:46,274
Sorry, I just don't
want to talk about work.

369
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:47,951
Or your personal life.

370
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:50,740
But I would
like to talk about something

371
00:18:50,803 --> 00:18:53,977
other than your
putting process.

372
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:58,506
What's going on in your life?
How are you doing?

373
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:00,407
I'm doing great.
Everything's fine.

374
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:04,031
Come on, Mia.
I'm just trying to relax.

375
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:05,289
Have some fun.

376
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:09,180
This is exactly
why we broke up.

377
00:19:10,757 --> 00:19:12,805
That's not how
I remember it.

378
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:17,305
I made a mistake.

379
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,390
But we were broken
long before that.

380
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,672
'Cause I didn't like
to talk about work?

381
00:19:22,582 --> 00:19:24,797
You decided
to leave the police force

382
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,005
and become
a doctor,

383
00:19:26,087 --> 00:19:27,253
and the first I heard of it

384
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:29,155
is when you told me
you got into med school.

385
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:31,157
Most people would think
that's a step up.

386
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,289
Be supportive.

387
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:34,680
How could I support
a man I never saw?

388
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,211
And when I did see you,
we didn't talk.

389
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:39,552
It's like everything in your life

390
00:19:39,634 --> 00:19:40,745
can only be divulged

391
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:42,078
on a "need to know" basis.

392
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:43,797
And I never needed
to know.

393
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,260
Found this in the trash.

394
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:50,276
An old pay stub
for Carnell Hunter.

395
00:19:50,492 --> 00:19:52,906
- I say we pay him a visit.
- And do what?

396
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:56,195
Give him a stern lecture that'll
teach him to respect women?

397
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:58,789
We need to make it clear
that abusing, stalking,

398
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:01,040
or in any way bothering
your mom ever again

399
00:20:01,122 --> 00:20:02,543
will be more trouble
than it's worth.

400
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:04,531
You're a bit
out of your element here.

401
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:08,039
We're not dealing with some
frat boy or creepy surgeon.

402
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:11,953
The guys my mom dates
are psychos.

403
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:15,359
So you just want to do nothing?
Let him get away with it?

404
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,051
Is she doesn't
want to involve the police,

405
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:18,359
there's nothing
we can do about it.

406
00:20:18,422 --> 00:20:20,679
Let's just...
help her get out of

407
00:20:20,742 --> 00:20:21,984
this mess and
be done with it.

408
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:23,125
No.

409
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:25,397
I'm not as
clueless as you think.

410
00:20:25,613 --> 00:20:27,093
I had a stalker in med school.

411
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:28,663
The guy was scary.

412
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,461
Which is why now

413
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:32,825
I never go anywhere
without this.

414
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:34,228
What the hell?

415
00:20:34,373 --> 00:20:36,864
Don't worry. It's legal.
I have a C.C.W.

416
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:41,059
So what're you gonna do?
Pop a cap in his ass?

417
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:44,075
No. We just need
to send him a message.

418
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:46,051
And studies have shown
that men are more likely

419
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:47,669
to be visual learners.

420
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,090
Give me your key.

421
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:58,426
- Why?
- I want to lock this.

422
00:20:58,531 --> 00:20:59,820
We're leaving the car together.

423
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:01,744
- How am I gonna get it?
- Key.

424
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:04,434
You're the one who insisted
the guy was so dangerous.

425
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,887
I'm sure he is.
But you with a gun

426
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:07,630
is even more
frightening.

427
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:12,127
Here.
Go ahead.

428
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:17,184
How come you're St. Claire
with everyone but your mom?

429
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:19,487
Stop calling me St. Claire.

430
00:21:19,591 --> 00:21:21,301
And you don't know
my mom.

431
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:24,122
I know it's not her fault
she's bipolar.

432
00:21:34,563 --> 00:21:35,762
Feeling any better?

433
00:21:35,825 --> 00:21:37,348
Actually, I am.

434
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:40,919
Nothing like a good B.M.
to turn a frown upside down.

435
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:44,452
I've been thinking about
what you said this morning.

436
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:47,075
About how competitive
I always am.

437
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,208
And the more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

438
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,942
- All I was trying to say...
- I have been nothing

439
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:56,577
but
professional with you.

440
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:57,825
And for the record,
<i>you're</i> the one

441
00:21:57,907 --> 00:21:59,747
who invited <i>me
out for drinks.</i>

442
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:02,083
<i>You're</i> the one who wanted to
go back to my apartment.

443
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,005
And now <i>you're</i> the one
who's acting differently

444
00:22:04,068 --> 00:22:05,333
just because we had sex.

445
00:22:05,488 --> 00:22:07,809
You need to project more,
use your diaphragm

446
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,145
if you really want
the entire hospital to hear you.

447
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:14,787
I definitely won't go out of
my way to be nice to you again.

448
00:22:20,747 --> 00:22:21,982
He doesn't trust me.

449
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:23,237
I mean, why?

450
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,809
Is he that way
with everybody or just me?

451
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:27,668
Can you help me convince him

452
00:22:27,731 --> 00:22:29,684
to start his chemotherapy
on schedule?

453
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,871
You want me to convince
a brain surgeon,

454
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,020
who doesn't like me,

455
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,329
that I know the best way
to treat his tumor?

456
00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:37,481
Yes.

457
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,221
Maybe just be supportive,
Shaun.

458
00:22:40,303 --> 00:22:41,489
He just wants
some time.

459
00:22:41,572 --> 00:22:45,653
No. He doesn't have time.
You don't understand.

460
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:47,128
Actually, I do understand.

461
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,981
And I'm getting really tired of
people treating me like I don't.

462
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:51,844
I know
how you feel.

463
00:22:52,075 --> 00:22:53,512
Where's your food?

464
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,950
Too many options. I got confused.

465
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:58,486
You find out why no one
wants to eat with me?

466
00:22:58,568 --> 00:22:59,958
Still snooping.

467
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,832
Hmm.

468
00:23:06,872 --> 00:23:07,996
Okay.

469
00:23:08,132 --> 00:23:11,012
We all need to do
something fun.

470
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,192
Either of you need a refill?

471
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:22,872
No, thanks.

472
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,262
I'm good.

473
00:23:24,372 --> 00:23:25,848
Neither do I.

474
00:23:28,114 --> 00:23:30,106
But I'm gonna get one anyways.

475
00:23:30,178 --> 00:23:32,270
I'll be in the arcade
when you two are done

476
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:34,762
with whatever
you need to deal with.

477
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:38,747
Regretting your invite now?

478
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:41,841
No. It's just, um...

479
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,684
Maybe we should think about
trying to get back together.

480
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:50,926
Are you insane?

481
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,488
We can't even spend half a day
together without a fight.

482
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:56,809
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I do respect you.

483
00:23:57,755 --> 00:24:00,348
Which is exactly why
I need you back in my life.

484
00:24:00,763 --> 00:24:03,020
To remind me
who I can be.

485
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:06,143
Come on, Alex.

486
00:24:06,263 --> 00:24:08,332
You've just been through
a traumatic experience.

487
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:10,926
You're exhausted...
and lonely.

488
00:24:18,198 --> 00:24:19,575
But...

489
00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:22,653
I love you.

490
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:28,020
Just tell me what I need to do,
and I'll do it.

491
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:34,758
Thank you.

492
00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:38,661
I know how hard it is for you
to open up.

493
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:41,738
I love you, too.

494
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:48,544
But I think it's best
if we just

495
00:24:48,878 --> 00:24:51,294
keep moving forward
with our lives.

496
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:20,968
Carnell Hunter?

497
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:24,210
- Yeah?
- We need to talk.

498
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:26,647
Yeah, well,
I need to do my job.

499
00:25:26,732 --> 00:25:29,210
So... unless you got a badge,

500
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,476
I ain't interested.

501
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:31,913
Time for a break.

502
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:33,627
Because we need
to tell you something,

503
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:35,601
and we want to make sure
you're listening.

504
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:37,803
Well, I'd get out of my face
if I were you.

505
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:40,568
Or what?
You gonna beat my ass?

506
00:25:40,928 --> 00:25:42,476
Who the hell are you?

507
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:44,249
Breeze Browne
is my mom.

508
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:46,022
She's moving
out of the apartment today.

509
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:48,038
And she never wants to see you
again.

510
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,977
What are you talking
about?

511
00:25:50,108 --> 00:25:52,613
You're a disgusting,
pathetically weak coward.

512
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:54,140
You know it.
And every woman

513
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:55,963
you've ever been with knows it,
too.

514
00:25:56,843 --> 00:25:58,593
I don't know
what you're talking about,

515
00:25:58,748 --> 00:26:01,452
but I would never
lay my hands on a woman.

516
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:02,990
Especially Breeze.

517
00:26:03,155 --> 00:26:05,239
I mean, she's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

518
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:06,778
I love her.

519
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:09,390
You guys all memorize
the same speech, don't you?

520
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:12,937
Why do you think
I asked her to marry me?

521
00:26:16,476 --> 00:26:18,266
Oh, she didn't tell you?

522
00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:21,929
What did she tell you?

523
00:26:25,026 --> 00:26:26,694
You had no right
to butt in.

524
00:26:26,776 --> 00:26:28,827
The poor guy was almost
in tears.

525
00:26:28,944 --> 00:26:31,655
Which is exactly why
I couldn't tell him to his face.

526
00:26:31,718 --> 00:26:34,382
He's just... He's so darn
sensitive about everything.

527
00:26:34,522 --> 00:26:36,003
So you thought
disappearing into the night

528
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:37,608
would make it easier
for him?

529
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:40,796
I know, you're right.
It's just...

530
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:45,335
I don't want to marry him.

531
00:26:46,124 --> 00:26:48,062
So tell him
you're not ready.

532
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,390
You want to take things
slower.

533
00:26:54,016 --> 00:26:56,437
He's one of the sweetest men
I've ever met.

534
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:59,038
So why are you trying
to ghost him?

535
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:06,066
I don't know.

536
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:08,975
Mom...

537
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:21,038
Dr. Andrews,
we have some findings.

538
00:27:21,187 --> 00:27:22,718
I'm excited
to hear them.

539
00:27:23,124 --> 00:27:25,319
And I just wanted to say,
with regard to the staffing issu...

540
00:27:25,401 --> 00:27:27,569
I wouldn't worry
about that anymore.

541
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:31,890
Uh, Dr. Audrey Lim
non-consensually dosed a man

542
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:34,288
who was not even a patient
with Haldol,

543
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,843
which is not only unethical,
it's a crime.

544
00:27:37,012 --> 00:27:39,866
And Dr. Neil Melendez
ignored a written DNR,

545
00:27:39,981 --> 00:27:41,433
which is also a crime.

546
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:44,058
And I've just reviewed a video

547
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,241
showing Dr. Shaun Murphy
curled up on the E.R. floor

548
00:27:47,336 --> 00:27:48,922
in the fetal position.

549
00:27:51,981 --> 00:27:54,068
Dr. Murphy has autism,

550
00:27:54,265 --> 00:27:57,738
which on extremely rare
occasions impacts his...

551
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,522
Ability to provide the proper
standard of care?

552
00:28:01,323 --> 00:28:02,823
I'll be recommending all three

553
00:28:02,905 --> 00:28:05,358
to the State Medical Board
for license suspension.

554
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,499
Bumper cars?
I'd rather go ice skating.

555
00:28:13,598 --> 00:28:15,327
I don't want to do either.

556
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,233
All right, these aren't
bumper cars, smartass.

557
00:28:17,315 --> 00:28:20,429
They're electric sprint-karts.
NASCAR drivers train in them.

558
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:24,247
We use them to test our device
prototypes, and they haul ass.

559
00:28:24,324 --> 00:28:26,507
This is a very bad idea.

560
00:28:26,578 --> 00:28:28,702
If the skull base repair
doesn't hold...

561
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:30,538
I could get
a subdural hematoma.

562
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:33,336
- Yes, we've established that.
- I don't know what that means.

563
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:35,858
But I do know both of you drove
on the freeway to get here.

564
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,866
If it's safe,
why do we have to wear...

565
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:40,710
Enough negativity.
Both of you.

566
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:42,632
You didn't blow off Blaize
just to go out

567
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:44,571
for a walk or a nice lunch.

568
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:47,226
It's time to crank up the volume
on this day off.

569
00:28:47,968 --> 00:28:50,108
I don't want to drive
a go-kart.

570
00:28:50,171 --> 00:28:51,367
I don't believe you.
I think you do

571
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:52,535
want to drive a go-kart.

572
00:28:52,617 --> 00:28:54,351
You just don't
want me to drive a go-kart.

573
00:28:54,414 --> 00:28:55,858
You know what?
I'm in.

574
00:28:58,854 --> 00:29:00,163
Okay.

That was awesome.

599
00:31:43,517 --> 00:31:47,164
I still beat your ass, but you
improved your time every lap.

600
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:48,398
Thank you.

601
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,000
You did, too, Shaun.

602
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:54,904
Are you okay?

603
00:31:55,054 --> 00:31:57,240
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You sure?

604
00:31:57,314 --> 00:31:59,634
You look
a little glassy-eyed, Glassy.

605
00:31:59,724 --> 00:32:01,984
No, I think I just have
something in my eye.

606
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:06,162
Do you have any dizziness
or a metallic taste?

607
00:32:06,244 --> 00:32:08,554
I'm fine, Shaun.
I'm actually fine.

608
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,432
I'm... You know what?
I'm better than fine.

609
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,081
I'm good.

610
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,135
He's good.

611
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:21,986
Yes!

612
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:25,776
Come on, Shaun.

613
00:32:27,252 --> 00:32:28,438
I was wrong.

614
00:32:28,565 --> 00:32:29,797
From the moment we met,

615
00:32:29,871 --> 00:32:32,212
my defensiveness was
unprofessional

616
00:32:32,357 --> 00:32:34,257
and my subsequent behavior
even worse.

617
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:37,093
I was not aware Dr. Lim
dosed a hospital visitor.

618
00:32:37,175 --> 00:32:39,690
Or that Dr. Melendez violated a DNR.

619
00:32:40,098 --> 00:32:41,697
But that's my fault.

620
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,510
Neither of them made any attempt
to hide their actions.

621
00:32:45,703 --> 00:32:47,790
Because they both are totally
committed to doing

622
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,539
whatever it takes to
provide the utmost care

623
00:32:49,621 --> 00:32:50,873
for their patients.

624
00:32:51,026 --> 00:32:55,631
Practicing medicine requires
doctors to make judgments.

625
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:57,446
Not just follow rules.

626
00:32:58,432 --> 00:33:02,831
Two human beings
who would otherwise be dead

627
00:33:03,034 --> 00:33:08,706
are alive because of rules
broken by Lim and Melendez.

628
00:33:09,017 --> 00:33:10,706
They were doing their jobs.

629
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:11,961
They shouldn't be
punished for that.

630
00:33:12,043 --> 00:33:13,424
They should be applauded.

631
00:33:22,744 --> 00:33:25,698
I'll be notifying
the State Board of our findings.

632
00:33:26,132 --> 00:33:29,448
It'll then be up
to those doctors to decide.

633
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:32,960
They'll leave us
bureaucrats out of it.

634
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:36,338
See you at the hearing.

635
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,120
I screwed up.

636
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,239
No, you did the right thing.
We both did.

637
00:33:59,478 --> 00:34:01,760
I wasn't talking
about this stupid investigation.

638
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:03,243
I was talking about us.

639
00:34:08,034 --> 00:34:10,701
Ever since my divorce,
I can't help but think...

640
00:34:13,526 --> 00:34:16,924
no matter how real
this feels, it's not.

641
00:34:22,635 --> 00:34:25,034
I have feelings
for you.

642
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:27,698
I have
for a long time.

643
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:30,190
And it scares me.

644
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,285
But I... don't want the night

645
00:34:33,348 --> 00:34:35,815
we spent together
to be our last.

646
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,963
I feel the same way.

647
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,276
But I'm not sure it's...
it's a good idea.

648
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,971
Especially now since we're both
gonna be under a microscope.

649
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:53,630
Yeah, that is true.

650
00:34:57,201 --> 00:35:00,807
Of course,
if, for the time being,

651
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,899
we just made sure that
Andrews and everyone else

652
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:05,527
doesn't know...

653
00:35:10,147 --> 00:35:11,901
Interesting idea.

654
00:35:17,507 --> 00:35:18,986
Good night, Neil.

655
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,789
Good night, Audrey.

656
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:32,473
Thank you.

657
00:35:34,072 --> 00:35:37,473
I'm glad you were here.
It helped.

658
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,712
No problem.

659
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:44,665
And also, um,
you're not clueless.

660
00:35:44,763 --> 00:35:45,979
I am.

661
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:49,463
You carry a gun.

662
00:35:49,826 --> 00:35:53,479
And you practically dared
that guy to take a swing at you.

663
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:58,002
I volunteered at a battered
women's shelter in med school,

664
00:35:58,141 --> 00:35:59,647
and I'm not an expert,

665
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,432
and I'm definitely
not trying to be a shrink,

666
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:06,517
but... if you ever
need someone to talk to.

667
00:36:07,247 --> 00:36:08,526
About anything.

668
00:36:13,132 --> 00:36:14,632
Thank you.

669
00:36:19,455 --> 00:36:20,885
It was a good day.

670
00:36:21,194 --> 00:36:24,854
I need to return the favor,
have you meet my mom.

671
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:26,857
It's a date.

672
00:36:40,186 --> 00:36:42,483
I decided not to postpone
the chemo.

673
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:44,366
That's a good idea.

674
00:36:45,678 --> 00:36:47,155
In fact, I'm gonna
speed it up.

675
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:50,585
I'm gonna go for a-a much more
aggressive regimen.

676
00:36:50,648 --> 00:36:53,316
- But Dr. Blaize...
- Dr. Blaize will have to agree.

677
00:36:53,455 --> 00:36:54,889
Or I'll get another doctor.

678
00:36:54,952 --> 00:36:56,118
I want
to get this over with.

679
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:59,522
I want to have
more days like today.

680
00:36:59,824 --> 00:37:01,133
And you should do the same.

681
00:37:01,215 --> 00:37:03,280
- I don't have cancer.
- Exactly.

682
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:05,046
You have no excuse.

683
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,600
Lea's okay, huh?

684
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,546
She gets you.

685
00:37:14,955 --> 00:37:17,776
Yes. I get her, too.
She's a good friend.

686
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:19,849
You think
she'll ever be more than that?

687
00:37:24,423 --> 00:37:26,569
She only wants
to be my friend.

688
00:37:26,683 --> 00:37:28,603
She made that very clear.

689
00:37:28,755 --> 00:37:30,147
Hmm.

690
00:37:33,224 --> 00:37:34,819
You're a good man, you know.

691
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:37,530
Deserve to be happy.

692
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,205
Well, thanks again
for staying.

693
00:37:54,974 --> 00:37:56,393
It was nice.

694
00:37:56,677 --> 00:37:58,386
It was.

695
00:37:58,981 --> 00:38:00,592
Well, bye.

696
00:38:28,048 --> 00:38:29,181
You forget something?

697
00:38:29,244 --> 00:38:30,610
No.

698
00:38:31,384 --> 00:38:32,759
Maybe you're right.

699
00:38:33,036 --> 00:38:37,639
We could try to slowly
and cautiously test the waters.

700
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:40,382
I would love that.

701
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:44,793
Maybe in a couple weeks
I could come back for a weekend.

702
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:46,064
On my own.

703
00:38:46,212 --> 00:38:47,530
Definitely.

704
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:56,796
I'll call you.

705
00:39:17,676 --> 00:39:19,028
Shaun?

706
00:39:19,165 --> 00:39:20,997
I thought you were gonna hang
with Glassy tonight.

707
00:39:21,124 --> 00:39:24,099
I did.
But he got tired.

708
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,380
Is there any more beer?
I'd like to try one.

709
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,463
Yeah, there's more
in the fridge.

710
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:34,231
How many beers
have you drunk?

711
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,317
Just this one.
Why?

712
00:39:38,782 --> 00:39:40,036
Oh, no.

713
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:42,997
Um... that's Jake's.

714
00:39:47,258 --> 00:39:50,593
Jake, meet my totally cool
roomie, Shaun Murphy.

715
00:39:50,675 --> 00:39:52,173
Shaun, meet Jake.

716
00:39:52,552 --> 00:39:53,646
Hello.

717
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:54,874
It's nice to meet you.

718
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:56,958
Uh, Lea's told me
a lot about you.

719
00:39:57,086 --> 00:39:58,650
He's such a sweetheart.

720
00:39:59,626 --> 00:40:01,112
Well, we gotta run.

721
00:40:01,186 --> 00:40:03,333
Jake's taking me
to Death Cab for Cutie.

722
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,658
Take it easy, Shaun.
And don't wait up.

723
00:40:05,725 --> 00:40:07,255
We're probably gonna
be out late.

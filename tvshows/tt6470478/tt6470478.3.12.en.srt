1
00:00:03,442 --> 00:00:05,024
Those are yours.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,664
We bought them together.

3
00:00:07,789 --> 00:00:10,969
Because you
"found the pattern soothing."

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,429
I'm gonna miss you,
Shaun.

5
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:23,343
I love Carly.

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,492
And that's great.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,578
I am so happy for you.

8
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:32,419
Now you can hang
the toilet paper incorrectly

9
00:00:32,507 --> 00:00:33,859
anytime you want.

10
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:35,335
And Carly and I
can go back

11
00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:37,632
to the way things were
before our fight.

12
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:42,203
Well, sometimes couples need
a little time to recover.

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,388
We won't.

14
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:46,001
Carly asked
for you to move out.

15
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,210
You <i>are</i> moving out.

16
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:53,656
How many kidneys do I need
in my body to attend prom?

17
00:00:53,744 --> 00:00:54,744
Ryan...

18
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:56,303
Even if the surgery
removes my kidney,

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,750
it'll be laparoscopic,

20
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:00,879
so my inpatient time
will be seven days, tops.

21
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:02,882
And then three more days
of rest at home.

22
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,143
I can take my girlfriend
to prom, right?

23
00:01:06,128 --> 00:01:07,771
That's not
a purely medical decision.

24
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,182
I have to
draw some blood.

25
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,219
What are the chances
Dr. Melendez might be able

26
00:01:11,307 --> 00:01:13,180
to remove the tumor
but spare Ryan's kidney?

27
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,113
Well, the MRI
will let us know

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,840
how much
the chemo shrunk the tumor,

29
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:19,020
but you shouldn't
count on it.

30
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:22,217
One chili burger,
extra mustard, extra pickles.

31
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,167
Hi.
Morning, Mr. Cooper.

32
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:25,971
I'm not sure he can have that
with his surgery...

33
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:28,098
Oh, he's fine
until about 6:30 tonight.

34
00:01:28,685 --> 00:01:30,017
Claire: I know you.

35
00:01:30,104 --> 00:01:32,644
Angie... Valens.

36
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:34,271
I helped put in
your chemo port.

37
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:36,773
I owe you a big thank‐you.

38
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,608
We met in chemo.

39
00:01:38,695 --> 00:01:40,736
They should put us in a public
service announcement or something.

40
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:42,863
Yeah... "I lost a tumor
and gained a boyfriend.

41
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,031
Thanks, chemo."

42
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,953
James McDougall?

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,246
That's who
we're here for, too.

44
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,623
All of you
can head over to Bay 4.

45
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,876
Guy saw me six months ago
for a stress fracture.

46
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:58,170
He's a lunatic
ultra‐marathoner.

47
00:01:58,257 --> 00:01:59,838
I just hope he didn't go
too hard too soon

48
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:01,301
and break it again.

49
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:09,639
He didn't
break it again.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,074

51
00:02:24,137 --> 00:02:26,323
Lim: Your GP was right to start
you on ketoprofen for the swelling,

52
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,325
but clearly,
it isn't working.

53
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:29,993
That's why
Drs. Murphy and Reznick

54
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,995
are going to block off
some of your lymphatic channels.

55
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:34,039
It should
reduce production.

56
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:36,124
The more pressing concern
is why.

57
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:38,380
Have you ever had surgery
on your lymph nodes?

58
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,089
What about cancer
or radiation treatment?

59
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:44,132
No. Physically,
I've always been healthy.

60
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:45,550
Physically?

61
00:02:45,637 --> 00:02:47,650
I was diagnosed with
Persistent Depressive Disorder

62
00:02:47,738 --> 00:02:49,429
when I was 16.

63
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:52,599
That's why you got to get me
back out on the road, Doc.

64
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:54,643
Are antidepressants
not effective for you?

65
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,436
I mean, they help.

66
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:59,106
But running really is key.

67
00:02:59,193 --> 00:03:01,983
Saved my marriage
and... and my life.

68
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,528
Lymphedema can be caused
by an infection.

69
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:06,496
He doesn't have
a fever.

70
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:08,281
Ketoprofen can
suppress fevers.

71
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:09,681
Let's get some cultures

72
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,535
and start him
on broad‐spec antibiotics.

73
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:19,459
As requested,
your restock on enemas.

74
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:21,168
Nice cover.

75
00:03:22,216 --> 00:03:23,338
How've you been feeling?

76
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:25,257
The methotrexate
is working great.

77
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:27,509
No pain, no redness.

78
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:29,634
Stiffness,
flu‐like symptoms?

79
00:03:29,722 --> 00:03:30,853
No. All good.

80
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,057
How long are you
planning to hide out

81
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,300
doing RA exams and clipping
diabetics' toenails?

82
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:40,650
Dizziness,
headaches, nausea?

83
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:43,902
I... Sometimes
I'm a little queasy after I eat.

84
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:46,871
You had to love
neurosurgery.

85
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:49,489
How about we try
to get you a medication

86
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:51,199
that doesn't irritate
your stomach?

87
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:54,004
No. My hands feel great.
That's all I care about.

88
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:58,222
You used to open up skulls
and poke around people's brains.

89
00:03:58,347 --> 00:04:00,738
There's no way
<i>this</i> fulfills you.

90
00:04:00,918 --> 00:04:02,210
I enjoy it.

91
00:04:02,297 --> 00:04:05,172
Or, rather,
I <i>usually</i> enjoy it.

92
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,824
I'll let you
get back to it.

93
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:12,910
Maybe someone out there
needs an enema.

94
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,268
Got a measurement
on the Wilms tumor?

95
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:21,464
Mm,
not quite there yet.

96
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:24,357
You mentioned 7 centimeters
as our limit

97
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:25,775
to doing this
laparoscopically.

98
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:28,400
What if we pushed it
to 7.2?

99
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:30,285
Would speed up recovery.

100
00:04:30,534 --> 00:04:32,119
By a few days.

101
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:34,962
Forget I brought it up.

102
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,460
Ryan wanting to take
his girlfriend to prom

103
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:40,733
should not factor into
our surgical plan.

104
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:42,042
Is he nuts about her?

105
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:45,126
Ohh. Crazy,
head over heels in love.

106
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:46,421
They both are.

107
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:47,508
Idiots.

108
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:52,230
I wouldn't mind being
an idiot like that again.

109
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:56,345
Though, I'm not sure
I ever felt <i>that</i> way...

110
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:57,765
totally happy.

111
00:04:57,853 --> 00:04:59,447
So therapy's going well?

112
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:02,949
No metastasis
in the lungs.

113
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:05,607
Look at that.

114
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:13,031
Your tumor is gone.

115
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,625
Gone?

116
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:19,161
How's that possible?

117
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:21,925
The chemotherapy worked
better than we expected.

118
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:24,605
Wait, like, no tumor?
Zero?

119
00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:26,267
No need for surgery
whatsoever?

120
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:27,261
Claire: That is right.

121
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:29,199
These are discharge forms.

122
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,511
Both of my kidneys
are taking you to prom!

123
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:35,804
Aah!
Hell, yeah, we are!

124
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:44,732
Angie?

125
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,552
Angie!

126
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,774
She's having a seizure!

127
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,549
2 milligrams of lorazepam
and portable oxygen, stat.

128
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,418
Let's get that
under her head.

129
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:59,363
His lungs
are filled with fluid.

130
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:03,456
I need a chest X‐ray
and a bedside ultrasound.

131
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:05,597
And page Dr. Reznick.

132
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:20,339
Imaging has confirmed

133
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:22,511
a reoccurrence
of your brain tumor.

134
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:25,148
What stage?

135
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:27,079
3.

136
00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:31,797
The best approach is surgery...
a wide resection of the tumor,

137
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:34,949
followed by radiation and chemo
to encourage full remission.

138
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,121
Sounds like
a fun couple months.

139
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:42,488
Full recovery will probably
take closer to eight.

140
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,506
We can get through this, baby,
just like last time.

141
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:53,714
W‐When will
the surgery be?

142
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:56,102
We need to do
some additional imaging,

143
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,719
and I'd like
to consult a colleague

144
00:06:57,807 --> 00:06:59,226
about the best
surgical approach.

145
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:00,534
That'll take
a few days.

146
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:03,612
Take your time.

147
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:06,569
Prom?

148
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:08,620
Yeah.

149
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,610
Now that Ryan can go,
I <i>have</i> to go.

150
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:13,667
Honey. This is your health
we're talking about.

151
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:16,316
Mom, please.

152
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:19,886
I just want to do this one thing
like a normal kid.

153
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:23,957
Can you tell her
it's okay?

154
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,245
Park: We can't.

155
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,001
Until we remove your tumor,
you're at risk

156
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,994
of potentially fatal
seizures.

157
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:33,546
After you're recovered,

158
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,173
you and Ryan
can get all dressed up,

159
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,940
and we'll go have dinner
at the Grandview.

160
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:38,028
Okay?

161
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:46,017
Prom sucks.

162
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:47,852
My buddy had a fake ID.

163
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:49,766
I got so drunk in the limo
that I passed out

164
00:07:49,854 --> 00:07:52,107
and never made it
into the dance.

165
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:54,734
Maybe that wasn't
everybody's experience.

166
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:57,128
I was prom king.
My date was queen.

167
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:03,063
I had the dress,
I had the date,

168
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:04,868
I had the mom
who got arrested.

169
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:06,871
Spent the night picking her up
from the drunk tank.

170
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,438
Did you see Park
while you were there?

171
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:12,331
Go to scheduling, get Angie's
surgery set for Friday...

172
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,254
with the best
neurosurgery OR nurses.

173
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:17,663
Let's go see Glassman.

174
00:08:18,612 --> 00:08:19,964
Andrews:
Now I'm identifying

175
00:08:20,052 --> 00:08:21,760
the submillimeter
lymphatic vessels.

176
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:25,464
I need an 11‐0 micro suture
and a 70 micron needle.

177
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:28,518
Instead of harvesting nodes
to this area,

178
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:31,312
could we redirect lymphatics
away from his lymph system?

179
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,471
We <i>could.</i>

180
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,753
If you identify
an appropriate vessel,

181
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:36,237
you can make
the connection.

182
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:38,745
Lim: We're clearly not dealing
with an infection.

183
00:08:38,907 --> 00:08:41,156
There must be a blockage
somewhere in his lymph system.

184
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,949
Most likely cancer.

185
00:08:43,128 --> 00:08:46,456
His CBC didn't show
any abnormal cells.

186
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:48,413
Lymphoma
doesn't always show up.

187
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,211
We need to run cytology
on his lymphatic fluid.

188
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:58,995
It's either gonna be nasty
or <i>very</i> nasty,

189
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,948
depending upon how it attaches
to the thalamus and fornix.

190
00:09:03,171 --> 00:09:07,297
Which no imaging or testing
can possibly determine.

191
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:09,517
So, our options are?

192
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:12,893
Between an endoscopic approach
or an open anterior one.

193
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:14,442
That is correct.

194
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,290
I'd run a stereotactic MRI
with fiducials and DTI

195
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:24,346
to gauge how close the white
matter tracts actually are.

196
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:26,719
You should scrub in.

197
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:30,000
Another doctor
can cover the clinic.

198
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:34,375
I haven't been in an OR
in over a year,

199
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:36,294
and then, as a patient.

200
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:38,338
I'm not asking you
to cut.

201
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:40,673
But it'd be a huge value
to have you there.

202
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:44,385
I appreciate that.

203
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:46,196
I'll consider it.

204
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:03,487
Hello. We need to run cytology
on this lymphatic fluid.

205
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,354
I would be happy to.

206
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:11,159
Lea moved out
this morning.

207
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:14,852
Thank you.

208
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,946
You're welcome.

209
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:17,891
Can you come over
tonight?

210
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:19,504
Uh, that probably
won't work...

211
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:21,448
Or we could go
to your apartment?

212
00:10:22,836 --> 00:10:24,129
I can't.

213
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,571
Lea said
that it might take time

214
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:30,565
for us to recover
from our fight.

215
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:32,563
But I told her
that we were okay.

216
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:34,351
We are.

217
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:36,145
I made plans tonight.

218
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:39,175
To hang out with a friend
who just got fired.

219
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:42,235
But I would love to come over
<i>tomorrow</i> night.

220
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:44,565
Okay.

221
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:46,815
I'll put a rush
on this test, too.

222
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,266
Your lymphovenous anastomosis
technique...

223
00:10:57,354 --> 00:10:58,793
I was impressed.

224
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,735
It's a little early
in the morning

225
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:02,130
to be sucking up,
Reznick.

226
00:11:02,217 --> 00:11:04,268
Not for me.
I like to get a jump on things.

227
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:06,594
I'm fascinated by the way
you use plastic procedures,

228
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:09,429
like microsurgery,
in other surgical specialties.

229
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:12,152
I thought it might make an
interesting topic for a paper.

230
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:14,510
Want to write it with me?

231
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,432
Yes.

232
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,646
Let's talk and eat.

233
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:22,568
That's not breakfast.

234
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:25,194
I'm buying.

235
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,363
What publications
do you want to target?

236
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:32,327
Last time, Angie had
bad post‐op vomiting.

237
00:11:32,414 --> 00:11:34,249
Of course.
I'll make note of it... Excuse me.

238
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:38,240
She's asleep.
She needs her rest.

239
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,058
I'll wait out here
until she's awake.

240
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:41,890
Ryan, your immune system
is weak.

241
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:43,713
It would be so easy
for you to pick up a bug

242
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,046
and pass it to Angie.

243
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:47,208
I haven't been around anyone
but my dad. I swear.

244
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:48,805
He could wear a mask.

245
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:54,057
After Angie's surgery,

246
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:56,142
we'll see about
arranging a visit.

247
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:57,772
Please tell her
Ryan came by.

248
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:03,399
I'm sorry
if I overstepped.

249
00:12:03,843 --> 00:12:05,224
I'd like
to change Angie's status

250
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:06,819
to "No visitors"
on her chart.

251
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:07,987
Yeah.

252
00:12:15,373 --> 00:12:16,929
Please take Mr. McDougall
to his room.

253
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:18,644
I'll be there
in a moment.

254
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,897
Is that James McDougall?

255
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,836
And the woman with him?

256
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:24,963
His wife.

257
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,798
Is it cancer?

258
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,851
No... worse.

259
00:12:29,262 --> 00:12:32,512
His lymphedema is caused
by a genetic mutation.

260
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:35,013
If you don't find a medication
he responds to,

261
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,266
he'll drown
from the inside.

262
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:43,796
The mutation is
on James' ARAF gene...

263
00:12:43,884 --> 00:12:45,528
it makes an enzyme
called kinase,

264
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:47,777
which can cause cells
to overproliferate.

265
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:49,734
It's a genetic condition.

266
00:12:51,218 --> 00:12:52,532
What set it off now?

267
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:54,047
Probably
the stress fracture.

268
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:55,660
Sent his immune system
into overdrive,

269
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:57,906
which fired up
his lymphatic system.

270
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,123
What treatment protocol
targets this mutation?

271
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,874
An MEK inhibitor.

272
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:03,376
The problem is,
which one?

273
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:07,380
There are 41 possibilities, each
with different side effects.

274
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,090
Good luck.

275
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:11,577
Well, I was hoping
you could stay.

276
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:17,356
Okay. Sure.

277
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:21,617
We need you
to stay completely still.

278
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:24,164
<i>Not a problem.</i>

279
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:27,430
You okay?

280
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,069
<i>Ryan totally bailed.</i>

281
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:31,783
<i>He hasn't come back
to see me.</i>

282
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:36,873
If you tell her that her mom
said he couldn't visit,

283
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:38,326
she'll be pissed
at her mom.

284
00:13:38,414 --> 00:13:39,938
How's that gonna help?

285
00:13:42,158 --> 00:13:45,119
He's probably...
busy catching up in school.

286
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:49,589
<i>We had a pact...</i>

287
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:52,906
<i>as long as we were together,
cancer wasn't gonna beat us.</i>

288
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:55,344
<i>He broke it.</i>

289
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,344
<i>Cancer wins.</i>

290
00:14:02,305 --> 00:14:03,805
Do you mind finishing?

291
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,824
Imaging finished?

292
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:18,149
Not quite.

293
00:14:18,253 --> 00:14:22,078
Mrs. Valens, Angie would
really like to see Ryan.

294
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,748
I know you're concerned
about infection,

295
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:25,249
but there is
minimal risk.

296
00:14:25,336 --> 00:14:28,461
Actually... Actually, none,
if they do a video chat.

297
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:30,852
Interesting idea.

298
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:32,592
I'll think about it.

299
00:14:35,016 --> 00:14:36,511
Angie's depressed.

300
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:39,096
And studies have shown that
that can have a negative impact

301
00:14:39,183 --> 00:14:41,224
on her surgical outcome.

302
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:47,020
Ryan doesn't always
improve Angie's mood.

303
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:49,795
A couple of weeks ago,
they had some silly fight,

304
00:14:49,883 --> 00:14:51,984
and she cried for days.

305
00:14:52,313 --> 00:14:53,694
Thank you
for letting me know.

306
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:55,347
I'm gonna do my best
to cheer her up.

307
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,406
She's a 16‐year‐old.

308
00:14:57,493 --> 00:14:59,116
She wants her boyfriend.

309
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:00,553
Yeah.

310
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:02,790
And how smart were <i>you</i>
when you were 16?

311
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:12,046
Morgan: Well,
what about Selumetinib?

312
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:14,711
It's shown promising results
on related conditions.

313
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,256
And a high occurrence
of liver disease.

314
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:21,414
Binimetinib is similar,
but has fewer complications.

315
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:23,719
Any objections?

316
00:15:26,165 --> 00:15:27,916
Let's start James
on that.

317
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:39,115
This is exciting,
working together.

318
00:15:39,202 --> 00:15:40,727
It <i>is.</i>

319
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,776
Although, I'm used to
samples and slides

320
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:45,563
instead of patients.

321
00:15:49,062 --> 00:15:51,811
Patients can be
difficult.

322
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,625
But you will be fine.

323
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,102
Do you need something?

324
00:16:15,947 --> 00:16:19,133
I was curious how James was
responding to the Binimetinib.

325
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,719
His urine output is up,

326
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:23,438
which suggests
the lymphatic fluid I...

327
00:16:24,313 --> 00:16:25,811
And his potassium
is a little low.

328
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:27,288
Can you... give him this?

329
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,607
I wasn't really...

330
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:46,458
Hi.

331
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:48,015
I'm Dr. Lever.

332
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:50,062
The tumor's abutting
and possibly infiltrating

333
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,747
the white matter tracts
of her fornix.

334
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:53,563
We'll likely have to
remove a section.

335
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:55,983
That'll affect her ability
to form memories.

336
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:57,450
With a lot
of neuropsych rehab,

337
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:59,946
she may be able to compensate
with other pathways.

338
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:02,044
Studies have shown
that positive attitudes

339
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:03,523
lead to positive outcomes.

340
00:17:03,611 --> 00:17:04,834
You're worried
about her attitude?

341
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:06,257
She's worried
about young love.

342
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:08,411
I'm worried about what Angie is
facing <i>after</i> surgery...

343
00:17:08,498 --> 00:17:10,841
physical therapy,
cognitive therapy,

344
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,031
one challenge
after another.

345
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,218
And what she wants
is so simple.

346
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:18,156
You want
to make a sad kid happy?

347
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:20,633
I guess I do.

348
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,176
Which isn't my job,
and I need to stop

349
00:17:22,263 --> 00:17:23,868
getting sucked into
people's personal issues.

350
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:26,554
Is there a way to do that
without antagonizing the mother?

351
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:31,554
Maybe.

352
00:17:32,874 --> 00:17:34,484
Then make her happy.

353
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,666
We've never gotten
this far before.

354
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:54,968
No.

355
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:56,419
We haven't.

356
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,398
And you're okay?

357
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:01,226
I am <i>very</i> okay.

358
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:11,929
Carly.

359
00:18:12,077 --> 00:18:13,102
Ohh.

360
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:28,266
Okay.

361
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:38,711
Did... I do
something wrong?

362
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:41,266
No, I'm sorry.
It's me.

363
00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:45,842
You said we were okay.

364
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,404
I thought we were.

365
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:48,721
I‐I want us to be.

366
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,701
You have no reason
to still be mad.

367
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:51,967
I'm not mad.

368
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:53,303
I'm... I'm just...

369
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:00,816
It's Morgan.

370
00:19:00,903 --> 00:19:03,819
The medication caused James
an upper GI bleed.

371
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:13,454
Have you localized
the source of the bleeding?

372
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,375
Working on it.

373
00:19:14,463 --> 00:19:16,670
Seems to be coming
from the antrum of the stomach.

374
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:18,471
Morgan:
We stopped the Binimetinib.

375
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,508
On top of causing this,

376
00:19:19,596 --> 00:19:21,170
it hadn't done much
to curtail the swelling.

377
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:22,213
Where's Dr. Lever?

378
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:24,789
There's the ulcerative lesion.
Cautery.

379
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:29,469
Zebrafish.

380
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:30,846
They're used
in medical research

381
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:32,348
because of
their quick maturation,

382
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:35,076
and 84% of genes
associated with human disease

383
00:19:35,164 --> 00:19:36,844
have a zebrafish equivalent.

384
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:40,466
You think we should do
a transgenic expression

385
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:44,346
of James' ARAF mutation
into the zebrafish genome.

386
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:45,736
Translation
for those of us

387
00:19:45,823 --> 00:19:47,446
without a genetics textbook
handy?

388
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:50,092
We make mini‐Jameses,
as zebrafish,

389
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,409
all with the same disorder.

390
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:54,370
Then we test every conceivable
drug on those fish.

391
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,247
How long before
we can start testing?

392
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:58,084
If we implant
the embryos now,

393
00:19:58,172 --> 00:19:59,667
probably by
late afternoon tomorrow.

394
00:19:59,755 --> 00:20:00,875
Get going.

395
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:03,087
Shaun, go with her.
You have Path experience.

396
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:26,625
I understand
no means no.

397
00:20:27,388 --> 00:20:30,516
If you don't want
to have sex,

398
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:33,033
I accept that.

399
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:35,703
But I am very confused.

400
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,649
So am I.

401
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,930
I thought I was fine
u‐until I...

402
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:43,976
I told Lea to move out,
like you wanted.

403
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:47,341
You said
that things were okay.

404
00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:48,606
They aren't.

405
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:50,383
How do I make them okay?

406
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:53,555
I can't tell you,
because I don't know.

407
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:19,288
When I was in chemo,

408
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,749
the nurses used to
force that stuff down my throat,

409
00:21:21,836 --> 00:21:24,376
so I know you're not drinking it
because of the taste.

410
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,219
It's fast, easy nutrition.

411
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:30,375
That and you don't end up puking
your guts out in the bathroom.

412
00:21:31,762 --> 00:21:34,220
I was president of this hospital
for over 10 years.

413
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:37,097
I made a few friends,
including Jack the janitor...

414
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:40,017
talks a lot, A's fan,
horrible gossip.

415
00:21:40,297 --> 00:21:42,555
If the methotrexate
is making you sick,

416
00:21:42,643 --> 00:21:44,477
we should try
another medication.

417
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,732
How can you guarantee
that you're not gonna throw up

418
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,883
in the middle
of your next surgery?

419
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:53,728
It won't happen.

420
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:57,594
Because it only happens
if I eat solid food.

421
00:21:57,934 --> 00:21:59,143
And I stopped.

422
00:22:00,425 --> 00:22:02,086
At least at work.

423
00:22:13,408 --> 00:22:15,662
That is a lot
of fish tanks.

424
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,756
40.

425
00:22:16,844 --> 00:22:18,138
So we can test

426
00:22:18,225 --> 00:22:20,933
all of the possible
medications for...

427
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:22,768
Are you
throwing a party?

428
00:22:23,073 --> 00:22:24,241
Hope so.

429
00:22:36,827 --> 00:22:38,688
How are you doing,
Shaun?

430
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:41,297
Since your father
passed away?

431
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:47,555
I don't think about him
very much.

432
00:22:51,884 --> 00:22:55,102
My mom... died recently.

433
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,117
I‐I don't know
if you knew that.

434
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:01,672
She pops into my head
all the time.

435
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,852
Not always
the nicest thoughts.

436
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,680
It's okay
not to love them.

437
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:19,241
They didn't make us
who we are.

438
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:58,016
Has your mom gone home?

439
00:24:00,244 --> 00:24:03,820
There is one more thing
we have to deal with tonight.

440
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,455
Come on.

441
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:09,383
How many more sets of imaging
can you possibly do?

442
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:13,503
One of these
is your prom dress.

443
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:17,591
I like the pink, but I think
you'd look gorgeous in both.

444
00:24:21,432 --> 00:24:22,805
Hurry up and choose.

445
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:24,680
Your date'll be here soon.

446
00:24:37,782 --> 00:24:40,239
All the medications
are in.

447
00:24:40,451 --> 00:24:44,410
Which means more waiting
to see which medicine works.

448
00:24:44,497 --> 00:24:46,290
It's hard to be patient.

449
00:24:51,587 --> 00:24:55,610
Do you think the fish control
how they react to the meds?

450
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:57,695
No.

451
00:24:58,052 --> 00:25:00,742
It's just
how their bodies respond.

452
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:05,469
That's how I felt
last night.

453
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:11,492
I thought I was ready
for us to be together, but...

454
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:14,731
my body had
a different response.

455
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:18,303
I can't
turn that response off

456
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,217
any more
than these fish can control

457
00:25:20,305 --> 00:25:22,781
how their mutation reacts
to the medication.

458
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:34,719
Was our mutation
me going to Wyoming with Lea?

459
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:45,304
Do you think we can find
our right medication?

is from too much fluid

513
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:43,633
Cross SL‐327 off the list.

514
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:46,438
I see one...

515
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,891
no, <i>two</i> tumors.

516
00:30:11,794 --> 00:30:13,008
Okay.

517
00:30:13,382 --> 00:30:14,969
This is my stop.

518
00:30:15,057 --> 00:30:16,555
I'll see you after.

519
00:30:16,891 --> 00:30:18,326
I love you.

520
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,531
I love you, too, Mom.

521
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:25,414
Don't worry. Okay?

522
00:30:25,873 --> 00:30:27,624
I got this.

523
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:31,070
I know you do.

524
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:40,240
Okay.

525
00:30:40,328 --> 00:30:41,467
Okay.

526
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:51,344
What if I wake up
and don't remember Ryan at all?

527
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:56,507
Then...

528
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,858
you'll have the chance
to fall in love with him

529
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:00,368
all over again.

530
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:05,914
Okay.

531
00:31:07,011 --> 00:31:08,011
Okay.

532
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:21,515
We're down
to five potential options.

533
00:31:21,602 --> 00:31:23,850
I don't need five potential.
I need one actual.

534
00:31:23,937 --> 00:31:25,707
There are two
that best curb...

535
00:31:25,795 --> 00:31:26,838
Choose one.

536
00:31:27,858 --> 00:31:31,498
We should try Refametinib.

537
00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:33,404
It caused
abnormal cell growth.

538
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,195
Trametinib is safer.

539
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:37,201
Which doesn't mean
it's safe.

540
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:38,360
Nothing's safe.

541
00:31:38,448 --> 00:31:39,616
Which do you want us to do?

542
00:31:44,607 --> 00:31:45,817
Trametinib.

543
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:46,914
That's the one.

544
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,090
Saline in.

545
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:56,758
Advancing scope
toward the third ventricle.

546
00:31:56,845 --> 00:31:58,854
Claire, hold gentle pressure
on the tumor

547
00:31:58,942 --> 00:32:00,804
while I cut off
its blood supply.

548
00:32:07,452 --> 00:32:09,131
We've got
some significant bleeding.

549
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,901
Adjust the scope
and suction.

550
00:32:15,765 --> 00:32:17,200
Look higher.

551
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:19,797
Septal vein...
there's your bleeder.

552
00:32:19,885 --> 00:32:21,095
Cauterize away.

553
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:07,535
Micro dissector.

554
00:33:12,713 --> 00:33:14,098
The tumor's immobile.

555
00:33:14,473 --> 00:33:16,635
I can't resect it without
injuring the nerve tracts.

556
00:33:16,723 --> 00:33:18,247
She'd be comatose.

557
00:33:18,353 --> 00:33:19,688
Try sharp dissection.

558
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:22,995
I can't get a plane.
How bad?

559
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:24,971
It's completely invaded
her thalamus.

560
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:28,778
Thin it out
with a suction aspirator.

561
00:33:34,606 --> 00:33:35,982
It's too adherent.

562
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,071
If I keep going,
I'm gonna kill her.

563
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:41,600
Any ideas?

564
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:06,761
Tell ICU Angie will be coming
sooner than we planned.

565
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:10,031
Let's close her up.

566
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:29,982
What's next?

567
00:34:30,217 --> 00:34:32,231
Another round of radiation,
chemo?

568
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:37,880
Her carcinoma is...

569
00:34:37,968 --> 00:34:40,471
unlikely to respond
to those therapies.

570
00:34:44,304 --> 00:34:45,411
No.

571
00:34:45,499 --> 00:34:47,455
We have to try.

572
00:34:47,682 --> 00:34:49,014
Angie will want to fight.

573
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:50,339
She's seizing.

574
00:34:50,426 --> 00:34:51,683
Give me lorazepam
and Dilantin, stat.

575
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,239
Phenobarb and propofol
on deck.

576
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,411
You're crying.

577
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:21,909
Yes.

578
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,888
Why?

579
00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:31,419
I found James on Facebook.

580
00:35:33,437 --> 00:35:36,106
He and Marjorie
want to go to Costa Rica.

581
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:41,193
Their dog is a three‐legged
rescue named Tripod.

582
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,528
He's not a slide.
He's a person.

583
00:35:49,536 --> 00:35:51,073
He's a good person.

584
00:35:51,161 --> 00:35:52,528
And he might die.

585
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,840
This is why I like
to stay in the lab.

586
00:36:02,215 --> 00:36:03,887
That...

587
00:36:04,384 --> 00:36:07,223
is a very dumb thing
to say.

588
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:11,856
If you had
stayed in the lab,

589
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,731
James would probably
be dead already.

590
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:23,387
Your plan with the zebrafish
gave him a chance.

591
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:28,528
It was a beautiful,
perfect idea,

592
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:32,667
from a beautiful,
almost perfect person.

593
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,786
Your earlobes
are lopsided.

594
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,434
I'm so sorry.

595
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,621
We couldn't save her.

596
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,684
Ms. Valens?

597
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:15,426
Nice call
on the zebrafish.

598
00:38:34,638 --> 00:38:36,845
About our paper,
let's meet weekly.

599
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:39,652
I'm thinking lunch every Tuesday
in the cafeteria.

600
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,866
Perfect.

601
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:53,950
I heard about
Melendez's patient.

602
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,419
Yeah.

603
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:09,692
You were right.

604
00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:14,106
I should probably try
another medication for my RA.

605
00:39:15,796 --> 00:39:17,631
I need solid food.

606
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,215
Melendez:
Claire? Wait up.

607
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:33,598
You okay?

608
00:39:33,944 --> 00:39:36,030
Fine.
I'm just tired.

609
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:40,054
You did an amazing thing
for Angie.

610
00:39:40,141 --> 00:39:42,724
You gave her mother a memory
that she will have forever.

611
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:45,481
Well, it won't make up
for the daughter she lost.

612
00:39:45,863 --> 00:39:47,143
You're angry.

613
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:49,314
I'm not. I am sad.

614
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:51,274
- Who are you angry at?
- I'm not.

615
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:53,610
Are you angry at me and Glassman
because we couldn't save her?

616
00:39:53,697 --> 00:39:55,194
- No!
- At Angie?

617
00:39:55,281 --> 00:39:58,301
No, you can't be mad at someone
for dying!

618
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:01,147
That's not true.
You know that.

619
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,044
She was sick.

620
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:07,332
And she was trying
to get better.

621
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:09,489
She failed
and left you alone.

622
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:12,801
After you'd spent a lifetime
trying to take care of her.

623
00:40:13,273 --> 00:40:15,637
You have every reason
to be mad at your mother.

624
00:40:16,821 --> 00:40:18,567
I hate feeling this way.

625
00:40:18,737 --> 00:40:20,718
My whole life,
I've been angry at her,

626
00:40:20,806 --> 00:40:22,989
and now
it will never change.

627
00:40:23,702 --> 00:40:25,528
I don't know how to stop.

628
00:40:29,278 --> 00:40:31,438
Therapy will help.

629
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:33,278
Time will help.

630
00:40:35,154 --> 00:40:37,819
There is one other thing
that's worked for me.

631
00:40:50,122 --> 00:40:52,502
Did we fix our mutation?

632
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:07,308
That the best you got?

632
00:41:08,305 --> 00:42:08,653

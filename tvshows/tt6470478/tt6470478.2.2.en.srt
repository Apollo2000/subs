_

3
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,304
You're here early. Trouble sleeping?

4
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,272
No. Just wanted to get out

5
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,141
of my apartment and to work.

6
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:35,554
We work you plenty hard enough. Go home.

7
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:37,789
Making sure you're rested
is also part of the job.

8
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:39,013
I understand.

9
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:42,980
What should I tell a patient

10
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:44,202
if they don't think they're sick

11
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:47,189
but I think they have pancreatic cancer?

12
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:49,616
You think one of our patients
has pancreatic cancer?

13
00:00:54,563 --> 00:00:56,941
Seventeen.

14
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:59,508
He's burped 17 times

15
00:00:59,532 --> 00:01:00,831
in 10 minutes.

16
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:03,754
It's a frequent symptom
of pancreatic cancer.

17
00:01:03,778 --> 00:01:06,540
Shaun, it's acid reflux.

18
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:09,410
He's also jaundiced.

19
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:13,995
No, he isn't.

20
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:16,909
Paul's skin is definitely not

21
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:19,445
the same color it was six months ago.

22
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:21,242
- Paul?
- I looked at his mouth

23
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:23,315
when he was telling me
about his daughter.

24
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:24,983
- She just...
- Walk with me.

25
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:28,554
Say nothing.

26
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,010
Hey, Shaun.

27
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:53,783
Do a CVC, CMP,

28
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:56,385
amylase, lipase, CA-19 levels,

29
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,588
and CT abdomen,
pelvis pancreatic protocol,

30
00:01:58,612 --> 00:02:00,378
and do not tell him why.

31
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:01,923
You want me to lie?

32
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:03,424
I don't want you to tell the truth.

33
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:06,127
The discoloration, if there
is any, is very minor.

34
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:07,962
I don't want you scaring the crap
out of the man over nothing.

35
00:02:07,986 --> 00:02:10,598
Excellent. I've been practicing lying.

36
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:12,266
I lied to you before when I said

37
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,792
I just wanted to get out
of my apartment and to work.

38
00:02:16,174 --> 00:02:17,841
Take Claire.

39
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:22,930
Hello. I'm Dr. Lim.

40
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:24,332
How can I help you today...

41
00:02:24,357 --> 00:02:25,624
Asha?

42
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:29,883
I want plastic surgery.

43
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:32,472
Sweetheart, this is the Emergency Room.

44
00:02:32,496 --> 00:02:34,874
If you want, I can make
an appointment for you...

45
00:02:34,898 --> 00:02:37,099
Well, you do vaginal rejuvenation, right?

46
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:39,411
Yes...

47
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:41,147
On much older, much vainer women,

48
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:43,563
generally after having many children.

49
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:45,284
I don't know what the
boys have told you...

50
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:46,582
Examine me.

51
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:49,238
Please.

52
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:52,081
Please take off your underwear.

53
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,144
Were you in an accident?

54
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:19,435
No.

55
00:03:20,664 --> 00:03:21,798
Can you help me?

56
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,679
- Did your father do this to you?
- No.

57
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:26,081
- Please just...
- Did your mother...

58
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,849
- I need to know who did this to you.
- No, you don't!

59
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:29,050
It doesn't matter who...

60
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:39,243
When I was 2 years old...

61
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:42,873
I was... Tied down,

62
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:44,675
and I was circumcised.

63
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:49,936
Please.

64
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,968
I'm hideous.

65
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:58,448
Will you help me?

66
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:02,049
Yes.

67
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:13,420
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

68
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,123
Why do you need to confirm

69
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:18,826
a diagnosis of acid reflux?

70
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,894
Because we're doctors. It's what we do.

71
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,452
We just like to be sure of everything.

72
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:27,301
There are a few remote possibilities...

73
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:28,592
I've got this!

74
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:33,707
Are you familiar with
the hospital employee manual

75
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,110
section 17, subsection C, triple I?

76
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:37,578
- No.
- Good.

77
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:39,213
- Good?
- Yes.

78
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,683
It requires that all employees

79
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:44,384
shall be subject to,

80
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:46,153
and I quote,

81
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:48,288
"Any and all possible necessary tests

82
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:50,124
"to confirm any and all diagnoses,

83
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:52,226
"no matter how mundane,
the cost of which tests

84
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,818
"shall be borne by
the hospital," end quote.

85
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:03,270
The Board wants to make sure

86
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:05,806
that no one is exposed to patients

87
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,708
if there is any chance that they have

88
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:09,699
any communicable condition.

89
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,252
I had the flu last week.

90
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,637
Why didn't anybody
do anything for me then?

91
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:26,016
- It's a new policy.
- You might have pancreatic cancer.

92
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:28,800
What?

93
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:30,058
What'd he say?

94
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:33,534
Female genital mutilation

95
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:36,203
is the ritual cutting
or removal of some, or all,

96
00:05:36,227 --> 00:05:38,192
of the external female genitalia.

97
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:40,857
Over 200 million victims worldwide.

98
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:42,876
It is almost universally practiced

99
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,136
in a number of African
and Asian countries.

100
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,338
Where was she born?

101
00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:48,784
Wisconsin.

102
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:50,352
Yeah, it's way more common
here than you think.

103
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:52,254
- What religion is she?
- I didn't ask.

104
00:05:52,278 --> 00:05:53,528
This isn't about religion.

105
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:55,977
No legit religious organization
endorses this stuff.

106
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:58,690
We're gonna do the labiaplasty
first thing in the morning.

107
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:01,159
The damage done to her nerves
is not going to get undone,

108
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:02,707
nor is the psych damage,

109
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:05,363
but at least she'll
look like other girls.

110
00:06:05,387 --> 00:06:06,798
We should be able to have her out of here

111
00:06:06,822 --> 00:06:07,899
by 6:00 in the evening.

112
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:10,368
Outpatient? Why the hurry?

113
00:06:10,392 --> 00:06:12,771
So her mother will simply
think she's in school,

114
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:14,262
then out studying with her friends.

115
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:17,876
She loves her parents
and doesn't want to tell them

116
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,345
that she's rejecting one
of their cultural traditions.

117
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:21,780
They won't stay in the dark for long,

118
00:06:21,804 --> 00:06:23,715
since we're legally obligated
to report them.

119
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:25,917
That "cultural tradition" also fits

120
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:28,620
- the definition of abuse.
- And they'll also find out when we ask

121
00:06:28,644 --> 00:06:30,488
for their permission to do this surgery.

122
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:31,823
She's a minor.

123
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:33,325
Her ID says she's 18.

124
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,060
Yes, her fake ID

125
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:36,661
says she's 18.

126
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:38,998
Her number starts with an "H," which
means she was born in the '50s.

127
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:41,800
Also, the photo background
is green instead of blue.

128
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:43,632
Also six other things.

129
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:45,511
Maybe we can get Legal
to get a court order...

130
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:47,246
If I believe that ID is real,

131
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,548
then I am entitled
to perform this surgery

132
00:06:49,572 --> 00:06:52,551
without seeking consent of
anyone other than the patient.

133
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:55,621
And, as legally required within 36 hours,

134
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:57,356
I will report the evidence of abuse

135
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,392
under the name and address
listed on that ID.

136
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,995
If the investigation of that report

137
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:05,331
doesn't begin until the girl is long gone

138
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:08,400
and happens to lead nowhere
because the name wasn't real,

139
00:07:08,424 --> 00:07:09,902
that's no fault of mine.

140
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:12,071
Are you sure you want
to risk your medical license

141
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:13,472
to protect an abusive mother?

142
00:07:13,496 --> 00:07:15,007
If we do this by the book,

143
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:17,042
we never see that girl again
and no one gets help.

144
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:20,112
If we do this by the book, maybe
the cops lock the parents up.

145
00:07:20,136 --> 00:07:22,581
We shine a light on this thing,
her community gets scared,

146
00:07:22,605 --> 00:07:24,650
and maybe the next girl
doesn't need our help.

147
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:26,518
Or maybe the testimony of the girl

148
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:28,253
about what happened to her when she was 2

149
00:07:28,277 --> 00:07:29,922
doesn't help the cops at all.

150
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:31,890
Maybe the parents just
take their daughter home,

151
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:33,425
and maybe we scare the next girl

152
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,784
into not even asking for help.

153
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:40,199
I'm doing the surgery to this girl

154
00:07:40,223 --> 00:07:43,602
under this name
tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m.

155
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,082
I can't believe people ever lie.

156
00:07:57,106 --> 00:07:59,485
There are so many questions

157
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:01,387
people might ask you,

158
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:03,088
but if you tell the truth,

159
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:05,135
you already know the answers.

160
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:08,560
And, also, it's wrong.

161
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:10,496
But sometimes,

162
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,021
you shouldn't tell the whole truth?

163
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:16,769
No. Of course not.

164
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:19,471
Because that lets you be honorable

165
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:22,941
and tell the truth and be a good person,

166
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:24,410
but at the same time,

167
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:27,579
you get to completely deceive the person.

168
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:29,968
- No, I don't think that...
- Lea came back.

169
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,317
Wow, Shaun, that's great.

170
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:35,921
She's staying with me
until she finds her own place.

171
00:08:35,945 --> 00:08:37,813
You must be so excited.

172
00:08:39,148 --> 00:08:40,348
Yes.

173
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:43,919
You're not excited?

174
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,121
I said, "Yes."

175
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:51,293
Paul has one year to live.

176
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:55,063
He has pancreatic cancer.

177
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:57,176
Stage III.

178
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:03,777
There are no metastatic
lesions, but there are

179
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:05,845
- local nodes involved.
- And there's partial encasement

180
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:07,380
of the superior mesenteric artery.

181
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:08,548
That puts it past the point

182
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:10,639
where we can cure with local resection.

183
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,885
We could do Whipple surgery.

184
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:15,121
That's not advised for
stage III pancreatic cancer.

185
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:17,890
Not quite. It's not advised for stage IV.

186
00:09:17,914 --> 00:09:20,259
For stage III, it's discretionary.

187
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:21,823
In my discretion,

188
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:23,722
he's better off with
12 semi-comfortable months,

189
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:26,034
rather than running the risk of
dying on the table tomorrow.

190
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:28,737
If he doesn't die on the table,
he could have many years.

191
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:30,814
It isn't our call to make.

192
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,020
I'll talk to Paul,
advise him of the parameters,

193
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:34,513
let him make his own decision.

194
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,442
No.

195
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,230
Shaun should do it.

196
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:42,008
Claire can do it.

197
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:44,610
Yes, she can,
which is why you should do it.

198
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:46,612
This is a teaching hospital.

199
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:47,847
Andrews is right...

200
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:49,882
Being a surgeon isn't just about cutting.

201
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:12,073
Would it be okay

202
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:14,837
if we spoke someplace more quiet?

203
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:18,461
You need someplace quiet
to tell me I have acid reflux?

204
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,054
I think we should be someplace quiet

205
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:26,389
because people sometimes get very upset

206
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:28,091
when they find out
they probably only have

207
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:29,828
less than a year to live.

208
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:37,925
Okay, uh...

209
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:39,961
Can I call my family?

210
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:42,132
They should probably hear
what you have to say, too.

211
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:43,682
I'd rather just talk to...

212
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:45,433
Of course you can.

213
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,692
I'll elevate it with
a 6-inch Ambler tissue hook.

214
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,894
You separate the underlying
tissue with iris forceps.

215
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,630
I got it. Tenotomy scissors.

216
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,265
I think we're actually
a little ahead of schedule.

217
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,634
Might be able to get her home
in time to do her homework.

218
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,860
Back to the bosom of her loving family.

219
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,662
We'd remove as much
of the cancer as possible

220
00:11:06,662 --> 00:11:08,439
by removing the head of the pancreas

221
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:10,041
and other attached organs,

222
00:11:10,065 --> 00:11:12,494
but then, we'd have to
reconstruct the anatomy.

223
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:13,972
The easiest way to do that

224
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:15,307
is to bring up a loop of jejunum...

225
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:16,331
Shaun.

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,444
Sorry.

227
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:22,547
The jejunum is part
of the small intestine

228
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:24,182
between the duodenum and ileum.

229
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:27,945
It's complicated, very dangerous surgery.

230
00:11:27,946 --> 00:11:29,590
And even if it's successful,

231
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:32,627
post-operative complications
are frequent and serious.

232
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,261
And recovery can be very painful.

233
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:39,393
But if it works, he's better?
He'll be healthy?

234
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:41,295
He would still need chemotherapy

235
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:43,164
and a lifetime of monitoring.

236
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:46,056
But hopefully, a long lifetime.

237
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:49,443
Let's do it, Dad.

238
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:50,835
What do you say?

239
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:54,951
What should I do?

240
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,942
It's your decision.

241
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:03,210
All we can do
is present you with the facts.

242
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:07,839
Yeah, here are the facts, Dad...

243
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:10,231
The surgery may kill you.

244
00:12:10,256 --> 00:12:12,601
Not doing the surgery will kill you.

245
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:24,005
Can you give us a few minutes?

246
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,307
Of course.

247
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:35,184
It was very nice of Dr. Andrews
to give you an office,

248
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:36,853
even though, you're on medical leave.

249
00:12:36,878 --> 00:12:38,423
Yeah, he is a prince.

250
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:40,125
Who's your surgeon going to be?

251
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,350
I haven't d...

252
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:43,555
I haven't decided yet.

253
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:46,756
You should definitely go with

254
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:50,165
Dr. Joshua Atkinson
at Stanford Medical Center.

255
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,235
His mortality index is .3.

256
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,735
It's too low.

257
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,272
Not enough of his patients are dying?

258
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:58,341
No, Shaun, sometimes patients die.

259
00:12:58,366 --> 00:12:59,844
Doesn't matter how good the doctor is.

260
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:02,797
But when your mortality rate
is as low as Atkinson's,

261
00:13:02,797 --> 00:13:04,775
it means you're turning away patients.

262
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,877
You turn away patients,
it means you lack confidence.

263
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:10,106
You lack confidence, I don't
want you inside my head.

264
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:12,510
And I'd like to be able to dress myself

265
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:13,902
when I'm all done.

266
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:18,382
Shaun, what are you doing here?

267
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:21,453
You showed up at work early this morning.

268
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:23,412
Go home. Get some rest.

269
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:28,802
I won't rest if I go home.

270
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:38,859
The surgery went great.

271
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:40,906
Once everything's healed, I think

272
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:43,376
you'll be very happy with the results.

273
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:46,562
- What time is it?
- Not quite 5:45.

274
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:47,706
We just need you to pee, and...

275
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,141
I need to go home.

276
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:51,510
And you will... very soon.

277
00:13:53,154 --> 00:13:55,699
- It hurts.
- I told you it would.

278
00:13:55,723 --> 00:13:57,634
We did a lot of cutting and scraping.

279
00:13:57,658 --> 00:13:59,503
You had a lot of scar tissue.

280
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:00,804
It hurts a lot.

281
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:02,272
We'll give you some Tylenol,

282
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:04,174
and you can tell your mother
you're cramping.

283
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:06,076
Ow!

284
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:10,503
Hang ketamine... 130 micrograms
per kilogram per hour.

285
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:14,985
Why does it hurt this much?

286
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:16,209
I don't know.

287
00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:18,645
But you're not going home.

288
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,586
Ow!

289
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:25,946
She's heavily sedated.

290
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,447
What did we do to her?

291
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:29,105
What if this is good news?

292
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:32,552
I know you haven't been
a doctor all that long,

293
00:14:32,576 --> 00:14:34,621
but pain is rarely a sign of good news.

294
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:36,456
It is if you're talking about
a part of the body

295
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,225
you thought was dead.

296
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:40,894
What if this means there's still
viable nerve endings in there?

297
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:43,053
What if this means we can
actually reconstruct her clitoris

298
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:44,854
and that it's capable of sensation?

299
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:47,106
Maybe. All we know for sure

300
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:48,976
is she's not gonna be home
anywhere near 6:00,

301
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:51,436
which means we're about to have
a missing child on our hands.

302
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,355
We have to bring Andrews up to speed.

303
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:10,618
I did a bad job of telling you

304
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,186
that you're dying.

305
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,388
Is there a good way?

306
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:21,249
I can't figure out
when I'm supposed to lie,

307
00:15:21,274 --> 00:15:24,090
when I'm supposed to tell
part of the truth.

308
00:15:24,282 --> 00:15:26,027
And it doesn't really matter,

309
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:29,054
because I can't figure out
how to do it anyway.

310
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,470
You did fine with me.

311
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:36,277
You never need to lie.

312
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,337
Lies don't protect you from the truth.

313
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,054
I don't like your haircut.

314
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:46,719
Okay.

315
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:53,445
Maybe sometimes, when the
truth can't help someone...

316
00:15:56,403 --> 00:15:58,371
...you should definitely just lie.

317
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:04,730
Do you think praying will
help you reach a decision?

318
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:09,813
I've already reached a decision.

319
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:14,383
I'm praying to help me find
comfort with that decision.

320
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,643
My family wants the surgery.

321
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:22,075
And what do you want?

322
00:16:23,531 --> 00:16:25,498
I want what my family wants.

323
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:28,030
I love them.

324
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:29,856
But they love you, too, right?

325
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:33,740
Don't they want what you want?

326
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:39,099
Long ago, I made a decision

327
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,542
to be there for them

328
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:44,848
no matter what.

329
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:51,590
And if the last choice I make in my life

330
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:53,215
is consistent with that,

331
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:58,287
I'm comfortable with that.

332
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:16,290
I'm surprised by you.

333
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,536
I, arguably, made errors in judgment,

334
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,838
but it was all in an effort
to help a patient.

335
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:22,507
Yes, and that would make sense
if you thought

336
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:24,575
you'd never have
another patient ever again.

337
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,678
And if there wasn't currently an
opening for Chief of Surgery.

338
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,790
I didn't know that was on the table.

339
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:32,426
See, that's the difference
between you and Melendez.

340
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,896
I have no doubt that as soon
as I got this promotion,

341
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,866
Melendez had done the math
and reacted accordingly.

342
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,174
But I suspect that even
if you had done the math,

343
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:44,811
it wouldn't have changed
how you handled this patient.

344
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:46,340
I don't view that as a weakness.

345
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,571
I'll handle the administrative fallout.

346
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:53,274
You...

347
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:54,966
...notify the parents immediately.

348
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:58,284
I can't.

349
00:17:58,309 --> 00:17:59,754
We don't know the girl's real name,

350
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,056
and we have to keep her sedated,

351
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,191
so there's no way we can track...

352
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:04,061
She's a teenager. She's got a phone.

353
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:06,120
Next time it rings, answer it.

354
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:15,163
- You feel the mesenteric artery pulsing?
- Yes.

355
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:17,199
You shouldn't.
You're too close to the vein.

356
00:18:17,223 --> 00:18:20,041
Great. Dr. Browne,
pass a penrose drain through.

357
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:24,439
Bovie.

358
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:29,767
Suction.

359
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:40,091
Got it all.

360
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:44,614
I see leaking pancreatic fluid.

361
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:46,316
That'll eat holes
in everything it touches.

362
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:47,585
Our duct tie didn't hold.

363
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,311
Suction. Needle driver.

364
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,728
Excellent.

365
00:18:51,753 --> 00:18:54,532
You have approved a scrub nurse

366
00:18:54,557 --> 00:18:57,269
and a circulating nurse
and seven other personnel.

367
00:18:57,294 --> 00:18:58,804
Everyone and everything is covered,

368
00:18:58,829 --> 00:18:59,998
except for an actual surgeon.

369
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:01,868
Yeah. I think we may have to postpone.

370
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:04,324
Have you notified your tumor to
stop growing in the interim?

371
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:06,570
I think any possible damage from a delay

372
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:09,231
may be more than offset
by having somebody competent

373
00:19:09,256 --> 00:19:10,667
digging around in my brain.

374
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:11,902
"Competent"?

375
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:14,639
- What's wrong with Sanders?
- 6% mortality rate.

376
00:19:14,664 --> 00:19:16,509
- Taylor?
- I don't like the way he's planning on

377
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:17,964
dealing with a carotid tear.

378
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:19,900
- That's nowhere near your tumor.
- It's the principle.

379
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,436
- Unger?
- He doesn't like me.

380
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,473
- No one likes you.
- No! You don't like me.

381
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:25,209
He doesn't like me. That's two.

382
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:26,578
Just pick a name. I don't care who.

383
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:28,147
I don't care if they're a doctor.

384
00:19:28,172 --> 00:19:29,616
Just pick a name.

385
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:31,652
Because in 48 hours, you're
either getting your surgery

386
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:34,055
or you're getting a new oncologist.

387
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,627
She's in pain.

388
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:49,629
That's why she's asleep right now,

389
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:51,721
because of what you did to her?

390
00:19:54,311 --> 00:19:56,422
What I did to her

391
00:19:56,447 --> 00:20:00,260
I believe revealed
that what you did to her

392
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:03,131
didn't do as much damage
as we initially feared.

393
00:20:03,156 --> 00:20:04,733
We want to do a second surgery...

394
00:20:04,758 --> 00:20:06,203
How can you stop her pain?

395
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:08,206
It's called clitoral reconstruction.

396
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:10,022
The nerves of her clitoris are exposed.

397
00:20:10,047 --> 00:20:11,458
We can sheath them using...

398
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:13,361
Our daughter wants this?

399
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:15,865
Asha wants to be like other girls.

400
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,000
She wants to be able to...

401
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:19,093
Mara told you that?

402
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:22,686
That's our daughter's name.

403
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:24,554
Not Asha.

404
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:27,555
You don't know her at all.

405
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:30,625
We need to do this surgery
to relieve her pain.

406
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:33,694
No. There must be another way.

407
00:20:33,718 --> 00:20:35,429
We want a second opinion.

408
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:37,265
Not at this hospital.

409
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:38,966
How soon can our daughter be moved?

410
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,835
Excuse me, Dr. Lim.

411
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:43,871
I am Ellen Vahtra from
Child Protective Services.

412
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:45,494
Until I complete my review,

413
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,098
I'm afraid you're not going to be
moving your daughter anywhere.

414
00:20:57,365 --> 00:20:59,900
How did it go? Is Dad okay? No, I'm good.

415
00:21:02,337 --> 00:21:04,315
There were complications,

416
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:06,651
but we found solutions.

417
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:09,687
It went very well. We got it all.

418
00:21:12,514 --> 00:21:13,557
Oh, my...

419
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:15,026
There's still...

420
00:21:17,757 --> 00:21:19,917
I don't think I did that well.

421
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,110
They're too happy.

422
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:23,924
Post-surgical complications are
still a major concern that they...

423
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,226
Let them enjoy the good news.

424
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,929
Is deceiving someone in a
way that makes them happy

425
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:31,832
better than deceiving someone
in a way that makes them sad?

426
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:34,991
Shaun. I think there's
someone here to see you.

427
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:37,370
Hey.

428
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:39,289
I had some time, so I thought

429
00:21:39,313 --> 00:21:41,641
you might want to have
some lunch with me?

430
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:45,639
I do not have time.

431
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:01,720
What's wrong?

432
00:22:01,744 --> 00:22:03,322
What did she do?

433
00:22:03,346 --> 00:22:04,590
Shaun. Sha...

434
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:12,831
You don't want to talk to Lea.
I don't understand.

435
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:15,290
I don't understand.

436
00:22:15,624 --> 00:22:17,324
I don't understand!

437
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:19,327
You're not being fair to her or yourself.

438
00:22:19,352 --> 00:22:21,720
- She's always been nice to you.
- No, she hasn't.

439
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:24,876
She's your friend.

440
00:22:24,901 --> 00:22:26,757
Whatever's happened, you have
to talk to her about it.

441
00:22:26,782 --> 00:22:27,970
Be honest about what you're feeling...

442
00:22:27,995 --> 00:22:29,172
I can't be.

443
00:22:29,197 --> 00:22:32,500
- Of course you can.
- I don't know...

444
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:35,468
I don't know how I feel!

445
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:41,638
I can't be honest
if I don't know how I feel!

446
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:50,282
Our 16-year-old daughter

447
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:52,518
is lying in a hospital bed unconscious

448
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:54,540
to protect her from overwhelming pain

449
00:22:54,565 --> 00:22:58,345
because of what this place did
to her without our permission.

450
00:22:58,868 --> 00:23:00,458
And you are investigating us?

451
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:02,561
Your daughter is suffering
because you butchered her

452
00:23:02,586 --> 00:23:03,868
when she was 2 years old.

453
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:06,514
Dr. Lim, please refrain from
unsubstantiated allegations.

454
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:09,383
Either they're the butchers or
they're protecting the butchers.

455
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:11,709
If you didn't do it, tell us who did.

456
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:19,080
It was an aunt
and a grandmother from Kenya.

457
00:23:19,104 --> 00:23:21,916
They were watching Mara
while we were on vacation.

458
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,118
Well, you must've been horrified.

459
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:26,389
Did you take her to a doctor?

460
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:29,134
That girl's sex organs
were covered with scar tissue.

461
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,637
She had no medical attention
to treat any of her wounds.

462
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,049
She was fine.

463
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:35,594
She was happy, laughing.

464
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:37,052
It's not that big a deal.

465
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,290
I was cut.

466
00:23:44,314 --> 00:23:47,026
My mother was cut. Her mother was cut.

467
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,797
It is a rite of passage connecting
our women to their ancestors.

468
00:23:50,822 --> 00:23:52,533
She will not find a husband
in our culture if she's...

469
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:53,925
So she'll find someone else.

470
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:56,757
It's not that big a deal.

471
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:58,862
These parents forfeited
the right to make any calls

472
00:23:58,886 --> 00:24:00,564
about their daughter a long time ago.

473
00:24:00,588 --> 00:24:02,635
Our daughter is an honor student,

474
00:24:02,636 --> 00:24:05,882
taking three AP classes
in her junior year,

475
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:08,885
went on a mission to Haiti
to build a school.

476
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:10,376
We have raised her well.

477
00:24:11,737 --> 00:24:12,971
She is a good person.

478
00:24:14,715 --> 00:24:16,149
We're proud of her.

479
00:24:17,311 --> 00:24:20,281
I'm sure she is a good person.

480
00:24:20,306 --> 00:24:21,750
But you are not gonna convince me

481
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:23,674
that what happened to Mara
when she was 2 years old

482
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:26,044
is anything short of an abomination.

483
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:28,047
But that's not the issue today.

484
00:24:28,072 --> 00:24:31,008
The issue is, how do we
best help this girl now?

485
00:24:32,466 --> 00:24:35,259
The clitoral reconstruction
should protect the exposed nerve.

486
00:24:35,284 --> 00:24:36,561
"Should"?

487
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:38,931
That is the surgery that,
in my medical opinion,

488
00:24:38,956 --> 00:24:40,167
is called for.

489
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,792
But it's not the only option?

490
00:24:43,464 --> 00:24:45,709
We could oblate the peripheral nerves

491
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,912
and remove the remaining clitoral tissue.

492
00:24:47,937 --> 00:24:50,321
And is that surgery safer
or more dangerous?

493
00:24:50,346 --> 00:24:52,324
It's simpler, but that's not
the only factor here.

494
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:55,127
It's the only factor to us.

495
00:24:55,152 --> 00:24:57,297
We want to know that our daughter

496
00:24:57,322 --> 00:25:00,401
won't spend the rest of her life in pain.

497
00:25:00,426 --> 00:25:01,837
Please.

498
00:25:01,862 --> 00:25:03,169
For a moment,

499
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:05,963
can we think about something
other than Mara's pain?

500
00:25:06,848 --> 00:25:08,992
Can we think about her pleasure?

501
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:11,529
We have a chance to give her

502
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:14,400
a healthy, meaningful sex life.

503
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:16,336
That is what she came here looking for.

504
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:23,876
Wake her up.

505
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:26,530
She's in pain, and she's already
told me what she wanted.

506
00:25:26,531 --> 00:25:29,010
Yesterday, she was requesting
cosmetic surgery.

507
00:25:29,034 --> 00:25:31,246
Today, you're asking her
to risk a lifetime of pain

508
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,947
for a chance at pleasure.

509
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:34,549
From everything I've heard,

510
00:25:34,573 --> 00:25:36,517
she's mature enough
to make the call herself,

511
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:39,120
even if it means suffering
for a few minutes to do so.

512
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:46,476
Dr. Unger has a mortality index

513
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,912
that is not too high and not too low.

514
00:25:48,936 --> 00:25:50,280
It's not gonna be Unger.

515
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:52,950
You have not eliminated Dr. Ko.

516
00:25:52,974 --> 00:25:54,203
Not yet.

517
00:25:54,562 --> 00:25:57,908
I may have to go out of state
to find a neurosurgeon.

518
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,344
Plus, I may have to find
myself a new oncologist.

519
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:03,682
You've used Dr. Ko many times.

520
00:26:03,707 --> 00:26:05,852
Did you think
she might kill your patients?

521
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:07,007
No.

522
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,876
Do you think you're better than them?

523
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,702
Yes, a little.

524
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:16,112
That was a joke.

525
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,075
You don't want to talk about this.

526
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,246
No, I don't want
to talk about this, Shaun.

527
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:24,250
That, in fact, is the point
of the alcohol.

528
00:26:24,492 --> 00:26:26,659
Okay, I understand.

529
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:27,717
Good.

530
00:26:35,557 --> 00:26:38,036
Why can't we talk about it?

531
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:39,772
Because it's upsetting.

532
00:26:39,797 --> 00:26:41,575
Is that why you're stalling?

533
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,611
Because you're afraid of dying?

534
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:45,847
I'm not afraid of dying.

535
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:47,617
Really?

536
00:26:47,642 --> 00:26:49,186
Why not?

537
00:26:49,211 --> 00:26:52,324
You should be. Dying is terrible.

538
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:53,983
Yes, dying is terrible.

539
00:26:54,704 --> 00:26:56,515
But there are worse things.

540
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,484
What's worse than dying?

541
00:27:02,374 --> 00:27:03,552
Not dying.

542
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,741
That doesn't make sense.

543
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:08,966
Makes sense to me.

544
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:11,964
That doesn't make sense.

545
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:13,623
That's the middle ground, Shaun.

546
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,175
Brain surgeries have a tendency

547
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:19,510
to end in the middle ground.

548
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:22,380
Brain surgeries can be
considered a success

549
00:27:22,404 --> 00:27:25,650
even when the patient
ends up compromised.

550
00:27:25,674 --> 00:27:27,218
He can't walk. He can't talk.

551
00:27:27,242 --> 00:27:29,387
His hand can't stop shaking.

552
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:36,544
I've been terrible
at a lot of things in my life,

553
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:38,370
but I am damn smart.

554
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:42,506
And I am a damn good surgeon.

555
00:27:42,531 --> 00:27:44,209
And if I can't be those things,

556
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:46,679
then I don't know who I'd be.

557
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:54,103
You'd be my friend.

558
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:04,977
Well, thank you, Shaun.

559
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:17,111
I have to go. My patient just crashed.

560
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:25,697
It's not enough. Is it?

561
00:28:29,637 --> 00:28:30,637
No.

562
00:28:32,328 --> 00:28:33,705
I'm sorry it isn't.

563
00:28:45,949 --> 00:28:47,927
Mom. Dad.

564
00:28:47,951 --> 00:28:49,318
We're here.

565
00:28:49,953 --> 00:28:51,931
We love you.

566
00:28:51,955 --> 00:28:54,333
We just don't understand
why you would turn your back.

567
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,534
Uh...

568
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:57,069
Hello, Mara.

569
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:59,105
I'm Ellen Vahtra. I'm a social worker.

570
00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:00,439
Your parents know what happened,

571
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:02,641
and Dr. Lim gave you a nerve block.

572
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:05,010
It hurts. It still hurts.

573
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,779
I understand that, and we are
going to try to get you

574
00:29:06,803 --> 00:29:09,348
back to sleep as quickly as possible.

575
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,484
But something happened during
your surgery, and we need you

576
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:13,509
to make a decision
about what is done next.

577
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,359
We believe that, despite what
was done to you as a child,

578
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,862
the reason you're in so much
pain because you still have

579
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,530
functioning nerves in your clitoris,

580
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,266
nerves that had been covered
with scar tissue.

581
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,901
I'd like to repair that.

582
00:29:28,925 --> 00:29:31,003
We can make you physiologically complete.

583
00:29:31,027 --> 00:29:33,128
But there's no guarantee
that it would work.

584
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,443
I'm confident.

585
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:39,368
There is a safer choice.

586
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,268
We could... remove your entire clitoris.

587
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:49,121
This is your choice.

588
00:29:49,145 --> 00:29:51,146
You will be protected no matter what.

589
00:29:55,218 --> 00:29:56,462
Take it out.

590
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:57,930
Mara, we can make you whole...

591
00:29:57,954 --> 00:30:00,332
I made a mistake. Take it out.

592
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:01,934
She's on medication. She's in pain...

593
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:04,837
Dr. Lim, please let her go back to sleep.

594
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:07,473
And prepare to operate
to remove the damaged tissue.

595
00:30:19,315 --> 00:30:21,706
Hang fresh, frozen plasma, too.
Looks like he's going into DIC.

596
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,966
Give me another hemostat.

597
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,063
BP's 71 over 53.

598
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:26,665
We should have warned the family.

599
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:28,266
Can't see anything in here.
There's too much blood.

600
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,968
- More suction.
- I think you got the hepatic artery.

601
00:30:29,992 --> 00:30:31,174
The warning wouldn't
have made any difference.

602
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:32,838
The bleeding is not slowing down.

603
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:35,075
We need to send the aorta to the celiac.

604
00:30:35,075 --> 00:30:37,051
- I need to see it to clamp it.
- They would have been prepared.

605
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:39,904
A-line systolic's 54. He's bottoming out.
No, they wouldn't.

606
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:42,230
You two, shut up and
pack his abdomen with laps

607
00:30:42,255 --> 00:30:43,789
while I sort through this mess.

608
00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:46,015
I won't do it.

609
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,518
Can we appeal this? Do you know?

610
00:30:47,543 --> 00:30:49,054
I've spoken with our legal department.

611
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,790
Unless we can prove
the social worker was biased,

612
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,159
we are stuck with this ruling.

613
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,385
Well, then you're also
stuck with "I won't do it."

614
00:30:55,274 --> 00:30:57,853
You're a good doctor.
This hospital will miss you.

615
00:30:57,877 --> 00:31:00,021
You're gonna fire me because I
won't butcher a teenage girl?

616
00:31:00,045 --> 00:31:01,590
Of course I am.

617
00:31:01,614 --> 00:31:03,492
This hospital will face
lawsuits, suspensions,

618
00:31:03,516 --> 00:31:04,964
perhaps criminal charges,

619
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:07,367
and this little girl will still
get the surgery you hate.

620
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:15,517
Could Dr. Lim at least
talk to Mara again?

621
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,140
You want to wake her up again in pain?

622
00:31:18,165 --> 00:31:19,609
Every woman deserves the right

623
00:31:19,634 --> 00:31:21,312
to make decisions about her sexuality

624
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,971
without her parents hanging over her.

625
00:31:28,701 --> 00:31:30,045
Okay.

626
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,856
When I was 15 years old,

627
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,968
my father caught me with a boy.

628
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:57,064
I mean, we weren't doing it,

629
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:59,234
but my top was off and

630
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:00,861
Well, it doesn't matter.

631
00:32:02,063 --> 00:32:03,363
My father hit me.

632
00:32:04,378 --> 00:32:05,778
I still have a small scar.

633
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:09,006
Our relationship was never the same.

634
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,511
But that's what growing up is.

635
00:32:11,536 --> 00:32:13,981
Not everyone gets called a slut.

636
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:16,741
Not everyone gets butchered.

637
00:32:17,552 --> 00:32:20,498
But everyone becomes a man or a woman

638
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,290
and stops being a child.

639
00:32:23,952 --> 00:32:26,998
I want to take a piece of
tissue from inside your cheek

640
00:32:27,022 --> 00:32:29,267
and I want to graft it to your clitoris.

641
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,973
We can make you feel... love.

642
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,599
I can't turn my back on my
family, on my traditions.

643
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:52,035
Traditions

644
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,928
connect us to the past.

645
00:32:54,817 --> 00:32:56,761
What about the future?

646
00:33:05,494 --> 00:33:07,105
Please.

647
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,976
No. I'm in pain.

648
00:33:22,007 --> 00:33:23,484
Cross-clamping his aorta.

649
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:25,320
He's in ventricular fibrillation.

650
00:33:26,578 --> 00:33:28,323
Starting chest compressions.

651
00:33:34,253 --> 00:33:35,730
Okay. Everybody clear.

652
00:33:57,749 --> 00:33:59,227
Prep the cheek, as well.

653
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,800
She's taking the graft?
The paperwork doesn't say...

654
00:34:03,825 --> 00:34:05,002
She consented verbally.

655
00:34:05,027 --> 00:34:06,772
We didn't want to keep her
awake any longer

656
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:08,097
than absolutely necessary.

657
00:34:09,868 --> 00:34:11,646
I wanted to help her as much as you...

658
00:34:11,671 --> 00:34:13,348
When she wanted help.

659
00:34:13,373 --> 00:34:15,074
- But if she doesn't want this...
- She wants this.

660
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:17,312
Dr. Lim just told us.

661
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:22,752
Prep the cheek.

662
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,276
I'll tell the family.

663
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,629
No.

664
00:34:41,654 --> 00:34:43,532
Claire, you do it.

665
00:34:43,557 --> 00:34:45,058
This isn't the time for learning.

666
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,896
I'm sorry.

667
00:35:13,147 --> 00:35:15,292
Paul died during surgery.

668
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,710
He had a gastroduodenal artery rupture.

669
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:21,291
It's a common complication
of a Whipple surgery,

670
00:35:21,316 --> 00:35:24,262
especially when someone's cancer was...

671
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:26,932
As advanced as his was.

672
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:28,806
We... did everything we could

673
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:31,042
for as long as we could.

674
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:32,812
He didn't suffer.

675
00:35:38,244 --> 00:35:39,678
You did this to him.

676
00:35:41,924 --> 00:35:43,191
Dad didn't want this.

677
00:35:44,734 --> 00:35:47,236
You saw that look on his face.
He was scared.

678
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:51,241
In my experience,
it does no good to dwell...

679
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:52,942
Of course he was scared.

680
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:54,061
That doesn't mean...

681
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:55,102
He just wanted to live
his last few months.

682
00:35:55,127 --> 00:35:56,607
Stop it.

683
00:35:56,632 --> 00:35:58,744
Nobody made your father do anything.

684
00:35:58,769 --> 00:36:00,303
He knew the risks.

685
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:04,384
It's your fault, too, Mom.

686
00:36:06,712 --> 00:36:07,979
All of us.

687
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,836
He would do anything for us.

688
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:14,749
We killed our father.

689
00:36:22,485 --> 00:36:23,829
It's not true.

690
00:36:28,036 --> 00:36:30,782
Paul wanted this surgery.

691
00:36:32,616 --> 00:36:36,062
He told me he wanted this surgery.

692
00:37:08,735 --> 00:37:09,935
Was that true?

693
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:14,006
Paul told me...

694
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:18,094
When the truth can't help someone,

695
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,663
we should lie.

696
00:37:30,323 --> 00:37:31,323
Mom?

697
00:37:34,095 --> 00:37:36,764
How are you? Does anything hurt?

698
00:37:37,985 --> 00:37:40,720
Not much. I'm better.

699
00:37:42,383 --> 00:37:44,217
Looks like she's doing well.

700
00:37:45,486 --> 00:37:46,520
Thank you, Doctor.

701
00:37:48,622 --> 00:37:51,968
There should still be some
discomfort at the surgical site.

702
00:37:51,993 --> 00:37:54,138
A nurse will bring you some...

703
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,439
Sorry.

704
00:38:02,464 --> 00:38:04,542
A nurse will bring you some Tylenol,

705
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,668
which should really be all you need.

706
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:08,505
Thank you.

707
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:13,045
You're gonna be great.

708
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,011
You're here.

709
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:40,314
Yes. I live here.

710
00:38:40,338 --> 00:38:41,848
You know that.

711
00:38:41,872 --> 00:38:44,952
Well, I was starting to doubt
it the last couple of days.

712
00:38:44,976 --> 00:38:47,854
You come home after I'm asleep.

713
00:38:47,878 --> 00:38:49,987
You leave before I can even get up.

714
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:51,379
Wow.

715
00:38:51,404 --> 00:38:53,748
Thank you.

716
00:39:02,647 --> 00:39:04,114
Please take this.

717
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,535
No, this is yours, Shaun.

718
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,784
I gave it to you to remember me by.

719
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:11,196
It hurt.

720
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,072
I didn't want to tell you the truth

721
00:39:17,096 --> 00:39:18,836
because I didn't know it,

722
00:39:18,861 --> 00:39:21,634
but I have to tell you the
truth because it will help.

723
00:39:26,986 --> 00:39:29,267
Every night, I would come home,

724
00:39:29,942 --> 00:39:34,656
and I would look at that baseball,

725
00:39:34,681 --> 00:39:36,566
and I would think of you.

726
00:39:38,512 --> 00:39:40,557
The baseball was here,

727
00:39:40,582 --> 00:39:42,416
but you weren't.

728
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:44,147
That's sweet.

729
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:47,050
No, it isn't.

730
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:48,620
It hurt.

731
00:39:48,645 --> 00:39:50,038
You hurt me.

732
00:39:50,423 --> 00:39:52,168
Okay, Shaun, you know...

733
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:54,934
You went away, and it hurt,

734
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,604
and it kept hurting, and now you're back.

735
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:03,092
If you stay, you will go away again,

736
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:05,863
and it will hurt again.

737
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,366
So I want you to go back to Hershey.

738
00:40:10,895 --> 00:40:12,572
I know you don't mean that, and I know...

739
00:40:12,597 --> 00:40:16,010
Please go back to Hershey

740
00:40:16,035 --> 00:40:18,480
or anywhere other than here!

741
00:40:45,346 --> 00:40:46,379
Feeling okay?

742
00:40:47,942 --> 00:40:50,682
Yeah, sure, superduper.

743
00:40:51,758 --> 00:40:53,970
I want to thank you for your trust.

744
00:40:53,995 --> 00:40:55,462
I'll do my best to deserve it.

745
00:40:56,365 --> 00:40:58,633
Well, that's all I can ask.

746
00:41:01,215 --> 00:41:02,859
You know the drill.

747
00:41:09,525 --> 00:41:10,859
10...

748
00:41:11,813 --> 00:41:13,113
9...

749
00:41:15,396 --> 00:41:16,563
8...

750
00:41:18,053 --> 00:41:19,053
7...

751
00:41:20,305 --> 00:42:20,825

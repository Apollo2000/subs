1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,403
It's just a migraine.

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:04,438
Honey,
until we're completely sure...

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,453
Is the pain a tight
band or pulsating?

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,343
Good question.

5
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:12,012
Pulsating,
light bothers me, nausea.

6
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,914
I get these all the time.

7
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,325
You said you didn't feel a,
uh...

8
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,117
What'd you call it? A...

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,618
An aura. I know, but...

10
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,554
Exactly how often do
you get these symptoms?

11
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,457
I just ask, since your boyfriend
doesn't seem to recognize them.

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,166
Zane and I have only known
each other for eight days.

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,467
It moved fast.

14
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:41,175
Ellie,
did you feel your foot twitch?

15
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:42,942
No.

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,620
Positive Babinski.

18
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:55,355
What does that mean?

19
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,490
It's not a migraine.

20
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,819
Oh, that.

21
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,289
I was performing due
diligence on my new roommate,

22
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,657
who might be a violent maniac,

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,592
and look what I
found in his closet.

24
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,361
It's cute.

25
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:34,638
You moved in with two suitcases.

26
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:36,142
You only have four
pairs of underwear.

27
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,717
How the hell did a
parrot make the cut?

28
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,300
I'm a Parrothead.

29
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,269
A Jimmy Buffett enthusiast.

30
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:42,603
The Margaritaville guy?

31
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,372
Well, he has other,
far better songs,

32
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:45,785
but yes, the Margaritaville guy.

33
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,074
It brings me luck.

34
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,368
Scary to think what your
life would be like without it.

35
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:50,843
Can I have it back?

36
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,648
It's fun getting to
know you better.

37
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,417
Worth every damn
bit of sacrifice.

38
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:09,062
I was demonstrating a torch
lift this morning, and, bang.

39
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,365
"Ballet master."

40
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:12,900
You're a dancer?

41
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,936
God, no. I'm like the CEO.

42
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,105
At my age,
I'd be the Betty White of the troupe.

43
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,239
Is she a dancer?

44
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,143
I don't know much about,
uh, culture.

45
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,815
I assume I just sprained something,
right?

46
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,318
Uh,
we will need neuro and abdominal exams,

47
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,519
X-rays for fractures,

48
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,953
CBC for infection,

49
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,888
cultures to rule out
a spinal abscess...

50
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,491
You're new, aren't you?

51
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,595
Uh, it's my second week here.

52
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:47,100
It's actually only my
first day seeing patients.

53
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:48,236
Am I your first?

54
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:49,869
Yes.

55
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,005
Sorry. But, yes.

56
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,607
Well...

57
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:56,243
That's impressive.

58
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,391
Whoever's supervising
you must really trust you.

59
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:04,784
I'm not sure that's true.

60
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,608
They won't let me
join their stupid gym

61
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,859
because I had
high blood pressure.

62
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,537
How am I supposed to
lower it if I can't work out?

63
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,128
200 over 105.

64
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:16,464
That is quite high.

65
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:17,931
I just told you it was high.

66
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:21,702
Are you a smoker?

67
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,971
Yeah. Pack or two a day.

68
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,104
More if I feel crappy.

69
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,640
And...

70
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,777
Do you have diabetes?

71
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,145
You're reading those
questions out of a book?

72
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,014
Yes. Have you ever
done this before?

73
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,430
I told you. You
have to trust them.

74
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:41,589
I don't.

75
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,557
Then act like you do.

76
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,160
Go away.

77
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:57,505
Nothing more romantic than
spending one of your first dates in an ER.

78
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:00,441
Well,
stressful experiences release oxytocin.

79
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,643
Same hormone that
creates emotional bonds.

80
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,576
This might actually
cement their relationship.

81
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:08,549
Next to the hippocampus.

82
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:10,951
Is that a tooth?

83
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,554
Dermoid cyst. Cool.

84
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,657
She's having a seizure.

85
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,592
Secure her airway. Push
two milligrams Ativan.

86
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,210
Thank you for
trusting us enough...

87
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,836
Please report.

88
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,705
Uh,
58-year-old male dancer with back pain.

89
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,074
I ruled out red flags
like osteomyelitis

90
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,243
and kidney infection,
but I did find evidence

91
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:39,046
of a mild L2 compression
fracture with moderate wedging

92
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,824
and evidence of impingement
on the neural canal.

93
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:43,116
You want to start beta blockers?

94
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,419
Me? Yeah. I think my
patient's a stroke risk.

95
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:46,754
BP's 200 over 105.

96
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,424
It was the same
at her gym earlier?

97
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,601
Can you raise your arms?

98
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,905
Okay. Now try to
squeeze my hands.

99
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,440
I just did all these
tests with her.

100
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:08,418
I thought you were gonna give
me stuff to lower my blood pressure.

101
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,810
That would kill you.

102
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,545
Now push against my hands.

103
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:13,990
If she's in danger
of having a stroke...

104
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,414
She's not. She's
already having one.

105
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,451
Smoking on estrogen
put her at high risk.

106
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:19,753
Loss of circadian blood
pressure variation confirms it.

107
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:22,589
Stick out your tongue.

108
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:26,426
We gotta get a CTA.

109
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:28,962
No. We're treating with IV tPA.

110
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:31,231
Don't we need to locate
the clot? We just did.

111
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,801
Right deviation means a
right vertebral artery occlusion.

112
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,472
Oh. You can close
your mouth now.

113
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:48,315
Her seizure and coma
were caused by a dermoid cyst.

114
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,485
It's a pocket of tissue with bits of teeth,
hair, and fat.

115
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,387
She likely got it
before she was born.

116
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,322
What can you do?

117
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,391
The less invasive
option is to put in a drain

118
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:58,759
to release some pressure,

119
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,894
treat with anti-seizure
meds and steroids,

120
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,597
then basically watch to see
if the swelling goes down.

121
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,399
And the more invasive?

122
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,533
Surgical removal.

123
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:08,969
But the cyst is deep inside

124
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,338
and wrapped
around major arteries,

125
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:14,842
so it is more likely
to fix the problem,

126
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:18,311
but it carries risk of
stroke or paralysis.

127
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,751
We need a decision quickly.

128
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,244
Ellie's sister is
on the paperwork,

129
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,254
but we haven't been
able to reach her.

130
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,823
Do you know where the
parents live or any other siblings?

131
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,877
He might still be on a business trip,
but, uh...

132
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,035
you can try her husband.

133
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,215
If we can't reduce the swelling,

134
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,850
she will have
permanent brain damage.

135
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:05,992
Is that him?

136
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,233
Brendan,
we need you to make a decision.

137
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,335
Yeah, yeah.

138
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,437
I'm... I'm not sure that
I'm the right one to...

139
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:21,875
I mean, right now,

140
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:25,513
I hate her.

141
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:29,982
You don't.

142
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:31,951
You're angry.

143
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,521
You're hurt.

144
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:35,756
Because you love her.

145
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,570
58-year-old male
dancer with back pain.

146
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,442
Moderate vertebral wedging and
impingement on the neural canal.

147
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,578
Yes. I think an L2
compression fracture.

148
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,483
Prescribe anti-inflammatories,
a brace, and PT,

149
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:04,618
then discharge him.

150
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,295
Do you wanna re-check anything?

151
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,128
No.

152
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,943
Remember to floss your
brain after every meal, people.

153
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,445
Aspirating.

154
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:36,222
Do you think we
should be doing this?

155
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,052
I know we have to legally,

156
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,346
but maybe her husband isn't
the one who knows her best,

157
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,256
knows what she wants.

158
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,934
Better than the guy who
met her last weekend.

159
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,159
Arachnoid knife.

160
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:49,663
Mmm, that guy,
she's in love with him. Apparently.

161
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,077
Well, maybe she loves them both.

162
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,700
Aren't you a romantic!

163
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,833
Watch for perforators.

164
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,415
I've been polyamorous for years.

165
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,512
When I was monogamous,
I was jealous, possessive, egotistical.

166
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,715
Our patient wasn't
honest. That's not cool.

167
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:08,848
But other than that...

168
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,821
Good margins all around.

169
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,989
Let's dry up the field
and close her up.

170
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,486
I never would've guessed
I was your first patient.

171
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,864
Felt more like the fourth.

172
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,368
By the way,
did I detect an accent?

173
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,370
No.

174
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:34,007
I mean, I had one,
but I worked really hard to lose it.

175
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,009
No one ever notices it anymore.

176
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,110
Eastern Europe?

177
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:40,546
Brooklyn.

178
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,549
Williamsburg.

179
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:45,018
I grew up Hasidic,
speaking Yiddish.

180
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,887
I left it a long time ago.

181
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,089
You left the... the religion?

182
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,024
The religion, the culture,

183
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,660
my family.

184
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,523
Must not have been easy,
growing up that way,

185
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,331
knowing you were

186
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,533
a doctor.

187
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,570
Excuse me?

188
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,841
My generation,
you could get bashed.

189
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,135
You could get thrown in jail.

190
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,444
We had to learn codes,

191
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,446
how to read each other.

192
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,860
You should thank
your lucky stars

193
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,782
you get to live your
life the way you want it.

194
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,422
I don't know what
you went through.

195
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,058
Please don't pretend to
know what I went through.

196
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:30,897
Sir?

197
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:31,998
My gut...

198
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:40,406
Code blue!

199
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,712
The surgery seemed successful,

200
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,547
but we need to monitor for
seizures over the next 24 hours.

201
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:50,293
Is this high enough?

202
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,852
Um, a little to the left.

203
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,887
No. To the right. Yeah.

204
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,095
You never said
anything was wrong.

205
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,835
Can we have the
room for a moment?

206
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,568
I'm sorry,
but we really need to check...

207
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,436
You're worried about
talking in front of them?

208
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:12,806
Embarrassing me?

209
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,147
I didn't think
anything was wrong.

210
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,850
When I met Zane,

211
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,955
it made me realize
something was missing.

212
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,261
Or, at least,
I think that's what I'm feeling.

213
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,438
You mind tilting your chin up?

214
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:36,462
I'm sorry.

215
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,512
Why couldn't you
just talk to me?

216
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,537
Or... Or leave me?

217
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,639
I don't know.

218
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,648
Were you happy?

219
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,351
With him?

220
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,031
I guess I should go.

221
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,467
Brendan?

222
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,106
Who are these people?

223
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,423
Ellie,
do you know where you are?

224
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,045
Why am I in the hospital?

225
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,892
Suprarenal aortic aneurysm.

226
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:41,194
It ruptured as he
was being discharged.

227
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,529
Clamping aorta now.

228
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:43,702
How much blood is he down?

229
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,232
We suctioned out two liters

230
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,801
and gave six units
on the rapid infuser.

231
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,937
The aneurysm
caused his back pain.

232
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,204
Dr. Wolke missed it.

233
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,741
I did an abdominal exam.

234
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,743
Aneurysms are
very hard to catch.

235
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,521
Experienced doctors
miss them all the time.

236
00:12:58,545 --> 00:12:59,546
Potts scissors.

237
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,883
The aneurysm is 6.5 centimeters.

238
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,452
Dr. Wolke should have felt it.

239
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,724
It felt like normal musculature.

240
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,060
I'm so sorry.

241
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,761
We'll never know what you felt.

242
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,430
There's no way to know if you,
or any doctor, for that matter,

243
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:18,564
would have detected this.

244
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,734
I would have.

245
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:24,271
He asked me if I
wanted to double-check.

246
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,615
If I had, I would've caught the
aneurysm before the rupture.

247
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,640
Stop it.

248
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,812
He made a mistake.

249
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,581
He might have.

250
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:35,883
But you did, too.

251
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,451
No. You told me to back off.

252
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,345
I didn't tell you to
abdicate responsibility.

253
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:49,129
When a First Year asks if
you want to re-check their work,

254
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,264
your answer should
always be "yes."

255
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,136
The fact they're
asking is a warning sign.

256
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,174
I didn't know that.

257
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,019
It's called retrograde
memory loss.

258
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,752
Luckily,
it seems to have been temporary.

259
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:14,786
She's lucid again.

260
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,892
We're running an
MRI and lab tests

261
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,627
to see what caused it.

262
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,130
Thank you for, uh,
telling me. I know I'm just the...

263
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:25,764
You care.

264
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:32,439
Maybe things with Ellie and I
weren't always perfect, but...

265
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:33,572
It was exciting.

266
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,542
When I was with her...

267
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,113
Never felt that way before.

268
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:41,949
I took care of her
when she was sick.

269
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,017
I never strayed.

270
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:45,518
It wasn't about
the things we did.

271
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:46,686
It was... It was about

272
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:49,588
being with her.

273
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,327
She stuck by me
when I needed her.

274
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,331
Last year,
I was... I was drinking way too much.

275
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,390
It's hard to imagine
being without her.

276
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,059
I just can't imagine
being without her.

277
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:17,951
She's stable.

00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,656
Some say it's all
about planning.

327
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,226
Others, charismatic leadership.

328
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,360
A third group...

329
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,232
Your temporary memory
loss was caused by some fat

330
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,999
that leaked from your cyst.

331
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49,001
We can remove
it via a craniotomy,

332
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:52,172
but there is a real risk
of more memory loss.

333
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,506
Maybe permanently.

334
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,709
What will I lose?

335
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,445
The time prior to the surgery.

336
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,747
Days, weeks, possibly months.

337
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,015
But if we don't operate soon,

338
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,550
the risk of brain
damage only grows.

339
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:08,155
I can't do it.

340
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,763
I don't even know
what I want right now,

341
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:20,200
but I do know that I don't want
the decision about my marriage

342
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,601
forced on me by an operation.

343
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,139
Please,

344
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,209
find another answer.

345
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,454
You are not very
good at your jobs,

346
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:42,998
and I'm not very
good at teaching you,

347
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,592
so we are going to focus
on one step at a time.

348
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,627
You will master
each skill separately.

349
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,729
I've made a list of 400 skills.

350
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,102
I didn't have the time to
finish it last night because...

351
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,236
Dr. Wolke,
you will be focusing on physical exams.

352
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,981
You'll find a list of the seven
post-op tests to be conducted on Carl.

353
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,940
Dr. Jackson,
you will find relevant seminars

354
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,742
on conquering nerves
in the workplace.

355
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,577
What are good
activities for a date?

356
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,346
Uh...

357
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,814
What does she like?

358
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,149
Cars, coding,
Zelda: Breath of the Wild,

359
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,885
Sauvignon Blanc, Skittles,
RuPaul's Drag Race,

360
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,321
camping...

361
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,254
I had a very romantic
time camping in Big Sur.

362
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,590
This is for tonight.

363
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,620
I haven't gone on many dates.

364
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,099
But everyone loves movies. Hmm.

365
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,249
Healing nicely.

366
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,850
No redness or swelling.

367
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,619
I'm gonna palpate around it now.

368
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,760
Look, I need to apologize.

369
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,928
For bringing up your
personal life the other day.

370
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,000
No.

371
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,702
You have nothing to
apologize to me for.

372
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:09,809
So, what's next on your list?

373
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,645
Checking for signs of
infection inside your abdomen.

374
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:16,748
Open your eyes wider.

375
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,823
You have signs of jaundice.

376
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,460
I think your liver's failing.

377
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,569
The liver is being
damaged by a new aneurysm.

378
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:39,372
How? A genetic
predisposition or...

379
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:41,207
More likely,
when we fixed the first one,

380
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,701
we increased the
pressure upstream.

381
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,345
Can we stent the celiac?

382
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:46,679
Anatomy's too tricky.

383
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,582
Aortic to celiac bypass?

384
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,452
We'd just risk a new
aneurysm forming upstream.

385
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,587
Maybe,
but it solves the problem in front of us.

386
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,423
He'll die without
an intervention.

387
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,190
He'll probably die either way.

388
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:06,433
Let's all take the time to
research alternate solutions.

389
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:09,602
If we can't come up with
something better in 24 hours,

390
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:10,870
we proceed with the bypass.

391
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:30,923
She's saying no for
emotional reasons.

392
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:35,061
So the answer isn't medical.

393
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:36,194
It's emotional.

394
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:43,202
We think Zane
should talk to Ellie.

395
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,704
No.

396
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,573
I don't want him
anywhere near her.

397
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:48,741
To convince her to
do the craniotomy.

398
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,745
From you, it's self-serving.

399
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,380
From Zane...

400
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,484
Wait. If she doesn't want it...

401
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:59,786
You said you can't
imagine life without her.

402
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,591
If you meant that,
you'd risk anything to keep her alive.

403
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,259
Including her memories of you.

404
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,143
Well done, Shaunie.

405
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:29,649
I really needed this.

406
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,350
The system update yesterday?

407
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:33,352
Went bananas.

408
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:34,806
I've been flooded
with complaints.

409
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:36,555
Total nightmare.

410
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,159
How's work? Did the videos help?

411
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,293
Yes.

412
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,196
Tell me more.

413
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:50,102
One of my patients developed
a secondary aneurysm.

414
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,639
Now I need to find a
surgical fix by tomorrow.

415
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:54,240
Otherwise, he will probably die.

416
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,808
I brought Skittles.

417
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,580
Shouldn't you be
at the hospital?

418
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,715
Yes. After you go to bed,

419
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,684
I plan to go back
and do research.

420
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,821
Shaunie, go to the hospital.

421
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,823
No, we made this schedule.

422
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,026
Someone else needs you.

423
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:16,563
More than I need you.

424
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,466
It's a hospital.

425
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,900
It's filled with sick people.

426
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,803
But tomorrow,
will someone need you

427
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,313
to come up with a
way to save their life?

428
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,106
Mmm, maybe.

429
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,845
Probably not tomorrow.

430
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,381
Okay.

431
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:39,184
Mmm-hmm.

432
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,026
I am canceling date night.

433
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:48,794
That's rude.

434
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:49,895
Oh, well.

435
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,371
Then

436
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,641
I should

437
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:03,943
go to the hospital.

438
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,410
Mmm-hmm.

439
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,114
They're prepping
Ellie for surgery.

440
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,390
Any last-minute questions?

441
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:23,428
What should I do?

442
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:27,533
Forgive her.

443
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:31,838
Under the right circumstances,
every human will stray.

444
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,405
We're not hardwired
for monogamy.

445
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,221
I'm guessing you're not married.

446
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,103
I'm not saying that
it's wrong to feel angry.

447
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,292
She wasn't honest with you.

448
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,852
The alternative to forgiving her

449
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,265
is losing someone that you love.

450
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:52,725
Then what?

451
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,830
If she comes back to me
just because she forgets him,

452
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,140
my marriage wouldn't be honest.

453
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:10,876
I have an idea.

454
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,315
We could remove
more proximal aorta

455
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,784
and extend the graft.

456
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:20,452
And rebuild the
celiac trunk with what?

457
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,021
Dacron?

458
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,322
Branches are too complex.

459
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:27,193
This Lancet article
on polymer materials

460
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,160
doesn't work.

461
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,463
But thin-film nitinol?

462
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,473
Did we break him?

463
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,482
We have the material.

464
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,221
It's his veins.

465
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:06,899
Hey! Oh, I'm sorry.

466
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,001
Did we reestablish
personal boundaries?

467
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:14,006
This morning's presentation's
on who's not moving on?

468
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,575
Exhibit A.

469
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,178
Canoodling on a very
romantic hillside with...

470
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,913
With my gay best
friend. Can you leave?

471
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:22,915
Exhibit B.

472
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:27,553
A XXL Rob Gronkowski jersey.

473
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:29,155
Just the latest fashion style

474
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,723
from a woman who
hates the Patriots?

475
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:31,857
Or an ex-boyfriend's...

476
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,726
Not an ex. I hooked
up with Gronk.

477
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,860
Seemed worth preserving.

478
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,265
Rob? Or one of his brothers?

479
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Props. I guess.

480
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,371
Exhibit infinitum.

481
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,406
Two ticket stubs to
Quantum of Solace.

482
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,142
Now, you once called
Daniel Craig "James Blonde,"

483
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,478
and yet, 11 years later,
these were in your drawer,

484
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:56,015
on top of an instruction
manual for a 2019 cellphone,

485
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,250
which means you dug
them out within the last year.

486
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:00,352
Why? I can only
assume you are currently

487
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,366
once again hooking up
with the James Blonde fan.

488
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,456
How could you possible deduce...

489
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,590
I also read your e-mails.

490
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,199
You've been sleeping with an ex

491
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,628
without asking for
any commitment.

492
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,698
It's just sex. It's not
keeping me from anything.

493
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:14,066
What's more likely to prevent
someone from moving on?

494
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,703
A parrot in a drawer
or an ex in your bed?

495
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:19,471
I'm at least getting something
hot from the situation.

496
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:20,907
You're just
wallowing in failure.

497
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,445
So, if your bag's empty,

498
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,178
I'm naked and have
to go to the bathroom.

499
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,825
It's called a
Y-shaped vein graft.

500
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:40,827
Your aorta is damaged
from the aneurysm

501
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,261
right where it branches off.

502
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,297
We're gonna find a vein in
your leg that's similar in size,

503
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:48,267
cut it out,
and use it to replace the damaged artery.

504
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
How bad is it?

505
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:51,503
This is an excellent solution.

506
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:52,671
If it works.

507
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,893
What are the actual
chances that it doesn't,

508
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:57,744
that I'm gonna die?

509
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:00,345
I don't want to give a number.

510
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:03,115
I mean, I can't.

511
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:06,786
I literally can't. There
are too many factors.

512
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:07,963
I can call in Dr. Murphy...

513
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,188
I don't need to hear numbers.

514
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,190
How bad is this?

515
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,064
Bad.

516
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:26,138
Thank you.

517
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:34,180
Whatever happens,
you're gonna be an incredible doctor.

518
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:38,150
And I am honored to
have been your first patient.

519
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:47,592
I screwed up.

520
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,163
That first exam,

521
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:53,832
I felt something.

522
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:58,737
I should have known
it was an aneurysm.

523
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,179
We could have saved
you before it got bad.

524
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:05,845
Why...

525
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,449
You were my first patient.

526
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:19,758
I need you to do
something for me.

527
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,195
I need you to pray.

528
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:27,199
You must know a
prayer for the sick.

529
00:29:31,037 --> 00:29:32,271
I'm not a believer anymore.

530
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,206
Neither am I.

531
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:36,641
But...

532
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:33,065
Ellie, do you know these men?

533
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:35,366
Of course.

534
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:36,734
Brendan.

535
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:40,771
And...

536
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,311
And are you a
friend of Brendan's?

537
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,281
Something like that.

538
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,366
A lot has happened
in the last week.

539
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:13,305
So before you went under,
the doctors made a video.

540
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:17,910
It's sort of, uh, a message

541
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:19,404
from your old self
to your new one.

542
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,249
Um...

543
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:30,322
I just want you to know

544
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,891
that I love you.

545
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:54,522
Tell me about the day you met.

546
00:31:56,515 --> 00:32:01,120
I was in the middle of
an art exhibit in SoMa,

547
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,723
and I noticed this guy,
and he was

548
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:09,261
looking at all the same
paintings I had been looking at.

549
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:11,955
Need another 6-0 loaded
backhand for the arterial stump.

550
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:17,303
Graft is secure.

551
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,737
Take off the Satinsky clamp.

552
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:27,913
Good perfusion
to his lower body.

553
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,249
Heart rate's spiking.

554
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:33,052
There's no ST elevations.

555
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:38,224
BP's tanking. Did he
thrombose the graft?

556
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,729
Distal anastomosis is pulsatile.

557
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:47,766
But there is blood pooling
in the left lower quadrant.

558
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:48,899
The right, too.

559
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,823
He's bleeding
everywhere but the graft.

560
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:55,374
It's DIC.

561
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:56,947
Send a stat ROTEM
and coag profile...

562
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:01,338
Start compression,
give epinephrine, and get the defib.

563
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:11,790
Set it to 120. 120.

564
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,035
Clear.

565
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
Compressions.

566
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:20,465
No response.

567
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:25,237
Go to monophasic at 360.

568
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:26,491
Clear.

569
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,188
Why aren't you shocking again?

570
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,359
He's in asystole.

571
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,861
Dr. Lim?

572
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,043
Dr. Wolke.

573
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:07,078
He's dead.

574
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:20,025
Time of death, 7:23 p.m.

575
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,600
Take as much time as you need.

576
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:13,244
I was in love with him.

577
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,947
All those moments I had,

578
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:19,351
meeting at the gallery,
the conversations...

579
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:23,789
I don't remember any of them.

580
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:27,358
But they were real.

581
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:30,962
And they brought up feelings.

582
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:37,636
Ones I don't remember
having for a really long time.

583
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,648
But all they made me think of was you,
Brendan.

584
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,419
Hearing how I met
Zane just reminded me

585
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:56,622
how you and I met
at Chelsey's party,

586
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,515
and you showed up in
that ugly bomber jacket.

587
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,127
And Zane taking
me to the hospital

588
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:04,363
reminded me how you
nursed me for months

589
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,797
when I broke my femur in Aspen.

590
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:08,400
And the whole time...

591
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:13,339
I just couldn't
stop thinking about

592
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:14,672
how much I must have hurt you.

593
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:24,949
And I...

594
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:27,619
I don't know

595
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,688
if you can forgive me.

596
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,327
But I love you.

597
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,638
And I... I want to come home.

598
00:36:58,784 --> 00:36:59,784
Well, you're wrong.

599
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:06,892
That bomber jacket
was really cool.

600
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:54,172
He died.

601
00:37:58,544 --> 00:38:01,447
I tried stepping back.

602
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,550
I tried brainstorming.

603
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,218
And he died.

604
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:17,729
I don't know what people
are thinking or feeling.

605
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:19,731
I can't communicate what I need.

606
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:22,968
And more patients will die.

607
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:33,111
You don't think your ASD had anything
to do with your patient's death, do you?

608
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,244
Because it didn't.

609
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,648
It did.

610
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,785
Asher wasn't sure about
his abdominal exam.

611
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:42,754
I should have known that.

612
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,056
Shaun, you're gonna do

613
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:50,228
most things better
than anyone else,

614
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:53,765
and there are days when you're gonna fail,
like everyone else.

615
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,768
Today might be
one of those days.

616
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,070
So...

617
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:04,776
What do you do then?

618
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:12,116
You go home,

619
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:14,732
you be with the people you love.

620
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:18,957
You take comfort in that,

621
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,259
and then you wake up
tomorrow and start all over again.

622
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,287
You can go home.

623
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:52,524
I just

624
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:56,995
don't wanna be alone right now.

625
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:41,439
I opened a Bumble account today.

626
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:42,574
Mmm.

627
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:47,913
I swiped right
three times today.

628
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,353
Gronk's jersey didn't
have a tag in the back.

629
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:57,588
It's symbolic.

630
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:02,098
You have any idea how much
the real one will be worth one day?

631
00:41:02,828 --> 00:41:03,828
Fair enough.

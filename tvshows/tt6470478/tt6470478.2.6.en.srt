00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:32,058
Morning, roomie.

3
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,526
Morning, roomie.

4
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:35,829
I'm going to the market later.
You need more apples?

5
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:39,432
No, but we need more toilet paper.

6
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:40,934
No prob.

7
00:00:42,482 --> 00:00:44,050
May I?

8
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:46,852
No prob.

9
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:50,601
Angel Fluff Plus, two-ply,

10
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:53,327
unscented, ultra-wide, extra soft.

11
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:56,053
Two-ply. No prob.

12
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:00,587
Y-You have to hang the toilet paper

13
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:02,856
on the dispenser the correct way.

14
00:01:02,858 --> 00:01:05,024
The paper goes over on the top,

15
00:01:05,026 --> 00:01:07,861
not under hanging against the wall.

16
00:01:07,863 --> 00:01:09,329
Sorry, I forgot you like it like that.

17
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:12,031
I don't "like it like that."

18
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:14,334
It's "right" like that.

19
00:01:14,336 --> 00:01:15,802
NBD.

20
00:01:17,037 --> 00:01:18,538
It's no big deal.

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,206
I got to run.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,879
Ms. Kohl?

23
00:01:30,904 --> 00:01:32,604
Hi, I'm Dr. Melendez.

24
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:34,962
Sorry. I have to practice whenever I can.

25
00:01:34,987 --> 00:01:37,388
I practice whenever I can, too.

26
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:39,413
We heard you hurt your finger.

27
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:40,604
Can we take a look?

28
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:43,196
I got a crappy manicure
a couple days ago,

29
00:01:43,198 --> 00:01:45,832
and now my nail looks disgusting.

30
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:48,101
Paronychia... it's an abscess caused by

31
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:49,602
a common bacterial infection.

32
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:51,437
We'll drain it, pack it,
and send you home.

33
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,706
In 72 hours, the pain and
swelling will be much better,

34
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,474
and you'll be back to Paganini.

35
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:01,960
Apologize already.

36
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:04,452
- I did nothing wrong.
- So?

37
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,019
You don't want to be iced out

38
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:08,278
by the future
- Chief of Surgery forever.

39
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:11,090
Lim could be Chief, too.
Andrews hasn't decided yet.

40
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:12,926
Hey, Brown, Park. Hustle in.

41
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:14,727
EMTs are less than a minute out.

42
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:16,429
Park, make sure Bay 3's good to go.

43
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:17,463
13-year-old female.

44
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:19,919
Progressively worsening epistaxis.

45
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,955
Bolus on the bus. BP 86/51.

46
00:02:22,957 --> 00:02:24,990
It won't stop! I can't get it to stop!

47
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:26,792
I got home, and she was calling 911.

48
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:28,093
Not your first nosebleed, huh, Dad?

49
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:29,695
Well, these things usually
go away on their own,

50
00:02:29,697 --> 00:02:31,797
but Riley claims she's been
like this for over an hour.

51
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:34,800
Ugh! It's not a claim, it's a fact!

52
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:36,669
Gonna need to get her on
a monitor right away

53
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:38,771
and apply 4% phenylephrine solution.

54
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:40,706
Gonna need to cauterize the bleed.

55
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,847
It's not my first nosebleed either.

56
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:50,683
I have my premiere at Davies
this weekend,

57
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:52,284
hence the manicure.

58
00:02:52,286 --> 00:02:55,721
Rosin, beeswax... that stuff
is tough to get off.

59
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:57,189
You play?

60
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,591
I know my way around bow strings.

61
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:02,594
I dabbled in archery
when I was in high school.

62
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:05,130
I started when I was 5.

63
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:07,900
I used to hum melodies doing my homework,

64
00:03:07,902 --> 00:03:09,668
eating dinner, taking out the trash.

65
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,904
I wanted to be a train conductor.

66
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:13,747
Mm, there's still time.

67
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:19,845
- Ow.
- She's numbed up.

68
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:23,082
She shouldn't have
any pain in her finger.

69
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:24,416
It's not my finger.

70
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:26,752
It's further up, by my knuckle.

71
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:28,420
No fever.

72
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:30,255
Any body aches?

73
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:31,790
Uh, a little.

74
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:34,326
Playing violin all day stresses
out my neck and shoulders.

75
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:37,496
It's likely tendonitis
or mild arthritic pain.

76
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:39,431
Or it might be flesh-eating bacteria

77
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:41,500
and we have may have to
cut off your finger.

78

There's the bleeder,

81
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:57,362
at the posterior rim of
Kiesselbach's plexus.

82
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,652
You called 911?

83
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:02,121
She did.

84
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:04,890
How you feeling, baby?

85
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:05,924
Peachy.

86
00:04:05,926 --> 00:04:07,659
It's a nosebleed. I'm handling it.

87
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:08,961
She's my kid, too, Bruce.

88
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:11,396
Bet you couldn't tell they're divorced.

89
00:04:11,398 --> 00:04:13,065
Well, why don't I take Riley's parents

90
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,233
to the waiting room so we can...

91
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:15,534
Talk about me.

92
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:16,902
Adiós.

93
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,543
We need to know.

94
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:27,880
Shaun, what do we need to do
to know for sure?

95
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:31,083
We need to cut deeper and get a swab.

96
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:33,352
Fingers have thousands of nerve endings.

97
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:36,421
Clipping off even the tiniest
portion of Jas' finger

98
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:38,724
could cause permanent damage
and be career-ending.

99
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:41,760
But if it is necrotizing fasciitis

100
00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:44,963
and we do nothing, she could die.

101
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:47,604
That would also end her career.

102
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:49,334
True.

103
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:51,804
But the numbers, Shaun, the data.

104
00:04:51,806 --> 00:04:53,806
There's almost no chance
that it's nec fasc.

105
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:55,541
On the other hand, if we test for it,

106
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:57,476
we will definitely do damage.

107
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:01,580
Anything else?

108
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,953
Do you hang your toilet paper
going over or under?

109
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,757
Doesn't matter.

110
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:16,128
Before the nosebleeds,
it was tummy aches,

111
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,930
insomnia, breathing pain.

112
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:20,332
Every time, we'd rush her
to the pediatrician,

113
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:22,334
but they couldn't find anything,

114
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:24,036
so we stopped taking her.

115
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:25,370
You think she's faking it?

116
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:28,540
A therapist said it was
likely her subconscious way

117
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,409
of trying to get her family
back together.

118
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:32,544
Well, divorce isn't easy for adults.

119
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:35,013
Why should kids be able
to deal with it any better?

120
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:36,915
She disengaged,

121
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:41,186
not just from us,
but her friends, school.

122
00:05:41,188 --> 00:05:43,088
It's been five years.

123
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,691
She should have found
her new normal by now.

124
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:51,430
Looks like someone's doing better.

125
00:05:51,432 --> 00:05:53,298
Nosebleed stopped,

126
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,367
but Riley's nasal membranes
are pretty thin.

127
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:57,569
You should be on the lookout
for future bleeds.

128
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:03,442
Riley, have you been sniffing
or snorting any drugs lately?

129
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:05,310
What? No way. I wouldn't do that.

130
00:06:05,312 --> 00:06:07,613
There's a lot of stuff
out there that looks harmless,

131
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,847
- but...
- She said no.

132
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:13,452
Does FLONASE count?

133
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:16,521
I was coughing.

134
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:19,191
I had a stuffy nose, itchy throat.

135
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:20,525
I looked up my symptoms,

136
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:23,028
because what the hell else
was I supposed to do?

137
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,230
Vasomotor rhinitis fit.

138
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:28,166
So I went to the drug store,
and I got some FLONASE.

139
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:30,936
Misuse of steroid sprays
can thin out nasal membranes,

140
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:32,671
causing terrible nosebleeds.

141
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:35,040
Quit the FLONASE, you're good to go.

142
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,708
Thank you.

143
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:40,445
Uh, I need you to take her tonight.

144
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:43,115
I had to skip a pitch to
an important V.C. to get here.

145
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:44,650
Sorry, didn't mean to take you away

146
00:06:44,652 --> 00:06:46,051
from anything important.

147
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:47,920
You're provoking her.
You know she's an anxious kid.

148
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:49,788
I'm not anxious, I'm sick.

149
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,956
Could you for once have my back?

150
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,357
- What?
- This is your fault.

151
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,159
She's playing us against each other.

152
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:56,762
What's wrong?

153
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:58,230
My breathing, I-it hurts.

154
00:06:58,232 --> 00:06:59,331
Just relax, sweetie.

155
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,199
Just stop, both of you.

156
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:09,111
Vasomotor rhinitis.

157
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:12,937
That is a pretty unique
diagnosis for an 8th grader.

158
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:14,505
You'll be numb in a minute.

159
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:15,940
7th.

160
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:17,675
And I was wrong.

161
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:18,909
Doesn't matter.

162
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:21,812
I get what you're going through.

163
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:24,415
You were smart, popular.

164
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:25,649
We don't have anything in common.

165
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:27,818
I was never popular.

166
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:32,323
I wore hand-me-downs from Goodwill.

167
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:34,225
I never knew my dad.

168
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:37,761
My mom was sick. I couldn't rely on her.

169
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:40,030
You know, kids at that age
can be total...

170
00:07:40,032 --> 00:07:41,265
Jerks.

171
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,467
Asshats. Turds.

172
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:47,071
I wouldn't send my worst enemy
back to junior high.

173
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:55,145
I got so many D's
on my report card last year,

174
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:56,614
I got held back.

175
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:00,755
Now everyone treats me like I'm stupid.

176
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:03,592
It's humiliating.

177
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:05,976
How'd you deal with it?

178
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:10,160
I said screw it.

179
00:08:10,162 --> 00:08:11,850
They already think I'm bad.

180
00:08:12,465 --> 00:08:15,799
I mess around in class, leave campus,

181
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:17,601
do whatever the hell I want.

182
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:22,606
But you're still angry.

183
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,715
I didn't let my past define me...

184
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:39,544
and yours doesn't have to define you.

185
00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:42,593
Repeating a grade doesn't make you...

186
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,764
What?

187
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:47,931
What's wrong?

188
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,300
Nothing.

189
00:08:49,302 --> 00:08:51,335
There doesn't seem to be
any active bleeding.

190
00:08:51,337 --> 00:08:54,238
But I coughed up blood. That was real.

191
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,041
It's possible it's just
post-nasal aspiration...

192
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:59,743
that the blood you coughed up
was from the initial nosebleed,

193
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:03,147
and it went down your throat,
into your lungs.

194
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:07,918
But my chest, it really hurts.

195
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:11,455
<i>Hey, Shaun. What's up?</i>

196
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:13,757
You forgot to put your coffee cup

197
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,793
in the dishwasher before you left.

198
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:17,394
<i>Sorry, I was in a rush.</i>

199
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:19,163
And remember, rinse it out

200
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:21,231
before you put it in the dishwasher.

201
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:23,534
<i>- Noted.
- And on the top rack.</i>

202
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:25,402
<i>- I got to go.
- Me too.</i>

203
00:09:25,404 --> 00:09:29,273
Morgan doesn't want to know
what's wrong with our patient.

204
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:30,974
I find that hard to believe.

205
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:33,210
They talk about bow strings.

206
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:35,679
I don't know anything about bow strings.

207
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:39,049
They should be talking about
what's wrong with her.

208
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:41,685
You can't always know, Shaun.

209
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:43,587
Sometimes tests aren't worth it.

210
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:46,223
Sometimes we don't have the right tests.

211
00:09:57,403 --> 00:09:58,702
What are you doing in here?

212
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:02,339
Lea and I disagree about toilet paper.

213
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:06,744
And you made a good point
about finding the right test.

214
00:10:06,746 --> 00:10:08,312
Thanks?

215
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:12,249
I just did a test.

216
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:13,650
On toilet paper?

217
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:16,053
Every toilet paper roll in this restroom

218
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:18,756
has the paper hanging over, not under,

219
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:21,925
and they were installed by professionals.

220
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:23,193
Does it matter?

221
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:28,265
I-D-G-A...

222
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:32,269
I think it's an acronym

223
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:34,938
or maybe even an anagram.

224
00:10:36,174 --> 00:10:40,210
I don't think Lea cares about
the toilet paper debate.

225
00:10:40,212 --> 00:10:42,880
It's not a debate. I'm right.

226
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:45,115
I think you should talk to Lea.

227
00:10:45,117 --> 00:10:46,884
Not text, talk.

228
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:51,622
Did you talk to Dr. Melendez

229
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:53,690
after you got in trouble with him?

230
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:55,759
- No.
- Why not?

231
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:57,995
Because I did nothing wrong.

232
00:10:57,997 --> 00:11:00,697
Because you were right.

233
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:02,399
- Yeah.
- So am I.

234
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:10,007
Make sure all four tips
are touching the ground

235
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,642
before you take a step.

236
00:11:11,644 --> 00:11:12,843
Well, thank you, Iris.

237
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:14,645
I never would have figured that out.

238
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:17,514
I'm required to show you how
to use all medical equipment.

239
00:11:18,884 --> 00:11:21,167
Well, I'm not gonna use it.
You want to know why?

240
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:24,588
- Huh?
- Because I'm not gonna use it.

241
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,957
You remind me of my Grandpa Eddie.

242
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,792
So grumpy, so adorable.

243
00:11:28,794 --> 00:11:30,761
See? Look... no hands.

244
00:11:30,763 --> 00:11:31,895
I'm fine.

245
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:37,201
Uh, chicken soup...
heard it's good for the soul.

246
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:39,169
I wasn't expecting you. Thank you.

247
00:11:39,171 --> 00:11:41,171
That's very thoughtful.

248
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:43,006
It's... Really, it's no big deal.

249
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:45,709
I signed up to bring you food
at the hospital,

250
00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:47,377
the Meal Train that they set up.

251
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:49,146
- The Meal Train, yeah.
- Yeah.

252
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:53,684
How... How are you doing today?

253
00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:56,253
Well, today is actually looking up.

254
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:57,387
Good.

255
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:59,223
You want to come in and have some soup?

256
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:02,059
I have other plans.

257
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:03,060
Ah, yeah.

258
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:04,828
But, um...

259
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,297
I'm actually free tomorrow.

260
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:09,266
Do you like lasagna?

261
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:10,934
I kind of love lasagna.

262
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:12,436
Great.

263
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:15,706
Finally get that second date.

264
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,674
- You know, you don't have to...
- No, Aaron.

265
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:19,710
I want to.

266
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:21,411
Well, then, I want to.

267
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:24,081
Okay. Great.

268
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,549
Then, um...

269
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:27,518
I will see you, then, tomorrow.

270
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,315
I'll see you tomorrow.

271
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:35,058
No one dabbles in archery
unless they're at summer camp.

272
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,326
How long did you do it?

273
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:38,729
Seven days a week for seven years.

274
00:12:38,731 --> 00:12:39,963
Why'd you stop?

275
00:12:39,965 --> 00:12:43,467
It was just time to go to
college, medical school,

276
00:12:43,469 --> 00:12:44,935
be a grown-up.

277
00:12:44,937 --> 00:12:47,004
It was that easy to just quit?

278
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:49,907
Archery doesn't fill concert
halls or pay the bills.

279
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:53,443
She has a slight fever,

280
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:56,346
her rash is spreading, and she has edema.

281
00:12:56,348 --> 00:12:58,849
This is definitely not paronychia.

282
00:12:58,851 --> 00:13:01,418
I know. I've moved on to MRSA.

283
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,222
That's possible,
but you should want proof.

284
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:08,692
If we do an open, deep-tissue biopsy,

285
00:13:08,694 --> 00:13:10,794
we will know for sure if
you have flesh-eating...

286
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:11,962
Shaun.

287
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:21,638
Part of being a good doctor is knowing

288
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,007
when to not scare the crap
out of a patient.

289
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:26,143
I don't think so.

290
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:28,211
This is your problem, not hers...

291
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:31,081
your need to be sure,
your obsession, y...

292
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,984
We need to cut off
a small piece of her finger

293
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:36,787
so we know if we have
to cut off a larger...

294
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:39,923
Shaun, you're acting like
you want to amputate her hand.

295
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:44,861
No. You're acting like you don't
want to amputate her hand.

296
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:46,296
I don't.

297
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:50,267
But that's not medically relevant.

298
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:53,070
Her temperature is 102.

299
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:58,175
It's gone up two degrees
since we've been arguing.

300
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:08,218
Okay. We'll test her.

301
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:15,929
That tissue has begun to die.

302
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,757
Or it's inflammatory infiltration.

303
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,259
Find anything?

304
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,628
W-We're at an impasse.

305
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,402
Look here, at the margin.

306
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:34,238
Subcutaneous fat and fascial necrosis.

307
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,733
Shaun was right.

308
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,431
Let's go try to save her hand.

309
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,258
She is a young girl with a lot going on.

310
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,760
Well, we agree on that much.

311
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,328
That's why she needs to see a shrink.

312
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:00,798
Mnh. This...

313
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,733
This feels different.

314
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:09,807
What, you don't believe in
emotional intelligence?

315
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,376
If I have to choose between
the battery of tests we've done

316
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,880
and your gut, it's an easy choice.

317
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:18,983
No. You don't relate to her,

318
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:22,019
and if you don't relate to her,
you can't understand her.

319
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,856
You're probably right.

320
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,333
You think you do relate.

321
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:32,169
Well, do you have a kid?

322
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:37,601
My opinion about Riley is medical.

323
00:15:39,783 --> 00:15:43,353
Why haven't you told any of us
you have a kid?

324
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:45,778
That is a huge chunk of your
life you've been hiding.

325
00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:47,570
I don't feel the need to share everything

326
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,248
about my personal life with
the people I work with.

327
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,849
Oh, that's your passive-aggressive way

328
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,284
of saying I'm an over-sharer?

329
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,418
Yeah.

330
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,154
Your opinion on Riley is clearly skewed

331
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,657
because you're looking at her
through a parental lens.

332
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,125
I've been in her shoes.

333
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,527
I'm better equipped
to evaluate her situation.

334
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,830
You're the poster child of skewed.

335
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,131
You're too emotionally involved

336
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,100
and are overreacting because
you had a crappy mom

337
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,501
who didn't care about you.

338
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,288
And why do I know all that?

339
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,572
Because you're an over-sharer.

340
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:21,279
The scan's clean.

341
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,450
Is it time to send her home?

342
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:29,931
Clamp.

343
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:35,559
Whoa. That is not good.

344
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,296
Muscle's weak. Clamp slid
right through the fascia.

345
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,941
Murphy, pull the skin back.

346
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:43,534
Smells like rotten eggs.

347
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:45,836
There's only tissue damage.

348
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,104
If we debride her hand carefully,

349
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,340
we can preserve some mobility
and dexterity.

350
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,842
She's gonna need close
monitoring post-op tonight.

351
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:54,011
Scissors.

352
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,339
We need to talk.

353
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,407
Can it wait? I'm late for
an all-night coding session.

354
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,510
You hung the toilet paper incorrectly.

355
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,212
Right. Did you flip it?

356
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:30,861
Great, we're done.

357
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,053
You left the TV remote on the couch.

358
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,488
Shaun, I'm running late.

359
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,392
You have to put it on the tray
on the coffee table.

360
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,127
That is where it belongs.

361
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:46,130
If it doesn't have a set place,

362
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,900
then it will be in many places
and then it will get lost

363
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,770
and if I can't find it, I can't
watch the Weather Channel...

364
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,039
Okay, enough about the damn remote!

365
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,908
Everything in this place
has to be your way.

366
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,444
We have to make sure to use
two pods in the washing machine,

367
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,179
we have to keep the cups
to the left of the plate,

368
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,849
we have to keep the
air conditioner at exactly 74,

369
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,684
and we have to use one very specific,

370
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,319
very hard-to-find toilet paper.

371
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,820
And I'm trying to be accommodating,

372
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,056
but you are not cutting me any slack.

373
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,762
Oh, God.

374
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,630
Shaun.

375
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,633
Shaun, I am sorry. I'm... Are you okay?

376
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,945
You have a ruptured Achilles.

377
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,647
I'm afraid your weekend warrior
days are over...

378
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,082
Help! Can we get some help here?

379
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,477
Right there.

380
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,152
What happened?

381
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,854
She couldn't sleep, uh,
she spiked a fever.

382
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:44,955
It's only getting worse.

383
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,957
I can't breathe.

384
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,260
Take a deep breath, in, out.

385
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,128
104.6.

386
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,097
I need IV acetaminophen
and cooling blankets ASAP.

387
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,132
She's tachypneic with an O2 SAT of 87.

388
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,734
Is this... Is this something new or...

389
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,135
Did... I mean, did she
do this to herself?

390
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,203
She has an infection.

391
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,571
I think she's developed pneumonia

392
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,173
due to an underlying condition.

393
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,274
What underlying condition?

394
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:05,693
I have no idea. Page Park and Lim.

395
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:10,826
No signs of PE or pneumonia.

396
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:13,061
CFTR was negative for cystic fibrosis.

397
00:19:13,063 --> 00:19:16,298
I think we may have missed
something on her CT.

398
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:20,736
There... that slight shadow
on the bronchus.

399
00:19:20,738 --> 00:19:22,504
A slow-growing carcinoid tumor

400
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:24,540
could cause chronic airway inflammation.

401
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:26,441
As the tumor grows, symptoms worsen,

402
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:29,177
leading to airway obstruction
and infection.

403
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:31,313
Or it's just a shadow,

404
00:19:31,315 --> 00:19:32,681
a slight shadow.

405
00:19:32,683 --> 00:19:34,182
It is pretty subtle.

406
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:36,852
I would like to do exploratory VATS.

407
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:38,887
You want to poke holes in her chest

408
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:40,522
and go rooting around in her lungs?

409
00:19:40,524 --> 00:19:42,190
Riley's body's already compromised.

410
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:43,725
There are no obvious lesions,

411
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:45,360
and her symptoms
are more likely indicators

412
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:46,962
of a simple sinus infection.

413
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:49,565
The safer, better plan is
to treat with antibiotics.

414
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,300
If she has a progressing tumor,

415
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:53,769
we can't just send her home
with medication.

416
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:02,010
Pitch the surgery
to the parents and Riley.

417
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:03,394
Okay.

418
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:11,186
Hey, hey, hey!

419
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:13,188
Don't touch those. Those are vintage.

420
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,690
Well, I'm just scooting your toys over

421
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:16,558
so it's easier to get to your medication.

422
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,660
Toys. Toys?

423
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:20,629
These are not toys.

424
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:22,130
That's Reggie Jackson.

425
00:20:22,132 --> 00:20:23,699
Well, when that timer goes off,

426
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:25,667
Roger Johnson can give you your medicine.

427
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:27,436
Reggie Jackson.

428
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:31,840
Hey, guess what.

429
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:35,344
Quitting time.

430
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:36,945
Okay. Have fun.

431
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:39,013
- Take your pills.
- Yeah.

432
00:20:48,257 --> 00:20:49,858
I think I broke Shaun.

433
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,760
- Hi.
- We got into a big fight, huge,

434
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:53,528
and I was yelling and he just fell apart.

435
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,763
It was awful.

436
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:57,232
And he pushes and pushes
and pushes. I pushed back.

437
00:20:57,234 --> 00:20:59,001
Well, Shaun's not easy,
but you knew that.

438
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:02,001
I knew it was gonna be hard,
but living with him is a lot.

439
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:02,997
I know.

440
00:21:03,022 --> 00:21:04,239
I mean, there's stuff I've
never even thought about.

441
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:05,641
And I know he has idiosyncrasies,

442
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:08,043
but there's a lot of them. I mean, a lot.

443
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:09,645
I know. Is Shaun okay?

444
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:10,912
Yes. No. I don't know.

445
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:12,380
He's at work.

446
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,183
Glassy, you know him,

447
00:21:15,185 --> 00:21:17,510
like really know him.

448
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:20,088
How do I deal with Shaun?

449
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,924
Well, it's been 12 years,
and I'm still learning.

450
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:24,393
He just always has to be right.

451
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:26,495
I mean, do you... do you know
how many calls and texts

452
00:21:26,497 --> 00:21:29,531
and notes he's left me about
how I'm doing stuff wrong?

453
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:30,932
I have a pretty good idea, yeah.

454
00:21:30,934 --> 00:21:32,901
Yeah, well, it's exhausting.

455
00:21:32,903 --> 00:21:34,436
You know what? We all have quirks.

456
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:37,973
We can all be a pain in the ass
from time to time.

457
00:21:37,975 --> 00:21:40,175
Okay, admittedly Shaun a little more so.

458
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:42,511
That is not helpful.

459
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:43,845
- Sit down.
- What?

460
00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:45,013
- Sit down.
- Why?

461
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:47,516
Why? Because you're agitated
and you're annoying me

462
00:21:47,518 --> 00:21:50,501
and I can't give you
good advice in that state.

463
00:21:51,321 --> 00:21:52,454
Sit.

464
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,393
Thank you.

465
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:02,531
Do you like Shaun?

466
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,132
- Of course.
- Why?

467
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:10,806
He's sweet, kind, honest,
sometimes brutally honest,

468
00:22:10,808 --> 00:22:14,242
there's never an agenda with him.

469
00:22:14,244 --> 00:22:16,978
He's just Shaun.

470
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,980
So?

471
00:22:18,982 --> 00:22:21,282
So I want him to change...

472
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:23,218
a little.

473
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,203
You moved in expecting him to change?

474
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,390
He doesn't want you to change.

475
00:22:28,392 --> 00:22:29,524
I know that.

476
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:35,864
And if I made the wrong decision?

477
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:38,924
Then you move out
and you do it right now.

478
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:41,436
It'll devastate him,
but the longer you wait,

479
00:22:41,438 --> 00:22:44,139
the more...

480
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:46,675
...the worse it will be for him.

481
00:22:52,315 --> 00:22:54,716
If Riley has a tumor,

482
00:22:54,718 --> 00:22:58,787
we need to open her up to find
out what we're dealing with.

483
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:00,489
Why do you think she has a tumor?

484
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:03,191
It's consistent with her symptoms.

485
00:23:03,193 --> 00:23:06,285
The same symptoms she's been
having for years?

486
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:08,563
Yes.

487
00:23:08,565 --> 00:23:11,767
The same symptoms we've been
told are psychological,

488
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:14,703
the same symptoms
a dozen doctors have run

489
00:23:14,705 --> 00:23:17,239
a hundred tests for and found nothing?

490
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:20,375
There is a shadow on her CT image.

491
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:22,134
A shadow?

492
00:23:22,913 --> 00:23:24,887
And it's risky surgery?

493
00:23:26,749 --> 00:23:30,476
Opening her up in a weakened
state could be dangerous.

494
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:34,756
Look, I know Riley frustrates you,

495
00:23:34,758 --> 00:23:36,816
drives you crazy,

496
00:23:37,795 --> 00:23:39,895
but I also know you love her.

497
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:43,781
You have a chance to show her that.

498
00:23:44,535 --> 00:23:46,868
So you want to do this as a statement?

499
00:23:50,073 --> 00:23:52,414
We want you to believe in your daughter,

500
00:23:53,977 --> 00:23:56,478
because that's what a parent does.

501
00:24:01,385 --> 00:24:03,092
When she was little

502
00:24:03,821 --> 00:24:05,886
and had a bad dream,

503
00:24:07,324 --> 00:24:11,600
she used to come into our room
and snuggle up under your arm,

504
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:13,936
just like she's doing to me.

505
00:24:15,132 --> 00:24:17,356
You would stroke her face

506
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:21,110
until she was finally at peace
and fell asleep.

507
00:24:23,574 --> 00:24:25,739
She's in so much pain,

508
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:29,559
and I don't know how to make it go away.

509
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,460
Riley?

510
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:40,622
Hey, um...

511
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,592
The doctors,

512
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:47,469
t-they want to see what's
going on in your lungs.

513
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:52,039
They think you might have a tumor.

514
00:24:55,805 --> 00:24:58,039
And we want them to operate.

515
00:25:00,443 --> 00:25:02,744
You think I have a real tumor?

516
00:25:04,247 --> 00:25:08,350
It's scary, I know, but...

517
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,987
yes, we do.

518
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,600
Her BP's dropping out... 73/51.

519
00:25:25,602 --> 00:25:28,937
Heart rate is spiking to 137.

520
00:25:28,939 --> 00:25:31,439
- Hang an IV saline bolus.
- I need a 12-lead.

521
00:25:35,722 --> 00:25:37,579
The necrosis has migrated.

522
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:38,813
She's septic.

523
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:40,982
There's definite infiltration
to the bone.

524
00:25:40,984 --> 00:25:43,051
We're gonna have to amputate her arm.

525
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,388
Polish the bone to help stump healing.

526
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,790
Rasp.

527
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:04,296
The margins appear to be clean.

528
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:07,331
There's still a small chance microbes

529
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,565
may have spread to her organs.

530
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,000
If they did, then her mortality rate

531
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,002
just increased exponentially.

532
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,373
What if we put her in
hyperbaric oxygen therapy now?

533
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,876
Oxygen's toxic to bacteria.

534
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:21,645
There's a lot of things
that could go wrong in there.

535
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,313
We wouldn't be able to
decompress the chamber in time

536
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,817
to help her.

537
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:29,019
We wouldn't have to wait to help her

538
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,321
if someone goes in with her.

539
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,724
I'll do it.

540
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:36,059
Okay. Get the chamber ready.

541
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,099
Lung tissue looks normal.

542
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,234
And there are healthy-appearing bronchi.

543
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:45,969
Nothing...

544
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,070
yet.

545
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:52,009
Damn it. Tore a lobar artery.

546
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:55,045
BP is 81/49, oxygen SATS 93,

547
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,214
heart rate is going up. She is tanking.

548
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,583
Park, I need more suction.
I can't see a thing in here.

549
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:01,251
We need to do an open thoracotomy now.

550
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:03,887
- Browne, crack her chest.
- 10 blade and a rib spreader.

551
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:14,898
There are only
7.18 cubic meters in there.

552
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,034
How does it feel?

553
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,769
It's fine.

554
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:21,138
I thought it might feel claustrophobic

555
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,417
for someone neurotypical.

556
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:25,936
It is.

557
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:31,982
Got it.

558
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,084
It's still bleeding.

559
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,986
Stroke volume just bottomed out.

560
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,088
Rapid infuse 4 liters of whole blood.

561
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,923
Get ready to start cardiac massage.

562
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:43,020
Wait. I think I have an anchor
in the arterial wall.

563
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,096
Stroke volume is rising,

564
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:49,833
BP increasing, 90/60.

565
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,602
Pulse is 90 and regular.

566
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:54,204
She's stable for now.

567
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,044
This was a mistake.

568
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,447
We need to close her up
as soon as possible.

569
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,589
It doesn't make any sense.

570
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,957
Her arterial wall
shouldn't be this fragile.

571
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,193
Something else has caused it to thin out.

572
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,131
What else is going on in here?

573
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:22,900
Browne, I need more light.

574
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,066
Yeah. See that?

575
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:33,076
A localized granuloma
on the right lower lobe.

576
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,111
You think it's cancer?

577
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:35,779
Not sure but something's in there.

578
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:37,714
Park, retract the lung.

579
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,896
It's a LEGO.

580
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,932
Riley must've inhaled it years ago.

581
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:56,099
It settled in your lung

582
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,936
and became encased
in inflammatory tissue.

583
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:01,638
Your body's immune response attacked it,

584
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,708
making you progressively
more sick over the years.

585
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,277
It's small, thin, and made of plastic.

586
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,546
There was no way of seeing it
on any of the imaging.

587
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,715
Ugh. This is so gross.

588
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,718
I'm gonna make it into a necklace.

589
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:19,056
Good luck. Excuse me.

590
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,698
We're sorry that we didn't
believe in you.

591
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:34,173
We're sorry that we put
you through all this.

592
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:39,509
We're sorry that we got divorced.

593
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,278
Whoa.

594
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,714
You guys are way better off apart.

595
00:29:43,716 --> 00:29:46,717
W-We always thought you were
upset because we split up.

596
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:50,487
I was upset because
you fought all the time.

597
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,022
You still do.

598
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,423
It freaked me out.

599
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,494
So I'd hide in my princess tent,

600
00:29:57,496 --> 00:30:00,964
bite my nails, gnaw on crayons...

601
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,802
...chew on LEGOs.

602
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,789
We screwed up,

603
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:12,209
and we promise we can do better.

604
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,157
I am not saying that "Ordinary People"

605
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,259
is not a good movie. I'm...

606
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,360
It's a good... It's a great movie.

607
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:32,029
It's a great movie.

608
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,730
Okay, but I'm saying
is that "Raging Bull"

609
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:36,099
is a superior cinematic experience.

610
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,902
It is raw. It's, like, romantic.

611
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,670
- It's romantic?
- Yeah!

612
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,072
It pummels you from start to finish.

613
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,707
Exactly. Exactly.

614
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:46,276
It's like adrenaline is
pulsing through your veins.

615
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:50,013
It leaves me breathless
every time I watch it.

616
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,481
Oh!

617
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:59,423
Do you... Do you want to,
like, go for a walk?

618
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,591
Well, it's a little cold outside.

619
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,430
- I'm gonna kiss you.
- You are?

620
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:07,998
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

621
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,068
Mm.

622
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,606
- Maybe we'll walk upstairs?
- Okay.

623
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:17,874
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

624
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,310
- This way?
- Yeah.

625
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,112
Yeah.

626
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,481
Whoa.

627
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,716
- C-Can... Can I help?
- No. Thank you.

628
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,585
I'll get there. I'm okay, I'm okay.

629
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:29,920
I'm okay. Ow.

630
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:52,895
Is my hand okay?

631
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:59,082
Your biopsy was positive
for necrotizing fasciitis.

632
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,119
We had to do multiple surgeries

633
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:05,388
to remove the infected muscle and bone.

634
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,623
Bone?

635
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,360
I'm so sorry, Jas.

636
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,162
We had to amputate your arm.

637
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:14,931
No.

638
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,067
No, my... my arm still hurts.

639
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:19,880
I can... I can feel it. It's still there.

640
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,842
What you're experiencing
is "phantom pain."

641
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:27,878
Your arm is gone.

642
00:32:40,544 --> 00:32:42,811
H-He told you.

643
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,864
My arm.

644
00:32:50,174 --> 00:32:52,976
My arm is gone.

645
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,175
It's gone and...

646
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:00,710
and it's... it's your fault.

647
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,124
Get out.

648
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,229
Get the hell out.

649
00:33:20,693 --> 00:33:22,317
I can't.

650
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:24,634
Neither of us can.

651
00:33:49,183 --> 00:33:50,917
You called it.

652
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:52,118
Well done.

653
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,020
Thanks for your help.

654
00:33:54,022 --> 00:33:57,691
Finally a believer in the power
of emotional intelligence?

655
00:33:57,693 --> 00:33:59,259
Oh, it did get her parents on board,

656
00:33:59,261 --> 00:34:01,294
even if it's only for a little while.

657
00:34:01,296 --> 00:34:02,863
They believe their kid,

658
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:05,198
and they're working on
their family relationships.

659
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,967
It's pretty big steps.

660
00:34:06,969 --> 00:34:08,835
It was a nice moment.

661
00:34:08,837 --> 00:34:11,071
But if you think you changed
them, that they'll be

662
00:34:11,073 --> 00:34:14,274
different people tomorrow
than they were yesterday,

663
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:16,142
then you're kidding yourself.

664
00:34:19,647 --> 00:34:22,048
Right now, my emotional
intelligence is telling me

665
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,717
even you don't believe that.

666
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,729
Kitchen's clean,

667
00:34:41,503 --> 00:34:43,136
leftovers are in the fridge.

668
00:34:44,906 --> 00:34:46,401
How you doing?

669
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:49,135
Fine.

670
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,531
I just got a little lightheaded.

671
00:34:52,314 --> 00:34:55,382
Balance isn't quite back to normal.

672
00:34:56,484 --> 00:34:58,351
Well, now that you're
feeling a little better,

673
00:34:58,353 --> 00:35:00,086
you want to watch "Raging Bull"?

674
00:35:01,923 --> 00:35:03,456
No.

675
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:06,459
Okay. Another time.

676
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:08,006
No.

677
00:35:09,097 --> 00:35:10,764
I can't do this.

678
00:35:10,766 --> 00:35:12,799
We can take it slow.

679
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:16,436
I'm... I'm happy to just
be here with you, like this.

680
00:35:16,438 --> 00:35:19,573
No. I can't... I can't be here like this.

681
00:35:22,843 --> 00:35:24,844
I-I-I don't want you to f...

682
00:35:26,147 --> 00:35:29,616
I just... I don't want to...

683
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:35,455
I'm sorry. I just...
I need you to go, please.

684
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:34,781
Jas practiced violin
every day since she was 5.

685
00:36:37,485 --> 00:36:40,453
She put all her faith in me
to do the right thing, and...

686
00:36:42,456 --> 00:36:44,324
I thought I did. I...

687
00:36:47,935 --> 00:36:49,936
Shaun didn't care. He...

688
00:36:49,961 --> 00:36:53,329
He didn't see her dreams.
He just saw her symptoms.

689
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,200
Sometimes that'll be the wrong choice.

690
00:37:07,581 --> 00:37:11,584
My second year in the program,
there was this resident.

691
00:37:13,287 --> 00:37:15,255
She was kind of weird.

692
00:37:15,257 --> 00:37:17,057
She wore comic book T-shirts,

693
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:20,263
always ate the exact same lunch.

694
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,224
But she was smart.

695
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,300
She would get surgeries and
knock 'em out of the park

696
00:37:27,302 --> 00:37:29,314
over and over again.

697
00:37:30,172 --> 00:37:32,172
Couldn't stand her.

698
00:37:35,009 --> 00:37:40,116
And one day I realized
I was competing against her,

699
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:43,662
but she wasn't competing against me.

700
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:48,788
She spent her time observing,
asking questions,

701
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:52,859
preparing herself to be a great surgeon.

702
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,567
Is she?

703
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:07,440
Dr. Lim is one of the best
trauma surgeons in the country.

704
00:38:35,703 --> 00:38:37,737
- Dr. Melendez.
- Dr. Browne.

705
00:38:38,906 --> 00:38:40,593
Dr. Lim.

706
00:38:41,176 --> 00:38:43,042
Nice save today.

707
00:38:43,044 --> 00:38:45,745
I heard. Yes, good work, Dr. Browne.

708
00:38:45,747 --> 00:38:47,313
Thank you.

709
00:38:58,392 --> 00:38:59,859
Good night.

710
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:08,234
You know she showed bad judgment.

711
00:39:08,236 --> 00:39:10,436
You got something to say, just say it.

712
00:39:13,274 --> 00:39:14,974
Want to grab a beer?

713
00:39:17,545 --> 00:39:19,212
Yes.

714
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:25,819
Hey.

715
00:39:28,189 --> 00:39:30,023
Are you okay?

716
00:39:33,627 --> 00:39:34,861
Yes.

717
00:39:37,164 --> 00:39:41,421
I'm so sorry for my outburst yesterday.

718
00:39:42,437 --> 00:39:44,370
I'm fine now.

719
00:39:47,308 --> 00:39:50,330
I'm not, Shaun.

720
00:39:50,946 --> 00:39:53,980
Coming back to California
and starting a new job

721
00:39:53,982 --> 00:39:55,915
and moving in with you...

722
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:58,418
it's been so stressful,

723
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,521
harder than I anticipated.

724
00:40:05,926 --> 00:40:08,264
You're moving out.

725
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,097
No, I'm not moving out.

726
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:14,300
We are still figuring out
each other's quirks.

727
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:15,969
Oh, yes.

728
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:18,538
You're very difficult to live with.

729
00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:24,878
I know I forget stuff a lot,

730
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,883
and sometimes I snap and yell.

731
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,247
I promise to work on that.

732
00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:35,788
And I don't need you to change,

733
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:38,378
but I do need to know that you know

734
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:40,619
you're annoying as hell.

735
00:40:42,696 --> 00:40:47,200
I need to know that you'll
try to compromise.

736
00:40:55,009 --> 00:41:00,647
I don't think I can use
one-ply toilet paper.

737
00:41:00,649 --> 00:41:02,815
Oh, no, you were so right about two-ply.

738
00:41:02,817 --> 00:41:05,363
Totally worth the extra $1.50.

739
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:11,491
But maybe the cups can go
to the right of the plates.

740
00:41:12,993 --> 00:41:14,560
Sometimes.

741
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:20,266
Well, everything's unpacked.

742
00:41:20,268 --> 00:41:24,470
We're officially moved in together.

743
00:41:27,108 --> 00:41:30,176
I'm gonna take these down
to the recycling.

744
00:41:30,178 --> 00:41:33,112
And I know I probably didn't put
everything in the right place,

745
00:41:33,114 --> 00:41:36,382
but maybe we can rearrange it together.

746
00:41:38,118 --> 00:41:41,788
I like that idea very much.

747
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,927
♪ All I am is all I need

748
00:42:15,223 --> 00:42:18,091
I like that idea very much.

748
00:42:19,305 --> 00:43:19,784

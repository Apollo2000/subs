I'm going to make you
a surprise dinner tonight.

814
00:39:13,592 --> 00:39:15,744
It's a special
grilled cheese sandwich.

815
00:39:15,828 --> 00:39:18,046
It's special because it
uses four kinds of cheeses...

816
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,254
Gruyere,
Parmesan, yellow...

I saw what I saw, Shaun,
and I am telling you,

it doesn't matter
what you say.

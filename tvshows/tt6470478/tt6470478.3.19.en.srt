1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,471
Previously on The Good Doctor...

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,104
You ready to tell me
what's on your mind?

3
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:07,975
I think I'm in love
with my boss.

4
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:11,579
I have rheumatoid arthritis.

5
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,881
I wanted you to know
and no one else.

6
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,351
I've been thinking about
synovectomy surgery.

7
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:19,820
That'll resolve the pain
temporarily. Then what?

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,755
It'll give me
at least ten years.

9
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,757
And then you're gonna be
bone on bone.

10
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,493
What's your plan then?

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,361
I understand
you're leaving surgery.

12
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:29,297
That's tough.
But it's the right call.

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,332
No, I don't think it is.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,635
I'm doing the surgery.

15
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,404
You don't tell me anything
about your life.

16
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:38,182
That's because you don't
want to know anything.

17
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,807
That's not true!

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,951
You don't want to feel guilty
about being a thousand miles away.

19
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,744
You just want to know
that I'm okay.

20
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,046
I love you, Lea.

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,649
I want to be your boyfriend.

22
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,651
I'm a challenge for anyone.

23
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:53,187
I just know it would be
too hard for you.

24
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:55,556
You have to give me a chance.

25
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,191
You need to let me try.

26
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:58,559
No. I will fix it!

27
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,028
Shaun, you're autistic.
You can't fix that.

28
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,565
You acted like
you cared about me,

29
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,401
but you don't even respect me.

30
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:10,671
You're going to end up alone,
and you deserve it!

31
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,640
Because you're a superficial,

32
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,543
selfish, and prejudiced person!

34
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,594
Uh, two lychee Kolsch, please.

35
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:35,929
Lea?

36
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:37,931
Hey! Hey.

37
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,103
I saw the invite at the clinic.

38
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:45,038
And I assumed
you wouldn't be here.

39
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:50,778
You with a friend?

40
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,914
Uh, it's been
a rough couple of weeks.

41
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,852
Hey! They're here!

42
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:00,921
The guys who made
this all possible!

43
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,122
I don't know about all that.

44
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:03,924
Yeah, well,
you try opening a brewery

45
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,593
or fundraising when you're dead.

46
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,960
Ohh.

47
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,397
Oh, honey, uh,
you remember Dr. Melendez...

48
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,464
Hi. And Dr. Glassman.

49
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,899
This is my wife, Noreen.

50
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,234
Aaron. Hi.

51
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,768
This is Lea.

52
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:17,104
Your flavor profiles are epic.

53
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,139
Well, how about a tour?

54
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:20,674
Uh, yes.

55
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,075
Okay, great. Come on.

56
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,412
Carl! Marta.

57
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:25,613
It's good to see you!

58
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,115
She is in host mode.
We could be here forever.

59
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,283
I'll show you around.

60
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:37,458
The, uh, hops in the Kolsch,
is that the Citra?

61
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,993
In combination
with the Noble German.

62
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,662
Lady knows her stuff.

63
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,067
Do you feel that?

64
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,337
It's an earthquake.

65
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:08,822
Get out of there!

66
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:14,995
Lea!

67
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,965
Hello?

68
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,401
Thank God. Are you okay?

69
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,068
Um, I'm fine, I think.

70
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,439
The ceiling caved in.

71
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,873
Were you hit? Are you bleeding?

72
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,075
Not as far as I can tell.
Just...

73
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,811
Just some bruises.

74
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,847
The brewing tanks fell over.

75
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,215
One went
right through the floor.

76
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,418
And Glassman?
Wasn't he with you?

77
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,420
I was! I am!

78
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,027
Your shoulder. It's dislocated.

79
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,161
Yeah.

80
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,033
I'm okay.

81
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,067
Noreen.

82
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,438
We're okay here.

83
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,115
I'm about to assemble
a HURT team and head out.

84
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,407
Any idea how many wounded?

85
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,076
No. Let me check.

86
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,713
Come on.

87
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,253
Lea?

88
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,977
Get here as fast as you can.

89
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,650
The hospital is on mass
casualty incident protocol.

90
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:18,151
Cancel all elective surgeries.

91
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,653
Transfer non-critical patients

92
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,489
to urgent-
or chronic-care facilities.

93
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,124
No family members or visitors
are allowed in the ER.

94
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,394
We're gonna need every
inch of space we've got.

95
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,871
Use the waiting room
for patient overflow.

96
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,930
Our HURT Team,
which I'll be running,

97
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,433
has been assigned
to the Bold Statement Brewery,

98
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,001
which collapsed
during a charity event.

99
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,803
Melendez and Glassman
went to that.

100
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,171
I spoke with Melendez.
They're both fine.

101
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,542
That's two out of
approximately a hundred.

102
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,277
Park, Shaun, Claire,
you're with me.

103
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:47,111
Get the equipment packed up. I
want to be on the road in three minutes.

104
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,020
I need you to cover surgery.

105
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,364
I'll get another attending
on the ER.

106
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:57,458
I'll do both. I used to run
the whole hospital.

107
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,628
It's just a cut. You'll be fine.

108
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,997
I need to focus
on medical emergencies.

109
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,966
Cuts and scrapes do not qualify.

110
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,501
My colleague and I
will be com...

111
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,907
Lea?

112
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,343
The door to the Brew Hall
is totally blocked.

113
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,646
Dr. Melendez!

114
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,680
Noreen?

115
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,485
Marta.

116
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,320
What hurts?

117
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,789
My back.

118
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,171
Okay,
I'm gonna need a towel and some tape,

119
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,355
and Glassman and I need
every first aid kit you've got.

120
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,067
Go.

121
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,107
Hold still.

122
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,208
You're gonna be okay.

123
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,682
I'm gonna stabilize
that leg, sir.

124
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:00,888
Hold on a second.

125
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,258
Sir, please put that light
on your leg.

126
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,860
What was that?

127
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,228
Just hold still.

128
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,239
What if there's an aftershock?
The whole place could come down.

129
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,041
Just hold still, please, sir.
Just hold still!

130
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,101
Aah!

131
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,603
Just please sit down!

132
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,287
Hey, you guys
can head across the street,

133
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:35,623
and you'll be okay over there.

134
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,626
There mi...

135
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,128
Might be about 40 people
inside in need of treatment

136
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,731
or so... Some kind of
onsite evaluation.

137
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:44,832
Where do you need me?

138
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,905
Back at the hospital. We're
short on surgeons. Okay.

139
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,736
Shaun. Uh...

140
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,505
Lea... was here.

141
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,275
Where is she now?

142
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,911
I don't know. She was inside
when the tanks fell down.

143
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,147
But the first responders
are gonna find her. Shaun?

144
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,595
Jack's in place. Let's lift it.

145
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,102
All right, she's clear.

146
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,737
Melendez.

147
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:26,907
50-year-old woman, medical
history includes spinal tumor resection,

148
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,041
C1-through-3 fusion,

149
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:29,352
complaining of severe back pain.

150
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,510
Hey, where were you hit?

151
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,345
Are you dizzy?
You okay? I'm fine.

152
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,682
A beam fell, hit me on my side,
knocked me down.

153
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:35,983
Let me see.

154
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,618
I'm fine.

155
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,186
Let me see.

156
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,509
I'll lay off working my
obliques at the gym for a bit.

157
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,960
Ow. How much does that hurt?

158
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,295
No more than it should.

159
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,363
You're gonna need
a full evaluation.

160
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,800
I'll go with Marta back to the hospital,
get checked out.

161
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,137
Where was Lea?

162
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,707
In the Brew Hall,
and it's completely blocked in.

163
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,042
Glassman and I already tried.

164
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,543
The danger of spinal fracture...

165
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:06,217
Let's get a real cervical collar
on her and get her onto the board.

166
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,348
Stop!

167
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,028
Don't touch her.

168
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,565
You winced when they
touched your neck.

169
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,200
Did your right hand hurt?

170
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,401
Yeah.

171
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,370
Like it was on fire.

172
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,805
It's not just a fracture.

173
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,107
Something is pressing
on her spinal cord.

174
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,443
Even the move to the board
could shift the object,

175
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,011
leading to permanent paralysis.

176
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,715
I need to find Lea.

177
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,518
Get the battery-powered X-ray.

178
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,087
Okay.

179
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,703
Lucky there weren't
more books on that shelf.

180
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:54,995
Bay one.

181
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,396
500 milligrams IV acetaminophen,

182
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,509
and page Calderon in pedes.

183
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,468
Reznick, no. You had surgery
on your hands 48 hours ago.

184
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:02,936
I don't need them to triage.

185
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,404
We need a surgeon over here.

186
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,539
Construction worker. Through
and through impalement.

187
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:07,693
Point of entry's his pelvis.

188
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,610
BP 111 over 84.

189
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:11,779
Pulse 107 BPMs.

190
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,113
Pupils? Ignore her.

191
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,614
Normal and reactive.

192
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,216
Right now she's a patient,
not a doctor.

193
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,284
Motor exam?

194
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,186
Normal. All right. Thanks.

195
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,921
I'm concerned
about the iliac artery.

196
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,198
You should check
his femoral pulse.

197
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,556
I was planning to.

198
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,492
Okay, okay, okay.

199
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,594
Right leg is strong.

200
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,929
Left is thready.

201
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,264
Ultrasound his leg to confirm.
His abdomen, too.

202
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,698
Look for additional
damaged vessels.

203
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,503
Then take him to OR 2
and page Cohen.

204
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,505
There could be
a lot of vascular injuries.

205
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,674
You should do his surgery
while I help with triage.

206
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,744
Dr. Reznick, I don't need
or want your help.

207
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,346
You have a habit
of withholding key details

208
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,916
from your attendings
as it benefits you.

209
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,450
Go to bed.

210
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,359
Lea?

211
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,128
Lea, can you hear me?

212
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,798
Help. Think I'm stuck.

213
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,810
Shaun, we need you on triage.
Let the professionals...

214
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:07,901
Sh... Okay.

215
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,102
Help.

216
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,304
Under here.

217
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,273
Someone is down there.

218
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,944
Someone's down there,
but it's not Lea.

219
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,914
We need fire and rescue
over here!

220
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:22,249
Coming now!

221
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,283
Shaun!

222
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,995
It's right up against
the spinal canal.

223
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,565
It's the C2 screws we used to fuse
the vertebrae once the tumor was out.

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,568
That doctor was right?

225
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,970
I could end up paralyzed?

226
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,006
I'm afraid so.

227
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,410
So,
what are we gonna do about that?

228
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,685
We could remove the screw here.

229
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,690
No. You can't operate
on my wife's spine

230
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,158
in the middle of all this.

231
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,560
It would have its risks,

232
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,163
significantly more
than most surgeries,

233
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,331
but Dr. Browne's right.

234
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,168
If we don't
remove the screw here,

235
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,602
it's very likely that you'll be
paralyzed from the neck down.

236
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,210
Take it out.

237
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:34,988
Lea?

238
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,492
Lea?

239
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,894
Are you there?

240
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,865
Can you hear me?

241
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:45,899
Lea? LEA: Please help!

242
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,271
Lea, it's me!

243
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,073
Lea, it's Shaun! It's...

244
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:57,577
Lea?

245
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,279
Shaun, help!

246
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,380
Okay.

247
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,296
Hey! This area needs to be
stabilized before any medical personnel...

248
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,321
Lea!

249
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,439
I think I'm stuck.

250
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,625
Okay.

251
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,500
Lea. I'm coming.

252
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,162
Okay.

253
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:31,838
Aah!

254
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,182
I am not afraid.

255
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,689
I am... not afraid.

256
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,660
I'm not afraid.

257
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,866
Of course you are.

258
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,038
You know why?

259
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,706
Because this is stupid scary.

260
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,714
Dispatch rerouted us to
Good Sam for some reason.

261
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,284
Put us on diversion. Too many
trauma patients, too few surgeons.

262
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,228
Now you got two more patients
and one more surgeon.

263
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,420
Which procedure do you want?

264
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,422
Pelvic fracture can wait. Bay 7.

265
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,590
I'm overseeing the ER.

266
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,393
Someone has to.
Doesn't have to be you.

267
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,530
Morgan texted me.
She's offered to help.

268
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:32,332
Hands-free.

269
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,934
I'll handle the ER.
You two go cut.

270
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,612
Who's gonna actually treat
the patients? Siri?

271
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,706
The nurses. I'll tell them what to
do and then oversee every move.

272
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,941
Running this place
isn't a job for a third-year,

273
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,876
even on days
without an earthquake.

274
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,950
Well, we've had an earthquake.
There are no options.

275
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,948
Morgan. You be careful
with those hands.

276
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,417
You could screw them up
for good.

277
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,518
Understood.

278
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,686
Petringa! OR 3.

279
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,463
What were you doing
in a brewery, anyway?

280
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,066
I was just sitting at the bar,
having a beer.

281
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,267
Now I'm trapped under it.

282
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,335
You're not 21.

283
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:09,636
I'd show you my ID,

284
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,904
but my pockets are
kind of underground right now.

285
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:14,341
We should let your
parents know where you are.

286
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,643
I'm fine. It doesn't even hurt.

287
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,254
I think you should have
someone here... Mom, Dad.

288
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,379
My mom's dead.

289
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,783
And my dad's on a plane.

290
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,654
Do you know the flight number?
We can get word to him.

291
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,968
If my son was in your situation,
I'd want to be there,

292
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,828
no matter what else was
going on or how he got there.

293
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,199
My dad already thinks
I'm a screw-up.

294
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,969
And this doesn't exactly
disprove that.

295
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,775
Just get this thing off me.

296
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,480
Call me a bitch.

297
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,317
Call me a bitch.

298
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,821
We are gonna clear this ER

299
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,023
and get the hospital
off trauma diversion.

300
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,169
With a patient in every bed
and one doctor with zero hands?

301
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,527
Actually, I've got eight.

302
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,829
You guys are gonna do
exactly what I tell you.

303
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,307
I ask you to probe
2 inches to the left,

304
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,133
I don't mean 1.5 inches or 1.7.

305
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,667
I have you debride a wound,

306
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,203
that's three Betadine swabs,
not two.

307
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,004
I don't care what shortcuts
you've picked up.

308
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,839
I will not say please.
It is a wasted word.

309
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,142
I will not say thank you.
I will be moving on.

310
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,295
I will be a bitch, so you
may as well call me one now.

311
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,879
Bitch.

312
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,516
You're a bitch. Bitch.

313
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,983
As a feminist,
I'm really not com...

314
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,085
Say it. Bitch.

315
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,620
Nice.

316
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,088
Let's get to work.

317
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,792
You should be up there
doing your job,

318
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,027
not down here.

319
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,231
Lea needs me.

320
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,265
No, she doesn't.

321
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,971
You think rescuing her will
make her fall in love with you.

322
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,005
It won't.

323
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,211
You're... being...

324
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,915
You always said I could do...

325
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,252
Because I believed in you.

326
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,986
Right now, I don't.

327
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,658
She doesn't love you.
She told you.

328
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,261
She thinks you're limited.

329
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:16,896
You are.

330
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,637
You're not her hero.

331
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,316
Please help!

332
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,236
We need a central line,
endotracheal tube,

333
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,938
bag mask, portable oxygen,
anesthesia...

334
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,108
We've got midazolam.

335
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,981
That combined with
a morphine drip should work.

336
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,945
Okay. Noreen?

337
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,814
Don't do this surgery. Please.

338
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,452
I-I can't lose her.
Not this soon.

339
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,522
M-Marta was with her husband.

340
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:18,057
She was miserable.
She didn't know...

341
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,659
We're not the ones
you need to persuade.

342
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,466
Sorry.

343
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,072
I will push your wheelchair.

344
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,708
I'll wipe your mouth,
whatever you need.

345
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,680
And be glad
for every minute of it

346
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:41,981
because...

347
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,485
You will still be alive.

348
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,156
And we'll still be
on our adventure.

349
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,662
Five years.

350
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,497
That's...

351
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,965
That's just not enough.

352
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:02,635
So greedy.

353
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,371
Marta, please.

354
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,978
Thank you for being willing
to take care of me...

355
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,012
Again.

356
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,550
Five years isn't enough.

357
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,522
However long I have with you
will never be enough.

358
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:25,858
I only found you

359
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,395
once I stopped listening
to my fear...

360
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,797
Fear of hurting my husband...

361
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,368
Being thrown out of the church,

362
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,703
of dying alone.

363
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,676
Pushing all that aside
made room for you,

364
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,013
and you are my life.

365
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,354
Dr. Melendez saved me once.

366
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,189
He's gonna do it again.

367
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,328
Be brave with me.

368
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,161
Okay.

369
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:04,156
You found me.

370
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:08,428
Mm.

371
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,238
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

372
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,473
I'm here to help you.

373
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:29,849
What's your name?

374
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,018
Vera.

375
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,687
Where does it hurt, Vera?

376
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:36,055
Everywhere.

377
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,724
But mostly the shoulder.

378
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,628
Mm.

379
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:42,895
Okay.

380
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,337
Take a deep breath, please.

381
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:57,877
Your lungs are fine.

382
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,648
Can you feel your hands?

383
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:02,715
Yes.

384
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:05,051
That means
you have no nerve damage.

385
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,019
It missed your vital organs.

386
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:10,156
I can remove it without
risking permanent injury.

387
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,858
That's good news.

388
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,367
This is bad.

389
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:29,642
When I cut, brace this.

390
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,944
Her neck cannot move at all.

391
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,622
Making initial midline
incision to posterior neck.

392
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:52,307
It's gonna take some
time before we can move that bar.

393
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:53,666
That's fine.

394
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,211
We need to get a sense of the
kid's injuries before you do anything.

395
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:58,571
I need to get under there
and take a look.

396
00:23:58,605 --> 00:23:59,806
Follow me.

397
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,109
Asthma and dust inhalation.

398
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,944
Bad combination.

399
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:06,713
Take deep breaths.

400
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,050
Higher.

401
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,752
Higher.

402
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:13,953
Where her lungs are.

403
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,586
You're the one that
can hear them. There.

404
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:17,690
Deeper.

405
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:22,962
Trying. Just can't.

406
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,068
That's probably because
your lungs are hyperinflated.

407
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,903
Start nebulizer albuterol
and oxygen,

408
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:32,171
eight liters per minute.

409
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,874
Why are you using
plaster of Paris?

410
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:36,485
You told me cast her arm.
You didn't tell me...

411
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:39,779
To use fiberglass, which takes half
the time and is twice as effective?

412
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,093
I wasn't aware that I had to
instruct you on common sense.

413
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,283
Bitch.

414
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,801
Can I speak to Dr. Lim, please?

415
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:06,673
Shaun, where are you?

416
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:09,776
I found a woman with
shoulder and leg impalements.

417
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,644
I'm going to extract
the shoulder,

418
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:14,681
but freeing the leg could
sever the posterior tibial artery.

419
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:15,815
That sounds bad.

420
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:16,949
You would die.

421
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:18,450
What's the leg impaled on?

422
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:22,054
Mm, it appears to be
steel rebar.

423
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,422
We'll send down a firefighter.

424
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,659
Once they've sawed through the rebar,
they'll transport her up.

425
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:29,028
And keep this channel open
so I can hear you.

426
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,069
Have they found Lea?

427
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:39,639
No. They're still searching.

428
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:44,644
Okay.

429
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,528
Hey, Aaron, can you head back
to the ER when you finish here?

430
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:06,198
Not unless you can take the
transected aorta being prepped in OR 3.

431
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,901
I got a myocardial contusion
and tamponade in 2.

432
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:10,837
Ceiling fan
fell on this guy's chest.

433
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,904
Ow.

434
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,305
See you on the other side.

435
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,241
Yeah.

436
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,684
We've got a bleed. Clamp.

437
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:29,164
The hardware tore
a muscular branch

438
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,388
of her right vertebral artery.

439
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,311
I can't find the bleed
without suction.

440
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,562
I see it.

441
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,746
Her vitals are stable,
but she's lost too much blood.

442
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:44,937
We can't keep cutting till
we give her a transfusion.

443
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:47,173
Check all local hospitals
and blood banks.

444
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:48,606
See who can get us
O-negative, stat.

445
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,946
There might be another way
to transfuse her.

446
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,024
So, I'm 16, in my dad's car,

447
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,893
a dime bag in my pocket,

448
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,661
and a cop approaching.

449
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:09,762
Did you get arrested?

450
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,030
Hey, let me tell the story.

451
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,307
It's got a beginning,
middle, and end.

452
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:14,266
I want the end. It's
better with the middle.

453
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,403
We, uh, roll down the window,

454
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:19,505
and the cop is hit
with a cloud of smoke.

455
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,073
She makes us get out,

456
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,075
pats us both down,
searches the whole car...

457
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:27,279
Uh, I'll be right back.

458
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,313
Oh, wait. Come on, come on.
Don't leave me hanging.

459
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:30,683
Come on.

460
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:31,784
She didn't find anything.

461
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:32,985
All right.

462
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,954
Our bodies
can do amazing things,

463
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,255
even hide dime bags.

464
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,925
Holy crap! No way!
Did you still smoke it?

465
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,260
I'll be right back.

466
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:43,562
Oh, man, you did! Euggh!

467
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,331
How bad is it?

468
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,001
His spine's been severed.

469
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,240
He's lost a lot of blood.

470
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:55,607
No femoral pulses.

471
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,910
His legs are ice cold.

472
00:27:57,944 --> 00:28:00,546
The bar's basically
cross-clamping his abdominal aorta.

473
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:05,222
He's gonna bleed out
when we lift the bar.

474
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,387
Yeah.

475
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:18,330
No, there's gotta be
something we can do.

476
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,499
We can get his dad here
before it's too late.

477
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,177
Inject five CCs bupivacaine,

478
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,845
wait 20 minutes,
then pull it out.

479
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:37,850
You here for me
to discharge our asthmatic?

480
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:39,318
No, she's gotten worse.

481
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,387
And she's complaining
about back pain.

482
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,155
She said she fell
during the earthquake.

483
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:44,556
Symptom explained.

484
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,492
Those sutures need to be
closer together.

485
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,127
Add budesonide to her nebulizer.

486
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,204
That should help her breathing.

487
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,428
I think she might be pregnant.

488
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,865
Shortness of breath
plus back pain

489
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,334
could be UTI, kidney stones,
or pregnancy.

490
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,436
Urine dip ruled out
UTI and kidney stones.

491
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,671
So her symptoms have nothing
to do with the earthquake?

492
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:00,773
It's possible.

493
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,544
How can you be
both slow and sloppy?

494
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,780
This is my first time
doing sutures.

495
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:09,882
Finish up
so I can discharge him.

496
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,717
Stop with the zebra hunting.

497
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,619
Put her on budesonide
and clear the bed.

498
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,554
I asked you to be my hands,
not my brain.

499
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,622
Dr. Reznick.

500
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:19,091
I'm over the bitch plan,
after three years of it.

501
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,259
We're in crisis.

502
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,627
That you are using
to rehabilitate

503
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,330
your reputation with Andrews,
which is fine.

504
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,765
But stop biting the hands
that are your hands.

505
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:37,609
What are you doing?

506
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:40,079
Sterilizing the instrument.

507
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,848
Do you know someone with cancer?

508
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,983
Um...

509
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46,886
I'm curious why you were at

510
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,288
a fundraiser
for cancer research.

511
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:52,458
I was there for a man.

512
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:55,761
One without cancer

513
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,264
or any interest
in being with me.

514
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,469
My ex-boyfriend is
on the board of the charity.

515
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:06,005
Why did you want to see
your ex-boyfriend?

516
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,140
I guess...

517
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,844
I hoped he'd realize
he was still in love with me

518
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:13,412
and beg me to take him back.

519
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,682
Clever, huh?

520
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:17,884
I understand.

521
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:26,192
I still want Lea
to be my girlfriend.

522
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,762
But she doesn't feel
the same way?

523
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,766
I have autism.

524
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,703
Oh... Shaun, that shouldn't...

525
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:52,718
Why didn't you warn me?

526
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,721
Studies have shown that
anticipation only heightens pain.

527
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,626
I used small talk
to distract you.

528
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,739
Where did you two meet?

529
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,080
Church.

530
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:22,414
I'm not a member anymore.

531
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:27,353
Okay.

532
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,892
Place that
in the surgical cavity.

533
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,229
You made a cell saver
out of a...

534
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:38,364
Beer engine.

535
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,400
I ran alcohol through it
to sterilize it.

536
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:45,271
Attach this to an IV.

537
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,342
We are gonna pump
her own blood back into her.

538
00:31:57,984 --> 00:31:59,385
Hey, we got somebody down here!

539
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,888
Can you hear us? We're coming!

540
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,962
Lea. Are you okay?

541
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:11,597
I-I think so.

542
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,409
Hey. How long before you guys
get this thing off of me?

543
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,580
We're working on it.

544
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:49,535
You said your dad thinks
you're a screw-up?

545
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:50,902
Has he actually said that?

546
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,273
No.

547
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,946
The reason I told you
that story is

548
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,182
everyone does dumb stuff
when they're a teenager.

549
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,462
I bet your dad doesn't
judge you nearly as harshly

550
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,554
as you think he does.

551
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,892
My dad doesn't know me.

552
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,294
Neither do you.

553
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,001
Can you stay with him?

554
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:37,716
That's... incredible.

555
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,253
Thank you.

556
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:46,192
Spend enough time
around Dr. Browne,

557
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:47,626
you get used to incredible.

558
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,338
Okay. Thank you.

559
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:03,618
There'll be a cruiser
waiting to pick Casey's dad up

560
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:04,802
when he lands in three hours.

561
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,013
What if we compress
Casey's aorta against his spine

562
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,015
and create a higher cross-clamp?

563
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,328
You didn't tell him yet,
did you?

564
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:13,652
No.

565
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:16,622
We could buy time

566
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,724
to repair his aorta
after we lift the bar.

567
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:21,227
Casey's about Kellan's age.

568
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,620
This has nothing to do
with Kellan.

569
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:27,433
Yes, it's... It's a 1% chance
of success if we do this,

570
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:30,068
against a 100% chance of death
if we don't.

571
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:36,542
Okay.

572
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,009
Prep him.

573
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,186
When will we know
if she's gonna be okay?

574
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,554
When she wakes up.

575
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:51,923
And there's still
a risk of infection.

576
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:54,193
Let's get her stabilized
and out of here.

577
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,034
I'm administering the budesonide

578
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,736
and checking to see
if she's pregnant.

579
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,407
I told her I'm on the pill.

580
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,741
Ever miss a day?

581
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:16,114
Look at that.
An unoccupied uterus.

582
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:17,483
Prep her for discharge.

583
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:20,252
Can you give me something
for my back pain?

584
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:22,130
It's bruised from when
you fell in the earthquake.

585
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:23,789
Take some Tylenol.

586
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,090
Uh, it's been bad all week.

587
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,359
Muscle relaxers usually help.

588
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:31,797
Check her tubes.

589
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,108
You're pregnant.

590
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,477
The fetus is developing
inside your fallopian tube.

591
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:48,414
It's called an ectopic
pregnancy. It's not viable.

592
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,716
That's a relief.

593
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,285
But if your fallopian tube
ruptures,

594
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,821
it can cause a serious,
possibly fatal, bleed.

595
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,923
So we'll get you into surgery
as soon as possible

596
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,258
to make sure
that doesn't happen.

597
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:07,499
It's gonna be fine.

598
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,808
If we get out of this alive,

599
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:19,745
let's promise to move on.

600
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:24,816
You can do better than Lea.

601
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:29,788
Not that I have any business
suggesting that.

602
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:32,291
I might die because
I'm still hung up on Paul.

603
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:37,696
No.

604
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:41,166
I don't want to move on.

605
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,368
If she doesn't feel like...

606
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:45,737
I always knew
I could be a good doctor.

607
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,109
But until I met Lea,

608
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,412
I never knew
I could drive a car.

609
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,683
Or enjoy music.

610
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,551
Or sing karaoke.

611
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:01,553
Or take tequila shots.

612
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:06,124
Or fall in love.

613
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:17,035
I don't want to stop being
the person I am with her.

614
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:22,574
Lea makes me more.

615
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:35,220
But I don't make her more.

616
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,459
If I did,

617
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:43,895
then Lea would want
to be my girlfriend.

618
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:17,228
She's tachycardic
and hypotensive.

619
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:18,330
Abdomen?

620
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:20,399
Rigid.

621
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,200
Her fallopian tube ruptured.

622
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,646
Any chance he can wait an hour?

623
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,549
Rapidly expanding
subdermal hematoma.

624
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:08,013
It still doesn't hurt.
Can't this wait?

625
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:09,615
We need to fix something
right away.

626
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,282
Okay.

627
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,086
Whatever you gotta do, I guess.

628
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:18,056
Hey, um,

629
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,190
about my dad...

630
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:21,026
The minute he lands,
we'll get him here.

631
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,329
Thank you.

632
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,669
Okay.

633
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,980
She needs a surgeon... Stat.

634
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,351
I'm a surgeon.

635
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,555
Harmonic scalpel,
DeBakey forceps,

636
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:51,322
two Yankauer suctions,
and vasopressin.

637
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:15,046
Marta?

638
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,985
Can you squeeze Noreen's hand?

639
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,024
Let's get you to the hospital.

640
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,197
You two, free beer for life.

641
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:35,366
Whoa.

642
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,868
Watch it! Aftershock!

643
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:39,137
We need to immobilize your leg.

644
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:41,406
Cover your head.

645
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:01,936
All right, get her out of here.

646
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,094
Right.

647
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,333
That was a big one.

648
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,537
Oh! Are you okay?

649
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,472
Yeah.

650
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:16,908
Just a little...
A little motion...

651
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:18,443
Oh!

652
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,650
I need oxygen here now!

653
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,625
You okay?

654
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:36,327
What about our patient?

655
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:37,596
Vitals stable.

656
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,032

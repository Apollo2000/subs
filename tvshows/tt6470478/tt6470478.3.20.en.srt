1
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:10,265
This isn't my usual seat
in a speeding ambulance.

2
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:13,168
You vomited and passed out.

3
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:15,136
You have a three-inch abdominal bruise

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,638
and a big bump on your head,

5
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:18,773
- either of which could...
- You can check it all out tomorrow.

6
00:00:18,797 --> 00:00:20,041
As soon as I'm back at the hospital,

7
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:22,377
I'm going back to treating
patients. They must be on overflow.

8
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:24,846
As soon as we're back at the hospital,
you are getting a CT.

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,015
You could have increasing
intracranial pressure

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,983
from contusions, edema, or a hematoma.

11
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:30,718
I don't.

12
00:00:30,742 --> 00:00:32,854
I'm pretty sure I know
my symptoms better than you do.

13
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:35,123
No headache, no unilateral weakness.

14
00:00:35,147 --> 00:00:38,026
The doctor without
the head injury makes the call.

15
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:47,135
There's the rupture.

16
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,703
The fallopian tube's necrotic.

17
00:00:48,727 --> 00:00:50,638
DeBakey forceps.

18
00:00:53,232 --> 00:00:55,977
BP's stabilizing at 90 over 65.

19
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:57,833
- I'll take the clamp.
- I'm fine. You remove the laps.

20
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,448
It's better if you do it. Less
likely to damage your hands.

21
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:01,946
We need six hands, we've got four,

22
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,484
and you want us to work with two?

23
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:08,311
I need 2-0 chromic catgut.

24
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:11,960
His heart's shifted
from the pressure on his chest.

25
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:14,128
Try retracting it to the right.

26
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:16,806
There's nowhere for it to go.

27
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:21,601
Close him up. We'll have to
go in through his side.

28
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:25,483
That won't be easier.

29
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:28,307
Well, it better be,
'cause this way is impossible.

30
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:35,793
Hello?

31
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:37,347
<i>Yes. Shaun.</i>

32
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:38,429
Lea?

33
00:01:38,453 --> 00:01:39,830
<i>Yeah, it's me. You okay?</i>

34
00:01:39,854 --> 00:01:41,365
Why is it still you?

35
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:42,933
I'm fine. I wanted to stay and help.

36
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:46,083
No, I don't need you, okay?

37
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,471
I need a rescue worker.

38
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:49,140
They're taking in
a lot of scaffolding and stuff

39
00:01:49,164 --> 00:01:50,574
hoping to reinforce the walls.

40
00:01:50,598 --> 00:01:52,209
The water should be a priority.

41
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:53,511
<i>They shut off the main.</i>

42
00:01:53,535 --> 00:01:55,546
They don't know why it's still flowing.

43
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,537
We're gonna drown in about five minutes!

44
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,319
That's not true.

45
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:05,511
At the rate the water is filling,
we have about an hour.

46
00:02:06,547 --> 00:02:08,581
And I could leave.

47
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:22,406

48
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:26,343
I am going to cut the rebar to free you.

49
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:27,745
I didn't do it before

50
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:30,080
because it risks rupturing
your posterior tibial artery,

51
00:02:30,104 --> 00:02:31,321
but now we need to.

52
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:32,511
Take this.

53
00:02:34,808 --> 00:02:36,887
Cutting will intermittently
cause your leg to move,

54
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:39,423
which will cause a lot of pain.

55
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:41,214
Ah.

56
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:50,134
How did you deal with your heartache?

57
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:54,471
- Are you just asking to keep me calm?
- Yes.

58
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:57,141
Distracting you from the
disastrous situation you're in

59
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:59,076
will help keep your blood pressure down.

60
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,878
Oh, and reduce bleeding.

61
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:09,339
Honesty was the problem with my ex.

62
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:14,080
I opened up to him, told him everything.

63
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:16,346
In return...

64
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:17,883
he didn't.

65
00:03:20,153 --> 00:03:21,899
Were you being honest when you said

66
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:24,068
you were going to move on after this?

67
00:03:26,694 --> 00:03:29,473
One upside of being
impaled on rebar underground

68
00:03:29,497 --> 00:03:30,975
in a room slowly filling with water

69
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:33,911
is it focuses your priorities.

70
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:35,379
Yeah.

71
00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:36,702
I'm moving on.

72
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:40,287
If you loved him...

73
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:43,609
maybe you can't.

74
00:03:50,952 --> 00:03:52,574
<i>- I told you.
- What?</i>

75
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:53,964
Be quiet. Be still.

76
00:03:53,988 --> 00:03:55,366
The machine is already past the point

77
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,268
where you would have seen any damage.

78
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:58,469
The fact that you haven't said anything

79
00:03:58,493 --> 00:03:59,703
means you're either trying to figure out

80
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:01,739
how to tell me I'm going to
die or you're trying to figure out

81
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:03,810
how to apologize for wasting my time.

82
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,411
<i>You're right.
I'm glad your brain is fine.</i>

83
00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:09,413
<i>I'm not sorry at all.</i>

84
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:11,048
Appreciate the excessive concern.

85
00:04:11,072 --> 00:04:12,816
Now I can get out of here and to patients

86
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,807
and you can get back
to the winery to help.

87
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:17,143
Brewery.

88
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:19,556
Oh, come on. I misspoke.

89
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,025
Been a bit of a rough day, you hear?

90
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:22,226
There was an earthquake.

91
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,261
I've seen you on a lot of rough days,

92
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:26,230
but not once have I seen you confused.

93
00:04:26,254 --> 00:04:27,853
Move your gown.

94
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:34,794
You're bleeding internally.

95
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:42,849
I need baci irrigation, and then
we can start closing her up.

96
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:45,716
Dr. Reznick.

97
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,051
Please step back, Dr. Andrews.

98
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:49,320
We're trying to keep this area
as sterile as possible.

99
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:51,221
Glad you're aware it's not
an actual operating room

100
00:04:51,245 --> 00:04:52,589
that you seem to be operating in.

101
00:04:52,613 --> 00:04:53,957
There weren't any available.

102
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:55,392
And there weren't any surgeons, either.

103
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,062
- Suction.
- So, you violated Dr. Glassman's order

104
00:04:58,086 --> 00:04:59,263
to not use your hands.

105
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:00,597
Ectopic pregnancy.

106
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:02,599
The fallopian tube ruptured.

107
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:03,934
Patient would have died.

108
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,036
Oh-Maxon sutures.

109
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,338
You could have found another way,

110
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:09,362
but you wanted to be a hero.

111
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:13,844
Get your hands out of the patient

112
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:15,507
and take them to your room.

113
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,063
I'll finish.

114
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:37,418
He has a traumatic dissection

115
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,489
all the way to the ascending aorta.

116
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,173
The clamp would tear through
the vessel wall.

117
00:05:43,197 --> 00:05:44,975
He'd bleed out.

118
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:46,710
And if we clamp proximal to it,

119
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:48,915
he'd lose perfusion to his head.

120
00:05:49,404 --> 00:05:51,042
He'll be brain-dead.

121
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:59,009
You should go back to the hospital.

122
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:00,924
I'll stay with the boy.

123
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:12,349
Who is in charge?

124
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,954
First Andrews,
then Morgan and Andrews again.

125
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,418
She's back in her patient room.
He's in surgery.

126
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:17,131
- All right, what do you got?
- Bay 4.

127
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:19,095
Otherwise healthy 35-year-old
with chest pain.

128
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,340
- High sensitivity troponins back?
- First was negative.

129
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:22,608
Repeat the tropes in an hour.

130
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,143
If there's still no change,
discharge him.

131
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,745
- Yeah.
- Bay 2... 16-year-old.

132
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:26,879
Dresser fell on her leg.

133
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:29,115
- Normal pulse and sensory exam?
- Yes.

134
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,416
It's a non-displaced fracture.

135
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,685
Prep her for a posterior slab
and book a follow-up.

136
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:34,153
Dr. Lim.

137
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,423
Who is this?

138
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:40,326
Dr. Melendez.

139
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,736
Dr. Park.

140
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,160
So, how'd it go?

141
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:56,107
Not good, Casey.

142
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,000
We couldn't fix things.

143
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:03,616
When we take this off you,
you'll start bleeding,

144
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,975
and we won't be able to stop it.

145
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,013
You're gonna die.

146
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,428
No.

147
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:17,230
No, no, no. You're wrong.

148
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:18,798
You gotta... You gotta be wrong.

149
00:07:18,822 --> 00:07:20,633
Man, where's...

150
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:21,667
Where's my dad?

151
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,510
He's on his way.

152
00:07:24,294 --> 00:07:25,705
We're gonna keep you comfortable.

153
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:28,241
I'm not in pain, okay?

154
00:07:28,265 --> 00:07:29,909
You gotta be wrong.

155
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,944
I'm sorry, Casey.

156
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,554
Where's my dad?

157
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:48,694
Mm.

158
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,430
Isn't "moving on" just a euphemism

159
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:53,999
for giving up, for failure?

160
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:57,069
Do you really believe that?

161
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:59,421
Do you think you failed?

162
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:04,143
Accepting... loss

163
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:06,467
makes us stronger.

164
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,467
Refusing to accept failure
makes us not fail.

165
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,232
If we keep fighting
till we succeed, then...

166
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:16,813
Th... That's not true!

167
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,742
It traps us,

168
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:22,772
prevents us from moving on
to other victories.

169
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:32,171
Your hematocrits suggest
you're still bleeding.

170
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:34,091
Appears to be in the retroperitoneum.

171
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:35,882
Probably from the pancreas.

172
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:37,431
If we open you up,

173
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:39,548
it means major resections
and reconstructions,

174
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:42,014
and you could end up
with ostomy or diabetes.

175
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,577
I'm well aware of the risks
of abdominal surgery.

176
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,245
The more conservative approach

177
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:48,481
is an angio for embolization
to stop the bleed.

178
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:51,222
- Less invasive...
- Again, aware.

179
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:53,995
Do the embolization.

180
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,519
In this case,

181
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:57,144
I don't think it's actually safer.

182
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,992
If the bleed isn't from the pancreas,

183
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:01,994
we'll have to keep poking
around till we find it,

184
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:04,730
and it might be too late.

185
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,236
You want to do the surgery instead?

186
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,993
Not really.

187
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:13,773
But Claire's right.

188
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,148
We've been able to get
a satellite hook-up to your dad.

189
00:09:22,172 --> 00:09:23,749
Do you want me to talk to him first?

190
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:25,239
No, I need to talk to him.

191
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:31,557
<i>Son?</i>

192
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:34,994
Dad, I'm sorry.

193
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:39,331
Dad, I'm so sorry.

194
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:40,737
<i>I can't hear you. Say that again.</i>

195
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:41,982
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

196
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:45,004
Dad, it's... it's my fault, okay? I...

197
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:47,907
<i>Can you hear me? Just be strong, okay?</i>

198
00:09:47,931 --> 00:09:49,375
- Dad!
- <i>Casey!</i>

199
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,709
Dad!

200
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:55,948
Get him back.

201
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:58,117
The plane's caught in a storm.

202
00:09:58,141 --> 00:09:59,907
- I don't know if it'll...
- Get him back.

203
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,528
Divide the gastro-colic
ligament and expose the pancreas.

204
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,930
It's a branch of the superior
mesenteric artery that's torn,

205
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:15,932
not his pancreas. Good call.

206
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:17,731
I need to resect the devitalized tissue

207
00:10:17,755 --> 00:10:19,140
to get a healthy anastomosis.

208
00:10:19,164 --> 00:10:21,429
We need clamps
and 6-0 vicryls on Castros.

209
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:26,127
Dr. Lim?

210
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:32,947
Above the SMA, the small bowel...

211
00:10:41,111 --> 00:10:44,419
There are three ways
to stop a bleeding vessel...

212
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:48,816
clamp, cauterize, or repair.

213
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:51,609
Since this vessel is made of steel,

214
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:53,867
clamping requires a 60-ton press,

215
00:10:53,892 --> 00:10:58,266
and cauterization requires
an oxyacetylene torch.

216
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,149
I don't need to stop the water.

217
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:05,720
Just slow it down.

218
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:10,184
You're good at a-adapting to challenges.

219
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,905
Yes, I am.

220
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:14,770
Blindly keeping on sawing
wasn't gonna work.

221
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,142
No.

222
00:11:16,486 --> 00:11:18,352
But it wasn't a failure.

223
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:23,064
Because cutting the rebar
wasn't your goal.

224
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:24,959
Saving me was your goal.

225
00:11:26,195 --> 00:11:29,839
And your goal isn't Lea.

226
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,440
It's love.

227
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:17,719
I think the scar
will work with the tattoos.

228
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:21,916
The bleed wasn't from the pancreas.

229
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,384
It was from the SMA.

230
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,486
But we found additional injuries

231
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,076
all the way to the celiac trunk.

232
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:29,023
Ischemic bowel?

233
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:31,025
Early stages.

234
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:34,462
We have restored full blood flow
and reperfused.

235
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:36,086
I'm sure the bowel is gonna be just fine.

236
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,574
How sure?

237
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:39,601
What's my lactate?

238
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:44,092
Four.

239
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:48,136
Means there's already been
some failure of the bowel wall.

240
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:52,623
We're going to re-test your lactate.

241
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,881
And I'm sure it'll have gone down.

242
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:57,240
But if it's gone up, it means
ischemia is progressing,

243
00:12:57,265 --> 00:12:59,429
and there'll be more bacterial leakage.

244
00:13:00,424 --> 00:13:03,692
Which in turn will mean septic shock...

245
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:07,423
...past the point of treatment.

246
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:12,841
We're not there yet.

247
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,541
Let him know it's still gonna be a while.

248
00:13:26,077 --> 00:13:27,389
How long is a while?

249
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:28,690
Sorry. I don't know.

250
00:13:28,714 --> 00:13:30,592
He says they're gonna drown
in 15 minutes.

251
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:32,961
Is "a while" more
or less than 15 minutes?

252
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:36,131
That last tremor made things too
unstable to send my crew down.

253
00:13:36,155 --> 00:13:37,799
You're supposed to be saving lives.

254
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:40,157
<i>You're</i> supposed to be the heroes.

255
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:44,106
If you let me,
what I'm gonna do right now

256
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,108
is help my crew
get in more braces, scaffolding,

257
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:47,175
and heavy machinery.

258
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,144
What you need to do right now

259
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:51,313
is convince Dr. Murphy
to get out of there.

260
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:58,196
Talk to me, Casey.

261
00:13:58,744 --> 00:14:00,322
I'm... I'm tired.

262
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:02,858
Let's just... talk.

263
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:05,026
Why do you need to
apologize to your father?

264
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,517
What do you think you did?

265
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:11,533
Whatever it is, there's
nothing you could have done

266
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:13,702
that he's gonna be mad about right now.

267
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:15,559
You don't know anything.

268
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:20,218
I know how a father feels.

269
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,098
I know no matter how mad
or how ugly things get,

270
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:28,150
we don't stop loving our children.

271
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:35,791
I killed my mother.

272
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:43,031
You need to get out.

273
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:45,000
- Soon.
<i>- Not soon, Shaun.</i>

274
00:14:45,024 --> 00:14:46,701
You need to get out now. It's not stable.

275
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:48,492
Vera can't leave.

276
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:53,041
The firefighters told me
they're making great headway,

277
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:55,076
<i>and they'll be able to save Vera soon,</i>

278
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,545
<i>but you need to get out of the way.</i>

279
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:05,921
Are you lying?

280
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:19,367
You need to go, Shaun.

281
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:27,464
If I leave, you die.

282
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:30,579
If you stay,

283
00:15:30,603 --> 00:15:32,469
we both die.

284
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,920
You can't cut through the rebar in time.

285
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:57,272
I can't cut through the rebar.

286
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:07,082
But I <i>can cut through your leg.</i>

287
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:16,080
At the civil war, there was a doctor

288
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:18,451
who could amputate limbs
in under three minutes,

289
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:20,253
which kept blood loss and pain
to a minimum,

290
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:22,589
thus reducing the effect of shock.

291
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:24,023
Our scalpels are sharper,

292
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:26,392
so I can slice through
the skin and muscle faster,

293
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:30,163
and I only sawed the rebar
with the top half of the saw.

294
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:31,898
So the bottom half is still pristine

295
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:33,633
to get through the bone.

296
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:35,323
Do you consent to the procedure?

297
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:39,927
No.

298
00:16:41,464 --> 00:16:43,569
I have one condition.

299
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:46,679
You have to promise me

300
00:16:46,703 --> 00:16:48,658
that if I don't make it,

301
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:51,319
you'll move on.

302
00:16:55,912 --> 00:16:58,157
You deserve to find love.

303
00:16:58,181 --> 00:17:00,128
You need to.

304
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:05,398
You're down here risking
your life for me, right?

305
00:17:05,422 --> 00:17:09,824
Well, this is me risking my life for you.

306
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:14,100
Promise me you'll move on, Shaun.

307
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:16,360
Promise.

308
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,888
I promise.

309
00:17:32,182 --> 00:17:34,527
<i>Let's do this.</i>

310
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:42,920
The year before med school,

311
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:46,132
I took six months off,

312
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:49,764
backpacked across Southeast Asia.

313
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,639
Hostels were three bucks a night.

314
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:56,475
Beer was 50 cents.

315
00:17:58,175 --> 00:18:01,105
And I found this little island
in Thailand,

316
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:03,691
Koh Lanta.

317
00:18:04,347 --> 00:18:07,315
Nothing but bamboo huts and palm trees.

318
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:11,073
Stayed eight days.

319
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:13,826
Read "Moby Dick."

320
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,891
Fell in love.

321
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:24,128
How high?

322
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:28,883
High.

323
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:35,473
8.1.

324
00:18:46,189 --> 00:18:48,923
The place is probably
overrun with tourists now.

325
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:55,117
She had an accident.

326
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:58,900
Nothing, really.
Mom didn't even report it.

327
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:04,518
But it was big enough
to mess with her neck.

328
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:06,452
A lot of pain.

329
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:09,122
But she was dealing with it.

330
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,692
I thought.

331
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:14,916
She became dependent on the pills?

332
00:19:16,852 --> 00:19:19,098
Going through her purse,

333
00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:21,890
looking to steal
a couple bucks for the movies...

334
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:27,440
...found three half-full
prescription bottles.

335
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:29,142
Same drug.

336
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,932
What did you do?

337
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:35,670
Nothing.

338
00:19:38,774 --> 00:19:41,921
I didn't say anything to her or my dad.

339
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:46,381
I-I-I didn't know what to say.

340
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:54,289
Three weeks later, she OD'd in her sleep.

341
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:58,514
He would've gotten her help.

342
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:09,971
I need to tell him.

343
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:14,989
You will.

344
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:17,156
I promise.

345
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:32,738
When I was a second-year resident,

346
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:35,864
I was assigned
to a Dr. Wilmet Fortingale.

347
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:40,446
Full of himself, sarcastic, thin-skinned.

348
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:44,310
Our first case together,

349
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:46,729
I saw he screwed up.

350
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,754
And I called him on it.

351
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:50,556
He lit into me.

352
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,593
What kind of ego I must have,

353
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:56,863
what little regard I must have
for my superiors,

354
00:20:56,887 --> 00:21:00,451
how hard it must be for me
to trust anyone in my life.

355
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:03,788
Two days later, the M&M,

356
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:06,082
guess who screwed up.

357
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,674
Me.

358
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:11,277
When you're a resident,

359
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:13,437
you think you know everything.

360
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:19,136
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:19,676 --> 00:21:22,477
I should've told you about my diagnosis.

362
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:26,281
- It's hard.
- Yeah.

363
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:29,695
And what that showed me is
that you don't respect protocol

364
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:33,901
and you don't respect
your superiors, your patients.

365
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:37,125
The only thing you care about
is your own career.

366
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:42,931
And again, I was wrong.

367
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:48,374
What you did today
for your patient was remarkable.

368
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:53,141
You made it clear that
saving lives is your first priority.

369
00:21:58,548 --> 00:22:00,261
Unfortunately...

370
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,997
...it may have cost you
your career as a surgeon.

371
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:08,990
You've traumatized
your joint capsule incisions.

372
00:22:10,392 --> 00:22:11,714
I'm sorry.

373
00:22:23,572 --> 00:22:25,473
I'm not afraid to die.

374
00:22:27,977 --> 00:22:30,124
I was raised a good Catholic...

375
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:32,626
altar boy,

376
00:22:33,116 --> 00:22:34,849
First Communion...

377
00:22:36,452 --> 00:22:38,831
...faithfully wore my silver crucifix

378
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:41,456
that Tía Abebe gave me for Confirmation.

379
00:22:43,592 --> 00:22:45,626
I was a true believer.

380
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,084
Then I went to college.

381
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,147
And maybe it's just now that I'm...

382
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,807
staring into the yawning void,

383
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,906
I'm hedging my bet, but...

384
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:03,866
...it's coming back to me.

385
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:10,477
Like an old friend with a warm hug.

386
00:23:33,096 --> 00:23:35,203
I want you to know that I...

387
00:23:35,228 --> 00:23:36,595
Don't.

388
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:44,198
You should go.

389
00:23:46,254 --> 00:23:48,722
This place still has a crisis going on.

390
00:24:02,305 --> 00:24:03,938
Goodbye, Claire.

391
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,408
Goodbye.

392
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:17,731
96.1.

393
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,536
That's okay.

394
00:24:21,557 --> 00:24:24,192
Feels way colder than 96.

395
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:28,742
Feels like...

396
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:31,287
f-fifty-six.

397
00:24:33,643 --> 00:24:34,842
46.

398
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,139
36.

399
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:39,697
Casey.

400
00:24:39,722 --> 00:24:41,839
- 26.
- Casey.

401
00:24:42,546 --> 00:24:44,345
Hey, stay with me just a little longer.

402
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:46,848
I can't give you any more epi.

403
00:24:48,004 --> 00:24:49,638
Casey?

404
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:04,753
Dad?

405
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,121
Yeah.

406
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:16,623
I'm right here.

407
00:25:21,858 --> 00:25:23,291
You had morphine?

408
00:25:23,316 --> 00:25:26,317
I saved it in case I needed to do this.

409
00:25:26,342 --> 00:25:28,042
Good thinking not telling me.

410
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:30,401
- Yes.
- The upside?

411
00:25:30,426 --> 00:25:32,592
In three minutes,
I'm gonna lose 10 pounds.

412
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:36,386
I'd say only 8, unless
you count blood loss and...

413
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:37,610
Do you take everything literally?

414
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:39,135
No.

415
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:40,179
Lea,

416
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:44,081
<i>I need you to count off
the seconds from 1 to 180.</i>

417
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:48,159
<i>I want to know how close I am
to three minutes.</i>

418
00:25:48,183 --> 00:25:50,244
How will that help you?

419
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:52,560
I don't think it will.

420
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,650
But it may help distract you
from the screaming.

421
00:25:56,618 --> 00:25:58,119
<i>- Ready?
- N-No!</i>

422
00:26:00,469 --> 00:26:02,335
Just do it, for God's sakes!

423
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:20,986
One...

424
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:23,565
...two...

425
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,479
three...

426
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:31,156
I want to go back in.

427
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:34,145
If we resect more bowel
and do a trauma Whipple, I...

428
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:35,480
A trauma Whipple?

429
00:26:35,504 --> 00:26:37,215
It's a big surgery.

430
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:38,583
Okay, a huge surgery,

431
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:40,685
and there's obviously no guarantee

432
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:42,185
and lots of complications,

433
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:44,689
- but if we act now, I feel like we...
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

434
00:26:44,713 --> 00:26:46,324
Let's just hold on for one second.

435
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:48,983
First of all, we are talking
about Melendez, correct?

436
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,342
Secondly...

437
00:26:50,674 --> 00:26:51,950
we do know the numbers.

438
00:26:51,974 --> 00:26:53,387
They're terrible.

439
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:56,575
And maybe so's this idea,
but that's how this works.

440
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,243
You shoot down mine, I shoot down yours

441
00:26:58,267 --> 00:27:00,334
until we come up with a viable solution.

442
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:05,754
Okay, here goes.

443
00:27:05,778 --> 00:27:09,021
The mesenteric bypass already failed.

444
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:12,146
His lactates have more than
doubled, from 4 to 8.1.

445
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,018
Any significant revascularization

446
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:15,928
is already out of the question.

447
00:27:15,952 --> 00:27:19,538
By some miracle
he were to survive the surgery,

448
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:24,603
he'd be tube-fed,
a diabetic with an ostomy bag,

449
00:27:24,627 --> 00:27:26,805
waiting for a liver transplant.

450
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,176
Your turn.

451
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,514
It's time to stop being a doctor.

452
00:27:37,813 --> 00:27:39,283
Be a friend.

453
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,028
Dad, I knew.

454
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:55,949
I-I knew about Mom.

455
00:27:56,692 --> 00:27:59,093
I-I knew about the drugs.

456
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:05,584
I should have told you.

457
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:11,924
I knew, too.

458
00:28:17,346 --> 00:28:19,014
Of course I knew.

459
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:21,975
When you love someone,

460
00:28:22,432 --> 00:28:24,732
you know when something's wrong.

461
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,216
But, Dad, if you knew...

462
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,653
I did what I thought I could.

463
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:35,864
Sometimes...

464
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:39,785
you can help them, but...

465
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:43,789
sometimes there's
just nothing anyone can do.

466
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:48,585
And <i>we</i> were the adults.

467
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,111
It was our problem, our responsibility,

468
00:28:51,136 --> 00:28:53,632
never yours, Casey.

469
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,595
It was <i>never</i> your fault.

470
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:11,376
<i>...67...</i>

471
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,681
<i>...68, 69, 70...</i>

472
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:17,416
I made it to the bone.

473
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,451
<i>...71... 72...</i>

474
00:29:19,475 --> 00:29:21,618
You need to stay conscious, Vera!

475
00:29:21,642 --> 00:29:23,440
<i>...74...</i>

476
00:29:23,464 --> 00:29:25,090
75.

477
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,027
<i>Keep counting!</i>

478
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:31,169
Uh, 80... 81...

479
00:29:34,422 --> 00:29:36,468
I'm sorry.

480
00:29:36,492 --> 00:29:38,568
I should've been able to do more.

481
00:29:38,593 --> 00:29:40,637
Faster, better.

482
00:29:42,123 --> 00:29:44,182
I know you want to find blame.

483
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:47,978
If there's blame, there's a reason.

484
00:29:48,863 --> 00:29:50,463
Sometimes...

485
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:55,676
...there just isn't.

486
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:02,483
It pisses me off, too.

487
00:30:06,232 --> 00:30:09,708
I could have spent a lifetime
drinking whiskey with you.

488
00:30:12,793 --> 00:30:15,213
I was even starting to like it neat.

489
00:30:23,105 --> 00:30:25,015
What did we do?

490
00:30:27,348 --> 00:30:28,685
No blame.

491
00:30:47,363 --> 00:30:51,877
<i>...150... 151... 152... 153...</i>

492
00:30:56,429 --> 00:30:57,665
<i>...154...</i>

493
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,133
Vera! Vera!

494
00:31:00,722 --> 00:31:03,957
Exhale! Breathe out!

495
00:31:05,974 --> 00:31:10,242
<i>...172... 173... 174...</i>

496
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:11,667
<i>...one-seventy...</i>

497
00:31:16,653 --> 00:31:19,454
...179...180.

498
00:31:22,205 --> 00:31:23,871
That's three minutes, Shaun!

499
00:31:29,714 --> 00:31:31,347
Shaun?

500
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:34,187
Shaun?

501
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,970
Shaun, can you hear me?

502
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:39,295
Shaun!

503
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,718
Dad, it's so cold.

504
00:31:43,185 --> 00:31:44,636
I know.

505
00:31:45,054 --> 00:31:46,513
I'm sorry.

506
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,473
We should go snowboarding.

507
00:31:50,464 --> 00:31:52,032
If you teach me one of your tricks.

508
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:54,824
You'd break your leg.

509
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:56,282
Mom would kill me.

510
00:31:57,564 --> 00:31:58,764
Good point.

511
00:32:08,862 --> 00:32:10,954
I love you, Dad.

512
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:21,316
I love you, too.

513
00:33:09,324 --> 00:33:11,335
His father's in the squad car.

514
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,460
We have him on the line now.

515
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,002
Let's get this bar off him.

516
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:25,487
Mr. Taylor. I'm Dr. Park.

517
00:33:29,214 --> 00:33:30,780
Lea?

518
00:33:33,968 --> 00:33:35,068
It's time to go.

519
00:33:35,617 --> 00:33:37,541
I can't.

520
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:39,626
There's nothing left to do.

521
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,378
We should get you checked out.

522
00:33:44,485 --> 00:33:46,424
<i>We've got something.</i>

523
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,610
Hey, you need a helmet!

524
00:33:58,506 --> 00:33:59,739
Hey.

525
00:33:59,764 --> 00:34:01,231
Hey.

526
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:06,945
I heard the A's
picked up another reliever.

527
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,155
Yeah.

528
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:11,805
Mm.

529
00:34:13,726 --> 00:34:15,159
I keep thinking, what's gonna happen

530
00:34:15,184 --> 00:34:16,955
to the next Theresa Adams?

531
00:34:17,612 --> 00:34:18,778
Remember her?

532
00:34:22,116 --> 00:34:23,584
Gallbladder.

533
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:25,275
Or so we thought.

534
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,336
We get in there, it's completely healthy.

535
00:34:27,361 --> 00:34:29,467
I blame it on lousy imaging.

536
00:34:30,572 --> 00:34:32,899
You call a duodenal ulcer
blocking the duct.

537
00:34:32,924 --> 00:34:34,347
Saved her life.

538
00:34:38,853 --> 00:34:40,478
Just so you know...

539
00:34:43,725 --> 00:34:45,984
...you're the best I ever worked with.

540
00:34:54,562 --> 00:34:57,464
A bottle of Macallan
says they win the division.

541
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:02,918
25 or 17?

542
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,211
25.

543
00:35:05,388 --> 00:35:08,222
It's a sucker bet.

544
00:35:09,144 --> 00:35:11,092
Hey, it's my funeral.

545
00:35:29,424 --> 00:35:31,726
I'll look forward to that scotch.

546
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:43,737
I got you something.

547
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,544
You saved me.

548
00:36:33,794 --> 00:36:35,395
No.

549
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:39,264
I was just in the right place...

550
00:36:40,082 --> 00:36:41,891
at the right time.

551
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:46,104
That was all you.

552
00:36:49,924 --> 00:36:52,325
You're gonna be okay, Claire.

553
00:37:00,015 --> 00:37:02,616
There's something I need to tell you.

554
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:05,790
Me too.

555
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:09,589
I go first.

556
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:13,715
You...

557
00:37:15,618 --> 00:37:17,251
are...

558
00:37:18,686 --> 00:37:20,286
...a terrible bowler.

559
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:25,759
Maybe the worst I've ever seen.

560
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:31,205
And I wanted to tell you
that I hate your tattoo.

561
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,064
Way too much antler.

562
00:37:40,882 --> 00:37:43,283
I love you.

563
00:37:49,544 --> 00:37:51,336
I love you, too.

564
00:38:28,678 --> 00:38:30,744
It's the start of a new day.

565
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:32,752
Yes. It is.

566
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:36,523
That was both literally true
and a metaphor.

567
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:00,864
Hey, Mia.

568
00:39:00,889 --> 00:39:03,156
No, I-I'm fine.

569
00:39:03,181 --> 00:39:05,614
I'm just, uh...

570
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,203
just tired.

571
00:39:09,437 --> 00:39:10,707
Hey.

572
00:39:12,241 --> 00:39:13,918
I have to be, uh,

573
00:39:15,184 --> 00:39:17,051
closer to you guys.

574
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:21,301
I'm gonna move back.

575
00:39:24,192 --> 00:39:26,293
Hey, is Kellan there?

576
00:39:26,318 --> 00:39:28,518
I need to hear his voice.

577
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:44,806
Hey, son.

578
00:40:36,459 --> 00:40:39,627
We should get a drink sometime.

579
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:41,352
I'd like that.

580
00:40:48,774 --> 00:40:51,007
I made a promise to Vera.

581
00:41:00,443 --> 00:41:02,843
I don't know what that was.

582
00:41:02,868 --> 00:41:05,769
It could be a practice kiss

583
00:41:05,794 --> 00:41:07,594
or a pity kiss or a goodbye kiss.

584
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:13,759
That was an "I'm such a stupid
idiot for not seeing it,

585
00:41:13,784 --> 00:41:16,952
but I love you with all my heart" kiss.

586
00:41:18,613 --> 00:41:20,614
And this is another.

587
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,395
Vera didn't die,
so the promise doesn't count.

588
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:44,330
You make me more, Shaun.

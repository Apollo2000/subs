00:00:02,856 --> 00:00:04,590
<i>I tried to help you,</i>

00:00:04,676 --> 00:00:06,364
<i>and you pushed me away.</i>

00:00:06,504 --> 00:00:10,044
It can't just be about
having fun together.

5
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:12,004
If I have
to call security,

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,059
you understand that
I'm also gonna have to fire you.

7
00:00:15,993 --> 00:00:19,629
I am a surgeon!

8
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:22,633
I am...
I am a surgeon!

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,637
I am a surgeon,
Dr. Han!

10
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:34,450
Why are you sad?

11
00:00:35,137 --> 00:00:36,817
I'm not sad.

12
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:38,731
Is there another reason
to get drunk

13
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:41,223
- at 10:00 in the morning?
- Shut up.

It's fun to drink
with someone who is fun.

16
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,895
Lea is fun.
You're not fun.

17
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:06,583
Shut up.

18
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,372
No.

19
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:20,684
If I have
something to say,

20
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:23,000
I will say it.

21
00:01:23,647 --> 00:01:25,497
Well, if I have
someone to shut up,

22
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,114
then I'll shut them up.

23
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:32,528
If I have something
to s...

24
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:36,301
Okay, I do not
like to be touched.

25
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:39,848
Just shut up.

26
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:49,903
I am a surgeon.

29
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,921
You've had sex
with each other.

30
00:02:23,888 --> 00:02:24,972
Yes.

31
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,308
And you're planning
on doing so again?

32
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:29,887
- Yes.
- Good news.

33
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:33,140
Because neither of you are
in a subservient position

34
00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:35,382
- to the other...
- Well, sometimes.

35
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:39,761
You work together and
you are sleeping together.

36
00:02:39,846 --> 00:02:42,554
You don't see any way
that can go wrong?

37
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,578
Nothing for your employer
to worry about?

38
00:02:46,476 --> 00:02:49,632
I'm going to interview
each of you separately

39
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:52,984
to ensure that
the relationship is consensual.

40
00:02:53,478 --> 00:02:55,577
Zack Cordell, 31,
loss of consciousness,

41
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,062
laceration with closed
head injury,

42
00:02:57,148 --> 00:02:58,374
possible brain contusion.

43
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,437
- GCS score?
- Nine. Dr. Murphy thinks

44
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:01,992
it might be
an epidural hematoma.

45
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:04,201
- Dr. Murphy?
- Yeah, he's...

46
00:03:05,172 --> 00:03:06,796
Where'd he go?

47
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,859
Shaun?

48
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:11,536
Come in.

49
00:03:11,622 --> 00:03:13,585
Tell us what you saw,
what you did.

50
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:15,487
I can't.

51
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:19,084
I'm not
a doctor here.

52
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,288
You're still
a doctor, Shaun.

53
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:26,695
We need to know
what happened.

54
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:33,221
I found him
like that.

55
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:37,985
I want
a STAT head CT.

56
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,416
Get me a CBC
and a tox screen.

57
00:03:40,563 --> 00:03:43,025
It might be
an epidural hematoma.

58
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:44,252
We heard.

59
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:45,827
Let's get a bolt
ICP monitor ready.

60
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:47,428
- I'm on it.
- Dr. Lim...

61
00:03:47,513 --> 00:03:48,563
How was
your meeting?

62
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:51,132
I confirmed the lack of
inducement or pressure.

63
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:52,955
I assume
you did likewise.

64
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,644
We are approved.

65
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:57,254
For what?

66
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:03,847
<i>♪ At last ♪</i>

67
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:11,191
<i>♪ My love has come along ♪</i>

68
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,347
<i>♪ My lonely days are over ♪</i>

69
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,386
<i>♪ And li... ♪</i>

70
00:04:37,755 --> 00:04:40,496
I farted,
I peed, I pooped,

71
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:44,363
everything is working as well
as I can possibly hope.

72
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:47,730
We just need to know there are
no post-surgical complications.

73
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:49,574
You're not wearing
a wedding ring.

74
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,876
I'm not married.

75
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:53,636
Well, gays
can get married...

76
00:04:53,762 --> 00:04:56,668
they have children...
you need to have children.

77
00:04:56,816 --> 00:04:58,099
I'll tell you
what's more interesting

78
00:04:58,184 --> 00:05:00,043
than a non-married woman
not wearing a ring.

79
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:02,050
Dr. Park here
wears a wedding ring

80
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,035
even though
he's not married.

81
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:07,543
I'm divorced,

82
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,526
but we're trying
to reconcile.

83
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:11,402
Well, good for you.

84
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:13,609
- Kids?
- A son.

85
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:15,350
BP looks good.

86
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:16,999
How often
do you see them?

87
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:18,499
Dinners, I hope.

88
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,803
I mean, dinners are
really important.

89
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:23,014
- They live in Phoenix.
- Oh, no.

90
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,342
No, no, no, no, no.

91
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:29,186
JP drain site looks good
with no bilious output.

92
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:31,014
Do you have
any other symptoms?

93
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,280
I-I've got a bit
of a stomachache,

94
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,570
because of
those nasty veggie slushies.

95
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:38,819
Dr. Mitzger has me on.

96
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:40,834
Does this
look inflamed?

97
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:42,784
I don't think
she's ready to go.

98
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,444
What? Why not?

99
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,210
We need to order
an abdominal ultrasound...

100
00:05:46,296 --> 00:05:49,147
make sure you don't have
a deep post-surgical abscess.

101
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:53,233
Hopefully just one more day
with us, Ida.

102
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:58,292
I am concerned about
how you dealt with Dr. Murphy.

103
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:01,062
Have you known
anyone else with ASD?

104
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:03,437
Not well. Have you?

105
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:06,063
When you give people
responsibility

106
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:09,024
they can't handle,
the results can be devastating.

107
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,405
Well, every time Dr. Murphy's
been given responsibility,

108
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:13,541
he's risen to the occa...

109
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:15,626
He's never been
given responsibility.

110
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:17,548
He's been
given things to do,

111
00:06:17,634 --> 00:06:20,227
but always with someone
right behind him.

112
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:23,118
I'm the first one
to really challenge him.

113
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:25,501
And he failed.

114
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,915
Are you okay?

115
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:34,536
Yes.

116
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:49,337
When something bad happens,
we have to remember

117
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:52,681
we're not defined
by any one thing.

118
00:06:54,137 --> 00:06:56,724
You're not just
a doctor, Shaun.

119
00:06:57,427 --> 00:06:59,504
You're a good friend,

120
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,891
a good person.

121
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,720
There are so many things
you can do.

122
00:07:07,545 --> 00:07:09,032
What do you want?

123
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:12,829
I want...

124
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,899
to be
a surgeon.

125
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:18,610
What else?

126
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,470
What else
do you want?

127
00:07:29,902 --> 00:07:32,219
I want what
everybody wants.

128
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:34,021
I want...

129
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:38,673
I want my life
to matter.

130
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,759
I want to have fun.
I...

131
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,352
I want to fall in love.

132
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:56,204
I think
I'd be a good father.

133
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:02,681
I think
you will be, too.

134
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:09,884
But I don't know
how to fall in love.

135
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:20,822
Good morning,
Claire.

136
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:22,310
Good morning.

137
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:25,457
Here are
some chocolates.

138
00:08:32,756 --> 00:08:34,809
They're not
really chocolates.

139
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:41,537
Here's a stapler,

140
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:45,262
which represents
flowers.

141
00:08:46,617 --> 00:08:47,957
Thank you.

142
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,036
These flowers
are beautiful.

143
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,434
You have nice hair.

144
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:56,059
Thank you, Shaun.

145
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:58,403
I like your shirt.

146
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,747
It's old.

147
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:09,884
I was wondering
if you would like...

148
00:09:10,737 --> 00:09:12,146
to...

149
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:15,331
Say the words.

150
00:09:16,053 --> 00:09:18,771
There could be other people
there that would be distracting.

151
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:20,837
There could be noises
that would be distracting.

152
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:22,973
She could misunderstand
my question.

153
00:09:23,058 --> 00:09:24,857
- You can't let that...
- She could say no.

154
00:09:31,453 --> 00:09:32,987
Shaun.

155
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,815
She will.

156
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:45,784
Y-You don't know.

157
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:47,487
Someone will.

158
00:09:49,962 --> 00:09:53,323
Shaun, you're gonna
fall in love,

159
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:55,661
and you're gonna
have your heart broken.

160
00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:58,190
And you're gonna
fall in love again.

161
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:02,706
And you're gonna
lose your job again.

162
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,722
- No.
- Yeah.

163
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:07,167
This is life.
You know that.

164
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:09,776
You've been hurt.
And you've survived.

165
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,878
You've gotten
stronger, better.

166
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:16,925
Not better.

167
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,113
It's not better.

168
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:32,465
Zack's tests
are ready.

169
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:36,340
Large iced,
extra shot.

170
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:38,786
Oh, no. No extra shot
for me today.

171
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,288
I'm already kinda up.

172
00:10:40,468 --> 00:10:43,075
- Having a good day?
- Uh...

173
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,661
yeah,
a real doozy.

174
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:48,387
As of today,
I'm officially cancer free.

175
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:50,583
- That's fantastic.
- Thank you.

176
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,692
I'm so happy for you.

177
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:55,763
You just got yourself

178
00:10:56,075 --> 00:10:57,856
a free coffee.

179
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:01,153
Thank you.
I got you something, too.

180
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,724
A Model J.

181
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,497
Just like the one that
we never got to see

182
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:11,161
at the car show
we never made it to.

183
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:14,581
Wow.

184
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:16,553
Open up the hood.
Check out the engine.

185
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:18,508
Oh, okay.

186
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:24,426
You're right.
We're too old

187
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:26,328
to just have fun.

188
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:28,364
I-I want to commit.

189
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:30,514
Commit?

190
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:33,670
I meant commit
to a relationship.

191
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:36,208
Not to, like,
pledging our...

192
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:38,575
never-ending love
before God.

193
00:11:38,661 --> 00:11:40,825
In sickness and in health.
That's what you wanted.

194
00:11:40,911 --> 00:11:43,434
I have just been through
the seven levels of Hell.

195
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,645
I am ready to embrace life,
to be bold.

196
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:52,981
This is
definitely bold.

197
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,278
It's... It's also...

198
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,723
It's also stupid.

199
00:12:09,524 --> 00:12:12,760
I made it a part
of our wedding vows.

200
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:16,250
Marty and I pledged
we would never be apart

201
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,774
for more than five days
at a time,

202
00:12:18,894 --> 00:12:20,315
and we never were.

203
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:23,553
Until he died
two years ago.

204
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:26,680
I made my daughter
put it in her vows.

205
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:28,609
Junie lives in Napa.

206
00:12:29,094 --> 00:12:32,008
Three children...
two boys and a girl.

207
00:12:32,153 --> 00:12:33,570
You're still young.

208
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,680
You should give your son
a brother and sister.

209
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:40,672
Everything looks great.

210
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,078
I think
we can send you home.

211
00:12:42,164 --> 00:12:43,219
Good.

212
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,828
Junie's driving in
with her youngest.

213
00:12:45,952 --> 00:12:48,004
Oh.

214
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:51,492
I-I can't feel
my fingers.

215
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:58,014
Other than the contusions,
no hematoma.

216
00:12:58,418 --> 00:13:00,352
I wish you were
back in Path.

217
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:04,188
I don't wish
I was back in Path.

218
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,488
CBC is normal.

219
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,669
Tox screen
is basically clear.

220
00:13:09,817 --> 00:13:12,711
No drugs, trace amounts
of alcohol.

221
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,070
Maybe he tripped
and hit his head.

222
00:13:17,156 --> 00:13:19,006
No. His gait
was erratic,

223
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:20,484
and so was
his behavior...

224
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,414
both highly suggestive
of intoxication.

225
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,747
I thought you found him
unconscious.

226
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:31,852
What happened?

227
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:35,546
Did he do something
to you?

228
00:13:35,803 --> 00:13:37,461
Say something
to you?

229
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:41,022
Shaun?

230
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,433
You never lie.

231
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,633
Why would you
lie about this?

232
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:53,734
If Zack wasn't intoxicated, then
he has a neurological issue...

233
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:56,420
you need to run an EEG
and a CT angiogram.

234
00:13:56,506 --> 00:13:58,056
I have to go.

235
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:08,056
Could be Guillain-Barré,
maybe peripheral neuropathy.

236
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:09,578
I think we should
perform an EMG

237
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:11,060
and a nerve
conduction study.

238
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:13,179
- What do you want to do?
- Send her home.

239
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:15,642
I think
she's making it up.

240
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:17,086
Her symptoms
are very mild,

241
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:18,768
very typical
post-op reactions...

242
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:20,516
except the one
that suddenly appeared

243
00:14:20,602 --> 00:14:22,205
as soon as we told her
she could go home.

244
00:14:22,547 --> 00:14:24,906
She's just lonely,
looking for attention.

245
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:26,563
She can be lonely
<i>and</i> sick.

246
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,742
According to the MRI,
she's just lonely.

247
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:31,780
It's no fun
releasing a patient

248
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:34,235
only to find them
in the morgue 24 hours later.

249
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:37,119
Recheck her history,
run whatever tests you need,

250
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:39,031
- rule out everything you can.
- Thank you.

251
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:40,789
And congratulations.

252
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:43,547
You and Dr. Lim.

253
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,406
It's an excellent
match.

254
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:13,852
I have a sample
I'd like you to test.

255
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:16,469
Shaun, you don't
work here anymore.

256
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:18,086
How do you
have a patient?

257
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:20,461
It's Claire's
patient.

258
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:26,008
There's no patient name
on it.

259
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,711
What are...
this patient's symptoms?

260
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:45,359
He's coughing blood.

261
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:51,969
I'll expedite
the test.

262
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:02,795
We'll get the data
analyzed by a neurologist

263
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:05,568
- as soon as possible.
- And when it comes back okay,

264
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:08,326
we could have you discharged
by the end of the day.

265
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:10,420
You said "when"...

266
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:12,592
You think
I'm making this up?

267
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:14,021
Wasting your time?

268
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,521
- No, I...
- Yes.

269
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:17,334
I do.

270
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,666
- You're right.
- You're faking?

271
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:24,358
No.

272
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:27,186
Not entirely.

273
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:31,057
I can feel my fingers.

274
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,521
- But they're tingling.
- Because you're 87, Ida.

275
00:16:34,771 --> 00:16:37,232
These are just
symptoms of old age.

276
00:16:40,456 --> 00:16:42,951
Junie had leukemia.

277
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:49,795
Months of chemo, and she just
got sicker and weaker.

278
00:16:50,598 --> 00:16:54,006
Three days before
her 9th birthday,

279
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:59,279
two oncologists said there was
nothing more they could do.

280
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:04,982
Told us that she would never
make it through the night.

281
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:13,264
They said it was pointless,
"Oh, it... it's so cruel."

282
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:21,061
But it wasn't
their little girl who was dying.

283
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:29,224
The next morning.

284
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,544
Junie was still alive.

285
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:39,998
And the morning after that,
she opened her eyes, and...

286
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:44,589
all the people said,
"Oh, it's a miracle."

287
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:47,448
But it wasn't
a miracle.

288
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:53,808
Junie is alive
with three beautiful children

289
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:56,339
only because I refused
to let those doctors

290
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:58,159
tell me what to do.

291
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,550
And now that I'm old,

292
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:11,362
they give me
even less credit.

293
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:17,300
We'll let you know
the test results.

294
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:30,211
WBC and
PT are elevated,

295
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:32,511
and hemoglobins
are a little low.

296
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:34,933
It could be
pneumonia, DIC...

297
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,903
It's trauma-induced,

298
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:39,097
- so more like...
- Trauma?

299
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:48,962
Then coagulopathy
is possible,

300
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:50,903
making bleeding worse.

301
00:18:52,383 --> 00:18:55,034
You need
to get the patient

302
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,155
on phytonadione
as soon as possible.

303
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,409
I'm writing
a script.

304
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:11,979
You'll tell your patient
how important this is, right?

305
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:24,651
Good news, Ida.

306
00:19:24,737 --> 00:19:26,597
Normal electrical activity
at rest,

307
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:28,636
normal action potentials
with contraction.

308
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:30,103
Thank you.

309
00:19:30,189 --> 00:19:32,172
I'm sorry
I wasted your time.

310
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:33,874
You don't have to <i>listen</i>
<i>to your doctors.</i>

311
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:36,019
But you do have
to be honest with them.

312
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,659
Park.

313
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:39,100
Bile.

314
00:19:57,615 --> 00:20:00,267
They're treating you
for rhabdomyolysis.

315
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,104
That makes sense.

316
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:05,241
- Why are you here?
- I am a doctor.

317
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:08,589
Why are you sad?

318
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:17,612
I'm sad
and angry and...

319
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:21,401
confused and I don't know.

320
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:27,776
I wasn't supposed
to be at the bar.

321
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:32,874
I was supposed to be
at a job interview.

322
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,948
Dr. Glassman got me
a job interview,

323
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,855
but I don't
want a new job,

324
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:41,847
and people tell me
that I have to move on,

325
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,995
but why can't I
just be sad

326
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:46,987
and angry and...

327
00:21:07,787 --> 00:21:09,687
It's not rhabdo.

328
00:21:11,245 --> 00:21:13,198
You need
immediate treatment.

329
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:14,362
What?

330
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:15,940
Wh... For what?

331
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:19,593
For what?
For what?!

332
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,883
Tram... poline...

333
00:21:25,561 --> 00:21:26,960
Hey.

334
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,099
Dr. Murphy?

335
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:35,459
I need help in here!

336
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:42,306
Left hemothorax and
grade 2 splenic laceration

337
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:44,150
resulting from
a rib fracture.

338
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:46,452
Inserted a chest tube to reduce
the blood pooling

339
00:21:46,537 --> 00:21:48,054
in the pleural cavity.

340
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:50,488
Any idea what caused
the trauma?

341
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,257
Zack Cordell
beat him up.

342
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:54,018
The patient
he brought in?

343
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:55,965
Shaun told you?

344
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:57,700
Not explicitly.

345
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:01,504
But... he was acting strange
from the minute they came in.

346
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:05,629
Shaun acting strange
isn't strange.

347
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:12,848
Excuse me.

348
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:19,450
Dr. Murphy saved
another person today.

349
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:23,028
Encountering an emergency
is not a job qualification.

350
00:22:23,192 --> 00:22:24,723
And how can you
trust a doctor

351
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:26,247
who doesn't have
the sense to tell someone

352
00:22:26,332 --> 00:22:27,960
he was injured
before passing out?

353
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:30,379
It's no longer
a request, Jackson.

354
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:33,317
Am I only allowed to do my job
when you agree with me?

355
00:22:33,413 --> 00:22:35,090
You knew someone
on the spectrum.

356
00:22:35,176 --> 00:22:36,653
What happened
to them?

357
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:39,227
They died.

358
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:41,575
But if either of us
are making decisions

359
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,012
based on
our personal experiences,

360
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:44,643
we're making
the wrong decisions.

361
00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:46,973
You paid a lot of money
for my judgment.

362
00:22:47,797 --> 00:22:49,301
Too much,
I'm starting to think.

363
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:50,950
Well, that was
the point.

364
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:52,790
I didn't need
the money.

365
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,996
I needed
the commitment.

366
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,778
You went out
on a limb for me.

367
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:02,371
You fire me now, you look like
a fool in front of the board.

368
00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:10,660
It's not the clips;

369
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:12,895
Ida needs to be
opened up again.

370
00:23:14,332 --> 00:23:15,809
That's too bad.

371
00:23:16,044 --> 00:23:18,496
There's one other test
I'd like to try.

372
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:24,884
I'm starting to feel
some pain on my left side.

373
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:26,919
It's important
for a doctor

374
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:29,321
to use
all their senses.

375
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:41,957
Tastes like...
a bit of kale,

376
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:43,926
seven delicious
vegetables...

377
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:45,817
Good news is
you don't have

378
00:23:45,903 --> 00:23:47,620
a potentially fatal
bile duct issue.

379
00:23:47,706 --> 00:23:49,065
The bad news is

380
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:51,034
we know you've been dumping
your veggie slushie

381
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,613
into your drain to make us
think you were sick.

382
00:24:00,924 --> 00:24:03,276
You'll be discharged
this afternoon.

383
00:24:18,552 --> 00:24:19,722
You asked
to see me?

384
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:21,425
Yeah, for the last
two hours.

385
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:24,097
I'm sorry. I've been dealing
with Dr. Murphy.

386
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,604
It seems someone
beat him up.

387
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,862
- Quite severely.
- Yeah, that shouldn't have happened,

388
00:24:27,948 --> 00:24:29,089
but before he passed out,

389
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:30,695
he said he knew
what was wrong with me.

390
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,316
Well, we all know
what's wrong with you.

391
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:34,229
You're an ass with
a head trauma and rhabdo.

392
00:24:34,315 --> 00:24:35,886
He said you're wrong.

393
00:24:36,297 --> 00:24:37,917
He kind of spaced out
all distracted,

394
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:41,292
then he said that I don't have
that and that I need treatment.

395
00:24:42,111 --> 00:24:43,478
Distracted how?

396
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:46,706
Like, he was
looking around

397
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,886
trying to find something
in the air, I don't know.

398
00:24:49,213 --> 00:24:50,948
And then it looked
like he found it.

399
00:24:52,964 --> 00:24:55,792
What exactly did he say?

400
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:57,409
Trampoline?

401
00:24:57,636 --> 00:24:59,550
- And?
- That's it.

402
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:01,715
You know Shaun.
It could be a reference

403
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,073
to something
he read somewhere.

404
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:04,815
It could be a metaphor.

405
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:06,807
It could be
the guy misheard.

406
00:25:06,893 --> 00:25:08,190
It could be delirium.

407
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,503
Shaun had a systolic pressure
of 70;

408
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:12,886
he may have been
hallucinating;

409
00:25:12,987 --> 00:25:14,886
he may have
just been wrong.

410
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,634
He's hypotensive,
O2 SATs are dropping.

411
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:21,628
- He's crashing!
- Bag him.

412
00:25:21,714 --> 00:25:24,732
Bolus five units of
vasopressin and start a drip.

413
00:25:34,036 --> 00:25:37,234
"Trampoline," from
the Spanish word <i>trampolino,</i>

414
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,336
<i>meaning "springboard,"</i>

415
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:40,104
from the Italian
root <i>trampoli,</i>

416
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:41,424
meaning "stilts."

417
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:43,760
Maybe Shaun
was talking about

418
00:25:43,845 --> 00:25:46,195
an excessive growth disorder
like acromegaly.

419
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,960
But instead of just saying
the name of the disorder,

420
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:49,265
he used
the English translation

421
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,801
of the Spanish derivative
of the Italian?

422
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:55,623
Maybe we should
just wake him up.

423
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:57,756
His respiratory status
is too fragile.

424
00:25:57,842 --> 00:26:00,756
We have a very sick patient.
If Shaun can save his life...

425
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:02,412
We have
<i>two</i> very sick patients,

426
00:26:02,497 --> 00:26:04,537
and if there's a 1% chance
that waking Shaun

427
00:26:04,623 --> 00:26:06,881
will risk his life
I say we don't do it.

428
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:12,373
We shouldn't
need Shaun.

429
00:26:12,482 --> 00:26:13,923
We can figure this out
ourselves.

430
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:15,158
What do we know?

431
00:26:15,243 --> 00:26:17,427
Low BP, nausea,
and dizziness,

432
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:19,568
erratic gait
and behavior.

433
00:26:20,701 --> 00:26:23,501
Adrenal insufficiency
could explain his gait and BP.

434
00:26:23,587 --> 00:26:25,389
We'd be seeing
hyperpigmentation.

435
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:28,178
- Botulism?
- There'd be descending paralysis;

436
00:26:28,264 --> 00:26:30,240
if anything
he has ascending.

437
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:33,420
Lyme disease?

438
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:38,099
Explains fatigue and dizziness
and, if advanced,

439
00:26:38,185 --> 00:26:39,412
impaired muscle movement.

440
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:42,234
And an arrhythmia
could be lowering his BP.

441
00:26:42,804 --> 00:26:46,701
None of this sounds like...

442
00:26:47,013 --> 00:26:48,313
"trampoline."

443
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:53,787
Let's get him started on
100 milligrams of doxycycline.

444
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:55,873
- Do you need...
- Shh.

445
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,810
Sorry, sorry.

446
00:28:01,232 --> 00:28:04,115
You were on duty when
Dr. Murphy passed out, right?

447
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:05,435
I was first one in.

448
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,345
Is this
where he was standing?

449
00:28:08,364 --> 00:28:10,912
I think he was closer
to the patient.

450
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,728
Hmm...

451
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:19,133
W-What about the blinds?
Were they like that?

452
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,857
Please, I need to know what
Shaun's experience was

453
00:28:22,943 --> 00:28:24,654
when he was standing here.

454
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:38,076
Also, could I
get a step stool?

455
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:39,718
Sure.

456
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:41,404
Thanks.

457
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,842
Why can't you get him
his job back?

458
00:28:49,982 --> 00:28:52,669
You were the president for,
like, a hundred years.

459
00:28:53,052 --> 00:28:56,545
I'm gonna fight for him,
but I'm only one vote.

460
00:28:58,104 --> 00:29:00,279
We all get
smacked around.

461
00:29:01,028 --> 00:29:02,810
We got to learn
to take the hits,

462
00:29:02,935 --> 00:29:05,236
lick our wounds,
and move on.

463
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:11,326
He likes you,
you know?

464
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,568
Yeah, I like him, too.

465
00:29:13,654 --> 00:29:15,178
He likes you more.

466
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:18,037
When he gets rejected,

467
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:22,099
I'm glad it's coming from
somebody who cares about him.

468
00:30:20,175 --> 00:30:22,325
We need an OR stat!

469
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:31,674
Hey, Shaun.

470
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,952
It's me, Auntie Em.

471
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:39,584
What are you
doing in my room?

472
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,702
No, Shaun,
we're in the hospital.

473
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,623
You were
pretty bad earlier,

474
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,889
- but now you...
- Zack... Zack...

475
00:30:46,008 --> 00:30:48,261
Zack has
the wrong diagnosis.

476
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,997
- No, no, no, Shaun. I know.
- No, no, he'll...

477
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:51,647
- It's fine. It's actually fine.
- He'll die unless he's

478
00:30:51,732 --> 00:30:53,039
treated immediately.

479
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:54,190
- Shaun, it's fine.
- No, he needs...

480
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:55,541
"Trampoline."

481
00:30:57,951 --> 00:31:00,603
Zack had
an aortic arch aneurysm

482
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:02,539
with signs
of impending rupture,

483
00:31:02,631 --> 00:31:05,657
the evidence of which was
a pulsatile mass in his neck.

484
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,880
That and his erratic gait
and behavior

485
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,717
are explained by the fact
that he had tertiary syphilis.

486
00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:12,154
Also known as...

487
00:31:13,977 --> 00:31:15,228
Treponema.

488
00:31:15,314 --> 00:31:16,831
Zack misheard you,

489
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,234
but we were able
to repair the aneurysm,

490
00:31:19,395 --> 00:31:21,046
and he is stable now.

491
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,897
Okay.

492
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:25,561
Okay.

493
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:27,569
All right.

494
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,756
Lie down, Dorothy.
Get some rest, all right?

495
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,998
We finally
got her history.

496
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:40,650
Those doctors who said Junie
wouldn't survive the night,

497
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,491
they were right.

498
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:45,602
Three days before
her 9th birthday, Junie died.

499
00:31:46,235 --> 00:31:48,419
Ida never had
any grandchildren.

500
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,092
What about her husband?

501
00:31:50,215 --> 00:31:52,553
He did pass away
two years ago,

502
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:56,326
but he and Ida separated
after their daughter's death.

503
00:32:01,082 --> 00:32:03,271
It doesn't change
anything medically.

504
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,973
I'm sorry.

505
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,468
You know what $300,000
can get you in Tempe?

506
00:32:51,378 --> 00:32:52,949
How are you doing?

507
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:56,355
I have an O2 SAT of 97%

508
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,292
and urine output
of 200cc an hour,

509
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,077
so I'm doing well.

510
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,472
I just got off
the phone

511
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,433
with Dr. Turner
at San Jose General.

512
00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:10,934
You missed
a job interview?

513
00:33:11,145 --> 00:33:13,785
I like being
a surgeon here.

514
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:19,324
But you're not anymore.

515
00:33:21,474 --> 00:33:23,284
And we can't change that.

516
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:33,109
Shaun.

517
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:36,300
Both of us...

518
00:33:38,657 --> 00:33:41,347
we need to face reality.

519
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:49,027
My brother Steve said

520
00:33:49,113 --> 00:33:52,652
that whenever people
want you to do something

521
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:54,175
they think is wrong,

522
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:56,402
they say
it's "reality."

523
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:08,695
Yesterday,
Dr. Shaun Murphy

524
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,940
did something
that was different.

525
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:14,261
And it wasn't
because he showed mercy

526
00:34:14,347 --> 00:34:17,887
to someone who had been
cruel and violent to him,

527
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,519
although
that's extraordinary.

528
00:34:19,605 --> 00:34:23,503
What was different is that
yesterday, Dr. Shaun Murphy

529
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:25,879
made Dr. Claire Browne
a better doctor.

530
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:28,105
Why?
Because Dr. Claire Browne

531
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,621
looked at a problem
through Dr. Murphy's eyes

532
00:34:31,707 --> 00:34:33,375
and she saved a life.

533
00:34:34,413 --> 00:34:36,354
And that's extraordinary.

534
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:41,620
Dr. Han,

535
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:44,792
Dr. Murphy may not communicate
like you do.

536
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:47,467
He may not communicate
like I do, but make no mistake.

537
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,145
He does communicate.

538
00:34:49,885 --> 00:34:51,517
And he inspires.

539
00:34:54,074 --> 00:34:55,261
Well, welcome back

540
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:57,077
to the Board,
Dr. Glassman.

541
00:34:57,292 --> 00:34:59,112
I've heard of your insights
and passion,

542
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,847
and I'm grateful
to witness it.

543
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,570
Thank you.

544
00:35:03,656 --> 00:35:07,785
But I didn't fire Dr. Murphy
because he doesn't inspire.

545
00:35:08,988 --> 00:35:11,386
I fired him
because he was irrational,

546
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,245
unprofessional.

547
00:35:13,824 --> 00:35:15,066
He couldn't calm down.

548
00:35:15,152 --> 00:35:17,111
He couldn't
control himself.

549
00:35:17,956 --> 00:35:19,753
I stand by
that decision.

550
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,613
And if Dr. Glassman
insists

551
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:25,688
on putting this to a vote,
the issue isn't

552
00:35:25,774 --> 00:35:28,234
whether Dr. Murphy
should be working here.

553
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:30,932
The issue
is whether I should.

554
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:34,232
Whether I control
my staff.

555
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:38,041
Because I can't work here
if I don't.

556
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:46,511
Okay.

557
00:35:47,293 --> 00:35:50,096
I don't think there's anything
else on the agenda, so...

558
00:35:50,259 --> 00:35:51,855
Steve was right.

559
00:35:54,144 --> 00:35:57,715
And Dr. Glassman
is right.

560
00:36:00,012 --> 00:36:01,715
You're gonna
propose his motion?

561
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:04,427
Dr. Andrews, I don't think
you have the votes to carry it.

562
00:36:04,513 --> 00:36:06,079
I agree.

563
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,348
But I don't
need the votes.

564
00:36:12,434 --> 00:36:14,394
Just as you have the power
to fire someone

565
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,238
under your supervision,
so do I.

566
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,433
You're gonna fire me
to save Dr. Murphy.

567
00:36:21,801 --> 00:36:23,848
He's not ready
to move on.

568
00:36:26,299 --> 00:36:27,882
Neither am I.

569
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:41,501
Did you
hear about Han?

570
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,980
Can't imagine Andrews
will survive the fallout.

571
00:36:44,144 --> 00:36:46,300
They're gonna need
a new Chief of Surgery;

572
00:36:46,386 --> 00:36:48,203
what if either of us
is offered the job?

573
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:50,322
One of us bossing
the other around?

574
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,558
I don't think
that would fly with HR.

575
00:36:52,804 --> 00:36:54,454
Someone would have
to resign.

576
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,410
Or we'd
have to break up.

577
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,058
Or...

578
00:36:58,408 --> 00:37:00,063
we could turn it down...

579
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:07,438
I think...
things are great.

580
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,133
And they've been great for,
what, four weeks now?

581
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,329
Just over a month.

582
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:15,968
It'd be crazy
to pass on a chance

583
00:37:16,054 --> 00:37:17,578
at being
a department head.

584
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:21,172
Are you that crazy?

585
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:24,694
No.

586
00:37:25,748 --> 00:37:27,000
Are you?

587
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,211
No.

588
00:37:32,848 --> 00:37:34,235
Good.

589
00:37:35,328 --> 00:37:37,292
I talked
to Andrews' assistant.

590
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:40,727
Aoki should be calling you
with the offer any minute.

591
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,615
You'd better answer.

592
00:38:01,165 --> 00:38:02,500
Hello.

593
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,954
Ms. Aoki, it's good
to hear from you.

594
00:38:18,907 --> 00:38:22,227
Hi... Shaun.

595
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,454
I got my job back.

596
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,344
That's great.

597
00:38:33,805 --> 00:38:35,710
I have
a question for you.

598
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,156
Yes.

599
00:38:37,728 --> 00:38:39,063
I don...
I don't mean yes.

600
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:42,071
I also don't mean no.
Just what is the question?

601
00:38:53,135 --> 00:38:54,946
Do I look nice?

602
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,750
Yes, Shaun.

603
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:01,492
You look very nice.

604
00:39:23,005 --> 00:39:25,365
I know myself.

605
00:39:26,123 --> 00:39:28,100
I know what I want,

606
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:30,257
and I know
what I love.

607
00:39:30,343 --> 00:39:32,242
You don't love me.

608
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:33,750
You barely know me.

609
00:39:33,836 --> 00:39:35,196
I think I do.

610
00:39:35,282 --> 00:39:37,058
I think I know you.

611
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:39,586
And, sure, we could go out
on another date

612
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:40,960
and another date
after that

613
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,531
and more dates after that,
but life is short

614
00:39:43,617 --> 00:39:45,842
and getting shorter,
and I want to spend

615
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:50,524
whatever time I have left
with you.

616
00:39:50,826 --> 00:39:52,676
When we're together,

617
00:39:52,816 --> 00:39:56,703
it feels like we're speeding
down the PCH in a Duesenberg,

618
00:39:56,836 --> 00:40:00,938
12 cylinders with 400cc
and turbo boosts

619
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:05,196
and picnic basket in the back
with baguettes and Gruyère

620
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:07,252
and prosciutto
and Chateauneuf du Pape,

621
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,797
and you're sitting next to me,
wind in your hair,

622
00:40:09,883 --> 00:40:12,860
and you're laughing
that laugh,

623
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:17,633
and the sun,
and the ocean.

624
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:22,500
And it just feels like
we can go forever.

625
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:31,180
Debbie Wexler,

626
00:40:31,944 --> 00:40:36,352
will you marry me?

627
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,360
Yes.

628
00:41:20,798 --> 00:41:23,025
You have nice hair.

629
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:26,487
I know, fabulous.
I was ju...

630
00:41:26,628 --> 00:41:29,644
Here are flowers
and chocolates.

631
00:41:33,008 --> 00:41:34,808
Real ones.

632
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,823
I was wondering if...

633
00:41:43,235 --> 00:41:47,558
you would like to...

634
00:41:53,892 --> 00:41:56,558
eat dinner?

635
00:41:59,629 --> 00:42:01,487
Are you
asking me out?

636
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:05,688
Yes.

637
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:07,565
On a date?

638
00:42:08,752 --> 00:42:10,666
Yes.

639
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,925
I would love to.

640

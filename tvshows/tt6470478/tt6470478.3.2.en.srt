1
00:00:00,391 --> 00:00:01,820
<i>Previously, on</i>
"The Good Doctor"...

2
00:00:01,908 --> 00:00:03,416
<i>We had the clinic
at the hospital.</i>

3
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:06,644
Come back as President, and...
and we'll re-open it.

4
00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:08,265
We need to go to HR
and break up.

5
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,657
I have accepted
your explanation and report.

6
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:11,805
Thank you.

7
00:00:11,893 --> 00:00:13,164
But I don't believe it.

8
00:00:13,906 --> 00:00:16,554
Traditionally, you don't get to
lead surgeries until fourth year.

9
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,654
That will be changing.

10
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:20,418
When the right surgery
comes along, it'll be yours.

11
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:23,007
I want you to meet
our new attending,

12
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,570
Dr. Marcus Andrews.

13
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,029
Pleasure to meet you.

14
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:27,859
You had a date last night,
didn't you?

15
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:31,429
It was hard, uncomfortable,
unpleasant,

16
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:33,210
and I have no idea
if she was happy,

17
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:36,296
and I know
I wasn't happy.

18
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:44,273
I don't like when you do that.

19
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:45,315
I know.

20
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:46,552
But I did it anyway

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,467
because you need
to snap out of it.

22
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,843
The moping...
it accomplishes nothing.

23
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:52,759
I'm not moping.
I'm eating.

24
00:00:52,847 --> 00:00:54,328
Which is the only thing

25
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,213
you're doing
outside your room now.

26
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:58,168
You didn't even come out
to tell me

27
00:00:58,256 --> 00:00:59,446
to turn down the Talking Heads.

28
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:01,554
It... didn't bother me.

29
00:01:01,617 --> 00:01:02,969
The walls were shaking.

30
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:05,150
I'm surprised
the cops didn't show up.

31
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:09,126
You like Carly.

32
00:01:09,273 --> 00:01:11,288
You need to get back
in the saddle.

33
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:14,375
And luckily, you have
a totally awesome Roomie

34
00:01:14,463 --> 00:01:15,438
who's here to help you.

35
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:18,639
I'm not going on
any more dates.

36
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:21,468
Shaun...
everyone gets it.

37
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:22,853
Dating is stressful.

38
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:25,137
But...
being alone is worse.

39
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:26,320
I'm not alone.

40
00:01:26,408 --> 00:01:29,359
I have you.
I have Dr. Glassman.

41
00:01:29,447 --> 00:01:31,572
Yeah, friends are great,
but everyone needs

42
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,710
- a special friend.
- I don't.

43
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:37,351
- Shaun...
- I'm not like everyone!

44
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:46,705
No one is like everyone.

45
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:48,869
We're all unique.

46
00:01:49,707 --> 00:01:52,947
But we're also
the same.

47

48
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:09,429
I had rent control.

49
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:11,531
The only way for them
to jack the rent

50
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:13,992
- is to get me out,
- so they just make up a reason.

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,836
Said that I was playing
my music too loud.

52
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:20,296
And the all-night parties,
the fighting with the neighbors,

53
00:02:20,384 --> 00:02:22,538
the wandering around the parking
lot without any clothes on?

54
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,437
I had a robe on!

55
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:25,703
And I wasn't wandering.

56
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,296
I was trying
to take the trash out,

57
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:29,017
but they moved
the damn bins.

58
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:31,070
It was windy.

59
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:34,749
Mom, you were clearly
off your meds and drinking.

60
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:36,693
Okay.

61
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:38,562
"Was."

62
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:41,217
It was a temporary setback.

63
00:02:42,113 --> 00:02:43,668
Okay, nobody's perfect,

64
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:44,906
but it is all
under control

65
00:02:44,994 --> 00:02:46,024
- now.
- People with things under control

66
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:48,193
don't show up
at their daughter's at 1:00 a.m.

67
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:49,344
looking for a place to stay.

68
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:51,861
I will be out of your hair
before you even know.

69
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:53,316
Two weeks.

70
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:54,451
Three... tops.

71
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:55,531
One!

72
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:57,924
I don't have time
to babysit a grown woman.

73
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,813
Well, it's three weeks
until the end of the month.

74
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,914
You at least owe me that.

75
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:02,150
No, I don't, actually.

76
00:03:02,238 --> 00:03:03,596
<i>One</i> week.

77
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:07,390
We need some help over here!

78
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,398
Male, 30s, gaping 10-centimeter
laceration to his left cheek.

79
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:12,609
Probable fractured
temporal bone, maxilla,

80
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:14,570
- definitely shattered mandible.
- What happened?

81
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:15,601
He tried to stop
some creeper

82
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:16,696
from groping
a woman on the subway.

83
00:03:16,783 --> 00:03:19,196
Maniac ended up bashing his skull in
with some kid's skateboard.

84
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,329
Wheels broke off,
and the metal axle...

85
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:22,533
did that.

86
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:23,626
Okay,
we need to secure his airway.

87
00:03:23,713 --> 00:03:24,862
His mouth is filling up
with blood.

88
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:26,085
Intubation cart.

89
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:27,956
He has a through-and-through
oral defect,

90
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:29,384
and the mandible is crushed.

91
00:03:29,472 --> 00:03:30,621
We need hemostats.

92
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:31,746
The woman?

93
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:33,009
She's fine.

94
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,422
Cops arrived, tased the dude,
took him away in cuffs.

95
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:37,299
Everybody's fine
except for the hero.

96
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,518
We're gonna need to intubate
through the neck.

97
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:42,894
Betadine, scalpel,
6-0 tube to place surgical cric.

98

100
00:03:57,228 --> 00:03:58,406
Could you do me
a huge favor

101
00:03:58,494 --> 00:03:59,510
and take this
up to Lim's office?

102
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:01,186
- Sure. No problem.
- I'm running late.

103
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:03,458
Melendez is waiting.

104
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,618
Sorry, I had to help Kellan

105
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,244
with a biology project
this morning.

106
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,378
What's in the box?

107
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:09,039
Ducati throw pillow.

108
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,524
You really think
you can bribe Lim with a pillow?

109
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:12,822
I'm not bribing her.
I'm being nice.

110
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:14,521
She's starting a new job
in a new office.

111
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:16,678
Where she'll decide who gets
the first lead surgery.

112
00:04:16,762 --> 00:04:17,919
I'm not stupid enough
to think

113
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:19,975
I can influence her decision
with a gift.

114
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,263
But it never hurts to have
a good relationship with your boss.

115
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,637
And it's a
damn cool pillow.

116
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:29,690
Hey.

117
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:33,201
No signs of any
post-op infection.

118
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:35,256
There's also no sign
your surgery did any good.

119
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:36,672
Tom.

120
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:39,388
How often is he vomiting?

121
00:04:39,473 --> 00:04:40,805
After every feeding.

122
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:42,203
Okay.

123
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:43,288
Shh.

124
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:47,299
This is obviously
not the outcome we had hoped for,

125
00:04:47,382 --> 00:04:50,117
but a pyloric stenosis
requires a cautious approach.

126
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:51,704
If we're too aggressive...

127
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,771
It's okay, buddy.
I got you.

128
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:56,855
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

129
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,183
Our baby is in pain.
He can't eat.

130
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,485
And you don't seem
to have any clue why.

131
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:06,682
I would be upset, too,
if I were in your position.

132
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:07,927
But you're wrong.

133
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:10,634
We need to conduct some tests
to confirm, but I am confident

134
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,272
it's just a matter of
going back in

135
00:05:12,356 --> 00:05:14,104
and making
a tiny adjustment.

136
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,054
Your son's in good hands.

137
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:18,084
Thank you.

138
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,145
I'm sorry. I'm just...

139
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,410
A father
who loves his son.

140
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,530
You've got nothing
to apologize for.

141
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:32,062
That was impressive.

142
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:34,525
Get an abdominal ultrasound
to confirm

143
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,758
it's just an incomplete
pyloromyotomy.

144
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,212
You're wasting your ass-kissing.

145
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,851
First surgery isn't his decision.

146
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:45,034
No.
He's just the one

147
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:46,948
sleeping with the one
making that decision.

148
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:54,144
Pupils are equal
and reactive.

149
00:05:54,232 --> 00:05:55,752
Do you know
where you are?

150
00:05:57,604 --> 00:05:59,567
And do you know
how you ended up here?

151
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,211
Josh, you have multiple fractures

152
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:05,773
in your cheek and jaw,

153
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:08,959
and a large piece
of your cheek tissue, skin,

154
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:11,508
and underlying muscle
was torn off.

155
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:14,314
You're going to need
extensive reconstructive surgery

156
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,843
to save your jaw function.

157
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:18,997
You need
to read these consent forms.

158
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:22,301
And if you have any questions,
write them on this pad.

159
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,641
Was the woman on the subway
a friend of yours?

160
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:30,471
He's a fool.

161
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,399
Trying to prove how macho
you are can get you killed.

162
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:36,301
Clamp the branch
of the inferior alveolar.

163
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:43,050
So, you would just
stand by?

164
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:44,882
Let a woman get groped?

165
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:48,403
Apply manual compression.
Try and close the fracture gap.

166
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:51,136
You help every homeless
drug addict

167
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,291
you see on the subway?

168
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:53,547
I don't.

169
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:54,897
And neither does Browne,

170
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,264
which is why she ought not
get so self-righteous.

171
00:06:57,348 --> 00:06:58,598
Yes.

172
00:06:58,682 --> 00:07:01,384
I help my patients
to the best of my ability

173
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,972
because it's meaningful,

174
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,647
and to me,
the downside is purely financial.

175
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:07,346
For friends,
I'll risk a little bit more,

176
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,550
but the only people
I'm risking life and limb for

177
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:11,940
are my family.

178
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,915
Someone gropes my wife
on the subway,

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,577
they're gonna
get whupped.

180
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:18,799
This isn't gonna work.

181
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:21,316
The mandibular ramus
is just too shattered,

182
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,011
and I can't get
adequate stabilization.

183
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:25,225
We can't do
any skin or muscle grafts

184
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:27,009
if we can't fix
the skeletal structures.

185
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:29,908
Alloplastic augmentation
to bridge the gap?

186
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:31,727
The span is too wide.

187
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:40,543
We're gonna have
to wire him shut.

188
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:43,539
Wake him up.

189
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:45,813
He should know
he's never gonna talk

190
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:47,541
or eat solid food again.

191
00:07:58,531 --> 00:07:59,991
Forever.

192
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,031
Do you have any questions?

193
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:16,946
I'm sorry.

194
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:40,391
The Cantrells want
a new surgeon.

195
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:44,115
What can you tell me
about the first surgery?

196
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:46,824
Is this an M&M review?

197
00:08:47,722 --> 00:08:49,326
Not yet.

198
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,094
Is it possible...

199
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:55,251
you may have been
a little too aggressive?

200
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:56,466
Cut too deeply?

201
00:08:56,908 --> 00:08:58,136
Are you really asking me that?

202
00:08:58,224 --> 00:08:59,794
I need to know.

203
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:04,398
I definitely didn't go
too deep.

204
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:06,182
Great.

205
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:07,987
We'll talk to the Cantrells.

206
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:11,298
Audrey.

207
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:14,392
Is this weird for you?

208
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:18,079
A little. You?

209
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,079
I'm trying
not to let it be.

210
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:21,804
Good.

211
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:23,214
Me too.

212
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,379
Hello.

213
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:32,079
I'm here to pick up artificial
dermal regeneration templates.

214
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:33,271
Let me get it.

215
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:34,679
Hey, Shaun.

216
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,422
I heard
what happened to the guy.

217
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:38,574
Sounds horrible.

218
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:40,225
Is he gonna be okay?

219
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:43,968
He won't be able to eat
or speak normally ever again.

220
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,194
Thank you.

221
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:47,527
Shaun.

222
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:51,132
You seem a bit
uncomfortable.

223
00:09:51,978 --> 00:09:53,740
If it has anything to do
with our date,

224
00:09:53,824 --> 00:09:56,651
I just want you to know,
I had a really good time...

225
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,973
and hope we can do it
again.

226
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:06,850
I had...
a horrible time...

227
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:11,416
and...
don't want to do that ever again.

228
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:24,638
Extensive swelling.

229
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:27,349
But within the acceptable range
of post-op edema.

230
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:29,100
The very top of the range.

231
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:31,583
I think maybe
Melendez did go too deep,

232
00:10:31,668 --> 00:10:32,961
injured the pylorus.

233
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,099
Well?

234
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:36,588
The swelling is within
the acceptable range

235
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,899
for a post-op edema.

236
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:41,497
Got your muffins.
Delicious.

237
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:42,598
I'm glad you liked them.

238
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:43,641
I did.

239
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,746
Just kinda surprised

240
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:46,671
you thought I could be bought
with baked goods.

241
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,031
We're not trying to buy you off
with muffins or a pillow.

242
00:10:49,212 --> 00:10:50,596
Someone got me a pillow?

243
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:56,390
No. I wanted to show you
my support for your promotion.

244
00:10:56,747 --> 00:10:58,768
You're all gonna lead
surgeries... hundreds of them.

245
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:00,883
So it doesn't matter
who does anything first.

246
00:11:00,968 --> 00:11:03,332
The only thing that matters
is that you do it right.

247
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:09,603
So, what was in the box?

248
00:11:09,798 --> 00:11:11,337
Sample marketing
pamphlets.

249
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,671
My buddy owns
a print shop,

250
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,418
asked me to give Lim
some samples.

251
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:16,490
Well played.

252
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:18,030
But it's all moot anyway.

253
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:19,503
It doesn't matter
who goes first.

254
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:20,864
Right.

255
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:22,723
Just so I'm clear, that

256
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,155
"right" was sarcastic, right?

257
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,262
Right.

258
00:11:32,206 --> 00:11:33,236
Hey.

259
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:35,335
Since when does
the President

260
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:37,047
need to stock
his own shelves?

261
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:39,281
When it's a free clinic
and you want it done right.

262
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:42,332
Thank you.

263
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:45,243
Have you ever
had sex in the office?

264
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:46,608
I'm not gonna answer that.

265
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:49,028
First of all,
it's embarrassing if I say yes,

266
00:11:49,177 --> 00:11:51,254
and it's even more embarrassing
if I say no.

267
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,669
I take the fifth.

268
00:11:52,774 --> 00:11:53,988
If we're gonna get married,

269
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:55,482
I need to know all your naughty...

270
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:57,489
I brought us lunch.

271
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,305
I know
what you each like.

272
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:04,363
Dr. Melendez is not
just our best surgeon.

273
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:06,296
He's one of the tops
in the entire country,

274
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,491
with the expertise to know
that the best way

275
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,806
to avoid a truly bad outcome
in this procedure

276
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,744
is to err on the side of caution.

277
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:16,454
- W-We hear all that.
- We do.

278
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,454
And we really appreciate you
taking the time

279
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:19,849
to explain everything.

280
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:25,097
But we would just...
be more comfortable

281
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:27,182
having someone else take over
from here.

282
00:12:27,303 --> 00:12:28,643
You do understand?

283
00:12:29,428 --> 00:12:30,739
Of course.

284
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:32,786
I assume you'd be okay

285
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,819
if I perform
Braden's second surgery?

286
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,044
Eh... the Chief of the department?

287
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:39,101
Eh...

288
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:40,458
Absolutely.

289
00:12:40,548 --> 00:12:41,808
Thank you, Doctor.

290
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:43,470
Of course.

291
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:50,090
Nobody likes dating.

292
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:51,919
It's awkward and
uncomfortable.

293
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:52,954
It's expensive.

294
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,996
Ah. That's why you proposed
after two dates?

295
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:55,995
To save money?

296
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,299
I proposed after two dates
because after one date,

297
00:12:58,383 --> 00:13:00,380
I realized how much
I loved being around you

298
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:02,999
and how much fun
we'd have together.

299
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:06,454
He's right, Shaun,
'cause the fun can be so fun.

300
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:10,505
That didn't happen to me.

301
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,845
I have to go to surgery.

302
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,495
Shaun.

303
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:19,668
Whenever you're ready,
you'll try again.

304
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:26,890
- What?
- Whenever he's ready?

305
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:28,774
He's got to go
at his own pace.

306
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:30,830
He needs to be pushed.

307
00:13:30,915 --> 00:13:31,996
I'm not gonna push him.

308
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:34,163
A man doesn't push another man
into a date.

309
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,458
He pushed <i>you.</i>

310
00:13:35,563 --> 00:13:36,919
Shaun doesn't know
any better.

311
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:38,381
If you want him
to find love,

312
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:41,090
he literally needs to be
pushed into it.

313
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:42,269
Literally?

314
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:44,056
Shaun's not like
other men.

315
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:46,376
Oh, he easily admits
he's wrong?

316
00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:49,409
He easily changes
course?

317
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:54,188
If you don't talk to him,
is anything gonna change?

318
00:13:57,331 --> 00:13:59,742
No good deed goes
unpunished.

319
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:01,724
Why does it always work out
hat way?

320
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,004
It doesn't.

321
00:14:03,294 --> 00:14:05,841
Most good deeds get
rewarded.

322
00:14:06,174 --> 00:14:08,008
And what do you base that on,
Murphy?

323
00:14:08,092 --> 00:14:10,409
Certainly not the news
or the Forbes 500.

324
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:11,374
Or the Bible.

325
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,539
I base it on
neuroscience.

326
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:17,135
Bad outcomes just implant deeper
in our cerebral cortex.

327
00:14:17,302 --> 00:14:18,841
So, evolution agrees
with me.

328
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,210
Our brains encourage us
to be selfish.

329
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:22,430
Yes.

330
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:24,425
Which makes it strange

331
00:14:24,508 --> 00:14:26,820
that people keep being
unselfish.

332
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:28,184
<i>You</i> were.

333
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:32,090
You saved my job.

334
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:35,271
And now you're an attending
instead of the President.

335
00:14:36,953 --> 00:14:38,447
Screws and wire ligature.

336
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:44,665
We're not doing this.

337
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:47,381
We can do better.

338
00:14:48,696 --> 00:14:50,501
There is no
other procedure.

339
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:54,075
We'll invent one.

340
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:03,720
Truce during surgery.

341
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,904
Fair.
What about procedures?

342
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,328
Imaging is fair game.

343
00:15:07,412 --> 00:15:08,795
Anything invasive,
we go to our corners.

344
00:15:08,878 --> 00:15:10,486
Crap.
I left my keys in my locker.

345
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:11,531
Losing my mind.

346
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,066
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Night.

347
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:18,172
What about a muscle graft
from the temporalis?

348
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,061
That wouldn't address
deep mucosa or bone.

349
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:25,001
Unless we took
an osseocutaneous free flap

350
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:26,608
from the radial forearm.

351
00:15:26,778 --> 00:15:28,371
We'd need approximately
2 inches

352
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:30,318
and could use
the natural concavity of...

353
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:32,237
And he could lose
the use of his hand.

354
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,377
That seems like
a reasonable trade-off.

355
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:36,484
I'm not telling this guy
that we can restore his speech

356
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,484
and all it'll cost
is his hand.

357
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:40,155
Because he's a hero?

358
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:42,469
What he did
has nothing to do with it.

359
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:43,742
It's what we can do
that matters.

360
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:46,126
What we can do is
what we were doing.

361
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,551
That's the protocol.

362
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:49,208
Aren't we risking
more damage

363
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:50,584
by leaving him
in an ICU bed

364
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:53,040
while we try to invent
a new treatment?

365
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,486
How about
attaching two free flaps

366
00:15:57,571 --> 00:15:59,908
on vessels
on either side of his neck?

367
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:02,277
Heard from Claire you're having
an all-hands-on-deck sesh.

368
00:16:02,364 --> 00:16:03,336
Happy to join.

369
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,064
Good.
How about Park?

370
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:06,121
He left.

371
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,216
Said he had a thing
with his son.

372
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:11,896
Thankfully, I don't have kids,
so extra hours... not a problem.

373
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,860
Have you considered an
allograft augmentation or a...

374
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,707
Heard y'all were working late,
so I got some coffee.

375
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:20,306
Any way I can help?

376
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:27,890
I want to talk about
our meeting with the Cantrells.

377
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:29,240
On date night?

378
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:32,221
Can it wait... 10 1/2 hours?

379
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,095
I guess.

380
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,393
Thank you.

381
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,658
Have you ever been
to The French Laundry?

382
00:16:38,868 --> 00:16:39,868
No.

383
00:16:40,074 --> 00:16:41,735
We should do
a weekend in Napa.

384
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:44,587
I know this great little B&B
just south of St. Helena...

385
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:46,182
It's not about the Cantrells.

386
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:47,851
It's about
what you said to them.

387
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:50,506
Has it been 10 1/2 hours already?

388
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,096
I "erred on the side of caution."

389
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:55,445
Caution is a good thing.

390
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,670
Err isn't.

391
00:16:57,154 --> 00:16:59,160
I didn't err... not at all.

392
00:16:59,244 --> 00:17:00,659
I was going
to bat for you.

393
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,155
I think that maybe
you're so afraid

394
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,645
of appearing
to favor your boyfriend

395
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,264
that you're overcompensating.

396
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:06,972
Given I think
you may have erred,

397
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:08,619
I'd say I was incredibly supportive.

398
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:10,693
In which case, you went against
your better professional judgment

399
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:11,711
to favor your boyfriend.

400
00:17:11,795 --> 00:17:14,535
So, I'm too supportive
or not supportive enough?

401
00:17:17,284 --> 00:17:19,954
Should I change the reservation
to two tables for one?

402
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:23,820
I've had plenty of
first dates

403
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:25,492
that were
actual disasters.

404
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:27,624
Took one woman
to a Coyotes game,

405
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,175
saw four minutes of it,

406
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:30,628
spent the rest of the night
in the ER

407
00:17:30,712 --> 00:17:34,096
while she got 17 stitches
after being hit by a puck.

408
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,834
We got married
eight months later.

409
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:39,578
Then you divorced her.

410
00:17:40,412 --> 00:17:41,796
It was worth it.

411
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:47,041
We don't have a choice.

412
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,182
Evolution needs us
to propagate,

413
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:52,401
so... it gives us
a shot of happiness

414
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:55,833
every now and again
to suck us in like idiots.

415
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:58,070
To keep us in a game

416
00:17:58,154 --> 00:18:00,355
that we know we're gonna lose
almost every time.

417
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:03,053
Because the upside's like...

418
00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:05,267
nothing else.

419
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:07,740
Love.

420
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,557
But if Shaun really
doesn't need to play, then...

421
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:15,408
good for him.

422
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:18,950
We've officially turned into
an episode of "The Bachelor."

423
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:21,695
Everyone go home.

424
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:23,429
I'm not tired.

425
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:24,732
<i>I</i> am.

426
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:25,870
No.

427
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,242
There are still
a number of possibilities.

428
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:30,835
Murphy, you are smart
and you're creative,

429
00:18:30,954 --> 00:18:34,372
but there are things
you can't do.

430
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:39,095
You can't do miracles.
You can't fix the unfixable.

431
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:01,118
Hey, baby.

432
00:19:02,796 --> 00:19:05,083
You work way too hard.

433
00:19:05,223 --> 00:19:06,810
Yes, I do.

434
00:19:07,317 --> 00:19:09,481
Uh...
let me get you something to eat,

435
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:12,664
'cause I made some pulled pork
and some peanut coleslaw.

436
00:19:12,748 --> 00:19:13,787
No, thanks, Mom.

437
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:15,350
Did you find a place?

438
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,348
I saw one, but it was nasty.

439
00:19:18,432 --> 00:19:19,628
Y-You must be hungry.

440
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:21,352
You saw <i>one,</i>

441
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:23,985
and then you
came home and cooked?

442
00:19:26,402 --> 00:19:27,598
Yes.

443
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:30,845
I came home
and cooked dinner for my daughter.

444
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:33,036
I'm trying, Claire.

445
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:34,787
Okay, I'm taking my meds.

446
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:36,568
I'm seeing Dr. Donovan.

447
00:19:36,652 --> 00:19:39,003
I am
doing my best.

448
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:42,507
I've heard that before.

449
00:19:46,823 --> 00:19:48,461
You got six days.

450
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,703
Shaun, you need sleep.

451
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:14,175
Your neurons will be sparkier
in the morning.

452
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:18,331
There are 640 muscles
and 206 bones in the body,

453
00:20:18,415 --> 00:20:20,847
but only 284 and 72 of those

454
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:22,203
are of sufficient size
for our grafts,

455
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:27,206
but that still leaves 20,448
possible permutations.

456
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:30,492
It's not unfixable
until I rule out every...

457
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:34,101
So, some anatomy problem,
you won't give up on,

458
00:20:34,185 --> 00:20:35,667
but after one date,

459
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:40,008
you think you've explored
all the possible permutations?

460
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,557
Stop distracting me.

461
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:44,999
I'm distracting you?

462
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:47,357
By talking about you?
By talking about love?

463
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:50,361
Yes.
I... I need to concentrate.

464
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:52,220
Okay.

465
00:20:52,304 --> 00:20:53,350
I'll shut up.

466
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:54,487
You're still talking.

467
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:55,864
Good night, Shaun.

468
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:57,308
You're still...

469
00:20:57,393 --> 00:20:59,293
We only have 206 bones?

470
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:01,194
- Still talking.
- Oh...

471
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,444
Yes.

472
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,904
Shaun?

473
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:34,956
I think we should talk.

474
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:36,731
So did Lea.

475
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:39,717
But I have to find a solution
for an oromandibular defect

476
00:21:39,802 --> 00:21:41,493
that doesn't involve
titanium plates,

477
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,968
356 of our muscles,
or 134 of our bones.

478
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:47,411
I don't think you never want
to see me again.

479
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:50,927
I have to find a solution
for an oromandibular...

480
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:52,119
We have to talk.

481
00:21:52,218 --> 00:21:53,827
You owe me that much.

482
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:05,815
Why do I owe you that much?

483
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,648
Because I thought
we had a nice time.

484
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:11,170
And I thought
you were a nice guy...

485
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:14,014
an honest guy...
and I still think you are,

486
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,298
and I'm confused
about how you feel

487
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:18,131
and about how I feel
about how you feel,

488
00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:20,035
and I just need
to talk about it.

489
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:24,746
So, if you have any feelings
for me at all,

490
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,359
you'll help me
understand.

491
00:22:36,698 --> 00:22:38,121
Okay.

492
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,525
My little sister, Andie,
has autism.

493
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,018
We're not all the same.

494
00:22:45,383 --> 00:22:46,602
I know.

495
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:52,162
I think growing up with Andie
helps me understand you.

496
00:22:53,482 --> 00:22:56,136
But it also makes me
wonder about myself.

497
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,809
And did I date you
to prove something?

498
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,998
Did I date you to...

499
00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:06,092
somehow make things
better for Andie?

500
00:23:08,078 --> 00:23:09,934
I don't think I did,
but...

501
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:15,722
My point is...

502
00:23:16,435 --> 00:23:18,822
I have questions, too,
Shaun.

503
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:22,407
Trying to figure out
what we want

504
00:23:22,492 --> 00:23:25,164
and why we want it
and is it good for us

505
00:23:25,315 --> 00:23:26,816
are good questions.

506
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:30,819
And they can't all be answered
over one dinner.

507
00:23:39,621 --> 00:23:41,009
I have to go.

508
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:08,883
Murphy...

509
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,762
I've... I've got it!

510
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:14,252
I've got it!

511
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,631
We take
a vascularized free flap

512
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:22,049
and suture it
to the facial artery and vein,

513
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,828
then flip up the pectoralis.

514
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,567
It's a great idea.

515
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:30,526
We're not doing it.

516
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,937
It's never been tried before.

517
00:24:33,052 --> 00:24:36,024
Risk 1...
graft failure brings infection

518
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,992
and he loses
the other half of his face.

519
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,168
Risk 2... sepsis and he dies.

520
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:41,142
Risk 3...

521
00:24:41,227 --> 00:24:42,345
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
risk whatever.

522
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:43,710
We do the standard procedure,

523
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:45,155
the guy never speaks
or eats again.

524
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,803
Dr. Murphy, could you please
give us a minute?

525
00:24:59,713 --> 00:25:01,213
Why do you want to do this?

526
00:25:01,586 --> 00:25:03,803
You've been my boss
for a few hours,

527
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:06,406
and you're already
questioning my motivations?

528
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,209
You fell on your sword for Shaun,

529
00:25:08,293 --> 00:25:10,583
and your reward
for your act of heroism

530
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,098
was getting fired.

531
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,840
And now you're back here,
answerable to me.

532
00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:18,125
I imagine
you've been asking yourself

533
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:19,648
if it was worth it.

534
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:26,975
Your issues with the procedure
are valid,

535
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,088
but at least let me put them
before the patient.

536
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,438
He'll say yes.

537
00:25:30,617 --> 00:25:32,101
I won't sugarcoat the risks.

538
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:33,826
He'll say yes
anyway.

539
00:25:33,944 --> 00:25:36,002
He <i>wants</i> to believe
things will work out.

540
00:25:36,228 --> 00:25:37,890
That's why he's a hero.

541
00:25:38,386 --> 00:25:40,154
Sometimes the hero loses.

542
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:42,837
Which is why he's got to learn
when to stand back

543
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,006
when there's nothing
he can do to help.

544
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,156
Are you going to order me
to stand back?

545
00:25:56,636 --> 00:25:57,974
No.

546
00:26:03,444 --> 00:26:04,719
Hey, Shaun?

547
00:26:04,974 --> 00:26:06,111
You got a minute?

548
00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:07,583
Okay.

549
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,338
Debbie wanted me to talk to you.

550
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,511
To tell you...

551
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:14,863
not to give up on love.

552
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,025
Don't give up on love.

553
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:22,621
Okay.

554
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:25,299
Do you want me to let her know
you told me?

555
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:26,744
Yes, please.

556
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:30,783
Hey, Shaun?

557
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,435
I know this, uh, dating thing
can be scary.

558
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,908
You're good at dating.

559
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,107
Well, before Debbie,
the last time I went on a date,

560
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,836
"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"
was the big hit.

561
00:26:41,248 --> 00:26:43,684
'Cause a-a-after Maddie
and the divorce,

562
00:26:43,788 --> 00:26:46,156
I kind of shut down
for a while.

563
00:26:46,695 --> 00:26:48,537
Yeah, I... and it felt better

564
00:26:48,621 --> 00:26:50,965
to be in a place
where I couldn't get hurt.

565
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:54,057
But then,
last year, I got my diagnosis,

566
00:26:54,141 --> 00:26:55,174
I thought
I was gonna die,

567
00:26:55,257 --> 00:26:57,689
and Debbie came into my life,
and I said to myself,

568
00:26:57,835 --> 00:26:59,753
"I-I-I don't want to be
safe anymore."

569
00:26:59,838 --> 00:27:00,847
You know?

570
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,522
I want to... I want to...
I want to feel alive.

571
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:06,553
And... And if I get hurt,
I get hurt.

572
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:08,189
That's part of the deal.

573
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,311
Morgan says
it's biological,

574
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,279
that it doesn't make sense.

575
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:15,574
Morgan's right.

576
00:27:15,658 --> 00:27:17,207
So <i>I'm</i> right?

577
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,592
No. No.

578
00:27:21,129 --> 00:27:22,326
Look, I...

579
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:24,514
it's wonderful,
this love thing.

580
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:26,325
Why should it make any sense?

581
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,440
When I think about the reasons
I-I'm in love with Debbie,

582
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,928
okay, she's...
she's kind, she's funny,

583
00:27:32,012 --> 00:27:33,601
she's... she's loving.

584
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:35,623
But that's not it.
Not really.

585
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:38,543
Don't tell her this,

586
00:27:38,628 --> 00:27:40,028
but there are other people
in the world

587
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:41,236
that are kinder,
that are funnier,

588
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,278
that are more loving
than she is,

589
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:46,469
but she makes me happy...
just being around her.

590
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,570
It makes absolutely
no sense,

591
00:27:49,122 --> 00:27:51,139
but I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

592
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,447
Okay.

593
00:28:10,017 --> 00:28:11,852
I have an ethical dilemma.

594
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:15,162
I was going through
state regulations

595
00:28:15,246 --> 00:28:16,271
for medical staff...

596
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,151
specifically, residents...

597
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,670
and their new guidelines
have raised an issue for me.

598
00:28:21,045 --> 00:28:23,185
The state caps residents
at 80 hours a week,

599
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:25,391
but I don't think
that's nearly enough.

600
00:28:25,474 --> 00:28:26,799
I work over 100,

601
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:28,064
and I don't plan
on cutting back,

602
00:28:28,147 --> 00:28:30,497
so I'm wondering
how I should be reporting my hours.

603
00:28:30,582 --> 00:28:33,138
Park offered to co-write a paper
with me.

604
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,330
What a suck-up.

605
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,416
I said yes.

606
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,277
It's an interesting case.
It should be written up.

607
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,372
So he's...

608
00:28:39,457 --> 00:28:40,920
Gonna do a lot of work
for nothing.

609
00:28:41,046 --> 00:28:43,168
Except for the good
of the medical community.

610
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:45,804
And I'm gonna tell you
what I told him...

611
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,597
if you come to me
with one more favor,

612
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,860
one more humblebrag,

613
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:51,564
if I suspect either of you
have your lips puckered,

614
00:28:51,753 --> 00:28:53,447
you're going to the bottom
of the list.

615
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:54,822
Yes, ma'am.

616
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:01,320
Dr. Lim?

617
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,203
Do you ever think about
what it means,

618
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:05,665
me doing all this?

619
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:07,613
Means you've
underestimated me.

620
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:09,292
Maybe.

621
00:29:09,605 --> 00:29:11,569
But it also means
that I care.

622
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:14,888
That getting the first surgery
means something to me...

623
00:29:14,973 --> 00:29:16,205
enough for me to go out

624
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:17,929
and really overspend
on designer desserts

625
00:29:18,012 --> 00:29:19,881
and then to spend
even more time

626
00:29:19,965 --> 00:29:21,929
trying to make them look
homemade.

627
00:29:22,222 --> 00:29:24,206
If I'm putting that much effort
into muffins,

628
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,599
imagine how hard
I'll work

629
00:29:25,684 --> 00:29:27,106
to make the most
of this opportunity

630
00:29:27,191 --> 00:29:28,769
if it's given to me.

631
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,899
With considerable
physio and speech therapy,

632
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:42,232
this graft would allow you to not
only chew and swallow whole foods,

633
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:44,458
but it would enable you
to talk again.

634
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:49,859
It's an untested procedure
with not-insignificant risks.

635
00:29:49,994 --> 00:29:51,160
If the graft doesn't take,

636
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:54,108
more skin and bone
could become infected,

637
00:29:54,316 --> 00:29:55,637
possibly necrotic.

638
00:30:00,947 --> 00:30:02,659
We need to know
you understand.

639
00:30:02,804 --> 00:30:04,751
It's an experimental procedure.

640
00:30:04,835 --> 00:30:07,358
In addition to all of
the usual surgical risks,

641
00:30:07,443 --> 00:30:09,331
there are all of the unknowns...

642
00:30:09,622 --> 00:30:11,970
bleeding out,
permanent graft loss,

643
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:13,533
stroke...

644
00:30:13,815 --> 00:30:15,173
death.

645
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,376
Good for you, Josh.

646
00:30:40,504 --> 00:30:42,085
Get him prepped.

647
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:44,639
Okay.

648
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:47,134
Infuse carbon dioxide.

649
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,027
Grasping duodenum
just distal of the pylorus.

650
00:30:56,177 --> 00:30:57,999
Huh. Look at that.

651
00:30:58,259 --> 00:30:59,848
That's not good.

652
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,408
Page Dr. Melendez.

653
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:06,832
An intussusception.

654
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,064
The telescoped bowel
is causing a blockage.

655
00:31:09,152 --> 00:31:10,923
The baby had
two unrelated conditions

656
00:31:11,008 --> 00:31:12,365
causing
the same symptom.

657
00:31:12,477 --> 00:31:13,904
We only know
about the second condition

658
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:15,318
because of
he first surgery.

659
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,732
Treatment protocol
is a barium enema,

660
00:31:18,061 --> 00:31:19,755
but not for someone
Braden's age.

661
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:21,398
An <i>air</i> enema might work.

662
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:23,076
Unless the intestine's torn.

663
00:31:24,537 --> 00:31:26,606
Morgan, reposition the scope

664
00:31:26,694 --> 00:31:28,319
to get a better look
at the intestinal wall

665
00:31:28,406 --> 00:31:30,079
around
the intussusception site.

666
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:35,364
There's too much swelling
and edema to be sure.

667
00:31:35,448 --> 00:31:37,479
With the risk of infection,
we don't have time to find out.

668
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,157
You're gonna have
to open him up.

669
00:31:39,242 --> 00:31:40,562
<i>You</i> should.

670
00:31:41,055 --> 00:31:42,803
The Cantrells made
their wishes clear.

671
00:31:42,888 --> 00:31:44,873
Well, that's when I made them think
you'd erred,

672
00:31:44,962 --> 00:31:46,122
which you did not...

673
00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:47,367
not on the side of caution...

674
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:48,713
not at all.

675
00:31:49,954 --> 00:31:51,567
We do the surgery together.

676
00:31:52,216 --> 00:31:53,267
Who's the lead?

677
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,612
I think you know.

678
00:31:54,805 --> 00:31:55,787
Pulling rank?

679
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:56,979
Absolutely.

680
00:31:57,405 --> 00:32:00,263
As Chief of Surgery,
I designate you.

681
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:02,260
It's like a puzzle.

682
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:03,802
You secure to the artery,

683
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:06,613
then the vessel just won't quite
stretch to the vein.

684
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:10,556
You could mobilize
the recipient vessel.

685
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:12,864
Repeat that, Dr. Browne.

686
00:32:12,949 --> 00:32:16,037
Mobilize the recipient vessel
to create more slack.

687
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:22,086
You saw Carly again.

688
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:23,176
How was it?

689
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,875
Inconvenient.

690
00:32:25,007 --> 00:32:26,884
But despite her intrusion,

691
00:32:27,023 --> 00:32:29,621
I was still able
to concentrate on medicine.

692
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:31,639
That wasn't an intrusion.
That was a date.

693
00:32:31,776 --> 00:32:33,164
It was walking.

694
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:36,193
Walking with someone you like
who likes you, too,

695
00:32:36,276 --> 00:32:37,403
is a non-date date.

696
00:32:37,487 --> 00:32:39,229
Some of the best dates
that I have had

697
00:32:39,313 --> 00:32:41,634
did not involve flowers
and restaurant reservations.

698
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:42,958
Just...

699
00:32:43,235 --> 00:32:46,052
sharing a bag of chips
and sitting on a couch.

700
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:48,701
Secured.

701
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:50,296
Remove clamps.

702
00:32:52,423 --> 00:32:54,590
Blood flow to and from graft.

703
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:56,756
Let's move on to
the pectoralis flap.

704
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:58,879
Blood pressure's dropping.

705
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,911
Okay. Heart rate is up.

706
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:02,903
Push IV fluids,
give epinephrine 1 milligram,

707
00:33:02,987 --> 00:33:04,227
then start a drip.

708
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:07,193
There's intestinal wall perforation.

709
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,505
Repairable?

710
00:33:09,703 --> 00:33:11,422
There's too much
tissue damage.

711
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:12,614
Infection?

712
00:33:12,698 --> 00:33:13,872
No sign of peritonitis,

713
00:33:13,956 --> 00:33:16,227
but we'll need to remove
this section of bowel.

714
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:21,851
- He's tachy.
- Hypotensive.

715
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:23,776
Push vasopressors
and antibiotics.

716
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:26,128
Check an iSTAT hematocrit,
ABG.

717
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,712
Give two units PRBCs.

718
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,797
I don't see
any major bleeding.

719
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,836
Push more fluids,
start an inotrope.

720
00:33:31,996 --> 00:33:34,513
Check all vessels we worked on
for clots with the Doppler.

721
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:35,719
Okay.

722
00:33:41,531 --> 00:33:43,390
Large clot in the carotid.

723
00:33:43,474 --> 00:33:44,864
Clamps back on,

724
00:33:44,948 --> 00:33:46,568
performing
carotid arteriotomy.

725
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:48,257
Will try to aspirate out the clot.

726
00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:49,793
Stand by with heparin.

727
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,531
Carotid clot removed.

728
00:34:03,161 --> 00:34:04,856
EEG looking good.

729
00:34:05,357 --> 00:34:07,568
Resuming pectoralis flap dissection.

730
00:34:09,492 --> 00:34:10,995
Good work, everybody.

731
00:34:44,903 --> 00:34:46,427
Go ahead... say something.

732
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:48,831
Yeah, you can talk.

733
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:50,514
Maybe not
too much at first...

734
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,209
give the jaw a chance
to heal.

735
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:56,674
Thank you.

736
00:35:01,023 --> 00:35:03,390
On behalf of all of us,
you're very welcome.

737
00:35:04,723 --> 00:35:07,395
The woman who was being accosted
when you intervened is here.

738
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:09,512
Is she all right?

739
00:35:09,597 --> 00:35:10,928
She's not here as a patient.

740
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:13,724
She's been...
waiting to see you.

741
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:15,367
Okay?

742
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:25,312
Hello.

743
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:27,221
Hey.

744
00:35:27,845 --> 00:35:30,565
I am so sorry
this happened.

745
00:35:30,968 --> 00:35:32,408
Me too.

746
00:35:33,459 --> 00:35:34,665
You look...

747
00:35:34,914 --> 00:35:37,408
When the swelling goes down,
he'll look a lot better.

748
00:35:38,341 --> 00:35:39,619
It's okay.

749
00:35:39,819 --> 00:35:41,898
My face was never
my fortune.

750
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:45,937
What made you do it?

751
00:35:47,223 --> 00:35:49,002
Why did you step in?

752
00:35:51,173 --> 00:35:52,515
I don't know.

753
00:35:54,357 --> 00:35:55,740
You needed help.

754
00:36:03,277 --> 00:36:05,056
Olivia, by the way.

755
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:06,240
Josh.

756
00:36:06,325 --> 00:36:07,872
We'll let you two
get acquainted.

757
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:18,336
It didn't matter who got
the first lead surgery... to me.

758
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,213
But it's recently
been brought to my attention

759
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,622
how much
it might mean to some of you.

760
00:36:23,759 --> 00:36:26,492
Seems I'd forgotten
how important this decision is

761
00:36:26,576 --> 00:36:28,504
when you've been
dreaming about it for years.

762
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:31,696
You're all excellent candidates,
each deserving,

763
00:36:31,795 --> 00:36:33,412
and will all get your turn.

764
00:36:34,396 --> 00:36:35,631
Starting with Dr. Browne.

765
00:36:35,716 --> 00:36:36,898
Yes!

766
00:36:37,824 --> 00:36:39,136
Thank you.

767
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,214
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

768
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:51,615
What the hell was that?

769
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,395
I was happy
for a colleague.

770
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,029
You weren't campaigning for you
to win.

771
00:36:55,114 --> 00:36:56,901
You were campaigning for me
to lose.

772
00:36:57,527 --> 00:36:59,771
Do you dislike me
that much?

773
00:37:00,276 --> 00:37:02,168
I just wouldn't want you
supervising me

774
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,204
as Chief Resident.

775
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:05,197
You'd be
a nightmare of a boss.

776
00:37:13,644 --> 00:37:15,045
Shaun.

777
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:19,580
Dr. Lim thought my motives
for fighting this hard

778
00:37:19,665 --> 00:37:21,654
for this patient were
miscalculated.

779
00:37:23,686 --> 00:37:24,998
She was right.

780
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,598
We shouldn't have saved
his face?

781
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:30,571
We have limited resources,
and we're even more limited

782
00:37:30,656 --> 00:37:33,099
in our personal capacity
to determine who is deserving,

783
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:35,597
so we make a choice
to treat everyone the same.

784
00:37:35,812 --> 00:37:39,203
So why did you treat
this patient differently?

785
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:41,466
Because I was angry.

786
00:37:42,285 --> 00:37:44,783
I made a sacrifice
to save you.

787
00:37:45,808 --> 00:37:48,597
I lost my job,
I took a substantial demotion.

788
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,449
And I thought I was a fool.

789
00:37:50,547 --> 00:37:53,345
The cost was way too high.

790
00:37:53,736 --> 00:37:55,448
I resented you, and I...

791
00:37:55,735 --> 00:37:57,558
kind of resented the universe.

792
00:38:00,484 --> 00:38:02,147
But today...

793
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:05,558
..you made me
proud of my sacrifice.

794
00:38:07,144 --> 00:38:08,435
Thank you.

795
00:38:11,503 --> 00:38:12,962
You're welcome.

796
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,138
Very few things
that are worthwhile in life

797
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:19,444
come without a cost,
Shaun.

798
00:38:39,607 --> 00:38:40,917
This is tricky.

799
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,291
I feel like we were just tested
and both of us failed.

800
00:38:46,217 --> 00:38:47,554
But...

801
00:38:48,057 --> 00:38:49,560
we'll get better at this.

802
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:03,078
Hey, honey.

803
00:39:03,162 --> 00:39:05,381
I'll make you a plate, and you
can take it to your room.

804
00:39:06,247 --> 00:39:07,557
Thanks.

805
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:10,522
I saw three more apartments today.

806
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:11,722
One was kind of nice,

807
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,880
but it's not ready
until a week from this Tuesday,

808
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:17,680
which puts me over your deadline
by three days.

809
00:39:20,498 --> 00:39:21,682
No.

810
00:39:23,263 --> 00:39:24,327
Three days?
Come on.

811
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:25,781
You can stay here.

812
00:39:26,418 --> 00:39:30,480
For a little while,
until you're a bit better.

813
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:33,058
But you have to stay
on your meds.

814
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:34,982
And keep away from other drugs
and alcohol.

815
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:36,610
I'm testing your urine
every two days.

816
00:39:36,695 --> 00:39:39,503
Don't miss <i>any</i> appointments
with Dr. Donovan.

817
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:41,872
Can you live with that?

818
00:39:56,956 --> 00:39:58,634
Do you have a couch?

819

2
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,486
This is Andrews' fault.

3
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,354
Agreed.

4
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:23,057
The bourbon may also bear
some responsibility.

5
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:24,358
Agreed.

6
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,361
You said "fault."

7
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:31,799
You don't regret that we...
No, not at all.

8
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:34,001
Seriously.

9
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,604
It was...

10
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:37,805
Pretty great.

11
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,074
Yeah.

12
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:42,410
And definitely shouldn't
happen again.

13
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,813
No, it shouldn't.

14
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,715
It'd make things
too complicated at work.

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,519
Let's chalk it up to,

16
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,522
"Andrews screwed us, so we
screwed each other" impulse.

17
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,727
I gotta get going.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,195
I'm covering the E.R. today.

19
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,365
Ooh, right before Christmas?

20
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,500
Gonna be a madhouse.

21
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,702
Yeah.

00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,543
"Jingle Bells"?

31
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,245
Two ambulances coming in,
back-to-back.

32
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,416
Hey. I need you on
your game today, Murphy.

33
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,484
Okay.

34
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,295
Male, mid-30s,

35
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:08,568
found unresponsive in Arrivals.

36
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,498
Restarted his heart
on site. Low O2,

37
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,642
wheezing, significant airway
resistance to the bag mask...

38
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,768
We need more hands on deck.
STAT. I've been calling,

39
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,112
everyone's left town
for the holidays.

40
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,338
Reznick's around.

41
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,615
Weird you know that,
but glad you do.

42
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,807
Get Reznick in here. On it.

43
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,942
Take him to Bay 4.
Murphy, I need you with me.

44
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,478
What do we got?

45
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,752
This is Marianne Southam, she
collapsed in Baggage Claim.

46
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,158
Both patients came
from the airport?

47
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,659
It's that time of year.
Everyone's traveling.

48
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,485
Right leg is red and swollen.

49
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,163
She's complaining of chest
pains, shortness of breath,

50
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,488
and she has a low-grade fever.

51
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,424
Did you just get
off a long flight?

52
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:38,359
20 hours, from Malaysia.

53
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:41,329
Deep vein thrombosis formed
while she was seated,

54
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,130
that explains the red leg
and the fever.

55
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,074
Part of the clot broke off,
traveled to her lung,

56
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,935
that explains the chest pain.
Pulmonary embolism.

57
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,203
We lost his pulse again!

58
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,139
Take Marianne to Bay 5.

59
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,242
I'll talk you through managing
a pulmonary embolism.

60
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,377
I'm gonna light him up.

61
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,678
Clear.

62
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,351
Got a rhythm. Barely.

63
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,661
He can't live
on 30 beats a minute.

64
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,620
His lungs are too stiff
to pre-oxygenate.

65
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,756
Fiberoptic blade
and a 7.5 ET tube.

66
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:14,328
Murphy, anti-coagulate her with
a 5,000-unit heparin bolus.

67
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,970
Set the ventilator
to assist control.

68
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,343
Heparin bolus infused.
Fever's spiking at 103.5.

69
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,345
Could be ARDS
from a viral pneumonia.

70
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,013
Get a chest X-ray.

71
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,148
Lost him again.

72
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:39,353
O2 SAT is 92.

73
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,021
Your chest pain
should be getting better.

74
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,690
It is. Thank you.

75
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,124
Peak airway pressure's 50.

76
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,694
Switch the ventilator to PRVC.

77
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,128
Pushing I.V. epinephrine.

78
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,565
Now you need to insert a central
line in case we go to thrombolysis.

79
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,244
I need you, Murphy.

80
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,516
Still V. Fib.

81
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:09,917
Push 300 of amiodarone.

82
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,526
Asystole.
He's still not responding.

83
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,762
That's over 30 minutes
of brain and cardiac hypoxia.

84
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,267
Stop compressions.

85
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,139
Time of death, 1007.

86
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,814
Have you had contact
with this man?

87
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,652
He was on my flight
from Malaysia.

88
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:48,989
They both have vesicular
rashes on their necks.

89
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,560
Whatever infection killed him,
she may have it, too.

90
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,381
This is a negative
pressure room,

91
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:14,982
designed so no air flows out.

92
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,917
Keeps germs from spreading.

93
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,552
Because whatever I have
is gonna kill me,

94
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:19,863
just like the man
from the plane?

95
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,122
Your symptoms are not
as severe as his.

96
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,292
Although, yours
will probably get worse

97
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,695
as the virus progresses.

98
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,330
We don't know for sure whether
you have the same thing.

99
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:33,934
We know nothing about him,
his condition, or his history.

100
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,436
When did you start feeling sick?

101
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:36,870
On the plane.

102
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,941
I've never even been
outside the U.S. before.

103
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,477
My ex-husband hated
to travel and...

104
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,217
Was the man who died
sitting near you?

105
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,154
No, he was six or seven rows
in front of me.

106
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:58,426
Were you ever physically
close to him?

107
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,429
Say, waiting for the restroom
or in line to board?

108
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:04,031
No, I think he slept
almost the entire flight.

109
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:08,101
That suggests the virus can
be transmitted in the air.

110
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:10,971
Which means everyone
in the plane

111
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,441
and this emergency room
has been exposed.

112
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,713
We'll start conditioning
tomorrow,

113
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,324
so we use chemo and
total body irradiation to...

114
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,084
To wipe out my crappy
leukemia-producing bone marrow

115
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,854
so you can replace it with
some good stuff. Well said.

116
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,690
Looks like your dad's good
to go on his marrow donation.

117
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,803
Please don't call him that.

118
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:35,463
Bob Cravens walked out on me
and my mom when I was four.

119
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,998
His biological material
gave me life,

120
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,342
and apparently
he's gonna save me,

121
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,400
but he's not my dad.

122
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:44,438
Any unusual complaints or pain
we should know about?

123
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:46,940
I've been tired.

124
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:48,676
And the last day, achy,

125
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,411
kind of stiff...
Standard leukemia woes.

126
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,114
Anywhere in particular?

127
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,585
My neck, left arm.

128
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,787
Right, Chris, you're
having a heart attack.

129
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,923
N-No. My chest feels fine.

130
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,434
We need to get you up
to radiation right away.

131
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,093
Call and let them know
we're coming.

132
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,861
Get his donor in here.

133
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,597
How is radiation gonna help
a heart attack?

134
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,666
Your blockage is most likely
excess blast white cells.

135
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,101
The best way
to clear out your heart

136
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,174
is to treat your leukemia.

137
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,939
It's what we planned.
Just a day early.

138
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,612
It might not be airborne.

139
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,322
Maybe both passengers
were already infected

140
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,748
when they got on the plane.

141
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,883
Marianne said she felt fine
before the flight.

142
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,919
But even if she did
contract it on the plane,

143
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,463
it could've been
through a shared water cup

144
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,555
or napkin...

145
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,456
Which would make
a quarantine unnecessary.

146
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,428
I'll call the Public
Health Department, the CDC,

147
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,872
they may want
to track the passengers

148
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,431
and anyone they
came into contact with.

149
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,167
Keep me up to date. Okay.

150
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,771
Hey. I'm done.

151
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,073
Jill, are you still on?

152
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,609
Get me the CDC
and a change of clothes.

153
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:57,545
I'm coming in.

154
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,279
Thanks for getting me
called in, Tyler.

155
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,348
You're welcome.
That was sarcasm.

156
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,316
Was it?
If this turns into a crisis,

157
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,752
where else would you want to be?

158
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,821
I hear you're having
some stomach pain?

159
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,122
It hurts a lot.

160
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,925
I figured it was probably the candy
canes, but I took some Pepto.

161
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,026
Didn't help at all.

162
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,562
How many candy canes we talking?

163
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,196
Three or four... Dozen.

164
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,965
Of the little ones.

165
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,442
They pass them out
at the mall where I work.

166
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,368
I like to munch on them.
Keeps me in character.

167
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,170
Sounds like you might
be overdoing it.

168
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,638
Take off your shirt.

169
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,775
How did you know I was
still in town?

170
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,146
Because the holidays are
"an obligatory performance

171
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,615
"where families buy
each other gifts

172
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:35,959
and pretend everything
is perfect."

173
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,927
Which is why you tell yours
you have to work every year

174
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,620
even when you don't.

175
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,156
He's a good listener.

176
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,326
What's that scar from?

177
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,829
Rudolph is an ass.

178
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,632
It's a minor bowel resection

179
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,867
for diverticulitis
eight months ago.

180
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,803
We need to do a contrast CT.

181
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,006
You need to come with me.

182
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,676
Dr. Lim, he has it, too.

183
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,077
There, on his neck. A rash.

184
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,178
It wasn't there earlier.

185
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,784
It hasn't fully developed, but
it could be the same thing.

186
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,485
It can't be.
I had on a mask, gloves...

187
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,022
Did you keep on the mask
the whole time?

188
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,324
Not... With airborne diseases,
that's important...

189
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,236
It's Marianne.
Her O2 SATs are crashing.

190
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,980
Get another dose of
I.V. methylprednisolone.

191
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,499
We need to move up
the transplant.

192
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,068
No, it doesn't change anything.

193
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,739
You'll be anesthetized,
you won't feel a thing

194
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,406
and when you wake up,

195
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,943
your son will be on his
way to being healthy.

196
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,216
We'll see you soon.

197
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,055
Sorry I couldn't meet you
at the airport.

198
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,457
That's a cool t-shirt.

199
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,525
It probably freaks
you out, right?

200
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,063
Like, "is he gonna
gender-transition or something?"

201
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,065
No, if that's your thing,
I'm cool.

202
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,235
How long am I stuck here?

203
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,603
Just for the rest of this shift.

204
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,272
And then I'm out of here
for three days.

205
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,240
There's a new rock-climbing
gym we can check out,

206
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,608
and the batting cages.

207
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,011
I'm good.

208
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,113
I got a season of
"Rick and Morty" on my phone.

209
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,020
Clear.

210
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,530
That's six rounds of defib.
And 30 minutes of CPR.

211
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,434
Okay, Dr. Murphy, you can stop.

212
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,751
I just spoke with Dr. Andrews.

213
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:53,286
We're on soft quarantine
while he consults the Board.

214
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,289
Call dispatch, put all
ambulances on diversion.

215
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,991
Do your best to stop
all walk-ins.

216
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,928
Say we're at capacity
and send them to County.

217
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,129
Stall all discharges.

218
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,798
Tyler stays in isolation
and on antivirals.

219
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,367
Fever is likely the next
stage, so keep a close eye.

220
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,668
What else are we dealing with?

221
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,071
I always have lunch by 200.

222
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,807
It's 215. I need to eat.

223
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,709
I've got a banana in my bag
if you want it.

224
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:16,944
A banana isn't lunch.

225
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,712
A turkey sandwich and milk
is lunch.

226
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,513
Dr. Murphy, patients first,

227
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,149
then we'll work
on that sandwich.

228
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,184
What else? 60-year-old
woman with angina,

229
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,528
visiting her family
for the holidays.

230
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,630
Forgot her blood pressure meds.
Came in for a prescription.

231
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,557
Her refill just got delayed.
What else?

232
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,836
The crib was almost finished
when the screwdriver slipped.

233
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,995
My family doctor's closed
for the holidays.

234
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,830
They would've sent you
here anyway.

235
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,299
This type of injury can
cause permanent damage.

236
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:42,535
Makes me feel less guilty for
bringing my baby into a germ pit.

237
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,538
No offense.

238
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,608
Guessing this is your first?

239
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,112
My husband and I
waited a long time.

240
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,114
I want everything to be perfect.

241
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:57,150
Which, as my husband
reminds me, is impossible.

242
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,420
Yet, my birth plan
is five pages long.

243
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,556
All closed up.

244
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,925
So I can go home?

245
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,161
Not before we do a nerve study.

246
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,275
I would hate for you to lose
feeling in your fingers.

247
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,500
You can't leave.

248
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,535
I'm sorry. What?
Hospital policy.

249
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,370
Look, I'm... I'm not a patient.

250
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,615
All right, I just came down here to
get some chips. My dad's a doctor.

251
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,341
Who's your dad? Dr. Alex Park.

252
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:23,343
Can you call him?

253
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,578
My phone's charging upstairs.

254
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,791
I'll call him, so he knows where
to come find you when he's free.

255
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,216
But for now,
you've got to stay put.

256
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,186
Why? Because I'm older than you.

257
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,596
Find the employee contact
list, call Park.

258
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,899
He should know where his son is.
Sure.

259
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,774
I feel so much worse than when
I was having a heart attack.

260
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:55,943
I don't doubt it.

261
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,878
Because of the urgency
of your situation,

262
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:01,581
we used combined leukapheresis,
chemo, and radiation.

263
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,459
You're no longer at risk for
another heart attack or stroke.

264
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,119
And I also no longer
have an immune system.

265
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,757
My donor's on his way, right?

266
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,830
I spoke with him. He said
he was getting in his car.

267
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,627
When was that?

268
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,030
I'll follow up.

269
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:26,940
He's still finding
new ways to let me down.

270
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,380
I thought you guys
were gonna do a C.T.

271
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,983
We're doing a KUB X-ray instead.

272
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,250
It's almost as good.

273
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,853
Why would you go with "almost"?

274
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,471
Can you hear that?

275
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,843
Hear what? Excuse me.

276
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,178
I'm looking for a patient.

277
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,322
You'll need to speak
with a nurse.

278
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,981
I've been waiting
to speak to a nurse.

279
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,450
You must hear that.
The light is buzzing.

280
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,851
I don't hear anything. It's loud

281
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,286
and very distracting.

282
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,488
It needs to be fixed.

283
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,300
You like Italian?

284
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,569
La Nostra?

285
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,638
It's great.

286
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,341
Barbecue? Ethiopian?

287
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,742
What are you talking about?

288
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,180
Where we're going on our date.

289
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,216
You haven't asked me on one,
and I haven't said yes.

290
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:47,487
Who turns down the request
of a man trapped in isolation?

291
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,692
What about sushi?
Everybody likes it.

292
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,862
Also, I'm pretty good
with chopsticks.

293
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,231
Never hurts to display
a little manual dexterity.

294
00:14:58,265 --> 00:14:59,967
You know, tends to impress.

295
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:05,172
I will want a cocktail
to soothe my nerves, but...

296
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,940
Why would you be nervous?

297
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,909
Have you seen you?

298
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:14,114
You are smart
as well as beautiful,

299
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:18,685
and I will need all the tools in
my toolkit to dazzle you, so...

300
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,721
No drink for me.

301
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,693
Have one after the appetizers.

302
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,162
I'll be impressed by then.

303
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,838
You have a fever.

304
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,811
He has a fever, and the rash
is fully materialized.

305
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:46,879
Okay.

306
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,617
Here we go.

307
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,153
Quarantine has been approved.

308
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:54,721
Yeah.

309
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,532
Can I have everyone's attention?

310
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:12,172
This emergency room and everyone
in it is now under quarantine.

311
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,009
We're hoping none of you
have been exposed,

312
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,710
but a serious respiratory virus

313
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,112
has infected three patients.

314
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,448
What? This can't happen.

315
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,816
We're starting everyone on
antivirals just as a precaution.

316
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,186
We'll also be bringing in
food and water,

317
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:29,589
so if any of you have any dietary
restrictions, please let us know now.

318
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,624
You can't make us stay here.
That's right.

319
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,427
I-I can't... Especially not
if someone's seriously ill.

320
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,101
We are legally entitled
to keep you for...

321
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,364
They locked us in.

322
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,301
Are we locked in? No way.

323
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,072
I gotta get out. Sir.

324
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,210
Sorry.

325
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,587
Like it or not,
no one's leaving.

326
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,978
The decision to implement
the quarantine

327
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:29,015
was made after consultation
with the Board.

328
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,384
The CDC has been kept
fully informed,

329
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,778
and we will be proceeding in
accordance with all protocol...

330
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,724
Shaun, Morgan, and Lim
are in there.

331
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,359
And our patient is out here.

332
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,028
There's still no sign of the donor.
He's not answering my calls.

333
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,697
I asked my contact at San Jose
PD to do a home check-in.

334
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,403
Park.

335
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:52,839
He's down there?

336
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,207
How... Yeah, put him on.

337
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,185
It's Security... Kellan's
stuck in the quarantine.

338
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,513
I'll pass along anything
I hear from San Jose PD.

339
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,455
Tyler started coughing.

340
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:11,057
Let's up his antivirals. Start
high flow oxygen and zosyn

341
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,992
to counter
any underlying infection.

342
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,395
Santa Pete has
a sigmoid volvulus,

343
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,896
he needs surgery very soon.

344
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,433
My call ended 37 minutes ago.

345
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,602
I'm supposed to be somewhere
else, It's important.

346
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,870
No, it's not.

347
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:28,074
We need a non-surgical fix
to a bowel obstruction.

348
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,210
Anyone?

349
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,801
Murphy.

350
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,804
You got something?

351
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,174
Not really.

352
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,910
Anything at all. Please.

353
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,115
We...

354
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,017
We usually...

355
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,152
We...

356
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:17,257
We usually make a hole and...

357
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,661
And come at an obstruction
from the side,

358
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,296
but we can't.

359
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,032
We need to use
the existing holes.

360
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:30,370
An endoscope risks tearing
right through the bowel.

361
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,038
A saline enema doesn't.

362
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,674
And it might untwist the bowel.

363
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,578
Simple, but it could work.

364
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,112
Nice.

365
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:44,984
I'm fine.

366
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,354
Do you have your inhaler?
Of course I do.

367
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,790
What were you doing down here?

368
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,325
This isn't my fault.

369
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,263
If you hadn't been working...
Kellan.

370
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,130
I know you must be scared.

371
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,032
I'm fine.

372
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,008
I'm keeping this hat on
for luck.

373
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,210
Here we go.

374
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,581
I'm threading the tube
into the rectum.

375
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,983
Now, slowly push the saline.

376
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,184
That's...

377
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,186
It's not a pleasant experience.

378
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,221
I'm getting some
resistance to flow.

379
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,890
I must've reached
the obstruction.

380
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,224
Push harder.
Hang in there, Pete.

381
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,326
Call me Santa...

382
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,529
Keep pushing the saline.

383
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,963
I'm sorry, Santa.

384
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,211
I feel so much better.

385
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:52,385
We've got you on a pretty
high dose of antivirals.

386
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:56,623
So, what's next?

387
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,157
We're debating nitric oxide...

388
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,193
No, I mean if this
doesn't turn around.

389
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,997
What happens to me next?

390
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,836
Then full respiratory failure.

391
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,976
Hey, I've got a new idea
for our first date.

392
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:19,579
Archery.

393
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,648
I used to compete
when I was young.

394
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,051
Basically, you'd be showing off.

395
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:28,555
I can show you some tricks.

396
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,957
Teach you a spit-finger hook,
how to anchor...

397
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,660
And then proceed
to demolish you.

398
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:36,629
Well, that sounds like
a reason to live.

399
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:02,021
I'm here to take you
to your imaging appointment.

400
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,456
Where's Shaun?

401
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,092
Shaun is quarantined in the E.R.

402
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,661
Quarantined? What, what...
What quarantine?

403
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:12,632
Apparently for some highly
contagious, deadly virus.

404
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,667
But Shaun sounds fine.

405
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:16,569
Except for some buzzing light

406
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:17,870
and his concern about lunch

407
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:21,574
and you missing your appointment
at the imaging clinic, so...

408
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:24,411
Let's go. Take me
to the hospital.

409
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,413
We are going to your
appointment and making sure

410
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:28,347
your think-melon
remains tumor-free.

411
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,116
Take me to the hospital please.

412
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,118
I'd like to help. How?

413
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:34,120
By taking your old job back
and saving the day?

414
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:36,989
Putting on an "Outbreak" suit
and rescuing Shaun?

415
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:43,262
Some people may find
your sassy attitude appealing.

416
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,697
I'm not one of them.

417
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,733
And I am crushed.

418
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,512
Sir, I'm sorry. You can't...

419
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,514
My wife's in there.

420
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,516
Viola! Look, that's her.
I need to get in there.

421
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,318
They're setting up a room
inside for friends and family.

422
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,720
Clifton, what are you doing?

423
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:10,457
Look, I'm coming in. Stop...
Let go of me!

424
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,291
Calm down
or you're gonna get hurt.

425
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,326
Stop. This is all my fault.

426
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,320
No. If I'd put the crib
together like you asked...

427
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,397
Forget about the crib.

428
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,032
I need you to take care
of yourself.

429
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,869
Because if something
happens to me...

430
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:27,607
our son needs someone
to take care of him.

431
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:36,415
It's... It's a boy?

432
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:38,751
I'm sorry I'm ruining
your surprise.

433
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,086
No.

434
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:48,194
Baby, I love you so much.

435
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,662
I love you, too.

436
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,237
I love you.

437
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:37,777
Dr. Shaun Murphy.

438
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,246
Shaun?

439
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,314
Why are you answering
our donor's phone?

440
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,318
Because he's here in quarantine.

441
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,818
What happened to the CDC
getting a team here today?

442
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,821
They confirmed that it
started in Malaysia last week.

443
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,389
Between the virologists
already there

444
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:25,968
and the ones grounded on the East
Coast because of the snowstorm...

445
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:27,359
Stay on them.

446
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,001
What do we know about the virus?

447
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:38,170
Similar symptoms to SARS,
but much faster moving.

448
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,839
Is Bob Cravens infected?

449
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,140
Not so far.

450
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:43,976
Currently Tyler Durnes, the EMT,

451
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,613
is the only person
displaying symptoms.

452
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:48,490
I need his bone marrow.
I'd like to go in and get it.

453
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:49,782
I'll comply with all protocol.

454
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:52,384
You're not hot zone certified.
None of us are.

455
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:55,021
My leukemia patient
has no immune system.

456
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,732
He'll die soon without
a marrow transplant.

457
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:58,658
Well, then you best find him
another donor

458
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,694
because no one, or their bone
marrow, is leaving that quarantine.

459
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:06,783
Have you heard from County about
taking our PICU transfers?

460
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,625
H-How are my O2 SATs?

461
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,561
Holding steady.

462
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,465
Do you want to call anyone?

463
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,735
I...

464
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:46,605
I... I thought about
letting my mom know...

465
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,474
what was going on, but...

466
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,979
She'd just worry about me
and feel bad she's not here.

467
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:55,047
So...

468
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:58,818
She... She knows I love her.

469
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:06,425
How's it going in here?

470
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,894
Dr. Reznick was just telling me

471
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:10,162
about some college
lesbian experiences...

472
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:14,266
Was that just my imagination?

473
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,669
Actually, we were talking
about your mother.

474
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:18,570
Interesting.

475
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,444
I don't like the drop
in his O2 SATs.

476
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:27,814
Let's start him on nitric oxide.

477
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,418
I knew you liked me.

478
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:44,496
He's in this hospital?

479
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,599
Bob actually came through
for once.

480
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:50,803
Unfortunately, we can't wait for
him to get out of quarantine.

481
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:53,139
But we found an alternative
donor in the Bay Area.

482
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,807
How compatible are they?

483
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:57,509
They share five out of eight
of your markers.

484
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,612
Bob is a much better match.

485
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:02,849
I can't handle marrow rejection,

486
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:04,851
or having to repeat
this nightmare.

487
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,997
That's a symptom
of the MAC pneumonia.

488
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,999
The antibiotics aren't working.

489
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:24,303
You need bone marrow, or this
infection is going to kill you. Soon.

490
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,972
Days, not weeks.

491
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,382
Seven years I've been
battling leukemia.

492
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,752
Been through four
full courses of chemo,

493
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:42,188
so many trips to the hospital
I've lost count.

494
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:44,857
Just knowing my father
showed up,

495
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:49,428
I'm grateful, relieved.

496
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,905
I'm okay if this is the end.

497
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:01,908
I'd like to sign a DNR.

498
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,744
Chris, the CDC will be here
tomorrow.

499
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:08,347
If they can identify the
virus, we can test Bob.

500
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,617
If he's negative... Whatever you
can manage before my heart stops,

501
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,252
go for it.

502
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:19,025
Please get me the form.

503
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,239
His fever's climbing.

504
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,807
Give the nebulizer time to work.

505
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,178
Cooling blankets,
that could help.

506
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:41,447
I'll go get some from
the supply closet.

507
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:44,650
Put your mask back on.

508
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,052
Why?

509
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:47,553
Because I'm infected.

510
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,404
You got it, too?

511
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:13,112
You guys any closer
to figuring this thing out?

512
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,014
Afraid not.

513
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,418
On the bright side, I...

514
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,487
I think I'm growing on Morgan.

515
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,611
There's got to be a way.

516
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:48,680
You can't go in.

517
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:51,183
Bob can't come out.
The marrow can't come out.

518
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:55,621
What if it doesn't?

519
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,959
What if the marrow never leaves?

520
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:03,195
Are we suggesting we put a man with
no immune system into the quarantine?

521
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:05,697
We expand the quarantine,
create a section just for him.

522
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,602
One of the doctors inside could do
the extraction and the transplant.

523
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:12,304
And then one
of two things happens.

524
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:15,107
He stays in isolation till we
know he hasn't been infected.

525
00:31:15,942 --> 00:31:17,343
Or it kills him.

526
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:22,381
There's no way Andrews will
let us expand the quarantine.

527
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:26,652
Wish me luck.

528
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:34,193
- Going to 360 Joules.
- Clear.

529
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:46,305
We can crack his chest
and do cardiac massage.

530
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:48,007
Dr. Reznick.
Have Petringa bring in

531
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,584
the internal paddles
from the trauma bay...

532
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:51,077
Morgan.

533
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:20,072
Hey, Doogie.

534
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,975
You didn't hear me
talking to you?

535
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:25,577
My sugar's crazy high. 650.

536
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:31,050
That doesn't make sense.

537
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:34,220
I gave you the proper
dosage of insulin.

538
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:35,687
10 units.

539
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:36,989
10 units?

540
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:39,691
10 units doesn't even make
a dent with me.

541
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:41,927
You got a doctor around here
who knows what he's doing?

542
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,629
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

543
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:46,265
I'll give you another 10 units.

544
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,933
Waste of time. Make it 20.

545
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,435
I'll give you 10.

546
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,437
What's wrong with you?
You sound like an idiot.

547
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,472
Don't be a jerk.
Mind your own business.

548
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,474
Doc. Doc, I don't feel so...

549
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,576
What the hell?

550
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,145
Did he just infect me?

551
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:00,546
Possibly.

552
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,714
I need to examine your abdomen.

553
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:10,989
Your obstruction has returned.

554
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:13,292
You need surgery, now.

555
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,926
But we're stuck in here.

556
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,196
And there's no operating room.

557
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:21,100
We will have to improvise.

558
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:31,477
There's no Neptune machine.

559
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,580
Without suction, the surgical
field will be filled with blood.

560
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:38,284
We can use the wall suction,
set to continuous.

561
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:39,351
That'll do.

562
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:49,595
No electrocautery
to control the bleeding.

563
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,363
You'll have to do this
combat style.

564
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:55,234
Tie off each artery
before you cut.

565
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,391
Dr. Reznick.

566
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,595
Are you ready?
Because I think we are.

567
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:30,402
I'll go get the patient.

568
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,279
You should lie down.

569
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,641
He's out.

570
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:11,710
Scalpel.

571
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:29,328
If we expand the quarantine,
I can do the transplant.

572
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,896
The only technical breach
will be...

573
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,139
She's infected.

574
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,914
Melendez.

575
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:51,683
Yeah.

576
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,723
Take down the adhesions
on the sigmoid.

577
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,693
How are his vitals?

578
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:05,297
Holding steady, Doctor.

579
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,167
That's dead bowel.

580
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:14,072
It's perforated.

581
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,140
Damn it.

582
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:22,448
I need a doctor!

583
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:23,849
Petringa needs help.

584
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:26,985
If I don't secure these clamps,

585
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,354
there'll be stool everywhere.

586
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:32,123
Murphy, go.

587
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:04,155
He signed a DNR.

588
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,190
He shouldn't have.

589
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,226
This is battery.

590
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,561
He doesn't need to die.

591
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,029
We're gonna get
his donor's marrow.

592
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:13,164
Andrews agreed to the plan?

593
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:16,368
Not yet.

594
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:18,162
If he doesn't, we'll think
of something else.

595
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:38,089
He said he was
feeling lightheaded.

596
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,063
I hear you,
but please stay back.

597
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:51,236
- He's...
- Is he infected?

598
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,938
From when Santa vomited on him?

599
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:54,406
He should go to isolation.

600
00:37:57,676 --> 00:38:00,746
He's in...

601
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,080
hypoglycemic shock.

602
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:04,049
Give him D50.

603
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,198
It's spreading.

604
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,232
Kellan!

605
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:25,136
Kellan!

606
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,975
Kellan!

607
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:32,411
Kellan! Kellan!

608
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:34,245
Kellan!

609
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:47,726
Dr. Glassman?

610
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:51,797
Hi.

611
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,499
We got what we needed
for images.

612
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:54,600
You are okay to go.

613
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:56,602
We'll send them to Dr. Blaize.

614
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:58,036
Anything I should
be worried about?

615
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,338
You're seeing Dr. Blaize
before the holiday?

616
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:04,810
As a matter of fact,
I'm seeing her now.

617
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,813
So, I could just show her
the hard copy.

618
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,981
I'm not supposed to do that.
No. I know.

619
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,850
I've been a neurosurgeon
for, like, 100 years.

620
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,819
I understand protocol.
I'm not gonna look at it.

621
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,387
I just want
to move things along.

622
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:20,526
Thank you.

623
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:47,653
It's back.

624
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:11,610
Suction.

625
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,649
I must've nicked a branch of the
inferior mesenteric artery.

626
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:18,717
I can't see where.

627
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,586
Can you feel it?

628
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,959
I think so. Use your
finger to plug the hole.

629
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,998
Now what?

630
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:36,735
Dr. Lim?

631
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:48,446
Everyone, calm down.

632
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,415
Hey, Kellan! Kellan! Look at me!

633
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,217
Look at me! Breathe!

634
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,620
Can... Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

635
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:16,307
Help my son!

2
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:27,943
Naughty thought.

3
00:00:28,507 --> 00:00:30,318
How about we don't wait
12 minutes

4
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:31,498
for our next kiss?

5
00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:33,904
We would never see
the end of the movie.

6
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:44,485
Oh.

7
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:49,748
Mm.

8
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,107
It's better if we stick
to the schedule.

9
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,709
Sure.

10
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,623
Didn't hear you come
in last night.

11
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:15,248
So I'm guessing
it went well at Carly's.

12
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,897
The end of the movie
was very predictable.

13
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:22,020
Not the question
I was asking,

14
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:24,764
but, you still
managed to answer it.

15
00:01:25,193 --> 00:01:28,109
Carly touches me
when we kiss.

16
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,303
You don't like her
touching you?

17
00:01:30,553 --> 00:01:32,368
- Oh, I... I do.
- Oh.

18
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:37,553
But I prefer to touch only
one thing at a time.

19
00:01:37,737 --> 00:01:39,845
Have you told her
you prefer

20
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,998
to touch only one thing
at a time?

21
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,318
In those exact words?

22
00:01:52,377 --> 00:01:53,525
Oh!

23
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:55,570
Whatever it is,
I'm definitely in.

24
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,126
My first lead surgery!

25
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:58,423
- Oh!
- Oh!

26
00:01:58,511 --> 00:02:00,673
Shaun!
That is awesome!

27
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:02,932
I am going to
rock it!

28
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,641
Oh, hells to the yeah
you are!

29
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:12,806
Oh!

33
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,477
How you doing?

34
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:26,681
I'm good.

35
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:30,648
Thank you for helping me
with the sea lions.

36
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:31,992
I'll never say no
to a caper.

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,502
But I'd like to keep my mother's
death between the two of us.

38
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,672
I just...
I can't deal with

39
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,181
people's platitudes
right now.

40
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,028
Okay, but that kinda suggests
you're not good.

41
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:41,556
This is textbook denial.

42
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:43,477
It's only going to inhibit
your grief process.

43
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:45,367
Denial is the first step
in the grief process,

44
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:46,727
so I'd say I'm right on track.

45
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:48,509
But thank you
for your platitudes.

46
00:02:50,324 --> 00:02:51,571
This is Curtis.

47
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,955
He decided to fix his chimney
without a safety harness.

48
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:55,898
He has open bilateral
tib-fib fractures.

49
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:58,257
They wanted $1,200
for a two-hour job.

50
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,486
And I can still do
a Hurricane Grind.

51
00:03:01,236 --> 00:03:04,056
It's a skateboard move
that builds off a 180 Ollie.

52
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,923
I got great balance.

53
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:10,916
Pupils are slow to react.

54
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:14,322
Unfortunately, balance is less
great after a few cocktails.

55
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:16,494
Not me.

56
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,634
Clean and sober six years,
three months,

57
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:20,650
and... and 24 days.

58
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,883
Get him on IV antibiotics
and to OR Level One.

59
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:25,627
And run a BAC.

60
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:30,158
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

61
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:31,892
Your surgeon.

62
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:41,087
Esophageal cancer
is a serious condition.

63
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:45,656
However,
you don't have any remote

64
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:47,476
or metastatic disease

65
00:03:47,564 --> 00:03:50,111
and responded well
to chemoradiation,

66
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,448
so a resection of the esophagus

67
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:54,815
should render you
cancer-free.

68
00:03:57,768 --> 00:03:59,572
You look awfully young.

69
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:07,423
I always say, the younger they are,
the smarter they must be.

70
00:04:10,414 --> 00:04:12,119
Oh, oh, yes.

71
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:16,191
We will pull the stomach up
and attach it to the remains

72
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:19,953
of your esophagus, keeping your
GI system connected,

73
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,000
so you will not need
a permanent feeding tube.

74
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,431
My oncologist told me all this,

75
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:26,595
but I refused to believe it...

76
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,712
that it was all gonna be okay...

77
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:31,080
until I heard it
from my surgeon.

78
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,087
Oh!

79
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:35,720
I'm sorry, it's just...

80
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:40,009
I've been through a divorce
and a career change...

81
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,930
and I finally bought
my own cafe...

82
00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:46,541
three days before
I got my diagnosis.

83
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:49,462
And I thought it was a sign
I was making a mistake.

84
00:04:49,742 --> 00:04:51,939
But it was just the opposite.

85
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:55,767
I wasn't done.

86
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,033
Oh, I'm sorry...

87
00:04:58,136 --> 00:05:02,095
I have to inform you
of the risks of this procedure.

88
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:07,650
There is a 7% chance
of heart and lung problems,

89
00:05:07,738 --> 00:05:12,556
a 12% chance of infection,
a 0.5% of death, among others.

90
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:21,580
Bring it, Dr. Murphy.

91
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,212
Shaun got very lucky.

92
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:36,195
Landed the world's most genial
patient for his first case.

93
00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:37,923
- Nice.
- Of you.

94
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,828
You picked that patient for him...

95
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,970
I heard it was Park's chart
before you stepped in.

96
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:43,837
Shaun's weakness is
patient management.

97
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:45,049
You shouldn't be coddling him.

98
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,220
We challenge him too much,
we lose him.

99
00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:48,642
Murphy?

100
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:52,111
He perseveres.
He's annoyingly resilient.

101
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:56,150
I agree that some failures
don't seem to faze him at all.

102
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:58,252
But it's his lifelong dream.

103
00:05:58,376 --> 00:06:00,384
So, yes,
I think we could lose him.

104
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:02,741
I'll tough-love his ass next week.

105
00:06:06,124 --> 00:06:07,681
Okay, Curtis, we're good to go.

106
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:09,830
Curtis, my God.
Are you okay?

107
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:12,049
I'm thinking I should've gone
with the contractor.

108
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:13,542
His thinking was impaired.

109
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,322
He had a blood
alcohol level of .09.

110
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:20,673
Your test must be wrong.

111
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:24,119
You were quite inebriated
when you came in.

112
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,931
That's impossible.
Curtis doesn't drink.

113
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:29,391
We'll make a note of it
in his chart.

114
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:31,259
We've got to get him
to the O.R.

115
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:44,095
You play softball?

116
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:45,681
Uh, my junior year in high school,

117
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:47,649
I had an ERA of 2.95.

118
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,345
My wife's got an arm.

119
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,298
I can't believe
you're my wife.

120
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:53,470
Till death do us part.

121
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:54,830
Yeah.

122
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:07,762
Oh, you found Wally.

123
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,232
You have a name for it?

124
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:12,341
Yeah,
he's my Walther PPK .32;

125
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:13,867
he and I go way back.

126
00:07:13,955 --> 00:07:15,435
Is it loaded?

127
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,380
I mean, is this a problem?

128
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:21,263
'Cause I... I just...
I keep it in my bedside table,

129
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:24,792
in my gun safe...
combination 7-3-5-9.

130
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,161
I'm not gonna
remember that.

131
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:28,005
I don't want
to remember that.

132
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:31,505
If we're gonna live
together,

133
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,036
we're gonna need
to make some... compromises.

134
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:45,505
You nervous?

135
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:47,661
How badly
are you freaking out?

136
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:51,474
I'm not badly freaking out.

137
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:55,374
I've assisted in six
esophageal resections,

138
00:07:55,462 --> 00:07:57,978
all of which were
free of complications.

139
00:07:58,065 --> 00:07:59,865
So you're overdue
for a blow-up.

140
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:03,116
Sorry.

141
00:08:03,204 --> 00:08:05,115
I'm just a bit annoyed

142
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:07,849
'cause I had my hand
on this case first,

143
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:10,552
and now I'm third out of four,
at best.

144
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:15,865
But I'm happy for you.

145
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:17,675
Really.

146
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,638
I'm happy for me,
too.

147
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:24,552
She has extensive
scar tissue.

148
00:08:25,346 --> 00:08:29,685
And it's plastered her stomach
to her anterior abdominal wall.

149
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:35,224
I told her she wouldn't need
a permanent feeding tube.

150
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:39,216
But she will.

151
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:47,493
We've got to tell a budding chef
she'll never eat again.

152
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:50,944
How will she react?

153
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:52,243
Don't know.

154
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:54,420
Badly.
But the specifics...

155
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:55,891
You should tell her.

156
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:57,932
She's your patient,
it's your job.

157
00:08:58,047 --> 00:09:01,100
I'm bad
at patient communication.

158
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:03,983
If I make her
very unhappy,

159
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:06,233
she may not want me
to do the surgery.

160
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:07,697
If you're not willing
to take that risk,

161
00:09:07,784 --> 00:09:09,358
then you should hand
the case over to Park.

162
00:09:09,445 --> 00:09:13,523
No. I don't want to hand
the case over to Dr. Park.

163
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:17,203
Park will tell Beth.

164
00:09:17,852 --> 00:09:20,461
And, Shaun,
it's still your surgery.

165
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:27,461
Drill.

166
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,782
Do you see his heart rhythm?

167
00:09:34,022 --> 00:09:35,649
Rate controlled A-fib.

168
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:37,157
Wasn't on his record.

169
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:39,078
Ask his wife about it post-op.

170
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,264
Probably a symptom
of binge drinking.

171
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:44,282
Which he'll lie to us about and
she'll tell us she believes.

172
00:09:45,773 --> 00:09:47,352
She's in denial?

173
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:53,297
You had surgery as a child.

174
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:56,360
As a baby,
I don't even remember it.

175
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:58,287
There's considerable
scar tissue...

176
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,055
more than we'd typically
expect to find.

177
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:02,914
Which has affected
our surgical plan.

178
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:04,724
How?

179
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:06,952
Dr. Murphy will field that question.

180
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:10,301
No, Dr. Lim s-said...

181
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,123
Proceed, Dr. Murphy.

182
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:17,164
Somebody please tell me.

183
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:29,602
We can't move your stomach up,
so you will need a feeding tube.

184
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:35,641
For the rest of your life.

185
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:41,566
The good news is that
this surgery is simpler,

186
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:46,610
so your recovery time will be
shorter by three to five days.

187
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,868
Hey.

188
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:02,368
Do any of you
own a gun?

189
00:11:04,886 --> 00:11:07,420
Is there someone you'd like
"taken care of"?

190
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:09,672
- Ah.
- I still have my service pistol.

191
00:11:09,789 --> 00:11:11,461
I have a Sig P365.

192
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:14,789
Do any of you have,
or have you ever had,

193
00:11:14,877 --> 00:11:17,516
issues about it
with your significant others?

194
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:22,108
After our son was born,
my wife suddenly hated

195
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:23,844
having a firearm in the house.

196
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,167
And one night,
I came home late to a...

197
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,451
PowerPoint presentation.

198
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:31,319
90 minutes of horrifying
statistics.

199
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:33,469
Now it's in a locker
at my gun range.

200
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:35,438
Lotta set up but I like that.

201
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:39,578
I had a boyfriend who felt very weird
about me having a gun.

202
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:41,358
He wasn't big on logic,

203
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:43,161
so I took the emotional approach.

204
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:44,928
Told him
it's not for the firepower,

205
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:47,735
it's for the confidence it gives me
as a woman when I carry it.

206
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:49,532
I lived with a guy
who had a gun.

207
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:51,436
Had to use the nuclear option.

208
00:11:51,523 --> 00:11:53,727
It goes
or he goes.

209
00:11:53,882 --> 00:11:55,852
It worked...
they both went.

210
00:11:57,863 --> 00:11:59,896
Well, that's just
wonderful.

211
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,680
I heard your news.

212
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,412
It's pretty exciting.

213
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,288
I jumped seven times.

214
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,977
How's the anxiety level?

215
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:14,305
Why do people
keep asking me that?

216
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,061
Everyone has doubts, Shaun.

217
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:18,229
I'm excited.

218
00:12:18,316 --> 00:12:20,965
You can be excited.
And nervous.

219
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,961
Usually they go together.

220
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:27,462
Speaking of, uh,
I'm sorry if I was a bit

221
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,323
too assertive last night.

222
00:12:29,464 --> 00:12:32,347
Lea said
it must be tricky for you.

223
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:37,566
So now Lea is also privy
to the intimacies of our intimacy?

224
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:39,394
- Great.
- Yes.

225
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,921
Oh.

226
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:46,003
Lea said to tell you

227
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:49,698
that I prefer to touch
only thing at a time.

228
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:58,587
Located upper esophageal sphincter.

229
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:01,471
You have a good tumor margin...
resecting above or below?

230
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:03,339
- Below.
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:07,884
Shaun gave the news
to his patient after all.

232
00:13:07,972 --> 00:13:09,235
Shaun did
what I expected.

233
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:10,941
He upset her,
but the news is upsetting.

234
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,095
She'll deal with it,
he'll learn how to...

235
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:13,802
She wants him off the case.

236
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:20,597
- Shaun...
- No...

237
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,826
Shaun, I will find you
another case.

238
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:28,394
This is my case.

239
00:13:28,551 --> 00:13:31,100
I prepared for this case.

240
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,221
I don't want another case.

241
00:13:35,835 --> 00:13:37,409
Dr. Murphy...

242
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,954
You're learning, Shaun.

243
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:11,362
That's what you do
at a teaching hospital.

244
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,153
I'm learning, too.

245
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:16,881
Going from attending
to Chief of Surgery

246
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:18,948
is... a big deal.

247
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:23,673
Every day, every decision,
every mistake...

248
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,626
I learn something.

249
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:27,267
So do you.

250
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,011
No, I don't.

251
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:33,763
I have
a developmental disorder.

252
00:14:40,656 --> 00:14:43,097
- Come with me.
- I'm waiting for my bus.

253
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:44,743
You can take a later one.

254
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:49,604
I'm sure
I mentioned I was Chief?

255
00:14:54,251 --> 00:14:55,517
Hi, Beth.

256
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,196
I'm sorry for
what you're going through.

257
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:04,313
And Dr. Murphy's phrasing was
unfortunate.

258
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:07,444
But there's been no deceit
or negligence.

259
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,909
He's an excellent surgeon

260
00:15:08,957 --> 00:15:10,764
who has my full confidence
in the O.R.

261
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:13,363
And if you don't trust him,
you don't trust me.

262
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:16,634
So, I would recommend

263
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:18,650
you have your surgery
at a different hospital.

264
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:20,371
I can make arrangements.

265
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,293
However, if you reconsider,
we can proceed as scheduled

266
00:15:24,386 --> 00:15:25,997
first thing
tomorrow morning.

267
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:50,438
If you don't want people to know
your mother died,

268
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:52,955
stop acting like someone
whose mother died.

269
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,111
I'm gonna move on to the second
stage of grief... anger.

270
00:15:58,142 --> 00:15:59,324
I'm not acting depressed.

271
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:01,259
No, you're acting bitchy.

272
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,429
But you're not a bitch,
so that looks weird on you,

273
00:16:03,517 --> 00:16:05,213
and people are gonna
know something's up.

274
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:07,400
So, do you want me
happier or sadder?

275
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:10,048
Let me know, because I'm really
looking for your approval.

276
00:16:11,544 --> 00:16:13,088
Bitchy...

277
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:20,525
You really think this guy's
still on the wagon?

278
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,509
Just because he's a drunk
doesn't mean he's not sick.

279
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:26,304
But all you can see is an addict
married to an enabler,

280
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:28,970
so all roads
lead to rum.

281
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:32,254
C'mon, that was cute.

282
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:35,916
No IV wall motion abnormalities.

283
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:38,849
No valvular disease
or dysfunction.

284
00:16:38,937 --> 00:16:41,845
Ruling out any structural cause
for the arrhythmia.

285
00:16:42,023 --> 00:16:44,447
You win.
Congratulations.

286
00:16:46,776 --> 00:16:48,197
- H-Hey!
- Hey.

287
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,827
How was your day?

288
00:16:50,023 --> 00:16:52,064
Good, good.

289
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:54,133
Pensive.

290
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,429
I was thinking
about your gun

291
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:56,859
- and why you need it...
- Oh, Aaron,

292
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:58,453
- I... I don't...
- No, no, no.

293
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,929
I was an idiot and a guy,
I get it.

294
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:03,179
You walking alone
in a garage late at night,

295
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:05,060
you walking alone on the street
late at night...

296
00:17:05,147 --> 00:17:08,483
Or getting into my own car,
or even my own house.

297
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:09,781
Exactly.

298
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:11,912
That's why I got you
a surprise.

299
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:16,272
- Yeah?
- Right outside the back door.

300
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:25,638
We have exactly 10 seconds
to punch in the code

301
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:28,365
before S.E.A.I. Team Six arrives.

302
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:31,723
7-3-5-9.

303
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:34,684
Every door, every window,
every vent over 36 inches.

304
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:36,842
This is your security fob.

305
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,865
Works in all 48 contiguous
states and Canada.

306
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:44,631
You have no idea how much extra
comfort this is gonna give me.

307
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:48,590
Actually, I was hoping
it would be

308
00:17:48,678 --> 00:17:50,881
your primary source of comfort.

309
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,502
You were thinking that
this would mean

310
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,207
- I would give up my gun?
- That's exactly what I was thinking.

311
00:18:00,317 --> 00:18:03,074
Well, the first rule of security
systems is redundancy.

312
00:18:03,223 --> 00:18:05,424
By that logic, we should get
a tank for the garage.

313
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:07,473
Aaron, it shouldn't matter
why I want a gun...

314
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,603
whether it's because it makes me
feel more secure,

315
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:12,221
or it was a memento
of my dad's

316
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:14,545
or just because
it's fun to shoot.

317
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:17,715
All that matters is
I'm a grown-up,

318
00:18:17,802 --> 00:18:21,590
and I'm responsible,
and I want it.

319
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:27,574
You're ruining Shaun.

320
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:30,580
Maybe you got him over the hump
of patient management,

321
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:32,471
but what about
surgical management?

322
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,064
Taking charge of the O.R.,

323
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:37,254
keeping lines of communication open,
everyone cooperating.

324
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:39,236
You're throwing him
into the deep end,

325
00:18:39,324 --> 00:18:40,697
and that's unfair to him.

326
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:43,176
Unless you plan to scrub in
as a lifeguard.

327
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,105
He'll be fine.

328
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:48,832
You handpicked
his surgical team?

329
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:53,801
You're ruining him.

330
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:58,338
The tests prove his arrhythmia
is associated

331
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:00,277
with excessive
ethanol consumption.

332
00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:02,033
But there's no
permanent damage

333
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:04,017
and his rhythm will
return to normal

334
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:06,504
in the absence of
any further drinking.

335
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,934
We met
when we were 15.

336
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,410
I was first clarinet,
he was second.

337
00:19:17,527 --> 00:19:20,150
We were at a band festival
in Anaheim when he found out

338
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:22,434
his parents died
in a plane crash.

339
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,894
We grieved together
and fell in love.

340
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:31,004
Then he started drinking.

341
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:36,996
It wasn't until I threatened to leave
that he finally woke up.

342
00:19:38,715 --> 00:19:41,267
The day he received
his two-year recovery chip

343
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:43,121
was the day we got married.

344
00:19:43,686 --> 00:19:45,150
The day he vowed to me,

345
00:19:45,238 --> 00:19:47,403
and a church full
of our family and friends,

346
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:50,103
that he would never drink again.

347
00:19:50,827 --> 00:19:53,061
Our marriage is built on
his sobriety.

348
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:59,144
I believe him.

349
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:05,419
Teal,
we ran the BAC three times,

350
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:07,769
and the results were consistent.

351
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:11,879
I believe in my husband.

352
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:14,340
I have to.

353
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,410
His BP is dropping.

354
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:20,504
Temp is normal.

355
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:22,504
Check for causes of shock.

356
00:20:24,302 --> 00:20:25,386
Upper GI bleed...

357
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,614
need stat hematocrits
and transfuse blood.

358
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:37,551
Surgery's the easy-peasy part.

359
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:45,317
You wanted this,
enjoy it.

360
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:49,142
I can't.

361
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:54,309
If I get distracted,
if I get upset...

362
00:20:54,372 --> 00:20:56,356
If you do,
Andrews has your back.

363
00:20:56,444 --> 00:21:01,439
If Dr. Andrews has to take over,
then I have failed.

364
00:21:01,747 --> 00:21:05,854
I have failed, and I have
endangered a patient's life,

365
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:08,850
and if I'm no good
at the easy-peasy part,

366
00:21:08,938 --> 00:21:11,302
then what part
am I good at?

367
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:15,310
What do we do
when we get all nutty like this?

368
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:20,099
Blow out the candles.

369
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,557
How many do you need?

370
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:24,880
Three.

371
00:21:50,384 --> 00:21:52,366
Hey. I was looking for you.

372
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,040
Big day, huh?

373
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:55,309
How are your nerves holding up?

374
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:56,933
I'm not nervous.

375
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:59,239
Of course you're nervous.
Everybody's nervous.

376
00:21:59,357 --> 00:22:01,044
It just means that
you care.

377
00:22:01,372 --> 00:22:03,276
Being nervous
means

378
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,565
I feel inadequate
and unprepared,

379
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:06,957
and if I am
either of those things,

380
00:22:07,044 --> 00:22:08,729
it doesn't matter
whether I care or not.

381
00:22:08,817 --> 00:22:11,223
You are more than adequate,
and you're very prepared.

382
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:13,769
You remind me of a...
a young surgeon I knew once.

383
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:16,661
The day he got his first lead,
he was thrilled,

384
00:22:16,778 --> 00:22:19,753
but he was a mess, trying to
remember a million things,

385
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:22,401
imagining a million things
that could go wrong.

386
00:22:22,488 --> 00:22:25,315
But then he remembered
the birth process,

387
00:22:25,403 --> 00:22:27,948
how moms are asked
to pick a focal point,

388
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:29,995
- let everything filter through that.
- Hmm.

389
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:33,505
So, he chose the color orange
to focus on.

390
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:37,182
This is the cap
that he focused on,

391
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:40,255
and he got through it
with flying colors.

392
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:41,911
Maybe it'll help.

393
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:47,669
Why do you have
the young surgeon's cap?

394
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:51,263
I was being coy.

395
00:22:51,575 --> 00:22:53,833
The young surgeon
was me.

396
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:11,634
Konnichiwa.

397
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:15,119
That's Japanese for hello.

398
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:18,210
Konnichiwa.
I have surgery in 42 minutes.

399
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:21,460
Which is why I'm here,
to wish you luck.

400
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:25,570
I don't need luck.

401
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:27,945
Everyone needs luck.

402
00:23:30,755 --> 00:23:32,421
That was a good luck kiss.

403
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:35,490
How can a kiss give you...

404
00:23:37,094 --> 00:23:38,617
So was that.

405
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,196
I am feeling
a bit lucky.

406
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:46,505
You know the thing
that Lea told you to tell me?

407
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:47,651
Yes.

408
00:23:47,984 --> 00:23:49,513
That was actually great advice.

409
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:51,138
It's important
that we tell each other

410
00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:52,740
exactly what we like
and what we don't.

411
00:23:52,827 --> 00:23:56,630
I also don't like pickles,
sirens, anything wool...

412
00:23:56,718 --> 00:24:00,249
I was thinking
more in the romantic area.

413
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:05,015
And right now, we are not going
to touch lips anymore.

414
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:08,179
Because there's something else
I want you to touch.

415
00:24:23,043 --> 00:24:24,882
So, what do you think?

416
00:24:34,469 --> 00:24:36,535
You don't have any lumps.

417
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,152
Win-win.

418
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:52,646
Lab and imaging tests
rule out Crohn's,

419
00:24:52,734 --> 00:24:56,085
gastroenteritis, C-diff colitis,
and even H pylori.

420
00:24:56,305 --> 00:24:57,888
Leaving bleeding ulcers.

421
00:24:57,976 --> 00:25:00,117
Caused by alcohol abuse.

422
00:25:01,544 --> 00:25:03,661
He needs to be
on a proton pump inhibitor

423
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:06,796
and octreotide to prevent
any further blood loss.

424
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:15,403
No.

425
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,005
He loves you.

426
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:19,141
That's why
he hasn't been honest.

427
00:25:19,288 --> 00:25:22,560
Doesn't make it right,
but it's that same love

428
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:25,413
that kept you together
through everything.

429
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:27,600
And it'll get you through this,
too.

430
00:25:35,978 --> 00:25:38,060
He's telling the truth.

431
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:40,575
We'll run more tests.

432
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:44,296
Your faith in your husband
is impressive.

433
00:25:44,994 --> 00:25:46,679
But it may have just
killed him.

434
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:31,743
Ten blade, please.

435
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:02,868
Located lower end of
esophageal lesion.

436
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:04,862
Linear cutting stapler.

437
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:08,925
Resecting the esophagus
from the stomach...

438
00:28:12,164 --> 00:28:15,737
I'm now
at the upper end of the lesion.

439
00:28:16,084 --> 00:28:17,370
Hemoclips.

440
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,731
Dr. Murphy?

441
00:28:33,892 --> 00:28:35,081
No.

442
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,694
No...

443
00:28:37,797 --> 00:28:39,047
What's the matter?

444
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:42,106
No, no, no...

445
00:28:42,193 --> 00:28:43,532
Shaun, what are you seeing?

446
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,110
Can't... can't do this!

447
00:28:45,198 --> 00:28:46,274
What... what can't you do?

448
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:47,883
- No!
- Don't... No.

449
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:50,948
No! No! No! No!

450
00:28:51,182 --> 00:28:52,916
- Dr. Murphy!
- No!!

451
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:54,384
Dr. Murphy!!

452
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:55,486
Go, go!

453
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,995
Page Dr. Lim.
Keep her stable.

454
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,548
No. No. No.

455
00:29:06,796 --> 00:29:08,548
Yur...

456
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:12,172
No.

457
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,947
No.

458
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:15,302
No.

459
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,087
- Yur...
- What happened?

460
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:19,651
- No, no, no.
- He lost it, walked out mid-procedure.

461
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:22,237
Yuri... Yu...

462
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:25,070
- Yuri kucho saiken.
- Shaun?

463
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:27,815
Yur... Yuri... Yur...

464
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:30,621
Okay, Park,
take over the surgery.

465
00:29:30,731 --> 00:29:32,556
Y... No!

466
00:29:32,749 --> 00:29:34,141
Dr. Park.

467
00:29:34,743 --> 00:29:36,743
Y...

468
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,814
- No.
- He obviously can't.

469
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:41,954
I don't think he lost it.

470
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:43,165
He was in complete charge
of that room.

471
00:29:43,252 --> 00:29:44,416
I don't think
this is a meltdown.

472
00:29:44,503 --> 00:29:45,702
He said he can't do it.

473
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,509
He said, "Can't do it."
Maybe he meant we can't do it.

474
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:49,893
I think he's seeing something...

475
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,992
We have a patient open
on the table.

476
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:55,423
Shaun, you have to tell us
what you're seeing.

477
00:29:55,787 --> 00:29:57,141
It's okay, Shaun.

478
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,025
Breathe.

479
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:20,330
That's it. Now slowly.

480
00:30:21,017 --> 00:30:22,811
What are you thinking?

481
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,248
When...

482
00:30:29,368 --> 00:30:33,653
Okay. When I examined
the upper portion...

483
00:30:34,979 --> 00:30:36,797
When I examined
the upper portion,

484
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:39,807
there was
a much larger area

485
00:30:39,924 --> 00:30:42,446
of tumor-free esophagus
than anticipated...

486
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:45,203
That's correct, but not nearly
enough to reach the stomach.

487
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:49,389
But there is enough to accept
a jejunum free flap,

488
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,196
using a portion
of the small intestine

489
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,867
to replace the resected esophagus.

490
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:56,281
We don't do jejunum
free flaps.

491
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:57,945
They do in Japan.

492
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,024
They do in Japan.

493
00:31:00,112 --> 00:31:02,994
I've been studying
their technique...

494
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,278
Yuri kucho saiken.

495
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,098
They have had great success.

496
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:12,090
It would mean Beth
wouldn't need a feeding tube.

497
00:31:12,178 --> 00:31:13,580
But...

498
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:17,687
it is v-very complex.

499
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:21,354
It's too complex for you
to lead.

500
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:23,604
So you'll lose your case.

501
00:31:25,273 --> 00:31:27,140
Yes...

502
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:32,854
I haven't done a transposition
graft like that before.

503
00:31:35,702 --> 00:31:37,369
Think you can walk us
through it?

504
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,309
Yes.

505
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:45,909
I'll scrub in.

506
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:58,260
Stomach...
is perfect.

507
00:31:58,607 --> 00:32:00,150
Check the duodenum.

508
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,164
The only way Teal
will accept the treatment

509
00:32:03,252 --> 00:32:05,299
is if we give her
no room for denial.

510
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,580
Did you really believe
what you said?

511
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,619
That their love is enough
to get them through this?

512
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:14,948
Such BS,
the belief that love is enough.

513
00:32:15,108 --> 00:32:17,805
Even worse, it's corollary
that a lack of love

514
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:18,930
is the real problem.

515
00:32:19,018 --> 00:32:20,813
If only they had someone
in their life

516
00:32:20,901 --> 00:32:22,821
who had enough faith in them,
had enough love for them,

517
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:23,860
they could've pulled through.

518
00:32:23,947 --> 00:32:26,494
It's wrong and it's mean.

519
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:31,244
What's that?

520
00:32:31,445 --> 00:32:32,924
Flush the area.

521
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:37,985
There's our bleed.

522
00:32:38,073 --> 00:32:40,214
But it's not coming
from an ulcer...

523
00:32:41,307 --> 00:32:42,617
It's coming from a tumor.

524
00:32:42,705 --> 00:32:44,508
It's obstructing
his digestive tract.

525
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,705
I'm paging Melendez
to the O.R.

526
00:32:50,108 --> 00:32:51,643
- Okay.
- Actually, I'm...

527
00:32:51,731 --> 00:32:53,317
I'm gonna need
an extra shot.

528
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:54,979
Rough day?

529
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:59,227
Had to... help out in the E.R.
with an eight-year-old boy

530
00:32:59,315 --> 00:33:01,196
who was accidentally
shot by his sister.

531
00:33:01,284 --> 00:33:03,604
He'll survive,
but with brain damage.

532
00:33:04,018 --> 00:33:05,369
That's horrible.

533
00:33:05,824 --> 00:33:07,284
Yes, it is.

534
00:33:09,061 --> 00:33:12,463
And quite coincidental.

535
00:33:12,763 --> 00:33:15,127
Like so many
other coincidences.

536
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:17,470
You know how many kids are shot
every day in this country?

537
00:33:17,557 --> 00:33:18,617
19.

538
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,680
You know you're three times
more likely to be shot

539
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:22,282
if you have access
to guns than if you don't?

540
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,977
Here's another fact...
one in four women are victims

541
00:33:25,065 --> 00:33:28,541
of violence at the hands
of their intimate partner.

542
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,607
No, no, no.
I'm not afraid of you.

543
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:35,541
This isn't about you.

544
00:33:39,391 --> 00:33:41,182
Did something happen?

545
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:43,690
'Cause if it did,
I want to know about it.

546
00:33:48,232 --> 00:33:51,828
You figure something horrible
must have happened to drive me

547
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:54,651
to such an irrational,
fear-driven choice?

548
00:33:58,189 --> 00:33:59,909
I'm sorry. Hi.

549
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:07,892
The ends of the harvested
jejunum have been matched

550
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,967
for caliber size
for the attachment sites.

551
00:34:10,134 --> 00:34:11,556
You should begin

552
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,619
proximal attachment
at the neck incision,

553
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:17,250
using layer-to-layer technique
on the esophagus

554
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:21,088
and microvascular anastomosis
of the vessels.

555
00:34:22,966 --> 00:34:24,317
You wanted to know
when Dr. Semler

556
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:25,904
was heading to O.R. #3.

557
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:30,096
Dr. Park, scrub out and join Semler.

558
00:34:31,508 --> 00:34:34,058
I-if it's all right,
I'd rather stay here.

559
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,038
You're needed
where you're needed.

560
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:52,466
Tumor is free.

561
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:55,854
Bag it, tag it,
and get it to Path.

562
00:34:59,235 --> 00:35:00,901
Do you smell that?

563
00:35:04,508 --> 00:35:06,500
Smells like a distillery.

564
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:08,654
But we know he couldn't
have touched a drop

565
00:35:08,742 --> 00:35:10,891
for at least 24 hours.

566
00:35:18,947 --> 00:35:20,890
Final stitch is yours.

567
00:35:23,656 --> 00:35:27,687
It's completely symbolic,
but symbols can be powerful.

568
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:55,281
Easy-peasy.

569
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:02,492
You had something called
Auto-Brewery Syndrome.

570
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,513
The tumor we found was blocking
your intestinal tract.

571
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:07,084
So carbs weren't being digested,

572
00:36:07,172 --> 00:36:09,084
they were being
trapped and fermented.

573
00:36:09,172 --> 00:36:12,599
Your stomach was actually
creating its own alcohol.

574
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:15,132
You were drunk,
but not from drinking.

575
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,652
With the removal of the tumor...
which was benign...

576
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:18,834
you're all good.

577
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:20,953
And the arrhythmia's gone, too.

578
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,929
I never doubted you.

579
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:28,914
Her faith in you
saved your life.

580
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:33,531
Thank you.

581
00:36:39,793 --> 00:36:41,716
I was so pissed
when Lim kicked me out...

582
00:36:41,804 --> 00:36:44,911
until I found Semler had
an appendectomy waiting for me.

583
00:36:45,056 --> 00:36:47,131
Got my first lead after all.

584
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:52,142
I'm happy for you.
Really.

585
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,767
I'm happy for me, too.

586
00:36:56,362 --> 00:36:57,728
You earned it.

587
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:00,682
And you'll get your chance
again soon, Shaun.

588
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:07,822
So that's it?
All's well that ends well?

589
00:37:08,174 --> 00:37:10,047
Your surgeon walked out
on his case.

590
00:37:10,135 --> 00:37:12,724
That's your takeaway?
That he failed?

591
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:14,125
A chef can eat.

592
00:37:14,213 --> 00:37:16,890
Well, as a diagnostician,

593
00:37:16,978 --> 00:37:19,664
he did something wonderful,
but as a surgeon?

594
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,361
Yes, he failed.

595
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:26,111
We don't work alone,
Marcus.

596
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:28,648
Every time
we have a good outcome,

597
00:37:28,736 --> 00:37:31,275
it's because everyone in the room
did something right.

598
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:34,820
Shaun came up with the idea,
Park got it out of him,

599
00:37:34,908 --> 00:37:38,016
I approved the surgery,
and you?

600
00:37:38,244 --> 00:37:40,375
The only reason
Shaun is working here

601
00:37:40,463 --> 00:37:42,550
is because
you believed in him.

602
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:45,236
Yay, team.

603
00:37:49,473 --> 00:37:52,039
Are you still having
a gun fight?

604
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,640
Oh, yeah.

605
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:57,335
Second day of my marriage
and we are at an impasse.

606
00:37:57,592 --> 00:38:00,270
Tried the logical approach,
I tried the emotional approach,

607
00:38:00,476 --> 00:38:02,195
no compromise.

608
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:06,187
Only thing left is the nuclear option,
which really sucks.

609
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:11,883
The thought of having a gun
in my house makes me sick...

610
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:18,758
Has Debbie let you touch
her breast?

611
00:38:21,988 --> 00:38:23,343
What?

612
00:38:24,851 --> 00:38:28,758
Has Debbie let you
touch her breast?

613
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,558
Yeah.

614
00:38:34,297 --> 00:38:38,968
Then you shouldn't worry
about anything else.

615
00:38:53,343 --> 00:38:55,093
I was wrong...

616
00:38:55,476 --> 00:38:57,125
this time.

617
00:38:57,858 --> 00:39:03,279
But 99.9% of cases,
I would be right.

618
00:39:03,367 --> 00:39:06,193
If... if someone acts like an addict,
lies like an addict,

619
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:08,771
smells like an addict,
then they are an addict.

620
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:11,357
And just because
we stumbled across

621
00:39:11,445 --> 00:39:14,139
the one ridiculously
fluky exception,

622
00:39:14,461 --> 00:39:17,064
that isn't going to change
my attitude moving forward.

623
00:39:21,617 --> 00:39:23,085
I respect you, Claire.

624
00:39:23,172 --> 00:39:25,854
Might even go as far
as to say I like you.

625
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,123
And I know
you're angry right now.

626
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,058
At your mother.

627
00:39:30,312 --> 00:39:31,773
The world.

628
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,922
Yourself.

629
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:36,484
Eventually,
that'll go away.

630
00:39:36,572 --> 00:39:38,797
Or... at least some of it will.

631
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:42,351
But until then,
giving up on that 0.1%

632
00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:44,687
means giving up on
something else.

633
00:39:45,197 --> 00:39:46,781
Hope.

634
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:51,937
Hope...

635
00:39:53,405 --> 00:39:55,172
killed my mother.

636
00:40:58,292 --> 00:40:59,780
We need to talk.

637
00:41:00,073 --> 00:41:03,870
About the 800-pound gun
in the room.

638
00:41:25,492 --> 00:41:27,909
I'm working
on my compromise skills.

639
00:41:28,756 --> 00:41:30,443
Okay.

640
00:42:01,801 --> 00:42:04,231
Looks like your first
lead surgery went well.

641

_

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,368
All right, that'll be $3.40.

4
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:21,006
Oh, okay. Let me just...

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

6
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:31,516
So sorry.

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,018
It's okay.

8
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:34,619
Here you go.

9
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:41,359
And there you go.

10
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:43,581
- Thank you.
- No worries.

11
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:45,163
Thank you very much.

12
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:47,722
- Have a good day.
- You too.

13
00:00:55,864 --> 00:00:57,242
Have you seen my ID badge?

14
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,511
- No.
- I had it last night,

15
00:00:59,535 --> 00:01:02,981
but maybe it fell out of my bag
when I paid for the pizza.

16
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:05,850
This wouldn't happen if you stayed over.

17
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:07,986
If you'll remember back
to when I lived here,

18
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,855
my ability to lose things
has always been top-notch.

19
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,391
If you stayed over,
you wouldn't have had to come

20
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:15,193
all the way back here
when you realized...

21
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:16,995
It's too soon, Shaun.

22
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:18,321
Why?

23
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:20,365
If I stayed over,

24
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:22,233
we both would've gotten a lot less sleep.

25
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:24,469
Why is it too soon?

26
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:26,604
Because we've only been together
a few weeks.

27
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,307
How many weeks of being together
are required

28
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:31,076
before you can stay over?

29
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,911
Yes!

30
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:35,241
Uh...

31
00:01:35,838 --> 00:01:37,449
Saturday.

32
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:41,152
I will spend the night Saturday.

33
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:52,281
I'm glad we come here.

34
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:55,305
I don't want to stop coming.

35
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:56,968
Why would we?

36
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,721
Well, that's the way it works.

37
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,607
You mourn, you cry, and then you forget.

38
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,619
You don't forget.

39
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:13,092
You... start to move on.

40
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:18,099
I don't want to stop coming.

41
00:02:29,237 --> 00:02:31,189
Your temperature's almost 101.

42
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:32,724
Your other symptoms?

43
00:02:32,748 --> 00:02:35,127
First it was a sore throat,

44
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:36,762
then my body started aching.

45
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:41,033
And then there's this cough.

46
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:42,634
I even had my flu shot.

47
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:45,470
Unfortunately, influenza is
constantly mutating.

48
00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:47,406
The shot always lags behind.

49
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,974
Hopefully, you'll recover faster
because of it.

50
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:54,413
My daughter's very worried
that I might have this...

51
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:55,847
virus from China.

52
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:57,082
What's it called?

53
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:58,984
Have you been to China
or been around anyone

54
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:01,151
who's been to China recently?

55
00:03:01,176 --> 00:03:02,954
Taken any cruises?

56
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:05,490
The coronavirus doesn't cause
sore throats.

57
00:03:05,514 --> 00:03:07,125
This is a bad case of the flu.

58
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:09,695
Go home, rest, drink plenty of fluids.

59
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,961
You'll be fine in a week or two.

60
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:17,836
_

61
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:23,709
The virus has damaged
your mother's lungs.

62
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:25,677
Her body is working harder
and harder to breathe,

63
00:03:25,701 --> 00:03:28,113
but her blood oxygen levels
continue to drop.

64
00:03:28,137 --> 00:03:30,849
She definitely has Corona?

65
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:36,254
We're doing everything we can
to help her.

66
00:03:48,113 --> 00:03:59,444
♪ _

67
00:03:59,468 --> 00:04:01,646
You have COVID-19.

68
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,582
But you haven't tested me.

69
00:04:03,606 --> 00:04:06,618
Your chest X-rays suggest
ground glass opacities.

70
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:08,487
That's COVID. I don't need a test,

71
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:10,284
which is good because we don't have any.

72
00:04:10,326 --> 00:04:11,703
But I can't smell.

73
00:04:11,737 --> 00:04:13,926
I've been reading about it,
and that's not a symptom.

74
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,395
I guess it is now.

75
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:18,561
You have COVID.

76
00:04:21,157 --> 00:04:23,372
Okay, now what?

77
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,737
Now you go home.

78
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:27,020
- That's it?
- That's it.

79
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:28,240
There's no treatment.

80
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:29,307
Stay away from people.

81
00:04:29,331 --> 00:04:30,523
Come back if you have trouble breathing.

82
00:04:30,547 --> 00:04:32,021
Goodbye.

83
00:04:32,695 --> 00:04:34,639
25 tests?

84
00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:36,109
Per day?

85
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:38,230
No, just give me one of tomorrow's.

86
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,221
Hello? County Health Department.

87
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:42,356
I don't have time for them,

88
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:43,692
and apparently they don't
have time for me.

89
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,695
Patient.

90
00:04:45,754 --> 00:04:46,798
Needs a lumpectomy.

91
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:47,933
Yes. Needs. And yet.

92
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,035
Surgery canceled?

93
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,238
They ruled it elective.

94
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:51,240
It is elective.

95
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:52,542
You just said "needs."

96
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:53,744
I didn't say when.

97
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,247
This can wait till after the pandemic.

98
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,986
Yeah, I-I'm twice the size of SJ General.

99
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:00,822
I should have twice the amount of tests.

100
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:02,792
Well, who do I speak to?

101
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:05,228
Do you feel shortness of breath?

102
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:06,697
A little.

103
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:10,644
If I'm sick, is my baby sick?

104
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:12,679
This disease doesn't really
seem to affect children

105
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,448
or babies like it does adults.

106
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,416
Should we admit her?

107
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,441
She's probably safer at home.

108
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:22,856
What's at home?
Do you have a support system?

109
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,559
Can anyone come help you
in case you get worse?

110
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:28,995
It's just me... and the little one.

111
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:33,967
Get her a room.

112
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:35,635
Start her on oxygen via nasal cannula,

113
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:38,138
and let's try some vancomycin
and cefepime.

114
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:40,307
Hey, Mia.

115
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:42,743
I'm not headed back there today
or this week.

116
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:44,044
I found a temporary place here.

117
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:45,912
There are hospitals in Phoenix, too.

118
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:47,914
If I come home, do you want me
living with you?

119
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:49,549
Of course. That's the point.

120
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:51,485
Every night after 12 hours
with COVID patients,

121
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:53,253
to hang out with you and Kellan.

122
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:54,681
And his asthma.

123
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:58,825
He's gonna be really bummed.

124
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:00,794
His graduation... Isn't till June.

125
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,801
This'll be over long before then.

126
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:05,532
Someone must have connections.

127
00:06:05,556 --> 00:06:07,934
At county? Van Kleek does, Woo does,

128
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,369
Nguyen's husband works at...

129
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:10,904
Well, great. Get one of them to call.

130
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:13,006
The problem is the board of
every hospital has connections.

131
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,274
They're all calling Public Health.

132
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:15,475
They're all getting nowhere.

133
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:16,543
So we do nothing?

134
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:17,927
No, we do everything we can.

135
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:21,982
We hammer at official channels
and every manufacturer's rep

136
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,417
that we deal with and see what companies,

137
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:25,552
if any, have undisturbed...

138
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:27,561
Nuts or no nuts?

139
00:06:28,377 --> 00:06:29,681
Uh...

140
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:31,858
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:31,882 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm... I'm in the middle of, uh,

142
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:35,462
a-a-a meeting with the Board.

143
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:37,364
Hey, everyone.

144
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:39,599
I'm just making... banana bread.

145
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:40,967
You know what? Let's just take a...

146
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:42,335
I'm gonna take a quick break.

147
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,004
If someone can get me a list of

148
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,673
PPE suppliers in the area, thanks.

149
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,241
I'll be back.

150
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:49,976
I don't want banana bread.

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,645
I want to be back at the hospital.

152
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:53,647
I'm the president,
and I'm at home, watching.

153
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:55,114
You're doing your job.

154
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,216
Whatever you gotta do,

155
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:57,886
whatever decisions you need to make,

156
00:06:57,911 --> 00:06:59,255
you just do it all right here.

157
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:00,994
I can...

158
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:03,030
I can take the necessary precautions.

159
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,333
That whole meeting was about
PPE's mitigation.

160
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,604
Aaron, you are 65 years old
with a history of cancer.

161
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,975
You get that virus, then what?

162
00:07:14,437 --> 00:07:15,648
I don't know what I'm doing.

163
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:18,752
You're being smart.
You're... You're being safe.

164
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:20,521
What is wrong with that?

165
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:25,394
And what is wrong with being
home together for a while?

166
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:29,507
Nothing, I guess.

167
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:31,642
We have no choice.

168
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,561
Let's enjoy it.

169
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,814
Nuts or no nuts?

170
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:39,692
Nuts.

171
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:40,881
Okay.

172
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:45,556
What's going on?

173
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,725
Your mother's oxygen saturation
has gotten critically low.

174
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:48,993
We need to get her on a ventilator.

175
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:50,261
And that'll help her get better?

176
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:52,029
It'll keep her alive,
hopefully long enough

177
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:53,764
for her body to fight off the virus.

178
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:55,599
Is it dangerous?

179
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:57,361
More for us.

180
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:03,274
She's out.

181
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:10,281
Lots of swelling.

182
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:20,658
Slow.

183
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:22,426
You want this over with
as soon as possible,

184
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,628
but you also don't want her to cough.

185
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:45,782
_

186
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,284
- Hello.
- Sorry. I woke you.

187
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:56,320
- I thoughtyou had to be up now.
- I do.

188
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:58,422
- I pushed snooze twice.
- I read the numbers.

189
00:08:58,446 --> 00:09:01,158
You guys had seven deaths in
Santa Clara County yesterday.

190
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:02,559
Any at Saint Bonaventure?

191
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,861
We have deaths at Saint Bonaventure

192
00:09:03,885 --> 00:09:04,962
every day, Kellan.

193
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:06,296
I miss you.

194
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,098
I know. You already said that.

195
00:09:08,122 --> 00:09:09,666
I wanted to reinforce the point.

196
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,969
You said you missed me a lot.

197
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:13,337
And we're together right now.

198
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:15,973
It's different not being
actually together.

199
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:18,609
You mean not being able to have sex?

200
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:21,945
No, I haven't been tested
because there's no need.

201
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:23,347
I'm fine. No symptoms.

202
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:25,749
You can be asymptomatic
and still have it.

203
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,017
I know.

204
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,252
You still working out?

205
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,987
Don't want to lose arm strength
while you're off?

206
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:32,289
I'm making a salad.
Figured I'd bring it by

207
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:33,924
and we'll have a masked,
distanced dinner.

208
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,993
You can't eat with a mask on.

209
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:37,594
Okay, we'll take them off
when we're eating

210
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,695
and turn our heads.

211
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:40,864
They say the regular masks don't work.

212
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:42,499
Okay, you can bring me one from work.

213
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:43,567
No.

214
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:45,803
Do you have enough PPE?

215
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:46,970
PPE?

216
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:48,605
Personal protective equipment, Dad.

217
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,140
Someone's been doing their research.

218
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:52,810
Yes, we have enough.
Yes, I'm being careful.

219
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:54,812
I heard your mother joined a book club.

220
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:56,880
Is Shaun being careful?

221
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:58,982
Oh, yes, I am... very.

222
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:01,251
So am I, so it should be safe
for me to come over.

223
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:04,588
You can't come over
because we are being safe.

224
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:06,223
What about apples?
Do you have enough apples?

225
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:07,357
I could go shop for...

226
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:08,792
He does.

227
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,061
See? Everything is under control.

228
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:12,462
Everything's under control.

229
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,639
I told you not to come back
unless your breathing got worse.

230
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,742
Between the fever and the
cough, he's barely sleeping.

231
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:28,478
Who said that?

232
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:32,916
My wife wanted to come with me,
but she has to work.

233
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,952
She's essential personnel.

234
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:37,441
He's lost 10 pounds.

235
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:39,562
Breathe.

236
00:10:39,587 --> 00:10:41,298
He should've come in a week ago.

237
00:10:41,323 --> 00:10:43,568
Please don't talk when I'm listening.

238
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:46,740
Breathe.

239
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:48,810
He's also coughing. A lot.

240
00:10:48,835 --> 00:10:50,245
He hasn't told you, but he is.

241
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,182
I'm sorry.

242
00:10:52,207 --> 00:10:54,618
Did you just apologize for me?

243
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:56,688
Because I'm worried about you?

244
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:58,024
So sorry.

245
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:00,094
I'm a wife who is worried
about her husband.

246
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,796
Forgive me, I'm... I'm evil.

247
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:04,161
It's lucky that you're so irritating.

248
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:06,316
What?

249
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,054
Your husband's blood oxygen
level is dangerously low.

250
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:13,595
That... That can't... That can't be.

251
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,518
I mean, I don't... I don't feel that bad.

252
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,187
Not great, but my breathing...

253
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:18,521
That's interesting.

254
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,657
You don't feel bad, but you are.

255
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,059
Hmm. Admit him to the COVID Floor.

256
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,227
Start heated humidified

257

high-flow nasal cannula at 8 LPM.

Her CRP, ESR, ferritin, D-dimer,

260
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,591
transaminases, and IL-6 are all way up.

261
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:56,226
Try her on dexamethasone.

262
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,927
I read in my online physicians group

263
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,864
that the UK's had some success with that.

264
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,034
Thank you.

265
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,170
Sorry, what'd you say? I
couldn't hear with the mask.

266
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:09,305
Thank you.

267
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,406
I heard you stepped in

268
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,475
for a therapist
that didn't come in today.

269
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,244
My son has asthma.

270
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:16,561
I've been doing this kind of
stuff for years.

271
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,249
I got a dresser.

272
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,351
And a crib.

273
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,820
Bolted them both to the wall.

274
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:27,090
All that matters is her.

275
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,425
I'm gonna do everything right.

276
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,729
You're gonna be a parent.

277
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,961
No way you're doing everything right.

278

for your COVID test kits.

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,951
Well, what do you need?

280
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:48,488
I've got hydroxychloroquine, ribavirin...

281
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:50,357
EKG leads?

282
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:51,726
No, no. I-I'm not saying no.

283
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:53,129
We'll pick 'em up in two hours.

284
00:12:53,154 --> 00:12:54,665
We have a surplus of EKG leads?

285
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,034
No, we've got a shortage.

286

But that's a problem that can wait.

Mildred's P-to-F is below 50.

She's showing signs of cardiogenic shock.

289
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:02,544
- Start her on steroids.
- I already have.

290
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:04,614
If she continues to go downhill,
I'd like to add ECMO;

291
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,949
take the strain off her heart and lungs.

292
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:07,321
Good idea.

293
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:10,959
I need EKG leads.

294
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:12,327
What do you need?

295
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:13,895
Should we intubate him?

296
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,064
Not yet. Not a minute before we need to.

297
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,399
His oxygen saturation
has been dropping steadily.

298
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,567
It's 74 now.

299
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,069
- At this rate...
- We're gonna prone him.

300
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:22,971
A buddy in New York says it helps.

301
00:13:22,995 --> 00:13:24,862
Sometimes.

302
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:40,878
How is Claire feeling?

303
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:44,993
...I assume she's exhausted?

304
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:47,662
That isn't a feeling. How is she feeling?

305
00:13:47,686 --> 00:13:50,231
It's a little tough to tell,
Shaun. She's wearing a mask.

306
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:52,867
Exactly. You can't tell if she's happy.

307
00:13:52,891 --> 00:13:54,135
You can't tell if she's sad.

308
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,771
You can't tell if I'm sad
or if I'm happy.

309
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,177
Well, you seem
distressingly happy, Shaun.

310
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,141
It's exciting. I can't read people.

311
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:01,909
Now no one can read people.

312
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:04,679
We're all forced to rely on
more reliable markers...

313
00:14:04,703 --> 00:14:06,014
like what people are saying.

314
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:09,083
Well, since you can't tell from
my face, I'll use my words.

315
00:14:09,107 --> 00:14:10,445
I feel terrible.

316
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,421
We all feel terrible because
we spent the last 18 hours

317
00:14:13,445 --> 00:14:14,705
watching people get sicker.

318
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:15,852
We didn't help anyone.

319
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,492
We just fended off death
for a little while,

320
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,060
and we're all pretty disgusted

321
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:20,711
at the joy you're taking
in this situation.

322
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,347
- Give him a break.
- You're enjoying this, too.

323
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:25,682
All elective surgeries
have been canceled,

324
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:28,185
so no one is a surgeon anymore,
not just you.

325
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:29,521
Claire...

326
00:14:31,012 --> 00:14:33,724
We're all exhausted, and
tomorrow won't be any different.

327
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:37,121
But it'd help if we didn't hate
each other when that time comes.

00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,710
You work in a hospital?

331
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:30,111
Yes.

332
00:16:30,135 --> 00:16:33,237
Could you wait for the next elevator?

333
00:16:37,142 --> 00:16:39,481
I appreciate you.

334
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:44,926
No.

335
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,728
- What's wrong?
- No, no.

336
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:48,863
But they had toilet paper...
12 rolls, double-ply.

337
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:50,198
No, no.

338
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:52,400
This is Lea's cabinet.

339
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:54,936
- She's not using it now.
- It needs to stay free.

340
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,638
For when she comes back.

341
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:58,440
This is my apartment.

342
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:02,521
You had no right to put anything
anywhere without my permission.

343
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:18,259
I miss Kellan and Mia, too.

344
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:22,697
What do they have to do
with Lea's cabinet?

345
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:24,066
You miss her, Shaun.

346
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,501
No, I don't. If I saw Lea,

347
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:29,537
she might be exposed to COVID
and she might get sick.

348
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,307
I don't want that.

349
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:34,977
And yet... you miss her.

350
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,218
Why would I want something
that isn't what I want?

351
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:45,954
Why do people on diets want ice cream?

352
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:52,649
I thought the ECMO was supposed
to help her heart.

353
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:54,951
It's taken some of the strain off of it,

354
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:58,064
but her own immune system is
still attacking her organs.

355
00:17:58,104 --> 00:18:00,323
And the steroids were
supposed to stop that.

356
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:01,991
We switched to a stronger medication,

357
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,801
so hopefully that'll help.

358
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:09,800
This is from her bedside table at home.

359
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:12,604
I gave it to her for
Mother's Day when I was 13.

360
00:18:13,401 --> 00:18:14,771
Would you like me to...

361
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:17,430
Please. Can I bring it to her?

362
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:22,246
I'm... I'm sorry, Lashelle, I can't.

363
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:23,415
It's just too risky.

364
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,985
I don't care what happens to me.

365
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,322
My mother is in there, all alone,

366
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:29,891
hooked up to a machine.

367
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:33,281
I just need to see her and...
and tell her...

368
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:35,361
that I love her.

369
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,331
I can't.

370
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:08,458
Your lungs are filling with
fluid and secretions.

371
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:10,828
Suction catheter, please.

372
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:12,364
Is that from COVID?

373
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:14,167
I guess so. I don't know.

374
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:15,536
It keeps changing.

375
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:16,838
Probably in combination with

376
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,108
the bacterial pneumonia he's developed.

377
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:21,245
First I probably brought this
home to him,

378
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,581
then I sent him to the hospital
where he's gotten...

379
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:25,351
Honey, don't blame yourself.
I'll be fine.

380
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:27,420
I need to suction out your lungs.

381
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:29,323
I'm going to feed this tube up your nose

382
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:30,726
and down into your airway.

383
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:33,062
It will be quite uncomfortable.

384
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:39,401
Please try not to grab my arm.

385
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:44,627
Take deep breaths.

386
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:54,925
We need to prone her.

387
00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:56,360
We can't; she's pregnant.

388
00:19:56,384 --> 00:19:57,995
That's why I bought this off
Michelle in PT.

389
00:19:58,019 --> 00:19:59,697
She does pregnancy massage.

390
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:17,147
I'm sorry! I'm... I'm sorry!

391
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:19,316
I'm on another call!
Can you hold it down?

392
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,731
- Yeah. You can close your door.
- Okay.

393
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:25,990
I-I'm making cioppino for
"Merchant Marine Night."

394
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:27,958
Where did you get the clams?

395
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:30,127
Oh, I ran out to Bruno's.

396
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:31,795
You ran out to buy clams?

397
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:33,330
Yeah, I wore... I wore a mask,

398
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:35,766
and they were really good
about social distancing.

399
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,869
I'm sorry, I'm not... I'm not
supposed to go to the hospital

400
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:40,571
where I possibly could save lives

401
00:20:40,595 --> 00:20:42,039
but you can go to Bruno's

402
00:20:42,063 --> 00:20:44,275
to buy clams for "Merchant Marine Night"?

403
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:46,143
I'm younger than you are,

404
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,878
I have no history of health issues,

405
00:20:47,902 --> 00:20:50,080
and unlike a hospital,

406
00:20:50,104 --> 00:20:52,777
Bruno's is not a Petri dish of COVID.

407
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:55,147
I have this whole menu planned.

408
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:58,852
I thought I could wear my, um,
uniform, and you could...

409
00:20:58,877 --> 00:21:00,888
We're on quarantine.
We're not on a cruise.

410
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:03,425
I know, but I thought
since we're stuck at home,

411
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,594
we could have some fun.

412
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:06,029
It's not a party; it's a pandemic.

413
00:21:06,054 --> 00:21:07,799
I don't have time for theme dinners

414
00:21:07,824 --> 00:21:11,570
and elaborate menus
and sourdough starter.

415
00:21:13,987 --> 00:21:15,321
Okay.

416
00:21:16,202 --> 00:21:19,815
We could... We could at least
dress up for dinner?

417
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:21,873
Yeah...

418
00:21:36,877 --> 00:21:39,241
Were you able to drain his lungs?

419
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:44,214
Yes.

420
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:47,084
Why are you... here?

421
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:51,848
It helps Martin relax...
knowing that I'm around.

422
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:56,241
Do you think it helps Martin
miss you less?

423
00:21:58,881 --> 00:22:01,118
Yeah. Yes.

424
00:22:12,178 --> 00:22:13,722
Martin has a heart murmur.

425
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:16,459
- What?
- Martin! Martin!

426
00:22:16,484 --> 00:22:18,062
Hello. I'm glad you're awake.

427
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,066
You may have a bacterial abscess
on your heart valve.

428
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:23,002
- That sounds really bad.
- It is.

429
00:22:23,027 --> 00:22:25,372
COVID's complications
are not at all consistent.

430
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:27,075
It's becoming annoying.

431
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,111
I'll tell you more
on the way to the procedure.

432
00:22:36,913 --> 00:22:38,957
ECMO isn't working for her.

433
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,829
She's pulseless V-tach.
Epi and the crash cart.

434
00:22:45,692 --> 00:22:47,103
Pushing epi.

435
00:22:54,257 --> 00:22:56,235
120 joules. Clear.

436
00:22:58,129 --> 00:22:59,801
V fib now.

437
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:04,278
Pushing amiodarone 300 in.

438
00:23:05,338 --> 00:23:06,382
200 joules.

439
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:07,721
Clear.

440
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:15,599
17 deaths in the county yesterday,

441
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:17,167
up by two at a time from the day before.

442
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:19,403
Too small of a sample
to draw any conclusions.

443
00:24:19,427 --> 00:24:21,371
What were the new case numbers again?

444
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:23,640
Also up. By 112...

445
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:25,509
Hey, does Shaun look okay to you?

446
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:26,610
I'm fine.

447
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:27,955
He looks fine.

448
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,446
I wasn't asking you. You'll lie.

449
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,181
Kellan, how does Shaun look?

450
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:32,983
I'm fine.

451
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:34,651
He looks tired, right?

452
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:36,920
I am tired, but I'm also fine.

453
00:24:36,944 --> 00:24:39,690
Lea, Shaun's fine. He just misses you.

454
00:24:39,714 --> 00:24:42,493
No, no, I don't.
I miss having sex with you.

455
00:24:42,517 --> 00:24:44,572
Hey, not alone... teenager present.

456
00:24:44,605 --> 00:24:46,569
Does Kellan not know what sex is?

457
00:24:46,605 --> 00:24:48,599
He's graduating high school in two weeks.

458
00:24:48,623 --> 00:24:50,267
Congratulations, Kellan.

459
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,615
- Thanks, Shaun!
- He knows.

460
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:53,203
He doesn't want to hear
about you having it.

461
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:54,538
Neither do I.

462
00:24:54,562 --> 00:24:56,507
Does he think Lea and I don't have sex?

463
00:24:56,531 --> 00:24:58,542
Because we do, a lot.

464
00:24:58,566 --> 00:24:59,968
Or, we did.

465
00:25:00,007 --> 00:25:01,311
I'm sure you do. We're all sure you do.

466
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:02,531
We don't need to talk about it.

467
00:25:02,596 --> 00:25:04,638
Sexual intimacy is beautiful.

468
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:08,085
I'm gonna skip breakfast.

469
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,853
You miss me.

470
00:25:09,877 --> 00:25:11,355
Uh... Unh-unh.

471
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:13,577
No, we talk twice a day.

472
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:16,080
The only difference is the lack
of physical contact,

473
00:25:16,104 --> 00:25:18,582
which reduces your risk of infection.

474
00:25:18,606 --> 00:25:20,951
But... I do miss sex.

475
00:25:20,975 --> 00:25:22,186
Don't you?

476
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,281
I do.

477
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:27,841
We can't do that over the phone.

478
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,628
That's not really true.

479
00:25:31,652 --> 00:25:33,764
Hmm? Go on.

480
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:37,457
Call me after work when you're alone.

481
00:25:39,127 --> 00:25:40,471
Oh.

482
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:49,780
Are... Are you muted?

483
00:25:49,804 --> 00:25:50,681
Yeah.

484
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:52,783
I'm sorry to bother you.

485
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:55,652
When, uh... When can you take a break?

486
00:25:55,676 --> 00:25:57,287
Can you come back in an hour?

487
00:25:57,311 --> 00:25:59,590
You really should take a break.

488
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:02,493
Just get out of the house for a bit.

489
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:04,394
It'll help you work better.

490
00:26:04,418 --> 00:26:07,464
You need to stretch your legs
and stretch your mind.

491
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:12,903
Um, can you come back in...
in a... aw, man!

492
00:26:12,927 --> 00:26:14,505
Are you working?

493
00:26:21,002 --> 00:26:23,781
Who's GoodPlaceFan 793?

494
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:25,282
I don't know, but whoever he is,

495
00:26:25,306 --> 00:26:26,984
he's richer than he was five minutes ago.

496
00:26:27,008 --> 00:26:29,453
I want to go on a walk.
Can I just finish this?

497
00:26:29,477 --> 00:26:30,854
No. No need.

498
00:26:30,878 --> 00:26:34,147
You just play as long as you
want with your friends.

499
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:45,769
Vegetations from the abscess had
implanted on your mitral valve.

500
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:48,172
A narrow margin sharp
dissection left enough

501
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:50,307
leaflet to allow a primary repair...

502
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:52,543
We expect a full recovery of the heart.

503
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:55,712
Of the heart? What about the rest of me?

504
00:26:55,736 --> 00:26:57,881
Unfortunately, your lungs
are still compro...

505
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:02,452
What... What was that?

506
00:27:02,476 --> 00:27:03,921
♪ Ya-hoo! ♪

507
00:27:03,945 --> 00:27:06,290
Someone's going home.

508
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:11,595
♪ Celebrate good times, come on ♪

509
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:13,499
♪ Let's celebrate ♪

510
00:27:13,523 --> 00:27:14,677
♪ There's a party... ♪

511
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,501
Your lungs have a lot of
inflammation and swelling,

512
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:19,870
and we need to put you on
a non-rebreather mask

513
00:27:19,894 --> 00:27:21,905
and hope it gets your O2 level up.

514
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:24,308
That doesn't sound overly promising.

515
00:27:24,332 --> 00:27:26,777
I-Isn't there anything else you can do?

516
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:28,335
No.

517
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,472
You need to go on a ventilator,
so I'm gonna sedate you.

518
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:37,209
For how long?

519
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:39,690
Hopefully just a few days.

520
00:27:39,714 --> 00:27:41,601
But it could be longer.

521
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,696
My baby's due in two weeks.

522
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,721
This is better for both of you.

523
00:27:51,492 --> 00:27:54,137
- If I don't make it...
- You will.

524
00:27:54,161 --> 00:27:58,542
Your baby's safe, you're young,
you're strong.

525
00:28:06,374 --> 00:28:09,386
Sex is not just about touch.

526
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:13,490
It's about imagery,
emotion, connection...

527
00:28:13,514 --> 00:28:16,884
Oh, but touch is very, very important.

528
00:28:16,918 --> 00:28:19,229
I mean, there will be touch.

529
00:28:19,253 --> 00:28:25,168
But I won't be touching you,
and you won't be touching me.

530
00:28:25,192 --> 00:28:26,874
Are your ears okay?

531
00:28:26,898 --> 00:28:28,191
They hurt.

532
00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:30,908
Because of COVID,
I have to wear two masks,

533
00:28:30,932 --> 00:28:33,596
and the elastics cut into
the skin behind my ears.

534
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:36,601
You're going to masturbate
while I masturbate?

535
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:41,198
Yeah. And we'll talk to each other.

536
00:28:41,223 --> 00:28:42,734
That sounds very distracting.

537
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:45,721
Shaun, we're going to talk about sex.

538
00:28:46,707 --> 00:28:50,561
Tell me what you're doing to me.

539
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,744
Looking at you on my computer.

540
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:56,481
What do you wish you were doing with me?

541
00:29:00,147 --> 00:29:01,792
Kissing you.

542
00:29:01,817 --> 00:29:03,027
Mm-hmm.

543
00:29:03,052 --> 00:29:06,165
But what if I have COVID? Then you'd...

544
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,434
I'm unfastening your belt.

545
00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:09,670
No... No, you're not.

546
00:29:09,695 --> 00:29:11,173
I-I don't have my belt on.

547
00:29:11,198 --> 00:29:12,563
Okay, no belt.

548
00:29:12,587 --> 00:29:17,447
Shaun, just close your eyes
and imagine we are...

549
00:29:17,472 --> 00:29:20,697
If I close my eyes,
then I can't see you, Lea,

550
00:29:20,722 --> 00:29:22,888
and I can't see most of you anyway.

551
00:29:22,913 --> 00:29:23,824
You can remember.

552
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,393
No, no, this is stupid.

553
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:27,529
I don't want to pretend
to have sex with you.

554
00:29:27,554 --> 00:29:29,361
I want to be with you.

555
00:29:35,249 --> 00:29:37,894
I miss you, too, Shaun.

556
00:29:57,976 --> 00:29:59,020
Any cough?

557
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:00,788
Any fever?

558
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:01,656
No.

559
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,952
Any shortness of breath?

560
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:05,293
- Sore throat, loss of smell?
- No, no, none of that.

561
00:30:05,317 --> 00:30:08,896
J-Just searing abdominal pain
and the runs.

562
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,432
I'm pretty sure it's my
diverticulitis acting up.

563
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,203
My roommate is
deeply into pandemic baking...

564
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:19,107
I've avoided coming in.
I don't want to catch COVID.

565
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:20,375
Have a seat.

566
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,017
Non-COVID floor,
NPO, I.V. acetaminophen for pain

567
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:25,293
while he waits on his abdominal CT.

568
00:30:25,337 --> 00:30:26,714
No food?

569
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:28,750
Usually my first stop
with an abdominal pain patient

570
00:30:28,774 --> 00:30:30,852
is the cafeteria.

571
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:32,320
It's Ambar. Repetitive late decels.

572
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:34,422
- I've got a baby coming.
- Go.

573
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:44,365
Thank you. I-I know you're busy.

574
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:47,425
What can I help you with?
Are you doing okay?

575
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:52,407
My mother had a necklace... a cross.

576
00:30:52,431 --> 00:30:55,266
She wore it every day.
I'm hoping to get it back.

577
00:30:57,235 --> 00:31:01,683
Uh, the patients' things are all
being held in one place.

578
00:31:01,707 --> 00:31:05,543
We're not supposed to
release them until after the crisis.

579
00:31:09,854 --> 00:31:12,056
I'm so sorry.

580
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:14,796
Thank you.

581
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:22,259
Okay. Um...

582
00:31:23,962 --> 00:31:25,640
Let me see if I can find it.

583
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:29,644
I'll... I'll clean it
and get it back to you.

584
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:40,488
Wanted to let you know
that it'll be quiet around here

585
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:41,556
for a little while.

586
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,625
I'm... taking a walk on
the beach with Susie.

587
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:46,994
We will stay six feet apart.

588
00:31:47,018 --> 00:31:48,730
Six feet is the absolute minimum.

589
00:31:48,754 --> 00:31:51,561
It's still considered quite a risk.

590
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:55,937
So not... not only do you
not want to do things with me,

591
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:58,239
now you don't want me to
do things with other people?

592
00:31:58,263 --> 00:32:00,641
I want you to be careful,
like you want me to be careful.

593
00:32:00,665 --> 00:32:02,744
You don't want me to do anything.

594
00:32:02,768 --> 00:32:05,546
I can't go shopping, I can't take a walk,

595
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,482
you won't spend any time with me.

596
00:32:07,506 --> 00:32:08,549
I'm a little bit busy.

597
00:32:08,573 --> 00:32:09,884
You're playing poker!

598
00:32:09,908 --> 00:32:12,420
I played poker for one hour
while I was working.

599
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:14,789
I spend every minute
of every day with you.

600
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:18,392
Oh, well, you should be so happy
that I'm taking a hike.

601
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:20,184
It'll be a long one.

602
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:29,470
Could you please... Wear your damn mask.

603
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:36,577
Rodriguez or Jeter?

604
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:38,079
Easy... Jeter.

605
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:39,881
I hate A-Rod with a white-hot hate,

606
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:41,549
but it's Jeter who beat us.

607
00:32:41,573 --> 00:32:43,618
Who's your most-hated Yankee?

608
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:45,620
I never cared for Paul Revere.

609
00:32:45,644 --> 00:32:47,688
Your CBC doesn't show a high white count,

610
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:49,991
which is atypical for
acute diverticulitis.

611
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:51,826
We'll see what the imaging shows.

612
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,094
Can we bring Walter down to CT?

613
00:32:53,118 --> 00:32:54,641
Sure thing.

614
00:32:57,255 --> 00:32:59,867
You remember when they lost
game 7 to the Diamondbacks?

615
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:02,837
Oh, I cried tears of joy.

616
00:33:03,995 --> 00:33:05,086
I feel the rump.

617
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,721
Apply the pressure there.

618
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:10,912
Don't be shy. We need this baby out now.

619
00:33:15,941 --> 00:33:16,984
Baby's out.

620
00:33:29,821 --> 00:33:31,766
How's she looking, Dr. Park?

621
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,241
Good.

622
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:37,305
She's pink, active, and breathing great.

623
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:56,424
The third fuse
on the left that looks like

624
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:58,726
it hasn't been flipped but it has.

625
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,930
You just... You turn it...
turn it off and then back on.

626
00:34:02,954 --> 00:34:04,411
This is for the dryer?

627
00:34:04,435 --> 00:34:08,169
I don't want you calling a repairman

628
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:11,128
just because of a tripped fuse.

629
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,445
The dryer is fine.

630
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,263
You're gonna be fine.

631
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:24,952
I love you.

632
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:26,554
You don't need to say that.

633
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:28,689
- But I want to.
- You don't need to, okay?

634
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:30,801
This isn't a big moment.

635
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:34,485
You'll be fine.

636
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:41,202
Lily... most... most people

637
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:43,361
who go on a ventilator...

638
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:46,801
don't come off.

639
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:53,614
Put the doctor on.

640
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:03,441
Tell him he's going to be fine.

641
00:35:04,382 --> 00:35:06,060
I can't.

642
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:09,130
He's right. The majority
of COVID patients

643
00:35:09,154 --> 00:35:11,721
who go on a ventilator never come off.

644
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:14,681
Put the other doctor on.

645
00:35:16,373 --> 00:35:19,441
Martin's relative youth is a positive.

646
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:24,478
I'm sorry. I wish I could give you more.

647
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:05,899
Your daughter's beautiful.

648
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:10,681
6 1/2 pounds, 19 inches,

649
00:36:10,705 --> 00:36:13,106
completely COVID-free.

650
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:18,689
She's, uh, got your nose...

651
00:36:18,713 --> 00:36:20,691
eats like a champ.

652
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:23,950
Everyone on the floor
knows when she's hungry.

653
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:32,269
She just needs you to get better
so you can hold her.

654
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,486
So far,
good news. No signs of diverticulitis.

655
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,445
Just need to scan y...

656
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:53,001
What?

657
00:36:54,115 --> 00:36:55,721
Scan my what?

658
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:01,298
Hello.

659
00:37:01,322 --> 00:37:02,499
Put on a mask.

660
00:37:02,523 --> 00:37:03,527
But I'm in the...

661
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:05,281
Put on a mask. Now.

662
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,106
Walter's abdominal CT caught
the lower portion of his lungs.

663
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,875
It's not diverticulitis. It's COVID.

664
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:13,810
We've both been exposed
and so has everyone

665
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:15,323
who passed through that hallway

666
00:37:15,348 --> 00:37:17,326
Walter was sitting in for an hour.

667
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,554
Ambar's acidosis is getting worse.

668
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:26,022
She's not getting enough oxygen.

669
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:28,225
- What's her ventilator setting?
- She's maxed out.

670
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:30,360
We can't increase pressure
without risking blowing out her lungs.

671
00:37:30,384 --> 00:37:31,495
Does she have any family?

672
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:32,786
It might be time to notify next of kin.

673
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,654
I read about a small
clinical rescue therapy trial...

674
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:35,799
the CHILL study.

675
00:37:35,823 --> 00:37:38,135
She's a good candidate...
no cytokine storm,

676
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,470
her troponin's low,
so are her LFTs and creatinine.

677
00:37:40,494 --> 00:37:42,105
Her organs are in good shape.

678
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:43,540
So why not freeze them and paralyze

679
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:45,409
virtually every muscle in her body?

680
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:47,377
Lowering the temperature reduces her

681
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:50,614
inflammatory response
and her need for oxygen.

682
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:52,852
And it's better than
calling her next of kin.

683
00:37:52,876 --> 00:37:55,218
She's gonna require constant monitoring.

684
00:37:55,242 --> 00:37:56,720
We're all already overstretched.

685
00:37:56,744 --> 00:37:58,121
I'll do it.

686
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:01,001
I'll take full responsibility for her.

687
00:38:09,004 --> 00:38:10,181
Who's there?

688
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:11,417
It's Lea.

689
00:38:11,442 --> 00:38:13,153
You can't come in.

690
00:38:13,178 --> 00:38:15,089
I got you something.

691
00:38:15,114 --> 00:38:16,558
That's too bad.

692
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:18,094
You can't come in to give it to me.

693
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:36,178
I saw online doctors are using these

694
00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:38,081
to help with their masks.

695
00:38:38,106 --> 00:38:40,317
You attach an elastic to each arm

696
00:38:40,342 --> 00:38:43,121
so they don't rub your ears.

697
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:56,813
It is better.

698
00:38:56,838 --> 00:38:58,438
Thank you.

699
00:39:00,828 --> 00:39:07,444
I know I can't come in,
but I don't want to leave.

700
00:39:14,673 --> 00:39:16,607
You can stay there.

701
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:33,689
What's for breakfast tomorrow?

702
00:39:33,714 --> 00:39:35,826
Park's making pancakes.

703
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:38,361
Mmm. That's great.

704
00:39:39,025 --> 00:39:40,936
He's done it before.

705
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,740
They weren't very good.

706
00:39:43,817 --> 00:39:45,361
Why?

707
00:39:46,406 --> 00:39:48,351
They... They were not very good.

708
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:51,689
I-I don't know, but I told him, I said,

709
00:39:51,714 --> 00:39:53,425
"Dr. Park, these pancakes are..."

710
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:51,683
Is that my nightstand?

711
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:53,252
What?

712
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:59,681
Oh, since you feel that our time together

713
00:40:59,706 --> 00:41:03,141
is something to be endured
instead of enjoyed,

714
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:08,003
I decided to make that easier for you.

715
00:41:09,529 --> 00:41:12,775
This is as far away
as I can get right now,

716
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,447
so can you just please shut the door

717
00:41:16,472 --> 00:41:18,683
and go back to your room?

718
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,481
Things will be okay.

719
00:42:23,452 --> 00:42:25,881
- You're back!
- Got sick, got better.

720
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:27,611
Always the over achiever.

721
00:42:27,635 --> 00:42:29,512
I've got to be downtown by noon.

722
00:42:29,536 --> 00:42:30,747
Oh yeah?

723
00:42:30,771 --> 00:42:32,182
You're late for the protest.

724
00:42:32,206 --> 00:42:33,283
How she doing?

725
00:42:33,307 --> 00:42:34,651
Not great.

726
00:42:34,675 --> 00:42:36,386
You don't have to tell me

727
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,021
I know it's lousy.

728
00:42:38,045 --> 00:42:39,589
You're not alone.

729
00:42:42,783 --> 00:42:46,696

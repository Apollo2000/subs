1
00:00:01,035 --> 00:00:02,579
Severe
Winter Weather Advisories

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:05,306
have been issued from Kansas
to western Minnesota.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,275
Severe ice and snow
reported.

4
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:10,678
Temperatures will likely reach
below 20 degrees, and wind chill...

5
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,513
Shaun.

6
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,348
Shaun.

7
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:18,986
Mm. There is a severe
weather warning in Minnesota.

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,721
You haven't been at work
in three days.

9
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,358
I want
to be left alone.

10
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,698
I'm sorry
she hurt you.

11
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,533
But you are strong.

12
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,602
You're the most
determined man I know.

13
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,170
You're gonna
get through this.

14
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:42,476
I wish I was...

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,911
Normal.

16
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:50,851
Everyone wishes
they were normal, Shaun.

17
00:00:58,126 --> 00:01:00,027
You need to get up.

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,430
You need to do
your exercise routine,

19
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,398
then shower, shave,
and get to work.

20
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:06,042
And not because your
patients need your help,

21
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,835
but because it'll
make you feel better.

22
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,106
I'm not leaving
without you.

23
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:20,681
Your sleep apnea is worse
than we'd thought.

24
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,584
You have a condition related
to your pseudoachondroplasia

25
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,286
that is narrowing
the base of your skull

26
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,188
and compressing
the part of your brain

27
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,489
that controls
your breathing.

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,862
People always say
I'm too full of myself.

29
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,264
Guess it's actually true.

30
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:37,898
Finn,
this is serious.

31
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,533
Don't worry.
I'm gonna be fine.

32
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,478
We can remove
bone from the wall of your skull

33
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,904
and resect a small section
of your cerebellum

34
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,473
to reduce
brain-stem pressure.

35
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:48,576
You're... You're gonna
cut out a piece of his brain?

36
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,744
It won't affect
your intellect,

37
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,780
but it will cause
a speech impediment

38
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,482
and some difficulty
with balance.

39
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:57,185
I'd rather you knock
a few points off my IQ.

40
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:58,452
Stop it.

41
00:01:58,486 --> 00:01:59,620
I'm serious.

42
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,022
My "gift of gab"
is what you love about me.

43
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,558
Uh, w-what's
option two?

44
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:07,328
I'm sorry,
there is no other option.

45
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,130
I'm a salesman.
I don't hear the word "no."

46
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:11,665
Th-There's always
another way.

47
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,401
You just got to think
outside the box.

48
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,035
We've already done that,

49
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,904
which is how we came up
with this surgery.

50
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,282
It's the only way
to keep you alive,

51
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,907
so you have no choice
but to accept it.

52
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,278
Dr. Murphy is being rude
and insensitive,

53
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,613
but he's also right.

54
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,148
Finn, please,
I love you.

55
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:30,150
And I will always
be here for you

56
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,586
no matter
how you talk or walk.

57
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,522
But you have to listen
to your doctors.

58
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,226
I love you, too.

59
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,966
Do whatever
you think's best.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

61
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,120
Let me guess.

62
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,689
I'm gonna need
another surgery.

63
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,624
What's that now,
my tenth?

64
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:11,659
Eleventh.

65
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,862
And I still can't
work the farm,

66
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:18,832
can't drive a tractor,
pull a combine lever.

67
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,168
I can't even
twist open a bottle of beer.

68
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,803
When we met,
you were in an ambulance

69
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,938
and your arms were still
in your harvester.

70
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:28,342
Today you have sensation
and almost full mobility.

71
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,210
Now we just need
to treat the neuropathy

72
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,212
and improve
your strength.

73
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,315
So how
do we do that?

74
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,585
I'm thinking a gracilis
muscle transfer.

75
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:40,654
That should improve his grip
and relieve some of the pain,

76
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:43,657
but there's only one way
to eliminate all of it.

77
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,327
Tyson, have you given
any more thought to amputation

78
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,195
and osseointegrated
prosthetic arms?

79
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,963
They'd attach
directly to the bones

80
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,131
and nerves
in your forearm,

81
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,200
and you can control them
just like your own hands.

82
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,136
Function would be reduced
in some respects.

83
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,373
Less dexterity,
no sensory feedback.

84
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,875
But others, like grip strength,
would be better.

85
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,877
And more importantly,
you'd be pain-free.

86
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:10,083
I want to be
a farmer,

87
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,385
not a cyborg.

88
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,787
Okay.

89
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,758
The pain's
getting worse.

90
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,861
Probably because I've been
crazy busy in the O.R.

91
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,430
with Murphy out
till today.

92
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,498
He's back?

93
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,166
Only because Browne
went to his apartment

94
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,200
and dragged his ass in.

95
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:29,937
She shouldn't have
done that.

96
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,539
He's trying to work
this out on his own.

97
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:32,606
That's a good thing.

98
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,909
DMARDs aren't working.

99
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,778
I know.

100
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,981
Which is why I've been thinking
about synovectomy surgery.

101
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,951
You're gonna remove the
joint linings in your fingers?

102
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,519
That'll resolve the pain
temporarily.

103
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:46,587
Then what?

104
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,489
It'll give me
at least ten years.

105
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,659
And then you're gonna be
bone on bone,

106
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:54,094
every joint in your hand
will be mangled and deformed.

107
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,663
What's your plan then?

108
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,202
Who knows what treatments
will be available in ten years?

109
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,671
Have you thought
about oncology?

110
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,540
Surgeons do
the real work.

111
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:09,142
They cut out the tumor,
they cure the patient.

112
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,078
Oncologists just
sweep up after.

113
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,646
You want to know
an even better job?

114
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,982
Starting pitcher
for the Oakland A's.

115
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,651
You want to know
why I didn't get that job?

116
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,629
Because the scouts didn't like
the way you wore your hat?

117
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,556
Yeah, that,
and I was born with this arm.

118
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,257
You were born
with those hands.

119
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,459
What are you gonna do,

120
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,160
practice surgery
for a few more years

121
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,505
and then spend
the rest of your life

122
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,631
not being able
to pick up a pencil?

123
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,234
You can pursue
another specialty.

124
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,269
You can practice
for the rest of your life.

125
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,412
You get rear-ended
on the way to work

126
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:46,480
or you just hate
little people?

127
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:49,550
Neither.
EKG is normal.

128
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,485
So you got dumped.

129
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,355
No, I didn't.

130
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,757
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

131
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,194
We were never even
going out.

132
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,197
Finn?

133
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,833
I've been worried sick.

134
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,135
Ohh.

135
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,670
Take it easy.

136
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,171
I told you to stay home.

137
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,506
There's nothing
to worry about.

138
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,274
Stop trying
to act so tough.

139
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,043
You shouldn't have to
go through this alone.

140
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,982
Sorry, baby,
but you should wait outside.

141
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,852
Let the doctors finish up,
and I'll be right out.

142
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,054
He's not going to the O.R.
for a while,

143
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,389
so there will be plenty of
time to visit when we're done.

144
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:30,424
Okay.

145
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,661
I'll be right outside.

146
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,745
Is there any way
you could make sure

147
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,114
she and Nathalie
stay in separate waiting rooms

148
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,916
and aren't allowed to visit
at the same time?

149
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,085
No. We're
not helping you cheat.

150
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,553
I'm not cheating.

151
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:03,023
I've always made it clear
I'm not ready to settle down,

152
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,225
but sometimes
women m-make assumptions.

153
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,561
Oh, and you don't feel
the need to correct that?

154
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,263
I understand
you don't approve,

155
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,431
but all I'm asking

156
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,834
is for you to help me
get through brain surgery

157
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,368
without emotional turmoil

158
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:18,371
that I assume would be
harmful to my recovery.

159
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:25,779
Okay.

160
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,314
Thank you.

161
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,991
Are you seeing
the same thing I'm seeing?

162
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:41,294
The tendons
are encased in scar tissue.

163
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,648
The gracilis
muscle transfer isn't gonna work.

164
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:46,900
It still could.
If we attach the muscle

165
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:49,570
further down the forearm
and bypass the scar ball.

166
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,438
It wouldn't hold.

167
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,273
There'd be too much tension
on the graft.

168
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,310
We can figure out a way
to work around that.

169
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,179
Let's wake him up and
put him back in his room

170
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,815
and pull every paper on
free-muscle and nerve transfers.

171
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,585
His only option
is double amputation

172
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,286
and the osseointegrated
prosthetics.

173
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,988
We don't have
a choice.

174
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,422
Yes, we do.

175
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,491
And as Chief of Surgery,
I just made it.

176
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,997
He doesn't really
look the part.

177
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,968
He's a handsome guy
with a great sense of humor

178
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,302
and a high-paying job.

179
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,137
He means
because women don't like

180
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,173
to be in relationships
with men who are weird.

181
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,808
He's not weird.
And neither are you.

182
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,777
And a week ago,
you were juggling two women,

183
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,645
so stop feeling
so sorry for yourself.

184
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,614
Have you ever dated
anyone who wasn't tall,

185
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:34,782
handsome,
and neurotypical?

186
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,485
It's not about me.

187
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:41,598
Talk to me.
He stopped breathing,

188
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,523
and I haven't even
administered the paralytics.

189
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:46,927
What just happened?

190
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,305
Pressure on
the medulla must be getting worse.

191
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,207
He's lucky he didn't wait
any longer to come in.

192
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,200
Let's tube him
and get to work.

193
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,736
Wait. Flex his head
into position again.

194
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,611
Extend his neck.

195
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:07,114
What's going on?

196
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,852
Flexing the neck offsets
the posterior compression.

197
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,030
But that should take the pressure off,
not make it worse.

198
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,431
Doesn't make any sense.

199
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,736
And we're not gonna do brain
surgery on him until it does.

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,269
I don't see anything different
in the flexed-neck views.

201
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:34,007
Should his C2 bone
be curved inward like that?

202
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,119
It could exacerbate the
narrowing on the front of his...

203
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,444
It's not significant.

204
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,180
Well, if his apnea's
getting worse

205
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,457
because of pressure from
the front as well as the back...

206
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,650
The treatment
is the same.

207
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,818
Surgery to create more room
in the skull base.

208
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:46,854
It's not the same,
and stop interrupting me.

209
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,390
If we drill off
the C2 in the front,

210
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,292
as well as open
the back,

211
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,728
we might not have to
resect the cerebellum.

212
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:57,698
He wouldn't have any speech
impediment or balance issues.

213
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,033
We'd have to approach
through his mouth,

214
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,202
a bacteria-rich
environment,

215
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,637
which can't be
fully sterilized.

216
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:05,715
There would be too high a risk
of a post-op brain infection.

217
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,174
So we figure out
another approach.

218
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,843
There's only one safe way
to access the C2.

219
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:12,880
Okay,
so come up with something outside the box.

220
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,215
No, that's a stupid
expression. There is no box.

221
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,550
And you are wasting
valuable time

222
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,586
just because
you want to be nice to her.

223
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,021
Murphy...

224
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,598
We should do the cerebellar
surgery before he has a fatal apnea...

225
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,891
Murphy.

226
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,493
I'm not being nice.

227
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,762
I'm using my experience
and judgment to make the call.

228
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:29,863
That's my job.

229
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:31,932
You are being nice.
And you're being a jerk.

230
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,739
You've got the night.

231
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,941
If you two can't come up
with a solution by morning,

232
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,776
we'll proceed
with the original plan.

233
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,062
Your patient's
in desperate need

234
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,596
of an Oklahoma
weather report?

235
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,799
I didn't even want
to be here today.

236
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:10,771
You should try
a martial arts class.

237
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,707
Focused distraction is key
to dealing with stress

238
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:15,542
and heartbreaks.

239
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,510
That's just
avoiding the problem.

240
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,346
Don't obsess over
what you've lost,

241
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,381
focus on what you've gained
from the relationship.

242
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,083
I hate to interrupt
group therapy,

243
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,185
but what if
we approached

244
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,720
through the side
of the neck?

245
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:28,856
We could transpose
the vertebral artery,

246
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,324
open up the spine laterally
to drill off the C2.

247
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,360
It would leave his spine
permanently unstable

248
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,694
and could cause
a stroke.

249
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,964
There might be a way
to mitigate stroke risk.

250
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,665
And he'd still have
the instability and...

251
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,300
Come on, Shaun.

252
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,869
I need help,
not criticism.

253
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,272
I have always
supported you

254
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,649
when you were trying
to come up with

255
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,033
an unconventional
treatment option.

256
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,046
You supported me when
you thought I was right.

257
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,688
What do
you guys think?

258
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,392
We gotta go.

259
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,060
We do?

260
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,430
We remove the scar tissue
and the nerves.

261
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,908
Then harvest nerves
from his upper arm

262
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,000
to rewire
his forearms.

263
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,167
It'll improve his grip,

264
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,602
and with
the scar tissue removed,

265
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,037
the pain
should decrease, too.

266
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,239
Does nothing to solve
the blood-flow problem

267
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,540
that's causing
the scarring.

268
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,609
I'm sure we can come up
with a solve for that.

269
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,677
That's what
you said last time.

270
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,880
And I was right.
We're making progress.

271
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,349
Would you two
give us a moment?

272
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,852
We'll meet you in the Residents'
Lounge when we're done.

273
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,959
Are you
so against the prosthetics

274
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,736
because you think it's in
Tyson's best interest,

275
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,761
or because
it's my idea?

276
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,533
You think I care
whose idea anything is?

277
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,435
You're a competitive person

278
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,537
working with the guy
who used to hold your job.

279
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:56,276
I'll admit my competitive
drive may kick up a notch

280
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,811
when we work together.

281
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:01,281
I'll also admit
that I admire the courage

282
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,984
of a guy who stumbled
a half-mile back to his house

283
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,719
after his arms were
ripped off by a combine.

284
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,655
He opened a door
with his mouth

285
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,824
and dialed 911
with his nose,

286
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,559
and as long as he wants
to keep fighting,

287
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,461
I'm gonna fight
along with him.

288
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,496
Which has nothing to do
with my ego.

289
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,765
Good.

290
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,267
That's all
I wanted to confirm.

291
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,447
But I'm gonna start prepping
for the amputation

292
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,907
because that's the only
rational choice we have,

293
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,780
which I'm confident
you'll realize soon enough.

294
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,018
Make any progress?

295
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,822
Yeah, I figured out
a lateral approach,

296
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:46,659
but Shaun thinks it would
leave his spine unstable

297
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,128
and increase his risk
of stroke.

298
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,799
I agree.
Yeah, me too.

299
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,277
There has to be a way
to mitigate the...

300
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,702
Dr. Browne?

301
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,270
These just
got delivered.

302
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,775
Enjoy.
Thanks.

303
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,344
Dash is a romantic.

304
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,879
Thought you hated
romantics.

305
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:10,150
Yeah, he's...
He's teasing me.

306
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,520
I told him I thought guys
who sent flowers were lame.

307
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,824
We haven't even kissed yet.

308
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,627
What are you waiting for?

309
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,631
I don't know.

310
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,199
Um...

311
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:29,269
I enjoy
being with him.

312
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,271
Actually,
I forgot how funny he is.

313
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:34,474
Just... hasn't seemed like
the right time.

314
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,715
I'm more worried
about the stroke risk

315
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,217
than spinal instability,

316
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,853
so focus
on fixing that.

317
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,221
Okay.

318
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,462
And, Claire,
if he's the right guy,

319
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,464
stop holding out
for the right time.

320
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,843
Your vitals are stable.

321
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,046
The nurses will monitor you
during the night.

322
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,117
Your problem's
simple to solve.

323
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,885
You just need
to ask someone else out.

324
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,524
Lea was special.

325
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,093
I'm sure she was.

326
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,495
But there are so many others,
just as special.

327
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,297
You just have to
get to know them.

328
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,365
No, I don't want to.

329
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,700
Yes, you do.

330
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,836
You think I don't know
how you feel?

331
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,372
Afraid of being rejected
because you're too...

332
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,407
Different.

333
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,743
Finally I decided,
screw it.

334
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,079
I started talking
to every woman I saw.

335
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:49,616
Street corners,
elevators, grocery stores.

336
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,751
And I learned
I'm pretty good at it.

337
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,919
That's my gift.

338
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,055
Everyone has one.

339
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,789
They just.

340
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,626
Have to figure out
what it is...

341
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:06,466
Okay. Code Blue!

342
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,568
Code Blue!

343
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,788
Murphy and I just inserted a
diaphragmatic pacemaker on Finn.

344
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,991
It'll only trigger
shallow breaths,

345
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,461
so he's at high risk
for pneumonia.

346
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,129
You got anything?

347
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,930
Yeah,
I was thinking of using

348
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,900
a more inferior
transatlas approach.

349
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,036
That would minimize
stroke risk.

350
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,471
That won't work.

351
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,938
It would destabilize
the C1-2 joint.

352
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,479
You did
all you could.

353
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,147
Go home.

354
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,015
We'll do the original
cerebellar surgery

355
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,150
first thing
in the morning.

356
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,295
So I'll be able
to work the farm.

357
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,830
We still need to find a way
to increase blood flow.

358
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,334
You should regain most of
your grip and forearm strength,

359
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,607
but you'd still be
in some pain.

360
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,038
I-I can handle it.

361
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,642
Can you?

362
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,511
How can you know
for sure?

363
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:28,215
As the years go by
and the pain doesn't stop,

364
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,649
will you
change your mind?

365
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,118
Because it'll be
too late.

366
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,830
What's wrong? What are
you... What are you feeling?

367
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,157
Like a horse
just kicked in my chest.

368
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,364
I need an echo
and pulmonary cath kit!

369
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,565
And page Lim, stat!

370
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:53,340
I think the last time that I was at
an actual punk-rock show was, uh...

371
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,074
College.

372
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,176
Patti Smith.

373
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,345
Oh, my God!

374
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,846
I completely forgot
about that.

375
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,814
You forgot getting
your ass tossed offstage

376
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:02,915
by a 60-year-old woman?

377
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,184
Yeah.

378
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,085
Remember what you said
when we picked you up?

379
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,722
Uh, oh, something about her
being, uh, thin but strong?

380
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,558
"Thin but wiry."

381
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,626
Wiry.
Wiry.

382
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,171
Okay, well, I, um...

383
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,738
I have an early surgery,

384
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,207
so I should
probably get going.

385
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,741
Okay.
Okay.

386
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:31,611
Have a good night.

387
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:32,879
Good night.

388
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,319
I got an idea.

389
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,986
Actually,
you had it first.

390
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,291
It's the right approach,
just the wrong route.

391
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,363
We go in from the back,
posterior transdural,

392
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,765
gently move your spinal
cord out of the way

393
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,134
so we can drill off
the misshaped C2.

394
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,502
There is
a risk of paralysis,

395
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,504
but we would be monitoring
your spinal functions

396
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,105
to help avoid
any nerve injuries.

397
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,242
Let's do it.
Where do I have to sign?

398
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,709
You shouldn't sign anything.

399
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,380
Consenting to this surgery

400
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,982
would be incredibly
shortsighted and reckless.

401
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:55,528
It is one thing to take your bad
mood out on your colleagues,

402
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,530
but to try and undermine
my surgical advice...

403
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,266
My opinion's valid.

404
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,633
Well, thankfully,
he disagrees.

405
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,703
He's risking paralysis
to be charming

406
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,506
because people expect
everyone to be perfect.

407
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,007
Everyone's opinion
is valid

408
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,685
all the way until
we go into the patient room.

409
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:13,212
We are a team
with one opinion.

410
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,086
I...

411
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,722
I don't feel better!

412
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,257
I feel worse!

413
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,659
And doing
the wrong surgery

414
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,995
is not
going to help anyone.

415
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,664
I don't want to do it,
I'm going home.

416
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,225
You're not walking out
on your patient.

417
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,784
Or your team.

418
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:54,354
I still have
two sick days

419
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,689
and 76 hours
of unused P.T.O.

420
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,434
You're not sick,
and you're in the middle of a case.

421
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,827
I don't care about
the case or the patient.

422
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,434
I don't care
about anything.

423
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:23,450
I've had
my heart broken twice

424
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,951
in the last few years.

425
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,120
You want to know
what I did?

426
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,425
I came to work
every day

427
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,394
and pretended
everything was fine.

428
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,430
Until, eventually,

429
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,031
I wasn't
pretending anymore.

430
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,871
That's not helpful
at all.

431
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,680
How about this?

432
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:55,114
Go back in there

433
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,849
and help Claire
prep Finn for surgery,

434
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,250
or you won't be
my resident.

435
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,053
Or anyone else's
at St. Bonaventure.

436
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,857
And I know
you care about that.

437
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,150
We were able
to clear the clot,

438
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,253
but due to the restricted
arteries in your arms,

439
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,523
we're gonna need to keep
you on blood thinners...

440
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:37,657
Indefinitely.

441
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:40,993
Okay.

442
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,196
The blood thinners

443
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,298
make the reconstructive
surgery impossible.

444
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:49,736
We have no choice
but to amputate.

445
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,639
I'm sorry.

446
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,643
No.

447
00:22:57,777 --> 00:23:00,513
I'm not letting you
cut off my arms.

448
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,815
I don't want
false limbs.

449
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,216
I don't want to be
that guy.

450
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,685
I want to be
who I am.

451
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:15,695
You are the toughest,

452
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,897
most tenacious person
I've ever met.

453
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:21,367
And that
is not gonna change

454
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,269
because we replace your hands
with titanium.

455
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,509
It's time to let go.

456
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,687
Okay.

457
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,024
Okay.

458
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:54,867
Any way
you could draw a skull

459
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,904
with a cobra coming out of its
eyes while you're back there?

460
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,839
Would you settle for
a lame smiley face?

461
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,008
Because that is the
only thing I can draw.

462
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,512
There's my favorite nurse.

463
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:07,213
Did you check out
that Ethiopian place

464
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,515
I told you about
last night?

465
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:09,616
Actually, I did,

466
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:12,384
and the kik alicha
was delish.

467
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:14,286
Now, if you want
a truly life-changing meal,

468
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,288
you need to try Lennon's
on Sixth.

469
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,591
Is it expensive?
Outrageously.

470
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,593
But worth it.

471
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:24,130
Now,
it's all white tablecloths and candles,

472
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,464
so you'll need
a date.

473
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:26,966
How 'bout Dr. Murphy?

474
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,705
You told me yourself
he's a gifted surgeon.

475
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:33,873
That's pretty
high praise.

476
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,276
And he told me
you're cute.

477
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:44,617
Good luck today.

478
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:45,985
Thanks.

479
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,558
I totally teed you up.

480
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,359
All you had to do
was take a swing.

481
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:56,062
I'm not interested
in her.

482
00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:57,997
If she's not your type,

483
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,132
I'm sure there are plenty
of other cool nurses

484
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,200
roaming around here

485
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,202
who could make you feel better
about yourself.

486
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,005
He's miserable because he's
had two relationships blow up.

487
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,507
I don't think jumping into
another one is the answer.

488
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,946
No, no, no!

489
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,790
Finn, you can't
exert yourself like this.

490
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:26,659
Just take it easy.

491
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,862
I ran into a woman
in the cafeteria.

492
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,831
Real nice.
But seemed stressed.

493
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,866
Turns out
that her boyfriend

494
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,501
is having
spinal surgery, too.

495
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:38,037
Big coincidence, huh?

496
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,305
But get this.

497
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:42,709
He also has
pseudoachondroplasia.

498
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,311
I mean,
what are the chances?

499
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,646
Nathalie,
don't you dare.

500
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:48,815
Stop!

501
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:50,549
Just slow down.

502
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:56,322
You called me
the love of your life!

503
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:58,791
I do love you!

504
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:00,259
Don't say that!

505
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,695
I don't want to hear
any more of your garbage.

506
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,096
Please...

507
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,965
You have to... listen.

508
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:08,768
You need to get back to bed now,
or you'll pass out.

509
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:28,087
What's up?

510
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,455
What are you doing
in here?

511
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,859
Once you get a patient
on the table,

512
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:33,926
there's too much
going on

513
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,062
to appreciate
what this place is.

514
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:39,098
Mm. It's nice.

515
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,268
It's perfect.

516
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:47,273
Time to scrub in.

517
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:51,110
This will be
my last surgery.

518
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:57,583
Five months ago,
I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.

519
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,188
I'm not responding
to medication.

520
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,342
Why did you do that?

521
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,644
I felt like it.

522
00:27:26,913 --> 00:27:30,983
It didn't change the fact
that he cheated on you.

523
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:33,152
It won't make your life
any better.

524
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,990
You can't control
how you feel about someone.

525
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,895
But you can control what
you do with those feelings.

526
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:45,164
I ended the relationship
on my terms.

527
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,001
More importantly...

528
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,638
It made me
feel better.

529
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,148
A Louisville Slugger
to a Porsche?

530
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,682
It was insane.

531
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,584
I like her.

532
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:07,419
What is to like?

533
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,089
I don't know.

534
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,323
I just do.

535
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,928
A sudden complete loss
of any SSEP and MEP signals.

536
00:28:15,962 --> 00:28:17,139
B.P. and heart rate
are tanking.

537
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:18,264
We've injured his cord.

538
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,099
Push high-dose steroids
and pressors.

539
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,534
Remove the retractor
to take the pressure off.

540
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:30,109
That's the last
of the vessels and nerves ligated.

541
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,678
Mayos.

542
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:37,349
Specimen bag.

543
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:47,159
We have healthy
bone-anchor sites.

544
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,528
Same here.

545
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:51,898
Time to give him
functional arms.

546
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,577
Not me.
Give it to her.

547
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:11,593
She's
a third-year resident...

548
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:13,185
A talented one,
but I wouldn't...

549
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:17,223
I'm sure she's read every
article written on osseointegration,

550
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,591
spent countless hours
in the Skills Lab,

551
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:22,505
and could probably do this with one
of her own arms tied behind her back.

552
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:24,663
Blindfolded.

553
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,332
Get to work.

554
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,412
Push another milligram
of atropine.

555
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:54,961
We may have just paralyzed him
trying to avoid a stutter.

556
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,728
We won't know anything
until we wake him up.

557
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,240
Where's the pressure
still coming from?

558
00:29:58,264 --> 00:29:59,631
Laterally now.

559
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,201
So if we remove the joints
of the C1 and C2 bones,

560
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,402
that should
make enough room

561
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:04,904
so we could
drill off the odontoid.

562
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:06,281
We could replace them
with screws and rods

563
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,773
to stabilize his
spine. That's...

564
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:11,810
A good idea.

565
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,212
Yes, it is.

566
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:15,481
If he's not
already paralyzed.

567
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:27,126
Colleen Brown.

568
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,594
Freshman year.

569
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,298
I took her
to the roller-skating rink

570
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,633
'cause I thought that's
what you're supposed to do,

571
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,635
take girls
to the roller-skating rink.

572
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,404
I didn't know
how to roller-skate,

573
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:41,007
she ended up leaving with
Bobby K.'s little brother.

574
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:45,177
Broke me up.

575
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:46,879
Couldn't go to school
for a week.

576
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:49,248
Convinced my mom
that I was sick

577
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,616
for the first three days,

578
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:54,153
and the last two I spent
in a double feature all day...

579
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,022
Where's Poppa?
And Twelve Chairs.

580
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:59,425
To this day,
I can quote both films verbatim.

581
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,628
So you think I should've
stayed home for two more days?

582
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:04,196
No, I don't think
it would've mattered.

583
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,697
It doesn't
make a difference.

584
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:06,966
And then
I made a list

585
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,068
of all the things
that annoyed me about her.

586
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:10,302
The way
she chewed her gum,

587
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,638
the way she used to sit in
the front row of every class

588
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,373
so that the teacher
would call on her

589
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:15,741
when she
raised her hand,

590
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:17,443
the way she said,
"Excuse me?"

591
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:20,046
instead of just "What?"
or "Huh?"

592
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,513
None of it
makes any difference.

593
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,652
Then why
are you telling me?

594
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:31,723
Maybe it'll make you feel a
little bit better to know that,

595
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,192
what you're going through,

596
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,495
every other young man in the
history of the world has gone through.

597
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:40,766
You're trying to make it work
with Lea and with Carly,

598
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,702
and you're getting a little beat up,
and that's okay.

599
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,137
Join the club.

600
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,674
You're in the mix.
That's a good thing.

601
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:53,312
I'm proud of you.

602
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,523
You ready?

603
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,525
It's gonna take
some getting used to.

604
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,396
But they're the same nerves
you used before.

605
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,900
All you have to do is
think about using the arms

606
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,168
the way
you normally would.

607
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:26,845
Whoa.

608
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:30,549
That's pretty cool.

609
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,625
It's not a beer,

610
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,228
but you got to
start somewhere.

611
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:55,174
Now pinch your forefinger
and thumb and twist off the cap.

612
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,193
I-I can't feel
the thing.

613
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,662
You'll get used to it.
You got this.

614
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,216
Nice.

615
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,022
You want me to say
you were right?

616
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:45,824
About the patient,
or you?

617
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:48,960
When you
offered me a job,

618
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:51,363
you said it was to help me
get back on the horse.

619
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:53,565
But what you really wanted
was a mentor.

620
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,967
Which I'm fine with,

621
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:58,337
but I think maybe you feel
threatened by that need.

622
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,208
Well,
maybe that's true.

623
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:05,511
But maybe also you
enjoy it a little too much.

624
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,647
Maybe because you're having a
hard time giving up being Chief.

625
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,518
Maybe we're both right.

626
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:18,657
How did it go?

627
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,228
Can you lift your arms
for me?

628
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:33,739
Okay.

629
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,009
I'm gonna push your arm,
and I need you to resist.

630
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:42,248
Good. More.

631
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:44,583
Stronger.

632
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,051
That's great.

633
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,220
You should make
a full recovery.

634
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:49,321
Thank you.

635
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,558
H-How's Nathalie's hand?

636
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,627
There was no nerve
or tendon damage.

637
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:56,928
She'll be fine.

638
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,764
She's a good person.

639
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,399
A little spirited,

640
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,301
but that's what I loved
about her.

641
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,772
Are you going to try
to win her back?

642
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,410
I'm confident
but not stupid.

643
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,579
You gotta know when to call it,
Dr. Murphy.

644
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:19,318
I mean,
there's a-a whole world

645
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:21,787
of amazing people
out there.

646
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,956
Don't get bogged down with
this notion of a soulmate.

647
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,799
Finn's exam was normal.

648
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,238
But I am not sure
it was worth the risk.

649
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:42,741
We did
a good thing today.

650
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:44,910
Mostly because of you.

651
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,779
That's kind of you
to say but...

652
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:51,350
Your commitment
to your patients

653
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,920
reminds me of why
I got into medicine.

654
00:35:57,556 --> 00:36:00,859
Being around you
makes me a better surgeon.

655
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,297
A better person.

656
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:12,304
Well, good night.

657
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:13,372
Good night.

658
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,720
You did
good work today.

659
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:32,858
And I understand
you're leaving surgery.

660
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,795
And I know that's a...
That's tough.

661
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:38,129
But it's
the right call.

662
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,403
No, I don't think it is.

663
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,276
I love operating.

664
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,611
So I'm gonna keep doing it
as long as I can.

665
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,417
I'm gonna have
the synovectomy surgery.

666
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:01,920
That's really stupid.

667
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:05,156
That's incredibly stupid.

668
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:09,528
Not every dream
comes true.

669
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,297
You have
other opportunities.

670
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,864
You have another chance.

671
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,166
Not everybody does.
Be grateful for that.

672
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,036
Pick another passion
and pursue that.

673
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:23,208
I'm doing the surgery.

674
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:44,730
Enjoy.

675
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:49,968
Another, please.

676
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,874
Well, that's one way
to start the night off right.

677
00:37:57,576 --> 00:38:00,211
Hello, Nurse Fletch.

678
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:01,780
You can
call me Julie.

679
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:06,051
Are you here alone,
or are you meeting someone?

680
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,886
I'm alone.

681
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,087
Well, to us.

682
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,431
You have
beautiful eyes.

683
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,801
Thank you.

684
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,607
Or did someone
just tell you that

685
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,409
that's a good
opening line?

686
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:38,617
It's right
in our backyard,

687
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,951
and I've never
even been there.

688
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,753
- Have you?
- No.

689
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:44,255
It's, uh, time we unleash
our inner tree-hugger.

690
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,559
You're off next weekend.

691
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:48,770
I think we should
go to Yosemite.

692
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:50,161
What do you think?

693
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,262
Yeah, sounds fun.

694
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:52,964
I need to get me
some hiking boots.

695
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,633
Mm.
And, uh, like a fleece.

696
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,967
Mm-hmm.
Beanie.

697
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:58,103
Mm. I'm rocking the
full lumbersexual look.

698
00:38:58,136 --> 00:38:59,571
'Cause I gotta blend in.

699
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:02,608
I hear a bear can spot
a tourist a mile away.

700
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,976
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

701
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:08,814
You okay?

702
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:12,350
Uh, you're, uh...

703
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,487
You're here,
but, you know, not.

704
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,124
You're right.
I'm sorry.

705
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,159
It's... It's just been
a long week.

706
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,661
I'm a bit exhausted.

707
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:27,399
Yeah,
I think I might call it an early night.

708
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:29,835
Oh, you sure?

709
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,203
I... You know,
we don't have to go to the club.

710
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:34,172
We can chill here.
We can watch a movie.

711
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,273
I'm sorry.

712
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,975
I just...

713
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:38,510
I just think
I should go home.

714
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:41,813
Okay.

715
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:50,321
Shaun?

716
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:56,762
I want
to smash your car up.

717
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:01,199
I think
that's a bad idea.

718
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:08,239
I want to hurt you
the way you hurt me.

719
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:12,377
I'm s-sorry.

720
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,812
You...

721
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,817
You...

722
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,586
You're...

723
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,771
I can't.

724
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:43,875
I can't.

725
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,081
You acted like
you cared about me,

726
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:54,553
but you don't even
respect me.

727
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:58,356
You're flaky.

728
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,561
And...

729
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,798
And you can't
keep a boyfriend.

730
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:11,136
And you can't
keep a job.

731
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:14,472
And no one likes you.

732
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:20,111
And... And you're going to
end up alone,

733
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,580
and you deserve it!

734
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:23,749
Because you're
a superficial,

735
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:26,284
selfish,
and prejudiced person!

736
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,038
You ready to tell me
what's on your mind?

737
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,010
Not really.

738
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,692
I...

739
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:10,629
I think I'm in love
with my boss.

739
00:42:11,305 --> 00:43:11,476

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,200
It's my fault, Ben.

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,960
You were right.

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,720
Shouldn't have involved her.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
About that…

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,720
I don't want to find you hanged.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,160
So, what do I do?

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
Lie down?

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,840
Give up? Let him win?

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,080
Or apologize, if you like.
Sorry for the trouble, Mr. Pellegrini.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,240
Sorry, sir. Again!

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
You have a life.

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,360
You have a wife and a son.

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,200
A son whose birthday is today.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,920
Did you plan something?

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,160
You promised Raoul.

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,400
- I don't feel up for it.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,040
But if you cancel,

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,400
he wins.

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,520
- What?
- You'll see, he's really sweet.

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,200
Just don't mention you-know-who.

24
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Who?

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Pellegrini!

26
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
Youssef.

27
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,640
It's shitty you got pulled from your case.

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,080
It's nothing. Don't worry. Besides…

29
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,160
paperwork is my passion.

30
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,600
- All right, ciao.
- Ciao.

31
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,800
OK.

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Who is this guy?

33
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,800
Luis Perenna,

34
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,440
Sernine,

35
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
the Louvre.

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,200
<i>813</i>, Perenna,

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,360
<i>The Teeth of the Tiger,</i>

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,320
Salvator.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,280
Of course, yes!

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,880
No…

41
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,840
<i>The Queen's Necklace.</i>

42
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,120
Dammit, what am I missing here?

43
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,520
Salvator, <i>The Seven of Hearts.</i>

44
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,400
There has to be a connection.

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,960
DECEMBER 11TH:
MAURICE LEBLANC'S BIRTHDAY

46
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,560
<i>This is just crazy.</i>

47
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,320
Forensics have nothing.

48
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,640
The guy robbed the Louvre,

49
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,720
and they've got nothing on him.

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,000
- Either he's lucky…
- Or the greatest thief of them all.

51
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,280
Don't you start with that too.

52
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,240
- Guédira had a lead.
- He isn't on the case anymore.

53
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,400
Want to join him?

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,840
By the way, where is he?

55
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,240
I didn't fire him.

56
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,560
He sent me a text saying he's sick.

57
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,920
- Did he look sick yesterday?
- Honestly…

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,320
he always looks sick.

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
All right.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,920
If he's in Paris, we'll get him.

61
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Dad?

62
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,520
- Happy birthday, son.
- What have you been up to?

63
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Nothing.

64
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,080
I missed my bus, so I ran a little.

65
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,680
- What is it?
- Open it.

66
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,240
What is this thing?

67
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,480
Look.

68
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,080
There! There you are.

69
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,400
- Assane, let me remind you, he's 14.
- So?

70
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
- You don't like it?
- Well…

71
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,720
I dig the Lupin books.

72
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,480
I'm not sure about the costume.

73
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,680
I'm sure. You're gonna love it. Trust me.

74
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,080
It's not over yet.
In fact, we have to get going.

75
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Where?

76
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,400
- Surprise.
- Well, have fun.

77
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,720
You're not coming?

78
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,760
No, I'm not coming, no.

79
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,080
I already have plans.

80
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,480
Doctor's appointment?

81
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,840
Did you snitch on me?

82
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,440
If you have any questions, just ask them!

83
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,360
- None.
- I have nothing to hide.

84
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,680
- What do you want to know?
- If you're coming.

85
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,520
- The train's in an hour.
- What train?

86
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,560
Our train. I got you a ticket.

87
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,960
You're annoying.

88
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,360
You're always putting me on the spot.

89
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,400
He never gives me any notice.

90
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,600
He's three hours late or doesn't show up.

91
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,080
Does he often ditch you?

92
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,520
Is his work very time-consuming?

93
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,680
His work… if you can call it that.

94
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,960
- What does he do?
- You don't want to know.

95
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,720
Let's just say,

96
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,880
if you run into him on the street,
watch your wallet.

97
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,120
I don't know the half of what he does.

98
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,920
- 295. That's the place.
- Here?

99
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,280
You got the call too?

100
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
- Yeah.
- Yes.

101
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,600
I got two guys stationed inside.

102
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Check under the windows
in case they try to sneak out.

103
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,160
- They're still here?
- There were four of them.

104
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,800
Three took off on a scooter, one's inside.
I'll take care of him.

105
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,320
- Should we go with you?
- A kid on foot. I'll manage.

106
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,680
Check under the windows.

107
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,440
Thanks, guys.

108
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Madam, it's the police.

109
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,080
- Open the door, please.
<i>- Who is it?</i>

110
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,760
- It's the police.
<i>- All right, come in.</i>

111
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Thank you, madam<i>.</i>

112
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
<i>Calm down, madam.</i>

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,720
I have two of my men
standing guard downstairs.

114
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,040
It's going to be OK. You're safe now.

115
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,080
I don't suppose
they took anything from here?

116
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,720
- I don't think so.
- Well, you're lucky.

117
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,560
They completely emptied

118
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,400
your neighbors' apartment.

119
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,840
- Really?
- Yes. Do you have an alarm?

120
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,240
- No.
- That's not OK, madam.

121
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,880
That's not good.
They're going to come back.

122
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,920
- You think so?
- That's for sure!

123
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,840
Those bastards won't let it go.

124
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,400
If they haven't finished the job,
they come back.

125
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,360
Stuff their pockets. Take everything.

126
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,160
- But you're staying here?
- No, madam.

127
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,360
I'm not staying.

128
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
I can't.

129
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,800
Understaffed.

130
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,040
All the money goes to the projects.
There's nothing left for honest people.

131
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,440
- My God!
- As you say.

132
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,880
- There might be a solution.
- Yes. Tell me.

133
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,040
A bit complicated.

134
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,960
Please.

135
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,160
If you have really valuable items,
leave them with me.

136
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,200
It's for the best. Let's do that.

137
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,600
I will put them in the station,

138
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,240
safe and sound in the evidence room.

139
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,800
You can come pick them up
after we catch the guys.

140
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes. Let's do that.

141
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,200
It's going to mean paperwork for me.

142
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,960
- I will have to...
- Please.

143
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
All right.

144
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Let's do that.

145
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
Madam.

146
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,040
Only the most valuable.

147
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,760
There.

148
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,240
My husband gave them to me.

149
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,520
He worked in diamond mining
in the Belgian Congo.

150
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,440
- The good old time.
- The locals were sitting on a fortune.

151
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,920
- They didn't realize. We helped ourselves.
- You did the right thing.

152
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,480
- The earrings too?
- Yes. Please.

153
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,600
Thank you. I…

154
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,720
have one last favor to ask you.

155
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,560
I have a Fabergé egg.

156
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,800
Madam, I can't take everything.

157
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,280
Please.

158
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,360
- You're fearsome.
- I know.

159
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
All right.

160
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,040
- In memory of the Belgian Congo.
- Thank you, young man.

161
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,560
You are a gentleman.

162
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,320
<i>This man is your soul mate.</i>

163
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
"Soul mate" is a bit much.

164
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,440
Those are your words.

165
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,880
During our last session, you said,

166
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,880
"Assane is made for me,
whether I like it or not."

167
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,600
"He's my soul mate."

168
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
So,

169
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,360
you believe in soul mates?

170
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,840
<i>Let's just say that</i>

171
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,400
<i>when he holds me really tight in his arms,</i>

172
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,720
yes, I believe in it, but…

173
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,080
when I've made dinner,
and he's three hours late,

174
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,480
it's more complicated.

175
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,120
<i>I keep thinking it'll get better,</i>

176
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,760
<i>and then there are moments</i>

177
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,440
when we're good. We talk about the future,

178
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,760
and all of a sudden,

179
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,520
it's like he can't help
ruining everything.

180
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,880
The vicious circle?

181
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,240
<i>I actually don't know
if I'm in love with him.</i>

182
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,440
<i>It's been so long.</i>

183
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,560
We have fun,
we've been through everything together.

184
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,080
<i>He's my best friend, but…</i>

185
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,040
I don't think he's the one.

186
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,600
You don't owe him anything.
You're not married. No children.

187
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,560
<i>I'll talk to him tonight.</i>

188
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
And that way, we…

189
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,280
- Well, we'll see.
- You'll see what?

190
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,200
Whether he cares about me.

191
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
That prick!

192
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,160
- You didn't see him?
- No.

193
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,360
- He got away through the roof.
- Shit.

194
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,160
- He got away. You didn't see him?
- No.

195
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,400
We don't get paid enough
to risk our lives.

196
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,040
He dropped this.

197
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,160
- Here.
- Really!

198
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,920
- Not bad.
- Good jackpot.

199
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,640
I'm taking this to the station
as evidence.

200
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,280
- I'll handle the paperwork.
- Thank you.

201
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,120
- Thanks.
- It's only fair.

202
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,000
- Have a nice day.
- Goodbye.

203
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,360
They're fast at that age.
They scurry around. They're agile.

204
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,760
- Yeah.
- OK, thanks!

205
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,320
- Goodbye.
- Thanks.

206
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,720
Can I see you tonight?

207
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,320
I need to talk to you.

208
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,880
What? I'm using my serious voice? No.

209
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,160
It's my normal voice.

210
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,960
Serious, yes.

211
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,960
Can we have dinner together?

212
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,920
OK for 7 p.m.
Pick a quiet place, Assane.

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,520
Nothing over the top, OK?

214
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,720
OK. See you tonight.

215
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,760
- Which number, Assane?
- 85.

216
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,280
- 84, 85 and 86.
- 85…

217
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,280
- 86…
- Here!

218
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,080
- There.
- Great.

219
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,600
Le Havre isn't exactly exciting.

220
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,760
We're not going there.

221
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,760
Really? Then where?

222
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,160
Under the Fréfossé fortress.

223
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,760
"Downstream from Étrerat,
the maidens' room."

224
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,760
"Under the Fréfossé fortress,
the hollow needle."

225
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,040
Exactly.

226
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,720
We're off to Étretat, darling.

227
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,880
- A celebration for Lupin.
- There.

228
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,280
That's why I love you. You see?

229
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,960
I've known this person for 25 years.

230
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,960
Of course
he asked me to read <i>The Hollow Needle</i>.

231
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,280
- So I remember some of it.
- Some of it?

232
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,320
- Some of it.
- Hang on.

233
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,360
"Two feet on the letters in stone."

234
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,080
"Measure 19 fathoms."

235
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,800
"Turn the cross."

236
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,720
"Climb onto the 44th step."

237
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,760
"Then, on the 357th…"

238
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,440
"You will find Arsène Lupin's treasure."

239
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,400
You two are actually totally nuts.

240
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,040
Yeah, nuts, but connected.

241
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,840
- This place isn't bad.
- What do you think?

242
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,840
I don't take you just anywhere.

243
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,240
I naively thought
you were scouting the location.

244
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,440
I already told you.

245
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,720
- The more money there is…
- The bigger the suckers are. I know.

246
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,560
I found the perfect place for my shop.

247
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,280
In the flea market. A large ground floor

248
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,040
for normal clients,

249
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,640
and a basement for clients

250
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
who aren't.

251
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,680
- Closest police station?
- Not close.

252
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
That's perfect.

253
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,240
- I think so.
- We're good.

254
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,040
First sale for the shop.

255
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,680
- Is this a Fabergé?
- Yes, why?

256
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,120
We're taking off.

257
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,640
I understand why we're here.

258
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,440
- Of course not.
- Yeah.

259
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,240
I'll be back.

260
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,880
Stop following me.

261
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,640
Are you kidding or something?

262
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,200
You're following me.
What are you doing here?

263
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,160
Very handsome.

264
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
I'm taken.

265
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Do you mind?

266
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,640
That's new.

267
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,680
- It's a mistake.
- It's annoying how you doubt yourself.

268
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,600
- I don't.
- No. That's the problem.

269
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
It's a problem?

270
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,960
Then it's a big problem.

271
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,360
- Can't do this to Claire anymore.
- Claire?

272
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,200
Even her name sounds boring.
I can only imagine the rest.

273
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,200
I'm a good guy.

274
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,240
No, not at all.

275
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,240
You're not a good guy at all.
That's what I like.

276
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,680
I see.

277
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,000
I won't wait for you my whole life.

278
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,360
You can stop waiting.

279
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,520
- I love Claire.
- And I love you.

280
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,160
So, what do we do?

281
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,200
I won't let you go.

282
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
I'm sorry.

283
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,360
I'm happy to get away with you two.

284
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
It's cool.

285
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Is it the doctor?

286
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,520
His name is Marc.

287
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,640
None of your business.

288
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,840
Have you seen Marc again? Since last time?

289
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,920
None of your business.

290
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,760
- She hasn't seen him again.
- Hey!

291
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,200
- Should we take a picture?
- Go on.

292
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
OK.

293
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
There.

294
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Hang on. Show me.

295
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,520
Wait.

296
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,920
- Let's see.
- Stop it!

297
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,240
- We want to see.
- Yes!

298
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
It's cute, right?

299
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,280
He really likes himself.

300
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Incredible.

301
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,280
I'm pretty good-looking.
You're not too bad either.

302
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
Where are we at?

303
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,680
<i>I'm riding the train with him.</i>

304
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,720
- Did he see you?
- No, I don't think so.

305
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,360
But he's with his wife and his kid.

306
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,680
Leave them alone.

307
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,720
But get rid of him for good.

308
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,320
- <i>Don't let me down</i>.
- Yes, sir.

309
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,320
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

310
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,760
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

311
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,480
<i>Happy birthday to you, Raoul!</i>

312
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,960
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

313
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
Bravo!

314
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Thank you!

315
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Stop it!

316
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Bravo.

317
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Worth celebrating.

318
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,520
For real.

319
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,520
This is nice! You recognize him?

320
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,720
- For you.
- OK, it's nice.

321
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Help yourself.

322
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,320
- Marble cake, my favorite.
- Nothing to drink. Hang on.

323
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,360
- I'll take care of it.
- Forget it.

324
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,560
I'll be right back.

325
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,000
Hello. Your ticket, please.

326
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,840
- Thank you. Hello.
- Hello.

327
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,000
Your ticket, please. Thank you.

328
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,680
When are we arriving?

329
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,680
- In 20 minutes.
- Thank you.

330
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,600
Hello. Your ticket, please.

331
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
Thank you.

332
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,520
Fucking shit!

333
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
Where's Dad?

334
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
He's coming.

335
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,480
Couldn't find anything to drink.

336
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,120
- But champagne's on me.
- Where were you?

337
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,000
- I got in a fight.
- Huh?

338
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,120
I ran into a guy who told me

339
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,480
<i>The Mysterious Traveler</i> is
the best Lupin book.

340
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,560
- Well, it's good.
- But it's not the best.

341
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,120
I explained this to him.
I told him nicely.

342
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,480
The guy got worked up.
Took it the wrong way.

343
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,640
Nonsense.

344
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,200
I agree. It's nonsense.

345
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
And the guy…

346
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
Well…

347
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,480
It's all sorted out.
We got into a scuffle. Nothing serious.

348
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,680
A little exercise.

349
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
It's OK.

350
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
I hate you.

351
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,040
You don't like it?

352
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,000
It just opened. It's <i>the</i> restaurant.

353
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,000
Who cares? That's not the issue.

354
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,680
I said, "Nothing over the top."
It's so fancy.

355
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,320
So what?

356
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
So what?

357
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
Thank you.

358
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,280
Thank you.

359
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,800
I wanted a quiet place
to tell you what I need to tell you.

360
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,880
- This is quiet.
- Château Carbonnieux?

361
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
No, thank you.

362
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
Sir?

363
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,880
Real quiet.

364
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,680
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

365
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
I'm sorry.

366
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
We can leave.

367
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,920
- The check, please!
- No!

368
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,800
Well then, tell me.

369
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
What?

370
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,200
You don't look well.
That thing looks serious, so tell me.

371
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
I'm pregnant.

372
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
What did you say?

373
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,400
I'm pregnant.

374
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
With a baby?

375
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,040
- Well, yes!
- With my baby?

376
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,040
I'm going to be a dad?

377
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,800
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yes.

378
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,560
You know that's a good thing?

379
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,880
- I don't know.
- It is!

380
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,880
You're having doubts.
That explains the face.

381
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
I'm going to be a dad!

382
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,400
- Stop it!
- I'm going to be a dad!

383
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,560
She'll be the best mother in the world!

384
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Stop it.

385
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,840
I'm going to be a dad!

386
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,080
This place isn't quiet. Let's bounce.

387
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Here we go!

388
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
Thank you!

389
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,640
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we're arriving</i>

390
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,080
<i>into Le Havre station.</i>

391
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,480
<i>Please take all your belongings.</i>

392
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,120
<i>We wish you a pleasant day.</i>

393
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
Hello.

394
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,720
You're going to Étretat?

395
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,960
- Are you a fan of Lupin?
- A great fan.

396
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,880
- You?
- Love it. My father introduced me to him.

397
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,680
Your father has great taste.

398
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,880
- Do you know each other?
- No.

399
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,640
A little.

400
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
Text, boss.

401
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Is it my wife?

402
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,680
No. Unknown number.

403
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
What's it say?

404
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,480
Let's see. "Hey, it's Paul Sernine."

405
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,600
"My train's pulling into Le Havre."

406
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,640
"Fancy a coffee? Beige raincoat."

407
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,600
A whack-job who got my number.

408
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,760
"Thanks for the pen at the Louvre."

409
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,960
Call Le Havre now!

410
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,880
OK, Raoul. Let's go.

411
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,320
Thank you.

412
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
I'll catch up.

413
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,200
- See you later?
- Later.

414
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,640
You're going to get up,
and we're going to get off nice and quiet.

415
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,200
Don't you try to get smart with me.

416
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,960
- You know <i>The Mysterious Traveler</i>?
- Freeze!

417
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,920
Don't move! Put your hands up!

418
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,280
I said put your hands up!

419
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,800
- Take your hands out!
- Beige raincoat, it's him.

420
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,520
- Now you know it.
- Take your hands out. Your hands!

421
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
On the ground.

422
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,120
- On the ground.
- Easy.

423
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Easy.

424
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,840
- There.
- Easy.

425
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,680
What's this?

426
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,280
What's in your pockets?

427
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,760
What's this?

428
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,480
I don't remember. How does Lupin end up?

429
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,600
Nobody knows. He never got caught.

430
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,480
That proves it's fiction.
In real life, he would get caught.

431
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,880
Unless he knew when to quit.

432
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,920
So?

433
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,200
Well, it'd look ridiculous anywhere else,
but it's pretty classy.

434
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,280
Agreed.

435
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,960
- I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

436
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,920
- To see the hollow needle.
- Don't wander off.

437
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
When are you due?

438
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,680
I think it's December 11th.

439
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,200
No.

440
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,320
Yes. Is that a problem?

441
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,840
- What?
- December 11th!

442
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,240
Claire!

443
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
It's Maurice Leblanc's birthday!

444
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,000
- OK, so what?
- It's a sign!

445
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,600
Don't tell me.
You want to name him Maurice?

446
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,680
Why not?

447
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,360
Not Maurice.

448
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,080
No, not Maurice. Assane Junior.

449
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,360
- Assane Junior?
- Yeah.

450
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,200
- Are you crazy?
- I know.

451
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,280
Arsène.

452
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,880
No, not Arsène.

453
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,720
I don't know his name,

454
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,800
but I'll love him.

455
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,400
I'll protect him with all my strength.

456
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,960
So, no more screwing up?

457
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,720
No more screwing up.

458
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
Promise.

459
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
I know.

460
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,480
- Raoul.
- Raoul?

461
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,240
- Yeah!
- No, not Raoul!

462
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,040
- Raoul, yes.
- No!

463
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,280
- Raoul.
- No!

464
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,240
Tell me, Assane.

465
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,440
Who was that guy?

466
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,560
What was the problem?

467
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,040
I know something was going on.

468
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,080
Don't take me for an idiot.

469
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Assane!

470
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
Answer me!

471
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,600
I need to settle something.

472
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,480
Something important for me. And for Raoul.

473
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,920
It's about my father.

474
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,920
Whom you haven't talked about in 25 years?

475
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,456
Whom I know nothing about?
What's that got to do with anything?

476
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,280
I need to see it through.
Then I'll tell you everything.

477
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,640
I'll stop that crap.

478
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,080
I've said this before.

479
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,600
- A hundred times.
- Yeah.

480
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,640
You have no reason to believe me.

481
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,280
- But it's true.
- It's true.

482
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,640
I know this time it's true, as usual.

483
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,240
You've said that too.

484
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,520
But I need more, Assane.
This isn't enough.

485
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,640
You won't even answer me.

486
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,360
Who cares? That's not what matters.

487
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,680
What matters is you and Raoul.

488
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
Give me a chance.

489
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
One last chance.

490
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,840
Wait, where's Raoul?

491
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,640
I don't see him.

492
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,760
Raoul?

493
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,920
This isn't our guy at all.

494
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,320
He had a gemstone from the necklace.
We'll bring him back from Le Havre.

495
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,720
- Where to?
- To get Sernine in Le Havre.

496
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,040
They let the guy go. It wasn't him.

497
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,240
- He had the gemstone.
- He was armed.

498
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,800
He has a gun license
and an alibi for the burglary.

499
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,880
So, the gemstone…

500
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,160
- Someone stuffed it in his pocket.
- But wait!

501
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,520
Wait for what?

502
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,520
Two more weeks on another false lead?

503
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,880
The guy was framed. Figure out who did it.

504
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,240
Go through the passenger list,

505
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,440
recover the surveillance footage.

506
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,520
Basically, do your job.
I'm not gonna do it for you.

507
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,440
What is this crap?
We can't question the guy?

508
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,840
- This is bullshit!
- What do you want me to say?

509
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,720
Get me the list of passengers.

510
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,480
There could be hundreds.
It's going to take ages.

511
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,800
A job for Guédira. Where is he?

512
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Raoul!

513
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Raoul!

514
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
Raoul!

515
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,040
<i>This is Raoul. Leave a message.</i>

516
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,200
Have you seen a 14-year-old?
Light brown skin, wearing a top hat?

517
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,640
There are boys wearing hats all over.

518
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,640
Light brown skin, with big hair?

519
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Let me go!

520
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Lupin?

521
00:40:43,305 --> 00:41:43,180

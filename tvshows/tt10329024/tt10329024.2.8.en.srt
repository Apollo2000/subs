- Your husband is coming to America.
- What?

3
00:00:06,343 --> 00:00:07,601
That's a nice dress.

4
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:09,076
Tayo will like it.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,484
It's not for him.

6
00:00:10,569 --> 00:00:13,140
I just grabbed any old thing
from the closet.

7
00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:16,607
Well, your old thing has
a tag from Nordstrom's.

8
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,468
I did not want him
to come here.

9
00:00:19,588 --> 00:00:21,796
Ah, a father
must see his son.

10
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:24,582
Would you rather they eat
at the Home of the Whopper?

11
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,226
E kaabo, Dad.

12
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:28,519
Look at you.
[chuckles]

13
00:00:28,644 --> 00:00:30,211
You are a man now.

14
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:33,668
Abishola,
you look beautiful.

15
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:36,317
This dress is old.
I look the same.

16
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:39,785
Whatever your side of the
story is, you've been gone

17
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,281
for eight years.

18
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:43,105
She's with me now.

19
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,441
She's moved on.

20
00:00:44,526 --> 00:00:46,923
I will be taking her back
to Nigeria.

21
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:49,722
It is time for you
to move on.

22
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:56,073
This chin chin
is terrible today.

23
00:00:56,187 --> 00:00:58,324
And yet you eat them as if
they are going to run away.

24
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:01,901
Ah. Terrible chin chin
is still chin chin.

25
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:05,260
I see you are enjoying
my daughter's cooking, Uncle.

26
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:09,737
Oh, yes, like they were made
with God's fingers.

27
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:12,924
Great service,
Pastor.

28
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:15,316
You really gave Satan
a run for his money.

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,565
Thank you, Bob.

30
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,100
Yeah, the way you jump around,

31
00:01:18,185 --> 00:01:19,644
sweating, screaming at people.

32
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:22,323
It's like
if Jesus taught a spin class.

33
00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:25,945
I accept your
blasphemous compliment.

34
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:29,660
Uh, listen, uh, can I
talk to you for a second?

35
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:31,359
Of course.

36
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:34,612
I don't know if you know, but
Abishola and I are engaged.

37
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:36,909
Yes, I am aware of this.

38
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:40,631
Well, technically she's still
married to Tayo Adebambo.

39
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:43,151
And I am also aware of this.

40
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,626
[chuckles] Well, I guess you
only work one day a week,

41
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:47,479
you got plenty of
time for gossip.

42
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:51,042
That was a joke.
It's-it's a bad joke.

43
00:01:51,497 --> 00:01:53,502
- Listen, you're from Nigeria.
- Mm-hmm.

44
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:55,711
Do you think you could pull
any strings over there

45
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:59,588
or over here or,
you know, up there?

46
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:04,700
Bob, Colossians, chapter
three, verse 18 says,

47
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:08,764
"Wives, submit to your
husbands, as is fitting in the Lord."

48
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:11,741
I appreciate your support,
but you've met Abishola.

49
00:02:11,826 --> 00:02:13,639
She's not exactly
the submitting type.

50
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:16,577
I'm sorry, Bob.
I don't think you understand.

51
00:02:16,662 --> 00:02:20,561
Abishola belongs
with Tayo, her husband.

52
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:23,569
Yeah, but what do you know?

53
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:26,139
I'm sorry I
took so long.

54
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:29,200
What is going on?

55
00:02:29,308 --> 00:02:30,303
Apparently

56
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:32,108
your pastor here
is Team Tayo.

57
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:36,483
I am Team God, but, yes,
God is Team Tayo. [laughs]

58
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:38,741
I have spoken
to your husband,

59
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,866
and he does not wish
to divorce you.

60
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:42,129
You spoke to Tayo?

61
00:02:42,214 --> 00:02:43,653
He came to me
for counsel.

62
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:45,647
When? 'Cause I tried
to call you Thursday,

63
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,889
and I got sent
to a stupid prayer line.

64
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:53,061
Tayo believes that you can
get past this misunderstanding.

65
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:55,760
Misunderstanding?
He abandoned her.

66
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:58,416
Bob.No. I guess when
you sent him out for groceries,

67
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,951
he thought you said, "Go back
to Nigeria and take a second wife."

68
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:02,648
It's your classic mix-up.

69
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:04,248
Bob, please.

70
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,188
Thank you for taking
the time to speak to us.

71
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:07,756
We will see you
next Sunday.

72
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,256
Yes, of course,
Pastor. Goodbye.

73
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:14,816
You're just gonna let
him off the hook like that?

74
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:16,185
Oh, he's not off the hook.

75
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,538
He will no longer be
in my nightly prayers.

76
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:20,483
Oh, you are vicious.

Can we go ten minutes
without bringing him up?

I'd love to go my whole life

out how to get rid of him.

Uh, so the account's under
a Mr. Adebambo. "Tay-o"?

00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:19,755
"Tie-o"?
Am I saying that right?

95

You're saying it enough.

96

You're still on
his phone plan?

97

Oh. Okay.

157
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,741
- Please proceed.
- CHRISTINA: As you know,

158
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:51,874
Abishola's husband is
causing some issues.

159
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,090
The dude can't take a hint.

160
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:55,130
She's the best thing
that ever happened to Bob,

161
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,543
to us,
and-and we can't lose her.

162
00:06:57,628 --> 00:06:59,067
From what I understand,

163
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,201
her husband will never
grant her a divorce.

164
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:04,864
- Exactly.
- So what are we gonna do about it?

165
00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:08,099
- We?
- You guys are Nigerian.

166
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:10,957
You know how this stuff works.
What can we do?

167
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,849
- Legally?
- DOUGLAS: Or...

168
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:15,706
illegally.

169
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:18,520
Put your vest on.

170
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:20,629
Take it easy.
We're just

171
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:22,910
trying to help out
Bob and Abishola.

172
00:07:22,995 --> 00:07:25,479
I think my solution
still has some merit.

173
00:07:25,564 --> 00:07:27,613
Knock it off with
that cockamamie idea.

174
00:07:27,777 --> 00:07:29,780
Maybe we should let
the Nigerians decide

175
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:31,175
what's cockamamie.

176
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:32,338
Fine.

177
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:39,030
Goodwin, Kofo,
as you know,

178
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:41,514
Nigerians are a noble,

179
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,161
honorable people
with high moral standards.

180
00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:48,154
We'd like
to exploit that.

181
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:52,700
Operation Secret Stork
is a two-part process.

182
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:55,574
Abishola pretends to be pregnant
with Bob's child.

183
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,748
We get a phony pee stick,

184
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,465
counterfeit sonograms,
the works.

185
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:04,099
And Tayo, so disgusted
by his wife's sins of the flesh,

186
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,968
demands a divorce.

187
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,966
Thoughts?

188
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:13,130
Kofo?

189
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:15,435
No,
you go right ahead.

190
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:19,157
So, you would destroy
this woman's reputation

191
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:21,997
and standing
within her family and community?

192
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,790
Yes.

193
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:28,919
But she'd have us.

194
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:29,865
Kofo?

195
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,154
I-I think what Goodwin
is trying to say is,

196
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,733
while your heart is
in the right place,

197
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,431
your actions are
beyond reprehensible.

198
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,193
See? Cockamamie!

199
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,036
Okay, but if we took out

200
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:42,518
the morality,
put it in a box,

201
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:45,279
buried that box
in a little shame hole,

202
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:46,728
would the plan work?

203
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:47,911
I suppose in theory

204
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:49,601
- it could, but...
- Thank you!

205
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:51,849
But her family may never
speak to her again.

206
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:54,588
Well, that will be okay,
because she's our family now!

207
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:00,513
When my son
sat me down,

208
00:09:00,598 --> 00:09:03,778
I thought he was gonna tell
me he was gay or Republican.

209
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:05,877
Which one is he?

210
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,919
Neither. He's in love.

211
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:08,951
With a man?

212
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:10,056
No, with a woman.

213
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,216
Ugh. Boring.

214
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,540
Tell your son not
to rush into marriage.

215
00:09:15,624 --> 00:09:18,151
He will end up disappointed,
feeling foolish,

216
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:19,544
and most likely alone.

217
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:22,634
Who tinkled on your toast?

218
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,935
Tayo. He left a trail
of tinkle all around Detroit.

219
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,728
It was stupid of me
to think this could work.

220
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:31,860
Why'd I say yes?

221
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:33,271
Why did I give
Bob hope?

222
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:34,669
[laughs]

223
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,911
Sorry, you said "Bob Hope."

224
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:39,208
Yes. She has given
Bob hope.

225
00:09:39,387 --> 00:09:41,138
And soon Bob's hope
will be dead.

226
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:43,810
[laughs]:
He already is. Get it?

227
00:09:45,262 --> 00:09:46,911
Never mind,
never mind.

228
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:49,115
Bob does not
understand.

229
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,291
No matter
what we do,

230
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:52,247
Tayo is not going
to change his mind.

231
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:53,302
Of course he's not.

232
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:55,261
He's that stubborn?
Is he a Taurus?

233
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:56,865
He's Nigerian.

234
00:09:57,825 --> 00:09:59,320
And a Taurus.

235
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:02,565
Nigerians can be
very headstrong.

236
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:04,161
And vindictive.

237
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:06,329
I had a friend
whose cousin stole

238
00:10:06,414 --> 00:10:09,435
her recipes and opened
a successful catering business.

239
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,458
My friend then sent her cousin
a tainted box of cilantro,

240
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:15,068
which gave all of her clients
violent dysentery.

241
00:10:15,435 --> 00:10:16,557
Damn.

242
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:20,253
Wait, doesn't your cousin
have a catering business?

243
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:23,265
Not anymore.

244
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:32,669
Bob.

245
00:10:32,794 --> 00:10:34,865
Kaale, Tayo.
I'd like to introduce you

246
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,708
to my attorney
Arnie Goldfischer.

247
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,255
Pleasure.

248
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:40,842
What's going on?

249
00:10:40,926 --> 00:10:42,670
I tried playing this
the Nigerian way,

250
00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:44,484
but now we're gonna play it
the American way.

251
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:47,066
Whoever has
the most expensive lawyer wins.

252
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,318
And I'm very expensive.

253
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:57,388
How did you know
I would be here?

254
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:58,818
Took a wild guess.

255
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:01,605
We also came yesterday...
You never showed up.

256
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:04,336
Oh, I love this soup.
It's very spicy.

257
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:07,688
Cleared me right out,
but in a good way.

258
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:08,773
Do you mind?

259
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:10,978
Sorry. Um...

260
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:12,502
[clears throat]
Listen...

261
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:14,170
Mr. Adebambo,

262
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,325
my client is ready to go
to great lengths

263
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,349
to acquire the legal
documentation from Nigeria

264
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:20,569
to render your marriage

265
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:24,716
to Mrs. Abishola Adebambo
null and void.

266
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:26,336
We're not messing
around, Tayo.

267
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,773
We're willing to do
whatever it takes.

268
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:31,242
[scoffs softly]
I see. Well,

269
00:11:31,327 --> 00:11:34,203
perhaps you will be needing
to speak with mylawyer

270
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,610
Kitoye Afolabe.

271
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:37,812
[clearing throat loudly]

272
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:38,929
Spicy?

273
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:40,845
No, he's a good lawyer.

274
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:43,964
You know him? He's presented at
international court.

275
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:45,664
Everyone knows Afolabe.

276
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:49,531
Perhaps this will not be
as easy as you thought.

277
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:52,508
Okay, okay,
so we both have bigwig lawyers.

278
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,211
No, his is bigger. Literally.

279
00:11:54,302 --> 00:11:56,398
You know, they wear
those powdered wigs.

280
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,989
I think it's left over
from the English?

281
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:01,117
Yes.
It is.

282
00:12:02,163 --> 00:12:04,172
Maybe you should try
dipping your fufu in there.

283
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,906
All right, listen!

284
00:12:06,587 --> 00:12:08,726
Nobody wants us
to spend a bunch of money

285
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:09,976
tying this up in court.

286
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:11,711
[coughing]

287
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:15,390
That time it was spicy.

288
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:19,991
The point is,
maybe we can try something else.

289
00:12:20,612 --> 00:12:22,835
How much would it take
for you to just let her go?

290
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:24,429
[chuckles]

291
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:27,675
So you are trying to bribe me
into leaving my wife?

292
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,418
What's the big deal?
First time you did it for free.

293
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,269
Let me ask you
something, Bob.

294
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:36,447
How much would it cost for you
to leave Abishola?

295
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,628
You don't have
that kind of money, pal.

296
00:12:38,712 --> 00:12:39,617
Ah...

297
00:12:39,702 --> 00:12:41,620
so you do have a number.

298
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:43,275
Because I do not.

299
00:12:43,742 --> 00:12:45,867
No, I-I don't have
a number either.

300
00:12:45,952 --> 00:12:47,739
But you see a Black man
and assume that

301
00:12:47,824 --> 00:12:50,047
- you can just buy him off.
- Okay.

302
00:12:50,132 --> 00:12:51,767
Hold on, this isn't
a race thing.

303
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:54,075
If you were white, I'd still be
trying to buy you off.

304
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,515
I'll buy off the lawyer,
the judge, whatever it takes.

305
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,242
What?!

306
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,915
Okay, evidently I should not
have said any of that.

307
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:08,413
This isn't over.
Not by a long shot.

308
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,086
We'll go to
international court.

309
00:13:10,304 --> 00:13:12,005
Do you know any
Nigerian lawyers?

310
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,877
No.Well, we'll find one.

311
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:15,773
And if we have to go
there, we'll go there.

312
00:13:15,857 --> 00:13:17,038
We'll make a trip
out of it.

313
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:18,800
We'll have to find
different accommodations.

314
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:21,150
My family will not allow us
in their homes.

315
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:23,457
Really? Really,
but I do not care.

316
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:25,843
I do not need my family
or my church's blessings.

317
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:28,236
We're going to fight this even
if it takes years and years.

318
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,756
Damn right.

319
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,140
Or... we could
just be happy.

320
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:40,538
What?

321
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:43,569
You're here with me,
and I'm here with you.

322
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:45,746
What are we fighting for?
We already won.

323
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,319
[sighs]

324
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:49,179
But this is important
to you.

325
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:53,366
It is, but it's not
what's most important.

326
00:13:57,744 --> 00:13:59,616
It was going to be
a nice wedding.

327
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:02,780
Yeah. You would have
made a lovely bride.

328
00:14:02,865 --> 00:14:05,305
And we know I can wear
the hell out of a tux.

329
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,374
Yes, you can.

330
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,421
Uncle Tunde and Dele were
going to walk me down the aisle.

331
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:12,593
I like that.
That's sweet.

332
00:14:12,678 --> 00:14:17,599
Mm. And there were going
to be so many flowers.

333
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:19,615
- Calla lilies?
- You remembered.

334
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,944
See? I listen sometimes.

335
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:23,913
We'd seal the deal
with a buffet

336
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:26,561
so people could stuff
themself on fufu.

337
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:28,343
- No buffet.
- Really?

338
00:14:28,428 --> 00:14:29,397
Uh-uh.

339
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:31,366
This is a wedding,
not a Sizzler.

340
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,796
[chuckles]

341
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:34,960
Sit-down, served dinner.

342
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:36,546
Deal.

343
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:39,396
Well, we may not
have a wedding,

344
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,936
but I found our song.

345
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:45,105
I am not dancing
to your Bob Seger.

346
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:47,327
I understand why
you'd say that,

347
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:49,547
but it's something else.

348
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:51,983
<i>"Love Don't Care"
by Simi playing...</i>

349

<i>♪ Love don't care
who you be... ♪</i>

350
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:02,846
I like this,
but this would not have been

351
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,530
- my first choice.
- No?

352
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:06,446
You wanted that
Bob Seger, huh?

353
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,593
<i>♪ Love don't care who you know</i>

356
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:28,566
Are you sure I need
to come every week?

357
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:30,351
It is important for us
to show we have

358
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:31,367
nothing to be
ashamed of.

359
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:32,968
I mean, I got plenty
to be ashamed of.

360
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:35,796
You know I used to smoke cigars
and wear a little porkpie hat?

361
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:38,848
- It's a joke.
- When I'm anxious, I make jokes.

362
00:15:39,003 --> 00:15:41,538
I cannot believe I agreed
to not marry you.

How long is he
gonna be here?

366
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:51,686
Too long.
Dele, come.

We're going to
get our seats.

368
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:54,905
What was he saying?

369
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,577
- I don't know. I was pretending
to understand. - [chuckles]

370
00:15:57,662 --> 00:16:00,179
I'm about to do a lot
of that right in here.

371
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,421
E karo, Uncle Tunde,
Auntie Olu.

372
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,405
So good to see you
on this fine morning.

373
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,569
I see that you are
still here. [scoffs]

374
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:09,833
Where else
would I be?

375
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:12,140
In Nigeria, with
your second family.

376
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:14,448
I'm sure
they miss you.[chuckles]

377
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,405
Yes, well, I have family
here, too.

378
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,626
Really? Oh, I would
love to meet them.

379
00:16:21,587 --> 00:16:23,280
Is there something wrong?

380
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:24,823
Nothing is wrong.

381
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:26,863
Tunde, remind me,

382
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:28,741
where was he
eight years ago?

383
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:30,564
Not here.

384
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:32,627
What about two years ago?

385
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:34,368
Still not here.

386
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,757
But this year,
Abishola found Bob,

387
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:39,416
a man she loves.

388
00:16:39,544 --> 00:16:42,286
And poof!
Here he is.

389
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,213
You are like a child
who has discarded a toy

390
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,216
and then begins
whining for it

391
00:16:48,301 --> 00:16:50,189
when another child
shows interest.

392
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:54,478
Like a baby-baby, who has
stuck his head in gravy.

393
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,682
I appreciate your guidance,

394
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,900
but Abishola and I
have a son together.

395
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,658
And what sort of an example
are you setting for him?

396
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:05,444
I am showing him he should
go after what he wants.

397
00:17:05,617 --> 00:17:08,014
Even if what he wants
does not want him?

398
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:10,205
You are making me seem
desperate.

399
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,119
Youare making you
seem desperate.

400
00:17:14,456 --> 00:17:16,245
Well, there are plenty
of women who would love

401
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,197
to be with a successful
man like me.

402
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:19,610
Then maybe
you should go wait

403
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:21,593
for them
at their church.

404
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,680
Oh, my wonderful wife,

405
00:17:24,765 --> 00:17:26,883
you have castrated
him with your words.

406
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:28,274
Snip, snip.

407
00:17:30,587 --> 00:17:33,724
I just do not understand
what made him send this text.

408
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:35,549
Let me see it.

409
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:38,360
"You've changed...

410
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:41,805
"Many women want me...

411
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:44,779
I can do a hundred push-ups."

412
00:17:44,953 --> 00:17:46,384
Is that a text from Tayo?

413
00:17:46,469 --> 00:17:49,118
Yes. I believe he no longer
wants to be married to me.

414
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:50,088
Ah.

415
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:52,133
So he just suddenly
changed his mind?

416
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:54,735
What an unexpected
turn of events.

417
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:58,749
It is very odd. Nigerians
do not change their minds.

418
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,056
I'll bet you I scared him
off with Goldfischer.

419
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:03,485
- It was not a goldfish.
- Uh-uh.

420
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:06,078
God must have heard
your prayers.

421
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:10,239
And sent an angel
to whisper in Tayo's ear.

422
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:13,055
So we're actually
doing this.

423
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:15,611
You're gonna be
Mrs. Abishola Wheeler.

424
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:18,259
Mm. Or you could
take my family name

425
00:18:18,344 --> 00:18:20,289
and be Bob Odegbami.

426
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:21,750
Ode-bami?

427
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:23,157
Odegbami.

428
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,275
Ode-bami.

429
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:28,071
Odegbami.

430
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,547
All right, if I can't
say it, we can't do it.

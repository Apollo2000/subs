1
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,398
My name is Max William Easton.

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,699
I'm a British
intelligence officer.

3
00:00:06,739 --> 00:00:09,369
You said it's done.
That whatever shady bullshit

4
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,638
you were involved in
in London is over.

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,773
Then you come running in
with a screwdriver

6
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,177
and you lock your children
in the bathroom!

7
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:17,857
Cooper and Toumi
have popped up in Beirut.

8
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,747
We need you to go in
and clean up the mess.

9
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,815
Find them. Deal with them.

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,018
Find Said.
Deal with him as well.

11
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:27,288
Ali Ardavan. Major financier of
the nuclear weapons program.

12
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:28,630
Our next target.

13
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,594
I found the source
of the breach.

14
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,464
Burnett Hanson.
Ardavan was a client there.

15
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,000
Harry is using Burnett Hanson
as a misdirect.

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,002
Burnett Hanson
is not the breach.

17
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,704
Harry is.

18
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:47,475
- How long have you been passing intelligence to Tehran?
- What, are you joking?

19
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:51,277
Where's Said?
Why did he kill Harry?

20
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,280
Said didn't kill Harry.

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,982
Harry's here. In Beirut.

22
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,650
Said, please!

23
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,688
We're giving you the
opportunity to make this right.

24
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,597
Isn't that what you'd want?

25
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,959
Why all of them?
Why not just Said?

26
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,361
It's what Langley wants.

27
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,173
Give me your hand.

28
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,516
Give me your fucking hand.

29
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,778
Slumped.

30
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:27,287
Two in the head.

31
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,584
Now get out of the car.

32
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,855
You're gonna disappear...
for good.

33
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,131
Anyone finds out you're alive,
we're both dead.

34
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,861
I was doing my job and now there's
a fucking kill order on me!

35
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,811
What did White tell you?
That I was the breach?

36
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:54,641
- And you believe that?
- You're alive, aren't you?

37
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,978
What are they covering up,
Said? You don't know, do you?

38
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,748
Find your way across the border
to Ashgabat. Lose yourself.

39
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,417
And you're just fine with this?

40
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,953
Don't make me regret
not killing you, Harry.

41
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,605
Said? Thank you.

42
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,853
Yes?

43
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,457
We've had
a complication in Tehran.

44
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:17,690
Care to expand?

45
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,602
One of our team has done
some digging on Ardavan.

46
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,339
He's followed the trail...

47
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,903
to Burnett Hanson.

48
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,606
- What?
- I've dealt with it.

49
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,208
Dealt with it, how?

50
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:35,942
He's down.

51
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,451
"He"?

52
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,247
Weren't there five of them
out there?

53
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,982
- Yes.
- How do you know they haven't talked to each other?

54
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,986
How do you know he hasn't
shared what he found out?

55
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,796
Are you willing
to take that risk, George...

56
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,432
stake your life on it?

57
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,471
No, I didn't think so.

58
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,540
They have to go.

59
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:02,242
All of them.

60
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,040
Do you have someone
who can clean up

61
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,674
or do you want me
to send one of mine?

62
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,344
No, no. I have someone.

63
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,420
- He's...
- I don't need to know.

64
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:17,190
Just make sure he's reliable
and you can control him.

65
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:58,732
You may find yourself
in another part of the world...

66
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,803
living in a beautiful house...

67
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,640
with a beautiful wife...

68
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,369
and you may ask yourself.

69
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:12,746
"How do I work this?"

70
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,451
"This is not
my beautiful house."

71
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,022
"This is not my beautiful wife."

72
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,829
You may ask yourself.

73
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:32,500
"Well..."

74
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:39,473
"how did I get here?"

75
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,683
Where's Harry? Is he alive?

76
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,854
Cooper!

77
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,153
Aargh!

78
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,337
My name is Max William Easton.

79
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,308
I'm a British
Intelligence officer.

80
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,369
My last ass...

81
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,722
- Max?
- Anna?

82
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,593
- It's not a good time now.
- I just wanted to hear your voice.

83
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,891
- How's your cold?
- What?

84
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,593
You said you were
coming down with a cold.

85
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,564
Erm... yeah,
it's... it's... it's fine.

86
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,165
I'm fine.

87
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,241
Well, you don't sound it.

88
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,571
- How's Beirut?
- Same as ever.

89
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,607
You've been there before?

90
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,383
Couple of times.

91
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,420
It's neutral ground
for old clients.

92
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,327
So did you find it... the money?

93
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,397
- Are you coming home?
- Soon. I promise.

94
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,635
Anna, what's up?

95
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,338
Nothing.

96
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,268
I have to go.
Lola just came down.

97
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,810
Can you put her on?

98
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,919
Lola?

99
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,615
She went to the bathroom.

100
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,850
I really have to go.

101
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,693
Okay.

102
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,531
I love you.

103
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:15,749
My last assignment was the
assassination of Dr. Marcus Reynolds...

104
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,584
the British government
scientist.

105
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:36,869
Four dead
Iranian nuclear scientists

106
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,371
in the last two weeks.

107
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,207
- Are you gonna tell me this was the Israelis?
- No, sir.

108
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,778
Since Stuxnet, we're more careful which
operations we share with them. This was us.

109
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,379
Sounds like mission creep.

110
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,550
Our brief was to contain Iran's
nuclear weapons program...

111
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,586
Your brief was to identify
and report back.

112
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,555
The administration's
current approach

113
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,591
is to safeguard
diplomatic stability with Iran.

114
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,259
Perhaps you'd like
to enlighten me

115
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,495
as to how
dead scientists turning up

116
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,032
on the streets of Iran
is furthering that aim?

117
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,941
Are we containing the regime,
or aren't we?

118
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,103
Excuse me?

119
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:13,447
I'm just not clear what the
objective is here, Mr. Chairman.

120
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,875
That makes two of us.

121
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,379
You're supposed to be
gathering credible intelligence

122
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,648
upon which this administration
can make an informed choice,

123
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,818
not wreaking havoc
in the Iranian capital.

124
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,954
We believed there to be
an active threat, sir.

125
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:33,192
Let me ask you, do you think the security
of the Republic should be underpinned

126
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,869
by something
more than your belief?

127
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:39,499
I'm minded to recommend
shutting this operation down.

128
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:43,269
Isn't Cyber Command a more effective way
of achieving our goals, in any case?

129
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,912
With respect, Mr. Chairman,

130
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,544
some of us believe in good
old-fashioned analogue tradecraft.

131
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,053
Boots on the ground.

132
00:10:55,222 --> 00:11:00,419
Okay. If you wish us
to support further operations,

133
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,824
we need to move
beyond mere belief.

134
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:08,195
Is Tehran in breach of
the nuclear deal, or isn't it?

135
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,863
Cold hard facts,
not supposition,

136
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:13,106
are what is required here,
Ms. Jones.

137
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,171
Fucking suits.

138
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,072
Why do you always
have to antagonize them?

139
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,175
Do you think they would
talk to you like that?

140
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:26,412
They're a bunch of corpulent, flatulent
misogynists, John. Don't you dare defend them!

141
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,481
You heard what he said.
Go get more evidence.

142
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,723
Otherwise they're gonna
shut us down.

143
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,998
Give me some good news.

144
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,100
Cooper's off the table.

145
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,604
I knew you still had it in you.
Leyla?

146
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:53,572
She got picked up by police
in Petro Trad square.

147
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,243
Okay. We'll find out which
station she's been taken to.

148
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,811
I'll call the embassy and see
if we can get you in there.

149
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,748
What?

150
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,658
I want Harry's body repatriated.

151
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,255
That might be tricky, Max.

152
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,690
I'll do my best.

153
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,558
Well, if anyone can do it,
you can.

154
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,961
I think you've got more faith in me
than I have in myself these days.

155
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,104
Let's see how long that lasts.

156
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,603
Finish the job, Max.

157
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,914
And then go home, see your
family while you still can.

158
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,594
Olivia, if you're watching this,

159
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,135
you'll know what to do with it.

160
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,911
My name is Max William Easton.

161
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,145
News on Toumi?

162
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,614
Yes, we trawled police comms.

163
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:12,351
Leyla Toumi is being detained
at Tareek El-Tafilah Station,

164
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,887
the Mazraa quarter.

165
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,821
Alright, let's get Max in there.

166
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,090
I'll contact
his usual pickup point.

167
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,900
I want everybody on this.
Where's Walker?

168
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:24,797
I was under the command of
George White at The Section.

169
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,144
Not disturbing you, am I?
We need you out here.

170
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,940
What is it?

171
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,450
Nothing. Nothing.

172
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,719
Out here.

173
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,283
Since the Omar tip-off, Ardavan's
stepped up his security.

174
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:53,461
He flies to Beirut the third
Sunday of every month.

175
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:02,136
Hey, Said.

176
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:05,932
Salam, chetori?

177
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:08,167
Chetori? Salam.

178
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:11,111
- Where the hell have you been?
- Where's Harry?

179
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:20,220
Harry's dead.

180
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:27,186
London told us to pick up Omar,
interrogate him...

181
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:29,489
- And you didn't tell us?
- You're on Ardavan.

182
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:33,400
- We still need to know.
- You need to know what I decide to tell you.

183
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:40,366
We drove to Omar's apartment
and we waited for him.

184
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:44,137
Then he shows up and he walks
straight towards the car.

185
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:46,180
Pulls a gun.

186
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:50,984
And... shoots Harry in the head.

187
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,723
I'm sorry.

188
00:14:57,756 --> 00:14:59,859
Alright, er...

189
00:15:01,827 --> 00:15:03,329
did you get him?

190
00:15:04,597 --> 00:15:07,635
Said, answer the fucking
question! Did you get Omar?

191
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:10,196
No. He got away.

192
00:15:10,236 --> 00:15:15,534
I got out, I chased him...
but he had his exit planned.

193
00:15:15,574 --> 00:15:18,104
- He's gone to ground.
- Well, then, we're screwed.

194
00:15:18,144 --> 00:15:19,712
No, not yet.

195
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:22,449
We'll put the word out,
we'll find him.

196
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:26,821
Where's the body?

197
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:30,283
By the time
I returned to the car,

198
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:32,351
police were crawling
all over the place.

199
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:35,388
- So you just left it there?
- I didn't have a choice.

200
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:38,291
- I have to get it back.
- Leyla, he is gone!

201
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:41,802
His body is lying on some
fucking Tehran police slab!

202
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:46,265
Now, our orders are
we take out Omar and Ardavan

203
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:48,374
and then we get out of here.

204
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,948
Unless you're willing
to defy those orders?

205
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:15,369
- I should never have asked you to take...
- To what?

206
00:16:16,336 --> 00:16:18,438
Spy on him?

207
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:21,500
Yeah, it wasn't like that.

208
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,010
Yeah?

209
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:26,212
So what was it like?

210
00:16:27,347 --> 00:16:29,075
Why the constant questions?

211
00:16:29,115 --> 00:16:32,546
- Special treatment?
- He was here because of me.

212
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:36,115
His father and I, we were friends,
and he walked out on him.

213
00:16:36,155 --> 00:16:39,125
And you were a good substitute?

214
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,662
Apparently not.

215
00:16:44,764 --> 00:16:47,467
I should have been there.

216
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:50,271
- This is not on you.
- No. No.

217
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:53,332
It's on you.

218
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:56,042
This whole fucking shambles
is on you.

219
00:16:58,211 --> 00:17:00,114
- Leyla, if...
- Get...

220
00:17:04,117 --> 00:17:06,253
Let's get this over with.?

221
00:17:08,254 --> 00:17:10,256
And then I'm out.

222
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:14,286
And I never have to
look at you again.

223
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:26,860
Said turned on him.
He killed him.

224
00:19:51,618 --> 00:19:52,720
Shukran.

225
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:08,494
As-Salamu Alaykum.

226
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:09,896
Alaykumu As-Salam.

227
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:12,706
Henry Adams.
Attaché to the British Embassy.

228
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,977
I'm here to collect Leyla Toumi. Can I
speak to your commanding officer, please?

229
00:20:18,977 --> 00:20:21,715
- Yeah, have a seat.
- Thank you.

230
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:47,801
Sir.

231
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:50,377
I'm sorry, but there is
no one here by that name.

232
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:53,939
- She's here. I know she's here.
- No, sir, she's not.

233
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:57,750
- I literally just saw her...
- No... sir... you did not.

234
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,609
Do you have her?

235
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:32,011
She switched custody.
Handed over to the ISF.

236
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:35,380
Salim Baraket.

237
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,256
Baraket?

238
00:21:40,226 --> 00:21:44,290
Baraket's no longer head of the ISF. He's
semi-retired. They're phasing out the old guard.

239
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,600
Except we never do
fucking retire, do we, George?

240
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:50,863
Baraket told me never to
set foot in Beirut again.

241
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:53,299
He knows I'm in town,
must have his dogs on me.

242
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:55,100
But now Baraket's got bait,

243
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,971
all he has to do is sit back
and wait for me to come to him.

244
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:00,072
That's a bad idea, Max.

245
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:03,508
You walk in there, with your history,
you know exactly what will happen.

246
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:05,177
Why, you got a better move?

247
00:22:05,217 --> 00:22:08,615
Raid the vaults.
Find me something on him.

248
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:11,391
Make it good if you want me
to walk out again.

249
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,800
My name is Max William Easton.

250
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:10,495
I'm a British
Intelligence officer.

251
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:12,264
My last assignment was

252
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:14,667
the assassination of
Dr. Marcus Reynolds,

253
00:25:14,707 --> 00:25:16,902
the British government scientist

254
00:25:16,942 --> 00:25:19,145
and UN weapons inspector...

255
00:25:35,594 --> 00:25:38,030
She just played the tape
for her brother.

256
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:42,527
What's the order?
Did you speak to White yet?

257
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:44,770
Just sit tight.
I'll call you back.

258
00:25:57,048 --> 00:26:01,320
So we are looking into some compromising
intel on Baraket from 2005.

259
00:26:04,457 --> 00:26:06,953
Did you find anything on
Baraket, anything we can use?

260
00:26:08,593 --> 00:26:10,990
Good God, man, please tell me
you have something.

261
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,599
What the hell
have you been doing?

262
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:18,965
I'll get onto it right away,
sir.

263
00:26:19,005 --> 00:26:21,241
Sorry.

264
00:26:33,553 --> 00:26:35,982
I spoke to White.
This needs to be contained.

265
00:26:36,022 --> 00:26:39,351
You're gonna need
a strong stomach for this one.

266
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:42,461
- Am I clear?
- And the children?

267
00:26:43,595 --> 00:26:45,598
Nothing left behind.

268
00:26:51,665 --> 00:26:55,260
For what it's worth, I don't think Dr.
Reynolds deserved to die...

269
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,296
if anyone ever does.

270
00:28:40,864 --> 00:28:43,000
Max, Max, Max.

271
00:28:45,335 --> 00:28:47,631
What are you doing here, Max?

272
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:50,266
I told you what would happen
if you ever came back.

273
00:28:50,306 --> 00:28:55,104
The ISF's holding one of ours...
a British national, an asset.

274
00:28:55,144 --> 00:28:56,748
The Section wants her back.

275
00:28:59,516 --> 00:29:02,646
- How much?
- We both know you took her.

276
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:06,524
How much
are they prepared to pay?

277
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:09,993
Nothing.

278
00:29:11,661 --> 00:29:13,131
Argh!

279
00:29:35,318 --> 00:29:38,155
I warned you what would happen
if you returned.

280
00:29:39,155 --> 00:29:41,552
If this was about me,
why did you take our asset?

281
00:29:41,592 --> 00:29:44,661
Well, if you're after her,
means she's valuable.

282
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:49,367
A man's got a right
to make a living.?

283
00:29:50,968 --> 00:29:52,570
So...

284
00:29:53,938 --> 00:29:56,867
fish hooks, shark line,
gutting knives.

285
00:29:56,907 --> 00:29:59,937
No reason we should
make this quick, right?

286
00:29:59,977 --> 00:30:02,840
- I have a confession.
- I'm not a priest.

287
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,748
Left jacket pocket.

288
00:30:14,091 --> 00:30:15,919
When I was stationed here,
I have to say,

289
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,688
you were a generous host.

290
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:19,622
You gave me access to your work,

291
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:21,132
maybe more than you knew.

292
00:30:24,535 --> 00:30:26,630
Long time ago.

293
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,966
- Memory fades.
- Records remain.

294
00:30:29,006 --> 00:30:32,702
21st July, 2005. The
government motorcade bombing.

295
00:30:32,742 --> 00:30:35,706
Twenty people died,
including your Prime Minister.

296
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:38,181
Everyone pointed the finger
at Syria.

297
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:43,279
But you and I both know...
that couldn't have happened

298
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:45,215
without information
from insiders,

299
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:47,458
high up in
Lebanese intelligence.

300
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:52,296
What some people might call...
traitors.

301
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:57,067
The code is 1834. Take a look.

302
00:31:01,805 --> 00:31:03,766
If the communiqués
don't bury you,

303
00:31:03,806 --> 00:31:08,211
the Damascus meeting with Syrian intelligence
two days before the bomb certainly will.

304
00:31:12,248 --> 00:31:14,544
If I don't
get out of here alive,

305
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:16,653
all of that gets leaked.

306
00:31:17,688 --> 00:31:19,390
It's just a click of a button.

307
00:31:21,691 --> 00:31:23,754
You once told me,
if you had to run,

308
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:26,264
you'd seek sanctuary in Syria.
Is that right?

309
00:31:28,164 --> 00:31:31,268
Well, that doesn't seem like
such a safe haven now.

310
00:31:32,402 --> 00:31:35,472
You're gonna take me
to Leyla Toumi.

311
00:31:46,784 --> 00:31:49,152
It'll be returned to you
when you leave.

312
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:19,750
Sit down.

313
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:24,881
This man is here
to collect you. You are to be

314
00:32:24,921 --> 00:32:27,717
released into his custody
and escorted back to the UK.

315
00:32:27,757 --> 00:32:29,693
- This man?
- Yeah.

316
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,729
This man is here to kill me.

317
00:32:34,264 --> 00:32:37,061
Leave me alone with him
and you'll be testifying

318
00:32:37,101 --> 00:32:40,938
as to why a British citizen
was murdered on your watch.

319
00:32:42,005 --> 00:32:44,101
I need to talk to you
about Harry.

320
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:47,271
Say what you like, I'm not
going anywhere with you.

321
00:32:47,311 --> 00:32:49,814
"Love is a kind of warfare."

322
00:32:52,048 --> 00:32:53,584
Your ring.

323
00:32:55,585 --> 00:32:57,448
It's written on the inside.

324
00:32:57,488 --> 00:33:01,058
It's Ovid. I know because
I had it engraved there.

325
00:33:03,494 --> 00:33:05,530
I'm his father.

326
00:33:08,198 --> 00:33:10,267
Would you give us a moment?

327
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,111
He obviously gave it to you.

328
00:33:28,151 --> 00:33:30,848
His mother gave it to him.
And I gave it to her.

329
00:33:30,888 --> 00:33:33,124
Long time ago.

330
00:33:36,994 --> 00:33:38,488
So, take it back.

331
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:41,057
You're about to be processed
by the Ministry of the Int...

332
00:33:41,097 --> 00:33:43,694
I heard what happened to Cooper.

333
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:45,570
Your doing?

334
00:33:49,873 --> 00:33:52,069
So, who sent you?

335
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:53,611
White?

336
00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:03,520
And you're to do
the same for me?

337
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:06,257
Maybe.

338
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,493
Or maybe things have changed.

339
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,022
White told me Harry was dead.

340
00:34:13,062 --> 00:34:16,867
- Cooper told me he was alive.
- A dying man will say anything.

341
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:20,971
Is he alive?

342
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:27,270
I have every reason to tell you
what you want to hear...

343
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,038
it keeps me breathing.

344
00:34:29,078 --> 00:34:32,115
But how can you know
I'm telling you the truth?

345
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:38,589
- Harry said you were dead.
- Yet here I am.

346
00:34:39,922 --> 00:34:43,319
So, you might not be
who you say you are.

347
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,821
I guess you'll just have to
take that chance.

348
00:34:45,861 --> 00:34:48,692
Because I suspect, like me,

349
00:34:48,732 --> 00:34:50,500
you want answers too.

350
00:34:52,535 --> 00:34:54,104
And because
maybe you love him too.

351
00:34:56,138 --> 00:35:00,636
Leyla, you're on a list
no one has ever survived.

352
00:35:00,676 --> 00:35:02,873
I am your one chance
to get off it.

353
00:35:02,913 --> 00:35:06,009
Now, you can either trust me,
come with me,

354
00:35:06,049 --> 00:35:09,120
or you trust them
and you stay here.

355
00:35:11,388 --> 00:35:12,723
Your choice.

356
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:38,608
I'll be seeing you, Max.

357
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:48,278
Now, White told me
you all mutinied,

358
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:50,713
you all turned on each other.

359
00:35:50,753 --> 00:35:53,516
That Said killed Harry.
Or had him killed.

360
00:35:53,556 --> 00:35:55,918
- That's not what happened.
- No?

361
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:58,588
- Then, what happened?
- If I tell you, what then?

362
00:35:58,628 --> 00:36:01,657
I don't know. The only thing
I'm absolutely certain of,

363
00:36:01,697 --> 00:36:04,034
is what's gonna happen
if you don't.

364
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:13,077
What happened in Tehran, Leyla?

365
00:36:30,494 --> 00:36:33,090
You with me, honey?

366
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,332
- Two blocks away.
- Fifty meters.

367
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:38,735
Omar's cab is passing me now.

368
00:36:46,376 --> 00:36:48,946
- Lost him.
- I'm on it.

369
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:08,691
Why am I on the kill list?

370
00:37:08,731 --> 00:37:09,892
What?

371
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:17,566
- I don't know, I swear!
- Why were you meeting Ardavan?

372
00:37:17,606 --> 00:37:19,436
I went there to warn him.

373
00:37:19,476 --> 00:37:21,311
He was never supposed to be
on the list.

374
00:37:22,344 --> 00:37:24,074
But he was financing
the program.

375
00:37:24,114 --> 00:37:26,217
That's what they told you.

376
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:30,447
- So what's the truth?
- Speak to Ardavan. He knows.

377
00:37:30,487 --> 00:37:32,782
- Knows what?
- What they're really doing out here.

378
00:37:32,822 --> 00:37:34,391
What you're really doing!

379
00:37:41,764 --> 00:37:43,293
So where's Ardavan now?

380
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:46,202
I don't know.
I got him a passport.

381
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,938
And the name on the passport?

382
00:37:54,978 --> 00:37:59,517
- Er... Darius... Darius Kazim!
- Where's he fucking gone, Omar?

383
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,686
We need to move!

384
00:38:43,393 --> 00:38:45,496
So he is alive.

385
00:38:46,496 --> 00:38:48,757
Where is he now?

386
00:38:48,797 --> 00:38:50,559
He's after a man
called Ali Ardavan.

387
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:53,128
- So you don't know where he is?
- I know how to find him.

388
00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:55,097
- How?
- Ardavan was on our list.

389
00:38:55,137 --> 00:38:58,909
When Harry started looking into him,
he ended up with an order on himself.

390
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:02,838
- The Section ordered Harry dead?
- White.

391
00:39:02,878 --> 00:39:04,681
Said couldn't carry it out.

392
00:39:05,715 --> 00:39:08,818
- Does White know?
- No. Said lied to him. Took off.

393
00:39:10,286 --> 00:39:12,589
If we find Ardavan,
we find Harry.

394
00:39:25,434 --> 00:39:28,063
Will Daddy be home on Saturday?

395
00:39:28,103 --> 00:39:30,740
I want him to take me
to the climbing wall.

396
00:39:33,143 --> 00:39:34,945
He always takes me.

397
00:39:36,378 --> 00:39:38,681
- Promise?
- Promis.

398
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:26,230
- Lola?
- Maman.

399
00:40:38,675 --> 00:40:40,210
Walker...

400
00:41:13,876 --> 00:41:15,144
Ssh. C'était un rêve.

401
00:41:38,635 --> 00:41:40,863
Allez, viens. Shh-shh.

402
00:41:40,903 --> 00:41:42,206
Viens avec moi. On y va.

403
00:41:45,974 --> 00:41:48,170
I never sanctioned an op
in St. Michel.

404
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,905
I know you've got
an asset in play.

405
00:41:49,945 --> 00:41:51,441
You start talking!

406
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:54,309
- She knows everything.
- Who knows what?

407
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:57,679
The wife. Max made a tape, an insurance
policy, about the Reynolds hit.

408
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:59,249
He named you.
The wife watched it.

409
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:01,251
- I was doing you a favor.
- What's the action?

410
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,920
- What's the fucking action?
- Wet work.

411
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,829
I sent Laurence in.

412
00:42:06,996 --> 00:42:09,525
- You treacherous little prick.
- Because you keep me blind.

413
00:42:09,565 --> 00:42:12,402
You always have, standing on
my fucking shoulders!

414
00:42:15,605 --> 00:42:18,175
You're finished.
Get out of my sight.

415
00:42:20,376 --> 00:42:21,711
Maman?

416
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:31,748
Laurence, this is George White.

417
00:42:33,822 --> 00:42:36,092
Show's over. Abort.
I repeat, abort.

418
00:43:11,427 --> 00:43:13,963
Who's furthest? No.

419
00:43:38,987 --> 00:43:43,393
I've come to recognize the sound of a
single malt being poured 3,000 miles away.

420
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:50,134
I reactivated an old asset to
sort out this fiasco in Tehran.

421
00:43:52,668 --> 00:43:54,496
I thought I had enough
leverage on him

422
00:43:54,536 --> 00:43:56,939
and it turns out
he has the same on me.

423
00:43:59,275 --> 00:44:01,838
On us, actually.

424
00:44:01,878 --> 00:44:03,072
Go on.

425
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:05,282
The Marcus Reynolds job.

426
00:44:06,815 --> 00:44:09,244
Tell me you have
this ring-fenced.

427
00:44:09,284 --> 00:44:11,221
He made a confession, of sorts.

428
00:44:12,222 --> 00:44:14,950
- It's a tape.
- Christ!

429
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:17,827
His wife has seen it.
So has her brother.

430
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:22,257
But they are contained?

431
00:44:22,297 --> 00:44:25,327
Walker acted rashly,
without my authorization.

432
00:44:25,367 --> 00:44:26,969
She got spooked.

433
00:44:27,936 --> 00:44:29,097
She fled.

434
00:44:29,137 --> 00:44:31,633
- I'm getting on a plane.
- No. You don't have to do that.

435
00:44:31,673 --> 00:44:33,702
If this spreads,
I burn right along with you,

436
00:44:33,742 --> 00:44:37,380
so forgive me if I don't trust
you to deal with it alone.

437
00:44:51,468 --> 00:44:56,468

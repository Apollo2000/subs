1
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,707
Should be a tabby or a black cat?

2
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:02,842
Black cat.

3
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:06,166
Tada!

4
00:01:11,036 --> 00:01:12,818
Come on, guys.

5
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:14,340
- Pancakes!
- Pancakes!

6
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:44,610
<i>Yalla, yalla!</i>

7
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:46,559
Papa? Papa, are you okay?

8
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:12,352
<i>You may find yourself</i>

9
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:16,001
<i>in another part of the world,</i>

10
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:19,805
<i>living in a beautiful house</i>

11
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:21,761
<i>with a beautiful wife.</i>

12
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:26,412
<i>And you may ask yourself</i>

13
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,201
<i>"How do I work this?</i>

14
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:33,406
<i>"This is not my beautiful house.</i>

15
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:38,211
<i>This is not my beautiful wife."</i>

16
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:43,983
<i>You may ask yourself...</i>

17
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:47,420
<i>"Well...</i>

18
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:55,519
<i>..how did I get here?"</i>

19

20
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,781
Come on, come on! Let's go! Come on!

21
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:26,031
Au revoir.

22
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:28,239
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour, monsieur.

23
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,004
<i>D'accord, à tout de suite.</i>

24
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,024
<i>Hey.</i>

25
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:54,626
<i>Bonjour, mon ange.</i>

26
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:56,349
- There you go.
- <i>Merci.</i>

27
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:01,667
- How'd it go last night?
- The usual.

28
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:03,869
Understaffed, overworked.

29
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,270
The girls get off okay?

30
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,426
Yeah, yeah.

31
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:10,429
What is it?

32
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,711
Nothing.

33
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:15,013
You sure?

34
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:16,536
Yeah, it's nothing.

35
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,543
<i>Amour?</i> The power has been cut.

36
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,190
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

37
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,168
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

38
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:31,210
Leyla? Okay?

39
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:35,227
Harry?

40
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:37,750
Good?

41
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,039
Nice work, everyone.

42
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,041
So when is the extraction?

43
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,610
Ahmadi was the last one
on the list. That's it.

44
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,912
- All four targets done.
- Plans have changed.

45
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:56,615
- There's one more.
- Jesus H. Christ.

46
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:59,718
Ali Ardavan... made his money in steel,

47
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:03,255
anywhere between $1.2 and $1.5 billion,

48
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,091
major financier
of the nuclear weapons program.

49
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,026
So when did you find out about this?

50
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:10,862
Came through from London this morning.

51
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:13,098
There's no point
taking out their scientists

52
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:15,400
if we don't take out the financiers

53
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,702
paying for the program.

54
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,403
This is the last target, I promise you,

55
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:19,725
and then we get to go home.

56
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:23,442
Man, I can't wait
to get out of this shithole.

57
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,845
Hey, no offense, Omar.

58
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,680
None taken.

59
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,640
<i>Okay, eyes on Ardavan.</i>

60
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,762
<i>He's with his bodyguard.</i>

61
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:05,204
<i>You guys take it from here.</i>

62
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,722
Fuck.

63
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:40,218
It's Omar.

64
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:42,141
What the fuck is Omar doing here?

65
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:45,924
Shit.

66
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:47,626
<i>And you're quite sure</i>

67
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:49,261
- it was Omar?
- We saw him clearly.

68
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:50,896
Little rat son of a bitch.

69
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:52,597
We're compromised.
I think we should pull out.

70
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:54,099
No, I need to run this back to London.

71
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:56,802
I say we bring him in.

72
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,704
A little enhanced interrogation,

73
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,405
find out what he told them.

74
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,441
We move the safe house
to Behnoud Street.

75
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,710
He doesn't know that one.
And we sit tight

76
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,879
and you await further orders.
Understood?

77
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,335
- Yes, boss.
- Okay, let's move.

78
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,099
Papa?

79
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,434
Hey, sweetie.

80
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:31,603
- Are you ready for your story?
- Yeah.

81
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:34,026
Yeah? Come on.

82
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,130
Come on, then.

83
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:48,220
Hi.

84
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,422
How are the girls?

85
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,545
I got them down.

86
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,695
How was your day?

87
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:58,864
Fine.

88
00:11:58,984 --> 00:11:59,998
Glass of wine?

89
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:02,401
Yeah, I'd love one.

90
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,956
I'll go get changed.

91
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:45,164
Hello?

92
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:55,487
We need to wake the girls.

93
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:58,423
What's going on? What's going on?

94
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:00,546
We need to get 'em up, now.

95
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,719
Get them in the bathroom.

96
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,958
Shh. Lock the door.

97
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:25,204
Shh, shh, shh. <i>Ça va, ça va.</i>

98
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,827
<i>How are those two beautiful
daughters of yours, Max?</i>

99
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:11,062
<i>Bright futures ahead of them, I bet?</i>

100
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:13,352
<i>And your gorgeous wife.</i>

101
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,001
<i>Family is important, Max.</i>

102
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,190
<i>Family is everything.</i>

103
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,273
<i>See you in London.</i>

104
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:44,062
Max, you're going to tell me

105
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:45,297
what the hell is going on.

106
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,798
I have to go away.

107
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:48,199
This is the bank.

108
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,201
This is their way of summoning me.

109
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:53,325
You left the bank ten years ago.

110
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:57,842
What kind of banker were you?

111
00:14:57,962 --> 00:14:59,965
Did you launder money?

112
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:02,534
Who for?

113
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:05,337
Answer me!

114
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:10,288
I represented some
pretty unpleasant people

115
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:12,424
within the Syrian regime.
It's not something I'm proud of.

116
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,526
In fact, that's why I left.

117
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:16,328
I helped them stash
theirtheir rainy day money.

118
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,584
Well, now it's fucking raining,
they want it back.

119
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:23,589
There are hundreds of people
working there.

120
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,638
Why you?

121
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:28,206
Why you, Max?

122
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:30,675
Because I don't have
a fucking choice. Okay?

123
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:32,331
I don't have a choice.

124
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:37,015
You have no idea
what these people are like.

125
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:38,717
What they're capable of.

126
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,406
Are we safe?

127
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,520
Are we safe?

128
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,655
Yes, we're safe,

129
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:45,290
if I do as they ask.

130
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,226
I find their money, they leave us alone.

131
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:49,948
It's over.

132
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:52,797
I'm doing this for us.

133
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:56,301
I just need one week.

134
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:58,557
And then we go back to normal.
I promise.

135
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,106
Please?

136
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,228
<i>Ne touche pas.</i>

137
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:50,421
This way, please.

138
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,603
You threaten my wife?

139
00:17:26,723 --> 00:17:28,125
My children?

140
00:17:29,393 --> 00:17:31,208
I don't like being ignored.

141
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:33,397
Fuck you, George.

142
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:38,402
Come.

143
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:03,640
Iran's been reneging
on its nuclear deal.

144
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,375
They've got government scientists

145
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,978
working around the clock
on weaponizing uranium.

146
00:18:08,098 --> 00:18:10,447
We sent in a team
to neutralize that threat.

147
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,050
The operation was led by your protégé,

148
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,018
Alexander Said.

149
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:16,787
Not exactly <i>my</i> protégé.

150
00:18:16,907 --> 00:18:19,990
Ryan Cooper and Leyla Toumi
were part of his unit.

151
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,892
The operation went like clockwork

152
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:23,660
until the last few days,

153
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,229
when Said decided, for reasons unknown,

154
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:29,433
to do a Colonel Kurtz.

155
00:18:29,553 --> 00:18:31,555
He's turned on us, Max.

156
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:40,377
Toumi and Cooper
have surfaced in Beirut.

157
00:18:40,497 --> 00:18:42,779
We need you to go in
and clean up the mess.

158
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:44,448
Find them. Deal with them.

159
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:47,384
Find Said. Deal with him as well.

160
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:49,086
Why me?

161
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:50,620
You've got other people.

162
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,209
Younger.

163
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:54,945
Hungrier.

164
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:13,777
What's this got to do with Harry?

165
00:19:13,897 --> 00:19:15,979
You don't know?

166
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:18,536
Know what?

167
00:19:20,704 --> 00:19:23,487
Harry came to Said
some years after you walked out.

168
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:25,389
He wanted to work for us.

169
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:28,012
Hehe wanted to follow
in your footsteps.

170
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:52,382
Said turned on him.

171
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:53,984
He killed him.

172
00:19:54,104 --> 00:19:56,186
Or had him killed.

173
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:58,109
We don't know why.

174
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,058
That's two to the head, Max.

175
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:03,180
You know exactly what that means.

176
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:08,185
We're giving you the
opportunity to make this right.

177
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:13,357
Isn't that what you'd want?

178
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,402
Call me from Beirut.

179
00:20:40,717 --> 00:20:42,399
Why all of them?

180
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:44,321
Why not just Said?

181
00:20:46,623 --> 00:20:48,626
It's what Langley wants.

182
00:20:51,528 --> 00:20:54,365
We just do their bidding for them.

183
00:20:57,534 --> 00:20:59,049
It's a mistake using him.

184
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:00,650
Well, fortunately for all of us, Khalid,

185
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,907
that isn't your call.

186
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:33,049
Okay, so now you've had your theatrics.

187
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:35,306
What's all this about?

188
00:21:38,975 --> 00:21:41,011
What is it?

189
00:21:45,715 --> 00:21:47,151
Harry's dead.

190
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:52,302
What?

191
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:54,404
He was in Tehran, on a trade delegation.

192
00:21:54,524 --> 00:21:56,273
He was hit by a car.

193
00:21:56,393 --> 00:21:58,208
A colleague called me from the embassy.

194
00:21:58,328 --> 00:22:00,497
I didn't want you to hear it
over the phone.

195
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:03,901
But-But I...

196
00:22:05,502 --> 00:22:07,304
But I...

197
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:12,009
I spoke to him last week.

198
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:15,592
I'm sorry.

199
00:22:15,712 --> 00:22:18,395
Don't you dare! Don't you...

200
00:22:18,515 --> 00:22:20,818
dare try and comfort me.

201
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:26,269
Trade delegation?

202
00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:28,525
Think I'm stupid?

203
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,842
He wanted to be like you.

204
00:22:32,962 --> 00:22:36,700
God only knows why,
you were always a fucking mess.

205
00:22:38,368 --> 00:22:40,417
Not a word in ten years.

206
00:22:40,537 --> 00:22:42,686
You get to start again,
you get to start over.

207
00:22:42,806 --> 00:22:45,789
Not one sodding word.

208
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:48,612
How fucking great for you.

209
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:05,609
There's nothing in here.
Nothing I can find.

210
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:09,012
- You?
- Got nothing.

211
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:12,015
How long's Omar been playing us?
There must be something here

212
00:23:12,135 --> 00:23:14,505
that tells us where the breach
happened, something we missed.

213
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:18,188
- You want some khoresh?
- What is Said doing,

214
00:23:18,308 --> 00:23:19,823
just sitting on this?

215
00:23:19,943 --> 00:23:21,825
You need to eat.

216
00:23:21,945 --> 00:23:24,782
Well, I'm clearly the only one
that's concerned about this.

217
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:29,199
I am concerned, Harry.

218
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,900
Just 'cause I don't
keep talking about it

219
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,023
doesn't mean that I'm not concerned.

220
00:24:45,695 --> 00:24:47,577
I never understood why you'd wake

221
00:24:47,697 --> 00:24:49,612
- in the middle of the night to pray.
- The Fajr.

222
00:24:49,732 --> 00:24:52,182
God's most favored prayer.

223
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:54,905
The devout pray whilst others slumber.

224
00:24:56,406 --> 00:24:58,988
Give me the sleep of the damned any day.

225
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:01,291
How's he doing?

226
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:03,593
He's spooked by Omar's betrayal,
but then...

227
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:06,296
so am I.

228
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:08,231
- Have you heard from London?
- No.

229
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:11,034
It doesn't make any sense.
Why go silent on us?

230
00:25:11,154 --> 00:25:13,603
- I don't know.
- Contact them again.

231
00:25:13,723 --> 00:25:15,359
Don't tell me how to do my job.

232
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,180
Why do you worry about Harry?

233
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,250
I've been worrying about Harry
since he was 14 years old.

234
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,706
I knew his father. We were...

235
00:25:35,512 --> 00:25:37,314
Keep him close. Keep me informed.

236
00:26:22,845 --> 00:26:26,329
My God. A real live ghost.

237
00:26:26,449 --> 00:26:30,266
- What happened to you?
- Car bomb.

238
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:31,734
2006.

239
00:26:31,854 --> 00:26:35,305
I guess my luck ran out.
You want a drink?

240
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:37,674
- You need to ask?
- Come on, then.

241
00:26:37,794 --> 00:26:39,742
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, what the fuck?

242
00:26:39,862 --> 00:26:41,711
The look on your face, man.

243
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:43,500
I'm just fucking with you.

244
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:46,282
I broke my ankle back in March.

245
00:26:46,402 --> 00:26:47,884
I've been meaning to return that thing,

246
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:49,953
but it's just so damn comfortable.

247
00:26:50,073 --> 00:26:52,409
- How you been?
- Not bad.

248
00:26:54,844 --> 00:26:56,359
I got to say, I'm a little surprised

249
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:58,461
to see you back in Beirut, Max.

250
00:26:58,581 --> 00:26:59,462
I thought you were out of the game.

251
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:01,284
Yeah, me too.

252
00:27:04,787 --> 00:27:06,736
Tripped on a running machine,
hit his head.

253
00:27:06,856 --> 00:27:08,671
Suppose you never know
when it's your turn.

254
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:11,074
Amen.

255
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:12,475
What are you doing here, Max?

256
00:27:12,595 --> 00:27:15,278
Two Section operatives have gone AWOL.

257
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:19,002
I need to, track 'em down.

258
00:27:21,804 --> 00:27:23,553
I really thought you'd retired.

259
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:25,475
I don't have a choice on this one.

260
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,732
You remember Alexander Said?

261
00:27:35,852 --> 00:27:38,868
- Is he still active?
- Very much so.

262
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:40,903
- Is he in town?
- Not that I know of.

263
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:42,372
If they're alone,
they're gonna need help.

264
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:44,073
An independent fixer.

265
00:27:44,193 --> 00:27:46,676
- Who would they go to?
- I'm out of the loop, Max.

266
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:49,712
- Your guess is as good as mine.
- I doubt that.

267
00:27:49,832 --> 00:27:51,748
Look, I don't owe anyone any favors.

268
00:27:51,868 --> 00:27:54,984
I got out for a reason.
And I intend to stay out.

269
00:27:55,104 --> 00:27:57,040
Fair enough.

270
00:27:59,008 --> 00:28:02,412
- It's good to see you, Gabe.
- Good to see you, my friend.

271
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,133
You look like the sky is falling in.

272
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:11,788
What are you not telling me?

273
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,272
Harry's dead.

274
00:28:16,392 --> 00:28:17,673
- What?
- Yeah.

275
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:19,776
Jesus, that's...
that's fucking terrible.

276
00:28:23,065 --> 00:28:24,301
Come here.

277
00:28:37,246 --> 00:28:39,449
So fucking sorry to hear that, man.

278
00:28:40,983 --> 00:28:43,499
- He was a good kid.
- Yeah. He was.

279
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:45,735
And I was a terrible father.

280
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:48,171
- What happened to him?
- They killed him.

281
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,873
The people he was working with.
They killed him.

282
00:28:50,993 --> 00:28:52,341
This has something
to do with these operatives

283
00:28:52,461 --> 00:28:53,376
you're looking for?

284
00:28:53,496 --> 00:28:55,078
It does.

285
00:28:55,198 --> 00:28:56,679
Then why the fuck didn't you say so,

286
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,068
you stupid old man?

287
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:06,839
<i>Allô? Anna.</i>

288
00:30:29,592 --> 00:30:30,940
<i>"In the event of your death,</i>

289
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,775
"contents of said strong box

290
00:30:32,895 --> 00:30:34,877
"in the St. Michel branch
of the Bank Of Lausanne

291
00:30:34,997 --> 00:30:38,559

292
00:31:09,098 --> 00:31:10,400
Okay.

293
00:31:50,072 --> 00:31:52,409
Gabriel.

294
00:32:35,484 --> 00:32:36,732
I don't know them.

295
00:32:36,852 --> 00:32:38,267
They were looking for a safe house,

296
00:32:38,387 --> 00:32:40,069
supplies, weapons.

297
00:32:40,189 --> 00:32:41,858
A fixer. Who would they go to?

298
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:12,589
Get in the car. Get in the car!

299
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:31,153
Leyla.

300
00:33:31,273 --> 00:33:32,888
We've been going about this
the wrong way.

301
00:33:33,008 --> 00:33:34,357
Looking into Omar
isn't gonna give us the breach.

302
00:33:34,477 --> 00:33:36,092
We need to look at Ali Ardavan.

303
00:33:36,212 --> 00:33:39,061
Two years ago, Ali Ardavan
bought a ten percent stake

304
00:33:39,181 --> 00:33:41,697
in Green Walsh, a U.S. engineering firm.

305
00:33:41,817 --> 00:33:44,100
So what? He's a businessman.

306
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,169
The deal was negotiated
by Burnett Hanson.

307
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:50,072
Highpowered Washington, D.C. law firm.

308
00:33:50,192 --> 00:33:51,874
Look at this.

309
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:53,676
What am I looking at?

310
00:33:53,796 --> 00:33:55,598
There, in the background.

311
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,634
Shit!

312
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:01,884
- Omar.
- So I looked into Burnett Hanson.

313
00:34:02,004 --> 00:34:03,085
Ardavan was a client of theirs.

314
00:34:03,205 --> 00:34:04,887
And, turns out, two summers ago,

315
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:06,843
Omar interned there.
Must be where they met.

316
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:11,481
I'm taking it to Said.

317
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:20,469
What?

318
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:22,905
I don't think you should
take it to Said.

319
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:24,740
- Why not?
- This whole Omar business...

320
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,776
it doesn't strike you as strange?

321
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:29,545
We tell them we have a mole,
and nothing.

322
00:34:29,665 --> 00:34:32,681
They don't say a word.

323
00:34:32,801 --> 00:34:34,283
At least, not according to Said.

324
00:34:34,403 --> 00:34:36,952
You think he's lying?

325
00:34:37,072 --> 00:34:38,921
- Yeah.
- I really don't know what to say to that.

326
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:40,510
This is Said we're talking about.

327
00:34:44,213 --> 00:34:46,382
You coming?

328
00:34:47,383 --> 00:34:49,385
Okay, then.

329
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:10,152
Hey. I found the source of the breach.

330
00:35:10,272 --> 00:35:11,887
Burnett Hanson.

331
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:14,690
Big Washington law firm.
Ardavan was a client there.

332
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,814
Omar interned at the same firm.

333
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:22,785
This is good work, Harry.

334
00:35:23,986 --> 00:35:25,588
I'll take it to White.

335
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:29,492
Your father would be
proud of you, you know that?

336
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:57,620
- Do you know them?
- No.

337
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:00,736
Okay.

338
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:03,026
Pretty much what I was expecting.

339
00:36:06,028 --> 00:36:08,077
I don't know
if I've got this in me anymore,

340
00:36:08,197 --> 00:36:09,299
but we're gonna find out.

341
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:15,551
I'm a little rusty.

342
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:18,320
I'm not as clean and efficient
as I used to be,

343
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,955
so this might get a little messy.

344
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:21,991
I'm gonna pull out
your fingernails one by one.

345
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:23,726
If, after the last nail,

346
00:36:23,846 --> 00:36:26,061
you still insist
you don't know those people,

347
00:36:26,181 --> 00:36:28,384
then, I'm gonna move on...

348
00:36:29,985 --> 00:36:32,935
..to your teeth.

349
00:36:33,055 --> 00:36:35,671
Hassan...

350
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:38,741
..I'm not one of those boys
who enjoys this kind of shit.

351
00:36:38,861 --> 00:36:40,910
But what I am...

352
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,199
is highly motivated
to find those people.

353
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:46,081
Okay? Don't look at him.

354
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:48,717
He can't help you.

355
00:36:48,837 --> 00:36:50,753
You take a couple of seconds...

356
00:36:50,873 --> 00:36:52,721
and think about that.

357
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:56,125
- What do you say?
- I don't know.

358
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:57,660
- You don't know?
- No.

359
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,382
Okay, fuck it.

360
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,773
Okay, okay, okay! Please! Please!

361
00:37:10,893 --> 00:37:12,675
- Please. Stop it.
- What are they doing here?

362
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:15,544
They're looking for a man...
Ali Ardavan.

363
00:37:15,664 --> 00:37:17,947
- Who's he?
- A businessman. An Iranian businessman.

364
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:19,949
- Why are they looking for him?
- I don't know.

365
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:22,885
- Why are they looking for him?
- I don't know! I don't know!

366
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:25,008
Please, I don't know.

367
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:29,959
Okay, you tell them
you want to meet them.

368
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,261
You have news.

369
00:37:32,381 --> 00:37:34,863
They're gonna meet you
in Petro Trad square, 5:00 p.m.

370
00:37:34,983 --> 00:37:36,265
Understood?

371
00:37:36,385 --> 00:37:38,133
Yes. Yes.

372
00:37:38,253 --> 00:37:40,302
- Look at me.
- Yes, yes.

373
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:42,137
- Understood?
- Yes.

374
00:37:42,257 --> 00:37:45,194
Yes. Yes.

375
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,409
<i>Merci.</i>

376
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:34,316
<i>Why the delay?</i>

377
00:39:34,436 --> 00:39:35,918
- Excuse me?
<i>- In giving us a steer</i>

378
00:39:36,038 --> 00:39:37,920
on Omar... why the delay?

379
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,009
My people are
out on a limb here, George.

380
00:39:41,443 --> 00:39:43,092
We've been doing our due diligence.

381
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:45,294
We want to be
on solid ground on this one.

382
00:39:45,414 --> 00:39:47,663
<i>Harry found the source of the breach.</i>

383
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:49,465
<i>Burnett Hanson.</i>

384
00:39:49,585 --> 00:39:51,888
<i>It's a law firm in Washington, D.C.</i>

385
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,273
Alex, we know all about Burnett Hanson.

386
00:39:58,393 --> 00:40:01,197
We've looked into them.
There's nothing there.

387
00:40:06,034 --> 00:40:07,316
Did Harry tell you

388
00:40:07,436 --> 00:40:09,605
<i>he knew Omar before this operation?</i>

389
00:40:11,506 --> 00:40:12,588
No.

390
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:15,557
<i>You know he was at the LSE.</i>

391
00:40:15,677 --> 00:40:17,326
- So?
<i>- Omar was as well.</i>

392
00:40:17,446 --> 00:40:20,329
They did a course together...
Strategy in a Changing World...

393
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:22,898
three years ago.

394
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:25,067
<i>I'll send you the intelligence,
you can see for yourself.</i>

395
00:40:25,187 --> 00:40:26,368
<i>Harry is using</i>

396
00:40:26,488 --> 00:40:28,370
Burnett Hanson as a misdirect.

397
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,539
Burnett Hanson is not the breach.

398
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:32,395
<i>Harry is.</i>

399
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,449
- Where are we going?
- We got the go on Omar.

400
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:50,785
He's in a bolt hole
in the Alborz mountains.

401
00:40:50,905 --> 00:40:53,054
We're gonna finish the job.

402
00:40:53,174 --> 00:40:54,889
Where are the others?

403
00:40:55,009 --> 00:40:57,512
It won't take more than two of us.

404
00:41:18,633 --> 00:41:20,399
<i>Et voilà.</i>

405
00:43:10,745 --> 00:43:12,093
Hey.

406
00:43:12,213 --> 00:43:14,795
Hi.

407
00:43:14,915 --> 00:43:17,098
Where are you?

408
00:43:17,218 --> 00:43:18,666
Beirut.

409
00:43:18,786 --> 00:43:21,035
- Beirut?
<i>- Following the money.</i>

410
00:43:21,155 --> 00:43:22,503
Look, I can't talk right now.

411
00:43:22,623 --> 00:43:23,838
I've got to go into a meeting.

412
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,406
Okay.

413
00:43:25,526 --> 00:43:28,042
Are you all right? You sound funny.

414
00:43:28,162 --> 00:43:30,478
<i>Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.</i>

415
00:43:30,598 --> 00:43:32,813
<i>I'm, coming down
with a cold, I think.</i>

416
00:43:32,933 --> 00:43:34,369
A cold?

417
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:36,438
Right.

418
00:43:40,508 --> 00:43:42,290
How are the girls?

419
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,258
Fine.

420
00:43:44,378 --> 00:43:45,714
Yeah, they're fine.

421
00:43:46,914 --> 00:43:49,997
Tell them...

422
00:43:50,117 --> 00:43:51,399
I miss them.

423
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:54,189
<i>I will.</i>

424
00:43:56,757 --> 00:43:57,805
Max?

425
00:43:57,925 --> 00:43:59,640
<i>We need to talk.</i>

426
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,908
Absolutely.

427
00:44:01,028 --> 00:44:03,210
We do.

428
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,680
Can it wait?

429
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,769
I've got, um...

430
00:44:09,737 --> 00:44:11,585
I've got a couple of people
waiting for me.

431
00:44:11,705 --> 00:44:13,454
<i>I'll call you, okay?</i>

432
00:44:13,574 --> 00:44:15,210
Okay.

433
00:44:43,304 --> 00:44:44,652
<i>Olivia, if you're watching this,</i>

434
00:44:44,772 --> 00:44:46,741
<i>you'll know what to do with it.</i>

435
00:44:54,381 --> 00:44:57,298
<i>My name is Max William Easton.</i>

436
00:44:57,418 --> 00:45:01,235
<i>I'm a British intelligence officer.</i>

437
00:45:01,355 --> 00:45:03,604
<i>My last assignment</i>

438
00:45:03,724 --> 00:45:06,707
<i>was the assassination
of Dr. Marcus Reynolds,</i>

439
00:45:06,827 --> 00:45:08,876
<i>the British government scientist</i>

440
00:45:08,996 --> 00:45:10,478
<i>and UN weapons inspector</i>

441
00:45:10,598 --> 00:45:12,767
<i>in the runup to the war in Iraq.</i>

442
00:45:15,803 --> 00:45:17,084
<i>I was...</i>

443
00:45:19,507 --> 00:45:22,110
<i>I was instructed
to make it look like suicide.</i>

444
00:45:24,512 --> 00:45:26,260
<i>I was under the command of George White</i>

445
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:29,263
<i>at The Section... MI6.</i>

446
00:45:29,383 --> 00:45:31,699
<i>For what it's worth,
I don't think Dr. Reynolds</i>

447
00:45:31,819 --> 00:45:33,188
<i>deserved to die.</i>

448
00:45:36,223 --> 00:45:37,625
<i>If anyone ever does.</i>

449
00:45:55,543 --> 00:45:57,391
What time did Nassor say he'd meet us?

450
00:45:57,511 --> 00:45:59,514
5:00 p.m.

451
00:46:19,133 --> 00:46:20,614
Did you tell them about the breach?

452
00:46:20,734 --> 00:46:21,916
I did.

453
00:46:22,036 --> 00:46:24,051
They're looking into Burnett Hanson.

454
00:46:24,171 --> 00:46:26,107
White commended your diligence.

455
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,524
Why didn't you tell me you knew Omar?

456
00:46:43,557 --> 00:46:45,206
What?

457
00:46:45,326 --> 00:46:48,242
How long have you been
passing intelligence to Tehran?

458
00:46:48,362 --> 00:46:52,333
Said, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

459
00:46:54,969 --> 00:46:57,138
What, are you fucking joking?

460
00:46:58,105 --> 00:47:00,187
Hey, what's going on?

461
00:47:00,307 --> 00:47:02,490
Fuck, Said!

462
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:05,914
Said, please!

463
00:47:18,726 --> 00:47:20,562
Where the hell is Nassor? He's late.

464
00:47:24,198 --> 00:47:27,114
Get out of here! Move!

465
00:47:38,145 --> 00:47:39,781
Aah!

466
00:49:17,511 --> 00:49:19,893
Where's Said?

467
00:49:20,013 --> 00:49:21,416
Why did he kill Harry?

468
00:49:24,618 --> 00:49:26,266
Said didn't kill Harry.

469
00:49:26,386 --> 00:49:28,102
- What?
- Harry's here.

470
00:49:28,222 --> 00:49:30,838
- What did you say?
- Harry's alive.

471
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:33,440
You fucking with me?

472
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,475
Is he alive?

473
00:49:34,595 --> 00:49:36,276
Where is he?

474
00:49:36,396 --> 00:49:38,112
Said, please!

475
00:49:38,232 --> 00:49:40,735
Stay with me! Stay with me!
Don't you die on me!

476
00:49:42,002 --> 00:49:44,184
Don't you fucking die on me!

477
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,112
Where's Harry? Is he alive?

478
00:49:53,013 --> 00:49:55,383
Cooper! Where's Harry?

479
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,799
I warned you what would happen
if you returned.

480
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,999
I know you've got an asset in play.

481
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,185
- Startp talking.

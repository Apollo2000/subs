1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,846
What did White tell you?
That I was the breach?

2
00:00:01,886 --> 00:00:03,914
- And you believe that?
- You're alive, aren't you?

3
00:00:03,954 --> 00:00:05,316
What are they covering up, Said?

4
00:00:05,356 --> 00:00:07,117
Speak to Ardavan, he knows.

5
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:09,069
- Knows what?
- What they're really doing out here.

6
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:10,320
What you're really doing.

7
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,522
You know what those are?

8
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:13,591
These mean nothing.

9
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:15,726
I can prove exactly
what they mean.

10
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,227
Put that back in your pocket.

11
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,997
Better still, bury it
before it buries you.

12
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:22,366
It was made very clear
to me that,

13
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:24,000
if I don't complete this job...

14
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,636
If you don't kill me,

15
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:28,105
White takes out your family.

16
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:31,108
They've burned five operatives
over this.

17
00:00:31,148 --> 00:00:33,243
You think
they're gonna spare you?

18
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:37,154
You need to know what's going
on, just as much as Harry does.

19
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:46,190
Turn around.

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,465
Slowly.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,074
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back Million
Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday.

22
00:04:58,414 --> 00:05:00,852
Turn around slowly.

23
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:12,555
What the fuck
are you doing here?

24
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,136
No, Harry, wait!

25
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:38,815
No, no!

26
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:41,191
Move! Go!

27
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:08,085
Where are the girls?

28
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:12,182
The girls.

29
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:14,918
Lola, Chloe.!

30
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,653
- Maman.
- Maman.

31
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:18,988
Now, you're gonna be here
for a while.

32
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:22,024
There's toys for the kids.

33
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:23,961
The kitchen is downstairs.

34
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:25,394
Larder's full.

35
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:27,197
I don't understand.
What is going on?

36
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:29,999
Now, you kids, you're free
to roam the grounds.

37
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,210
There's a trampoline
and a rope swing.

38
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,082
No.

39
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:40,644
Wait.

40
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:42,686
Please.

41
00:06:43,787 --> 00:06:46,657
What is really going on here?

42
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,055
Are we being used as leverage?

43
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:55,124
I'm having some hot water
sent up for you.

44
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:59,737
What if my husband refuses to do
what you want him to?

45
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:17,713
Max, it's me.

46
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:18,915
I lost you.

47
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:20,016
I'm back in the room.

48
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:22,693
Call me.

49
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:58,362
It's good to see you.

50
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,228
Okay, so what are you
doing here?

51
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:06,797
Rescuing you, apparently.

52
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:08,831
I don't need your help.

53
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:10,167
A thank you would be nice.

54
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:11,802
Fuck you.

55
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:14,170
Right.

56
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,372
Okay.

57
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,908
Well, now we've got that
out of the way.

58
00:08:18,948 --> 00:08:20,444
I came here to find you.

59
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:21,978
And to put a bullet in my head.

60
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:23,980
Don't forget that little detail.

61
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,749
There is that.

62
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:28,218
White told him you were dead.

63
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,853
Said we'd gone AWOL,

64
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:33,189
sent your father here
to clean up the mess.

65
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,025
He got to Cooper; I was next.

66
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:37,960
Yeah, well, you always were
nothing if not efficient.

67
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,162
I still don't understand

68
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:42,539
why you came, because I know
it's not for me.

69
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:50,280
White threatened his kids.

70
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,178
So you've got kids?

71
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:57,781
- Yeah, two girls.
- Wow.

72
00:08:57,821 --> 00:08:59,949
You have been busy.

73
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:01,591
You still with the mum?

74
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,356
Yeah.

75
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:08,824
We need to move from here,
find somewhere less conspicuous.

76
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:10,359
Since when is there a "we"?

77
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,643
Can you even remember
the last time

78
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,130
we were in
the same room together?

79
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,933
Okay, family reunion over.
What now?

80
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,016
We're in the same boat here.

81
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,035
For now.

82
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:21,003
White's targeting my kids.

83
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:22,539
He wants you dead.

84
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,373
The only way out of this
is to find out

85
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:25,590
what it is they're covering up

86
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:27,377
and use it to buy
our lives back.

87
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:29,257
Yeah, what do you think
I've been trying to do?

88
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:38,921
Kahani walked Ardavan
into an ambush.

89
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:41,223
Clearly, he's no lawyer.

90
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:42,925
Maybe he's agency?

91
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:45,027
I've trawled the database,
I can't find anything.

92
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:48,198
Ardavan had something on them.

93
00:09:48,238 --> 00:09:50,566
We heard him talking to Kahani.

94
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:52,368
If we can find out what that is,

95
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:54,371
maybe we can use it as leverage.

96
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:56,138
And how do we do that?

97
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,148
What, so now
you do want my help?

98
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:26,435
Welcome back. How was London?

99
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:28,738
Old. And isolated.

100
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:30,640
Hey, what's going on
in Southern Lebanon?

101
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,959
My phone's been lighting up, but
I can't get anything concrete.

102
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:34,710
Some sort of explosion.
Looks like military.

103
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,545
- First activity in a while.
- Fatalities?

104
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:38,225
Local wedding.
We don't yet have a number.

105
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:41,617
It's too far north
for an Israeli incursion.

106
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:43,987
Hezbollah don't target
their own people.

107
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:45,454
Anyone taking responsibility?

108
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:46,823
That's the thing. No one.

109
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:49,559
The usual chatter,
it's all silent.

110
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:52,496
- You've been back, what...?
- Two minutes.

111
00:10:52,536 --> 00:10:54,296
And I'm not your first
port of call?

112
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:56,366
What the fuck's going on?

113
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,635
Was that us?

114
00:10:58,675 --> 00:11:01,545
Was... that us?

115
00:11:08,484 --> 00:11:10,146
I don't know.

116
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:11,948
I'm getting a lot of heat
on this.

117
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:13,891
Find out, and fast.

118
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,391
- Do you want me to...?
- Get the fuck out.

119
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:34,905
It's me.

120
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,614
We need to talk.

121
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,724
Was this you?

122
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:56,959
Answer me.

123
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:59,329
It was an accident.

124
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:00,963
You have got
to be fucking kidding me.

125
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:02,614
- The drone drifted off target.
- Drifted?

126
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,001
Do you have any idea how
difficult you have made my job?

127
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,902
It wasn't supposed
to happen this way.

128
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:08,387
Everything goes through me.
That is the deal.

129
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:09,805
That is the only way this works.

130
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:11,574
It won't happen again.

131
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:13,977
You're fucking right
it won't happen again.

132
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:15,545
We apologize.

133
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:19,355
That apology better have
a lot of zeros attached.

134
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:23,460
We need you
to take the fall on this one.

135
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:27,623
You are un-fucking-believable.

136
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,226
I get it.

137
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:31,001
You're pissed.

138
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,598
But watch your tone.

139
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:38,642
Ali Ardavan had intel
he can use against us.

140
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:41,377
Find it.

141
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:53,851
White's waiting
for a photo of my corpse.

142
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:55,694
What are you gonna tell him?

143
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:08,600
I've tracked Said to
the Hotel Excelsior in Sodeco.

144
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,769
It seems he's been praying
at the Al-Amin Mosque.

145
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:13,138
I'm gonna use Leyla
to lure him to a meet.

146
00:13:13,178 --> 00:13:15,681
- Is she playing ball?
- She is, with a little persuasion.

147
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:20,285
See for yourself.

148
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,725
The clock's ticking, Max.
Find Said.

149
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:35,205
Anna's not answering
any of my calls.

150
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,129
And that concerns me how?

151
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:39,237
I know you, George.
Have you got someone on her?

152
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:43,675
I need to know
my family is safe.

153
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:48,814
I need her to call me.

154
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:53,944
All right.

155
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:55,179
I'll see what I can do.

156
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:56,981
You do that.

157
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:59,650
By the way, Ali Ardavan's dead.

158
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,519
I picked it up
from local chatter.

159
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,095
And before you ask,
it was nothing to do with me.

160
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:10,729
Would have been less risky
to put a bullet in my head.

161
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:12,998
Yeah?

162
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:15,441
Give my son one more reason
to hate me?

163
00:14:24,482 --> 00:14:26,378
Think he bought it?

164
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:28,913
Gonna find out.

165
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,183
Why tell him about Ardavan?

166
00:14:31,223 --> 00:14:32,616
He was on your list.

167
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:34,553
Someone else got to him,

168
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:37,989
which means White isn't
as in control as he thinks.

169
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:39,957
Did Said come to Beirut?

170
00:14:39,997 --> 00:14:41,426
I doubt it. I'd be long gone.

171
00:14:41,466 --> 00:14:43,369
Yeah, I'm sure you would be.

172
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:46,204
Right.

173
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,809
The man saved my life.

174
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:54,213
And when I see him, I'll be sure
to tell him how grateful I am.

175
00:14:55,747 --> 00:14:57,625
Do you know where Ardavan
was staying in Beirut?

176
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,311
Les Palmiers apartments.

177
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:02,213
Okay, let's start there.

178
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:04,489
See if we can find out
what he had on Kahani.

179
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,763
This is useless.

180
00:15:51,803 --> 00:15:53,597
We don't know
what we're looking for.

181
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:56,742
Anyone got
any better suggestions?

182
00:16:03,448 --> 00:16:06,745
I've got White on the line.

183
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:09,413
Put him through.

184
00:16:09,453 --> 00:16:11,115
George, how can I help you?

185
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:13,717
Ali Ardavan was
my responsibility.

186
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:16,221
I received intelligence
that he was in Beirut,

187
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:17,889
and I took
the appropriate action.

188
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:19,490
Without informing me?

189
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,692
Last time I checked,
I didn't have to.

190
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,928
What happened to us
working together on this?

191
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:25,630
Ali Ardavan slipped through

192
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,165
your fingers once. I wasn't
about to take that risk again.

193
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:30,835
He is gonna fuck us
from beyond the grave.

194
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,279
Taken care of.

195
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:39,843
He made contact
with Habib Mansouri,

196
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:42,112
a political journalist
from An-Nahar.

197
00:16:42,152 --> 00:16:44,749
Ardavan kept an insurance
policy that would be passed on

198
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:47,751
to this journalist
in the event of his death.

199
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,520
My people are on it.

200
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,064
They're on their way
to his apartment as we speak.

201
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:15,588
There's someone
approaching Ardavan's apartment.

202
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:45,542
He's taken something
out of the cupboard.

203
00:17:45,582 --> 00:17:47,645
Red notebook,

204
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:49,381
left jacket pocket.

205
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:52,825
Shit!
There's someone else in there!

206
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,563
Man down. He's been hit.

207
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:05,870
He has the book.
He's taken the book.

208
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:57,174
You're lucky.

209
00:19:57,214 --> 00:19:58,843
They play together well.

210
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:01,546
Have they always been so close?

211
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:03,955
They've gotten closer
since you pulled a gun on them.

212
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:10,989
When are you going to tell me
what's really going on?

213
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:13,598
Just be patient.

214
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:19,230
Max will come through for you.

215
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,199
He loves you.

216
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:23,408
He's a father.

217
00:20:26,176 --> 00:20:28,579
I'm not a monster, Anna.

218
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:34,418
Anything else?

219
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:38,022
I need you to call him.

220
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:54,806
Yes?

221
00:20:57,742 --> 00:20:59,770
What?

222
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,205
The drone strike in Lebanon.

223
00:21:01,245 --> 00:21:03,348
- What about it?
- It was us.

224
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,612
It was an accident.

225
00:21:07,652 --> 00:21:09,413
Wrong coordinates were entered.

226
00:21:09,453 --> 00:21:11,088
Human error.

227
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,597
Jesus fucking Christ.

228
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,595
You're the face on this one.

229
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:26,038
Not me.

230
00:21:44,055 --> 00:21:45,817
You take full responsibility?

231
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:47,719
I do, sir. Personally.

232
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,086
Personally?

233
00:21:49,126 --> 00:21:52,129
It happened on my watch.

234
00:21:54,432 --> 00:21:57,127
The drone was almost
150 miles off target.

235
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:59,631
It was a coding error.

236
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:01,231
An error? Which led

237
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:03,934
to the loss of civilian lives

238
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:06,570
in a region

239
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,405
where there's already
considerable tension.

240
00:22:08,445 --> 00:22:10,407
If I may?

241
00:22:10,447 --> 00:22:13,010
Ms. Jones,

242
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,046
remind us,

243
00:22:15,086 --> 00:22:17,315
what were you actually
trying to hit?

244
00:22:17,355 --> 00:22:20,718
Rashid Kalfa,
number two in al-Qaeda in Syria.

245
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:23,362
We had firm intel
that he was in Qatana.

246
00:22:25,562 --> 00:22:28,826
Assassination by drone strike is
a factor in the war on terror.

247
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:30,961
It's the way we do business.

248
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:32,230
Overseen by this directorate.

249
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,514
We didn't oversee this bullshit.

250
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:34,999
How many terrorists have you

251
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,733
actually killed
in this endeavor?

252
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,936
- I don't have exact...
- Terrorists that have

253
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:40,837
actively plotted
against this country?

254
00:22:40,877 --> 00:22:43,308
We've made hundreds
of successful strikes.

255
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:45,710
And this...

256
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,813
is one of the rare occasions
where the system failed?

257
00:22:48,853 --> 00:22:50,048
Yes.

258
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:53,151
Does the senator have
a point to make?

259
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:55,686
Prague, 1945.

260
00:22:55,726 --> 00:22:59,190
Allied command were given
the order to bomb Dresden.

261
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,558
One U.S. squadron
drifted off course

262
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:04,628
and destroyed parts
of the Czech capital.

263
00:23:04,668 --> 00:23:06,964
What's the relevance
of the history lesson?

264
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:09,901
The mistake diminished
in significance

265
00:23:09,941 --> 00:23:12,336
due to the greatness
of the prize!

266
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:15,205
In the chaos of war,

267
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:17,748
civilians die.

268
00:23:37,335 --> 00:23:38,829
It's numbers.

269
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:40,397
This is what they killed
Ardavan for?

270
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:42,900
I never thanked you...
for pulling me out that car.

271
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,602
You mean for saving your life?

272
00:23:44,642 --> 00:23:47,004
- Yeah.
- No.

273
00:23:47,044 --> 00:23:49,740
You didn't thank me.

274
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,642
And for coming to find me
in Beirut.

275
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:53,810
Who said I came to find you?

276
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,253
Don't overplay your hand,
Clarke.

277
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,320
You okay?

278
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,963
Yeah.

279
00:24:15,405 --> 00:24:18,777
It's been a long time since
I walked in on you with a girl.

280
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,705
Looks like

281
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:24,375
- some sort of financial record.
- There is a name there.

282
00:24:24,415 --> 00:24:26,376
- Najmat Fiddia.
- That's a private gambling club.

283
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:29,180
Or it was when I was last here.

284
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,548
It used to move around
every month

285
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:32,115
to stay ahead
of the authorities.

286
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:35,153
That could be
a gambler's record.

287
00:24:35,193 --> 00:24:36,621
Professional gamblers

288
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:38,830
like to keep a-a diary.
Can I have a look?

289
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,325
And that's why they killed him?

290
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:43,294
- I don't know.
- So, we're going up

291
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:44,996
against White
with Ardavan's record

292
00:24:45,036 --> 00:24:47,198
- at blackjack.
- Why? You got a better idea?

293
00:24:47,238 --> 00:24:48,748
- Don't fucking patronize me.
- I'm not patronizing you.

294
00:24:48,772 --> 00:24:50,316
If you got a better idea,
I want to hear it.

295
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,985
Do you think that I can't work
this out on my own?

296
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:53,203
Do you think I need you?

297
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,838
You know,
you always were too proud.

298
00:24:54,878 --> 00:24:56,240
You're talking like you know me.

299
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,824
You don't know
the first thing about me.

300
00:24:57,848 --> 00:24:59,443
All you know

301
00:24:59,483 --> 00:25:01,527
is a locked bedroom door
and silence at the dinner table.

302
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:03,796
So, why don't you come and find
me when you've calmed down?

303
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,357
Look, he's gonna fuck off now.

304
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:11,396
You don't know the first thing
about me, either, pal.

305
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,325
Get out of my fucking way.

306
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:16,160
Right.

307
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,811
- What, are you gonna hit me?
- You think I haven't

308
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:19,045
thought about it since I was 15?

309
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:20,597
- Harry, calm down.
- Go on, hit me.

310
00:25:20,637 --> 00:25:22,006
Get it out of the way.

311
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:25,644
Go on. Hit me.

312
00:25:41,626 --> 00:25:44,355
Max? It's me.

313
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:46,431
Anna, are you okay?

314
00:25:48,432 --> 00:25:50,961
I'm fine.

315
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:52,736
I'm sorry I haven't called yet.

316
00:25:57,073 --> 00:25:58,876
It's been a little...

317
00:26:00,877 --> 00:26:03,039
Chloe passed her violin.

318
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,842
That's great.

319
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:07,644
That's great. Tell her...

320
00:26:07,684 --> 00:26:09,579
congratulations.

321
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:12,223
Tell her I'm proud of her.

322
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:14,551
How's Lola?

323
00:26:14,591 --> 00:26:15,952
She's fine.

324
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:18,562
She misses you.

325
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,833
I miss her, too.

326
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:25,563
Tell her that, will you?

327
00:26:25,603 --> 00:26:28,031
I will.

328
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:30,574
I'll tell her.

329
00:26:31,576 --> 00:26:34,504
When are you coming home?

330
00:26:34,544 --> 00:26:36,507
Soon.

331
00:26:36,547 --> 00:26:38,783
It's almost over.

332
00:26:41,985 --> 00:26:43,988
Come home, Max.

333
00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:47,425
Please come home.

334
00:26:51,127 --> 00:26:53,130
I will.

335
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:55,766
I love you.

336
00:26:57,934 --> 00:27:00,871
I love you back.

337
00:27:10,447 --> 00:27:12,483
You did well.

338
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:16,487
Fuck you.

339
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:24,989
Is she okay?

340
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:26,190
Her?

341
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,592
She's fine.

342
00:27:27,632 --> 00:27:29,794
And the girls?

343
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:31,836
They're fine, too.
Thanks for asking.

344
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:36,634
Right. Let's go and find this...

345
00:27:36,674 --> 00:27:38,903
Najmat Fiddia.

346
00:27:38,943 --> 00:27:40,371
See if we can find out

347
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:43,215
why the little red book's
worth killing for.

348
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:10,654
What's the latest?

349
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:12,321
I got a position
on the brother's phone.

350
00:28:12,361 --> 00:28:15,325
He picked up a burner
in Saint-Michel.

351
00:28:15,365 --> 00:28:16,893
We're on our way to pick him up.

352
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:19,361
Alive would be preferable.

353
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:54,103
He's around here.

354
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:37,414
Najmat Fiddia?

355
00:29:55,098 --> 00:29:56,760
Ahlan wa sahlan.

356
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Salaam alaikum.

357
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,896
You're looking for a table?

358
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,165
You're not an easy place
to find.

359
00:30:02,205 --> 00:30:05,034
Our players value their privacy.

360
00:30:05,074 --> 00:30:06,075
Players like Ali Ardavan.

361
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:08,938
I don't know that name.

362
00:30:08,978 --> 00:30:10,839
- I'm sorry.
- We have information

363
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:11,879
that says otherwise.

364
00:30:11,915 --> 00:30:13,124
Look, you don't want us
to make life

365
00:30:13,148 --> 00:30:14,918
more difficult for you.

366
00:30:20,689 --> 00:30:23,793
This is Ali Ardavan's journal.

367
00:30:24,793 --> 00:30:26,556
Would you take a look?

368
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:28,358
Then we'll go.

369
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:36,566
Gamblers keep record
of their games.

370
00:30:36,606 --> 00:30:38,835
Obsessed with numbers.

371
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:41,271
His game was roulette, he was

372
00:30:41,311 --> 00:30:43,639
trying to beat the odds.

373
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,576
A foolish hope but a compulsion.

374
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:48,719
Then look again.

375
00:30:49,785 --> 00:30:51,821
Something about it's
significant.

376
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,760
I don't know.
Maybe he was drunk or...

377
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:00,924
Or what?

378
00:31:00,964 --> 00:31:02,858
This page here is meaningless.

379
00:31:02,898 --> 00:31:06,402
The numbers in roulette
only go to 36.

380
00:31:28,425 --> 00:31:29,752
Can I have a word?

381
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:38,099
How are the girls doing?

382
00:31:42,138 --> 00:31:45,708
I hope your husband knows
just how strong you are.

383
00:31:47,676 --> 00:31:48,937
I have two boys.

384
00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:51,107
Arlo and Hayden.

385
00:31:51,147 --> 00:31:52,675
Hayden is the youngest one.

386
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:54,844
Headstrong like...

387
00:31:54,884 --> 00:31:58,080
- like his mother, just like...
- How can you handle it?

388
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,451
How can you be two people?

389
00:32:01,491 --> 00:32:05,387
A loving father and... this man?

390
00:32:05,427 --> 00:32:08,657
You're not asking about me.

391
00:32:08,697 --> 00:32:11,368
You're asking
about your husband.

392
00:32:12,836 --> 00:32:14,864
What sort of relationship
can two people have

393
00:32:14,904 --> 00:32:16,532
if they never speak...

394
00:32:16,572 --> 00:32:19,176
if they never speak the truth?

395
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:22,571
The truth?

396
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:25,241
I'm protecting my boys.

397
00:32:25,281 --> 00:32:27,618
Maybe Max was protecting you.

398
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,117
We found your brother's phone.

399
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:37,252
Three miles up
toward Saint-Michael.

400
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:39,155
He was writing
a text message for you.

401
00:32:39,195 --> 00:32:41,657
Only got as far
as three words...

402
00:32:41,697 --> 00:32:43,900
"le château fort."

403
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:47,530
Does it mean anything to you?

404
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,573
- Le château fort?
- No.

405
00:32:54,577 --> 00:32:57,240
We will find him.

406
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,242
You know that.

407
00:33:00,282 --> 00:33:03,480
It's better for you
if you help us.

408
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,082
I don't know
what he's talking about.

409
00:33:07,122 --> 00:33:09,125
Honestly.

410
00:33:42,157 --> 00:33:45,254
Good afternoon.

411
00:33:45,294 --> 00:33:47,456
At 0500 yesterday,

412
00:33:47,496 --> 00:33:49,125
Eastern Standard Time,

413
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:51,094
there was an explosion
in the village of Aaqbiye,

414
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:53,762
Southern Lebanon.

415
00:33:53,802 --> 00:33:56,598
22 men, women and children
were killed,

416
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:59,376
all Lebanese nationals.

417
00:34:00,376 --> 00:34:02,871
The explosion was the result

418
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:04,773
of computer error.

419
00:34:04,813 --> 00:34:08,043
A U.S. military drone drifted

420
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:09,179
tragically off course.

421
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:11,114
I must stress

422
00:34:11,154 --> 00:34:14,183
that the accident was caused
by machine failure,

423
00:34:14,223 --> 00:34:17,160
not human miscalculation.

424
00:34:19,194 --> 00:34:20,723
The U.S. government

425
00:34:20,763 --> 00:34:24,194
bitterly regrets this tragedy

426
00:34:24,234 --> 00:34:27,963
and is in consultation
with Lebanese authorities.

427
00:34:28,003 --> 00:34:30,567
Thank you.

428
00:35:04,306 --> 00:35:06,310
Shh.

429
00:35:35,003 --> 00:35:36,933
I'll take that up to her.

430
00:35:36,973 --> 00:35:39,534
Thank you.

431
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:52,375
Daniel!

432
00:36:52,415 --> 00:36:54,177
Come on!

433
00:36:54,217 --> 00:36:55,485
Get the dogs!

434
00:37:20,942 --> 00:37:24,480
Maman, ils arrivent!

435
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,092
Non.

436
00:37:43,132 --> 00:37:46,061
Non!

437
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:49,806
Non, non! Non. Non.

438
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:08,185
Rache?

439
00:39:09,217 --> 00:39:11,913
You've decorated.

440
00:39:11,953 --> 00:39:15,650
But then been a while
since I came round.

441
00:39:20,957 --> 00:39:24,520
You've come all this way
just to see me?

442
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,256
- I'm very flattered.
- Where else did you expect me to go?

443
00:39:27,296 --> 00:39:29,859
Nowhere to run? Nowhere to hide?

444
00:39:29,899 --> 00:39:31,602
Isn't that a song?

445
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:34,698
Security's three minutes away.

446
00:39:34,738 --> 00:39:36,281
- Presumably, you know that.
- Your heart

447
00:39:36,305 --> 00:39:37,882
would have stopped pumping blood
to your brain

448
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:39,586
before they even made it
to the front door.

449
00:39:40,776 --> 00:39:43,347
Well, at least
you've done your maths.

450
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:46,250
Sit.

451
00:40:15,511 --> 00:40:20,075
You know your Shakespeare,
do you, George?

452
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:22,379
You know Macbeth?

453
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:24,613
When he kills the children.

454
00:40:24,653 --> 00:40:28,218
Do you recall what the other
bloke swears to do to him?

455
00:40:28,258 --> 00:40:32,995
I don't get to the theater
as much as I'd like, so...

456
00:40:34,696 --> 00:40:37,993
What if it was your child that
had the kill order put on them?

457
00:40:39,435 --> 00:40:41,397
You really do want
your pound of flesh.

458
00:40:41,437 --> 00:40:43,799
They're not just names.

459
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,301
They're all someone's daughter,

460
00:40:46,341 --> 00:40:47,937
someone's son.

461
00:40:47,977 --> 00:40:50,939
Have you lost your nerve, Alex?

462
00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:53,343
I've seen it before,

463
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:55,412
in stronger men than you.

464
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:58,522
Why the order on Harry Clarke?

465
00:41:01,457 --> 00:41:03,426
You didn't go through with it.

466
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:08,198
That's why you're on the run.

467
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:17,200
7-1-3-9-5-0-

468
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,908
4-0-9.

469
00:41:29,017 --> 00:41:30,712
Nothing.

470
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,986
They put Ardavan in his coffin
for these numbers, okay?

471
00:41:38,026 --> 00:41:39,605
If they're so significant,
why write them

472
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:41,323
in a gambling journal?

473
00:41:41,363 --> 00:41:43,833
Best place to hide a tree
is in a forest.

474
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:48,438
Keep looking, keep trying.

475
00:41:51,006 --> 00:41:53,502
Why did you make me
take him to Tehran?

476
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:55,805
Harry?

477
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:58,348
Did you know
what was gonna happen?

478
00:41:59,381 --> 00:42:01,343
How could I?

479
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:03,345
I didn't know
he was playing both sides.

480
00:42:03,385 --> 00:42:05,582
You really believe that?

481
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:08,725
I believe it
because it's the truth.

482
00:42:10,459 --> 00:42:12,522
What are you covering up,
George?

483
00:42:12,562 --> 00:42:15,491
Alex, you're tired.

484
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:17,894
- You should get some sleep.
- I made him swear the oath.

485
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:19,294
I trained him up.

486
00:42:19,334 --> 00:42:21,296
I'm not just his friend,
his boss.

487
00:42:21,336 --> 00:42:23,600
I'm practically his father.

488
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,169
What did you think
I was going to do?

489
00:42:27,209 --> 00:42:28,805
Whatever your country asks
of you.

490
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:30,372
Isn't that the point?

491
00:42:30,412 --> 00:42:32,609
But it's not, is it?

492
00:42:32,649 --> 00:42:35,611
It's not for country.

493
00:42:35,651 --> 00:42:37,546
Not anymore.

494
00:42:37,586 --> 00:42:40,723
Then what is it for?

495
00:42:55,037 --> 00:42:58,040
I didn't come for retribution.

496
00:43:01,044 --> 00:43:04,607
I just came to tell you...

497
00:43:04,647 --> 00:43:08,151
you carry on living
in this world that you've built.

498
00:43:10,586 --> 00:43:13,055
But I don't care to.

499
00:43:38,347 --> 00:43:40,510
Still nothing.

500
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,452
What if they're coordinates?

501
00:43:50,426 --> 00:43:54,031
It's coordinates for Aaqbiye,
Southern Lebanon.

502
00:44:02,372 --> 00:44:04,334
Wait a minute, go back.

503
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,872
There.

504
00:44:09,912 --> 00:44:11,473
Play it.

505
00:44:11,513 --> 00:44:15,011
At 0500 yesterday,
Eastern Standard Time,

506
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:17,145
there was an explosion
in the village

507
00:44:17,185 --> 00:44:19,281
of Aaqbiye, Southern Lebanon.

508
00:44:19,321 --> 00:44:21,683
22 men, women and children

509
00:44:21,723 --> 00:44:24,486
were killed,
all Lebanese nationals.

510
00:44:24,526 --> 00:44:26,522
The bodies of the victims

511
00:44:26,562 --> 00:44:28,957
lie at the site
where the drone struck.

512
00:44:28,997 --> 00:44:32,861
Men and women, whole families
with children at their side.

513
00:44:32,901 --> 00:44:34,731
Limbs are missing,

514
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:37,640
faces are contorted
by shrapnel and pain.

515
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,609
They're coordinates
of the drone attack.

516
00:44:47,649 --> 00:44:51,113
Ardavan knew the coordinates
of the site before it happened.

517
00:44:51,153 --> 00:44:53,515
That's what he had on them.

518
00:44:53,555 --> 00:44:55,084
He was using it against them.

519
00:44:55,124 --> 00:44:56,785
That the accident was caused

520
00:44:56,825 --> 00:44:58,754
by machine failure

521
00:44:58,794 --> 00:45:00,731
not human miscalculation.

522
00:45:06,169 --> 00:45:08,131
This was no fucking accident.

523
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:09,866
The U.S. government

524
00:45:09,906 --> 00:45:12,734
bitterly regrets this tragedy

525
00:45:12,774 --> 00:45:16,471
and is in consultation
with Lebanese authorities.

526
00:45:16,511 --> 00:45:18,274
Thank you.

527
00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:25,588
I'm sorry, Alex. I'm very sorry.

528
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:29,352
But I'm not an automaton.

529
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:31,587
Can we just please...

530
00:45:31,627 --> 00:45:34,156
Can we just wind the clock back?

531
00:45:34,196 --> 00:45:35,725
I disobeyed a kill order.

532
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:37,093
I know what happens.

533
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:38,560
I'm section chief, Alex.

534
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,763
But more than that,
I'm your friend.

535
00:45:40,803 --> 00:45:44,007
I write the rules.

536
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,171
Stay for a drink.

537
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:50,205
I'll open a bottle,

538
00:45:50,245 --> 00:45:53,249
and we can rewrite
the damn things together.

539
00:45:58,821 --> 00:46:01,425
I've got something
I think you'll like.

540
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,211
We need to talk
about what happened in Tehran.

541
00:46:23,613 --> 00:46:26,676
Does Max know
Harry's still alive?

542
00:46:26,716 --> 00:46:29,479
Max? Why would Max

543
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:31,113
think that Harry is...

544
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,642
You let me leave.

545
00:47:28,644 --> 00:47:30,872
You followed me.

546
00:47:30,912 --> 00:47:33,408
Get the girls.

547
00:47:35,984 --> 00:47:37,412
Come on!

548
00:47:39,055 --> 00:47:41,616
- Maman!
- Maman!

549
00:47:48,231 --> 00:47:50,526
Yeah?

550
00:47:50,566 --> 00:47:52,528
You've gone
a little quiet on me.

551
00:47:52,568 --> 00:47:54,296
George.

552
00:47:54,336 --> 00:47:55,564
I've been busy.

553
00:47:55,604 --> 00:47:57,265
Care to share?

554
00:47:57,305 --> 00:47:59,868
Seems the tip about
the Al-Amin Mosque paid off.

555
00:47:59,908 --> 00:48:02,571
- Are you sure?
- Said's been praying there.

556
00:48:02,611 --> 00:48:04,473
I need you to be sure.

557
00:48:04,513 --> 00:48:07,751
Time is running out for those
little girls of yours, Max.

558
00:48:09,752 --> 00:48:12,556
He's in a cafe
across the street.

559
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:15,859
I'm looking at him right now.

560
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:18,888
Good.

561
00:48:18,928 --> 00:48:21,457
Then let's take the appropriate
action, then, shall we?

562
00:48:21,497 --> 00:48:22,859
Sure.

563
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:39,868
Subtitles by explosiveskull.

564
00:48:39,954 --> 00:48:41,832
We found an intelligence source.

565
00:48:42,162 --> 00:48:44,139
Ashkan Davoud, a scientist

566
00:48:44,179 --> 00:48:46,450
with detailed knowledge
of what we believe to be.

567
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,364
Tehran's reactivated program.

568
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:49,979
There is no such program.

569
00:48:50,018 --> 00:48:51,058
Max is off the leash.

570
00:48:53,614 --> 00:48:55,448
We are going to have to flush him out.

571
00:48:55,487 --> 00:48:57,025
How long are we going to stay here?

572
00:48:57,064 --> 00:48:58,963
Listen,
if you harm one hair on their heads,

573
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:02,280
- I swear to God...
- You'll what, Max? You'll...

574
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,319
what?

575
00:49:04,305 --> 00:49:10,436

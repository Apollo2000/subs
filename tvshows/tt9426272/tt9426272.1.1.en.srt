00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,391
-It is a terrible thing
to lose a child.
-Ah, yeah.

360
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,393
May I ask how she passed?

361
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:07,567
That is not
for your ledger, Hamish.

362
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:09,949
Yes.

363
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:11,813
Forgive me.

364
00:22:11,882 --> 00:22:14,747
We would like
to see our rooms now.

365
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:21,892
Tell me, Monsieur Sel,

366
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:24,929
what is your impression
of New France?

367
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,968
[short chuckle]
So many trees.

368
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:34,180
It is the forest of the world.

369
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:37,666
No one has ever seen its end,
nor will they.

370
00:22:38,598 --> 00:22:41,360
You have not seen paradise

371
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:45,364
until you have lain eyes
on my Doma.

372
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:48,608
It is peaceful,

373
00:22:48,677 --> 00:22:51,473
open, unwalled.

374
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:54,787
Soon it will blot out Wobik.

375
00:23:00,448 --> 00:23:01,828
Come.

376
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:06,177
I do not wish
to be on this path

377
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:08,939
when night falls.

378
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:10,941
[rustling]

379
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,979
Shh.

380
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,948
Is it the beast?

381
00:23:18,017 --> 00:23:20,951
It is not the beast.

382
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,091
It is providence.

383
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:49,497
And so a spirit...

384
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:51,878
is born of the spirit
and flesh of flesh,

385
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:55,468
and so the kingdom of Satan...

386
00:23:55,537 --> 00:23:59,127
is accomplished in this world
and among all nations.

387
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:07,894
[chitters]

388
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:21,667
Behold.

389
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:32,263
HAMISH:
As a representative
of the Hudson'’s Bay Company,

390
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:35,335
I aim to discover the reason
for Mr. Cross'’ disappearance

391
00:24:35,404 --> 00:24:39,167
so that I may report back
and suggest a course of action.

392
00:24:39,236 --> 00:24:40,617
Now...

393
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:42,722
I'’ll have what you know
of the time here.

394
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:44,448
[short chuckle]

395
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:46,312
First...

396
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:49,902
another brandy
on the company'’s tab.

397
00:24:53,353 --> 00:24:56,391
It is cut with some base
and poisonous spirit.

398
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,670
Mm.
It agrees just fine.

399
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,571
Another.

400
00:25:09,128 --> 00:25:11,061
And a coin...

401
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,545
for my troubles.

402
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:31,633
Aye.

403
00:25:31,702 --> 00:25:34,636
I remember your man,

404
00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:37,846
poking about for the company,
as your type do.

405
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:39,641
He felt strongly of the need

406
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,678
that we should expand
our operation here.

407
00:25:41,747 --> 00:25:45,233
Long way from the bay
to be expanding.

408
00:25:45,302 --> 00:25:48,339
You are in New France,
Mr. Goames.

409
00:25:48,408 --> 00:25:50,169
It'’s bad enough
the English have been allowed

410
00:25:50,238 --> 00:25:52,171
to creep north along
with the Iroquois.

411
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,139
But soon,
the peace will be broken,

412
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:57,625
and the English
and French will go back

413
00:25:57,694 --> 00:26:00,489
to the way
things have always been.

414
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,010
Throat slitting,
lies and land grabs.

415
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,600
As you may well know,
one does not prosper

416
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:10,258
to empire with timid strokes,
Captain.

417
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:12,571
I keep my distance from empire.

418
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,711
That is for others to sort.

419
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,472
I serve the king

420
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,784
and keep the peace

421
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:20,958
in Wobik for Intendant De Fer.

422
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:23,064
Then we will speak
to Intendant De Fer.

423
00:26:23,133 --> 00:26:24,341
[laughs]

424
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,861
He prefers to spend his time
in Quebec.

425
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,310
[laughs]

426
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,693
It is my job
to speak to English scum.

427
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:37,941
Now, who might you serve,
Mr. Goames?

428
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:46,915
The truth, Captain.

429
00:26:46,984 --> 00:26:50,781
We were told of
the recent tragedy west of town.

430
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,301
The settlers burnt out,
killed by Iroquois.

431
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,029
We saw the bodies
on display by the docks.

432
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:01,620
It was a small raiding party.
The rest ran off.

433
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:05,037
You should know the Iroquois
always collect their dead.

434
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:07,936
And you should know
better than most

435
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:11,630
that the Iroquois
have animal hearts...

436
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:14,771
that will pump
until the last drop leaves them,

437
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,911
and then their sons
will take up the cause

438
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,809
and pray to their wicked god

439
00:27:18,878 --> 00:27:20,984
that death finds you.

440
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:22,917
Now,

441
00:27:22,986 --> 00:27:25,920
that is some witchcraft
I wish to avoid.

442
00:27:25,989 --> 00:27:27,853
[laughs]

443
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:30,441
We have the Iroquois
well-managed.

444
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:34,618
[laughing]

445
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:36,275
Managed?

446
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:38,657
There is no managing
the Iroquois.

447
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:40,762
They outnumber you 40 to one.

448
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:43,144
YVON:
Silent as deer.

449
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:46,768
You can'’t tell them apart
from the trees.

450
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:48,149
Seen one gut a trapper

451
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:50,841
with nothing more
than a flint knife.

452
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,016
Baby on her back, too.

453
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:58,746
God will not judge me
for hanging those savages!

454
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:02,922
Go! Go see for yourself
what they have done.

455
00:28:04,337 --> 00:28:06,098
Was Cross there?

456
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:08,100
[scoffs]
Hey, he could be anywhere.

457
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:10,274
Then we will have a look,
Captain.

458
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:14,382
The woods are filled
with the bones

459
00:28:14,451 --> 00:28:16,936
of men like you, Mr. Goames.

460
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:22,355
The sooner you find your way
out of Wobik, the better.

461
00:28:23,598 --> 00:28:25,289
COOKE:
Captain?

462
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:32,676
-Elisha Cooke.
-Hamish Goames.

463
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:35,783
BOUCHARD:
Mr. Goames has come to town
looking for

464
00:28:35,852 --> 00:28:37,163
the Hudson Bay agent
who went missing.

465
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:39,303
Randall Cross was his name.

466
00:28:41,202 --> 00:28:44,377
The company sent you all the way
out here to find him?

467
00:28:44,446 --> 00:28:47,311
They did.

468
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,556
Perhaps his absence
is merely discretion.

469
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,903
These are French territories.

470
00:28:52,972 --> 00:28:55,216
A fact that I am
reminded of every day.

471
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:57,874
Mr. Cooke is the barrel king
of Wobik.

472
00:28:57,943 --> 00:29:01,256
You don'’t want to enter into
trade with him, that'’s for sure.

473
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:03,258
Did you happen
to meet Randall Cross?

474
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,814
Might I just say what a relief
it is to hear your voice?

475
00:29:06,883 --> 00:29:08,885
Uh, it is so good...

476
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:11,059
to have another Englishman
in town.

477
00:29:11,128 --> 00:29:12,820
I was born in Kirkwall.

478
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:16,755
E-Even so, our numbers swell.

479
00:29:16,824 --> 00:29:18,273
BOUCHARD:
Hey!

480
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:20,724
Were it not for your late
French wife and barrels,

481
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:24,107
you'’d be outside the gate
fending for yourself, Cooke.

482
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:27,075
I'’d ask you to join us
for a drink, but... [laughs]

483
00:29:27,144 --> 00:29:29,768
I don'’t want to be seen
with so many English.

484
00:29:29,837 --> 00:29:31,770
No.

485
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,944
It would not be wise for you.

486
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:37,983
Mr. Goames.
Friend.

487
00:29:39,743 --> 00:29:41,918
[footsteps departing]

488
00:29:43,126 --> 00:29:45,404
-[door opens]
-[bell jingles]

489
00:29:45,473 --> 00:29:46,992
HAMISH:
Mmm.

490
00:29:47,061 --> 00:29:48,994
-The crust.
-[door closes]

491
00:29:49,063 --> 00:29:50,581
It'’s exceptional.

492
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,307
Try some, Yvon.

493
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:58,210
Prunes don'’t agree.

494
00:30:02,697 --> 00:30:04,803
Good day, Mr. Goames.

495
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,288
[footsteps departing]

496
00:30:07,357 --> 00:30:08,703
[door opens]

497
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:11,016
[indistinct chatter in distance]

498
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,642
I won'’t take my dress off.

499
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:19,472
Not for her or anyone else.

500
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,716
You will for your husband.

501
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:23,891
It will be good practice
for you.

502
00:30:27,273 --> 00:30:30,345
What sort of husband
are you hoping for, Delphine?

503
00:30:33,797 --> 00:30:37,214
Kind.
And, uh,

504
00:30:37,283 --> 00:30:39,216
generous.

505
00:30:39,285 --> 00:30:41,667
And you?

506
00:30:41,736 --> 00:30:43,669
Rich.

507
00:30:43,738 --> 00:30:46,534
With a well-appointed house,
which I will run.

508
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:53,679
But first, we must brave

509
00:30:53,748 --> 00:30:56,371
the long, bony fingers
of Mother Sabrine.

510
00:30:57,752 --> 00:31:00,479
Pray that she doesn'’t
pop it herself.

511
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:08,349
Come in, ma petite.

512
00:31:19,222 --> 00:31:20,671
SABRINE:
Lie down.

513
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:27,368
Lay back.

514
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:33,098
[sighs]

515
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:35,272
Pray, if you like.

516
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:39,242
Then think about
your fine husband

517
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:42,279
and the fine land
you will share with him.

518
00:31:42,348 --> 00:31:44,385
[sighs]

519
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:46,974
[gasps, sighs]

520
00:31:49,528 --> 00:31:51,564
Is something wrong?

521
00:31:53,635 --> 00:31:55,568
Was the child born alive?

522
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,745
What child?

523
00:31:59,814 --> 00:32:01,574
It is a sin to lie.

524
00:32:01,643 --> 00:32:04,336
Do you think
you are the first girl

525
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:07,511
to come to me with a secret?

526
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,582
I have seen...

527
00:32:09,651 --> 00:32:11,895
everything, my dear.

528
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:14,691
Now tell me.

529
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,245
Yes, Mother, there was a child.

530
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:20,731
Did the child survive?

531
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:29,154
Please don'’t send me back.
I was young,

532
00:32:29,223 --> 00:32:31,432
and I wish only
to grow New France.

533
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:33,710
I promise to be a good wife.

534
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,248
Lamb'’s blood.

535
00:32:54,317 --> 00:32:56,871
On your wedding night,

536
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,668
sprinkle this on the bedsheet.

537
00:33:00,737 --> 00:33:02,670
Tell no one.

538
00:33:06,536 --> 00:33:08,469
Yes, Mother.

539
00:33:15,648 --> 00:33:18,134
My Doma!

540
00:33:30,422 --> 00:33:34,253
[sing-songy]:
Mari, Mari,

541
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:37,912
dame jolie--

542
00:33:37,981 --> 00:33:41,019
the men are here.

543
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:43,124
Hey, Theo.

544
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:46,058
Only God points.

545
00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:49,061
Now, where is God?

546
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,994
-Where were you?
-A trip to town

547
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:53,100
for the men
who will help us build the Doma.

548
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:54,963
Mm.

549
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,965
[sniffs]

550
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,795
Mm.

551
00:33:58,864 --> 00:34:00,314
Is that all you did?

552
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:03,317
I have not spilled seed.

553
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:07,079
Now, I brought a quill pig
and a fine black ram.

554
00:34:07,148 --> 00:34:09,495
-[laughs]
-That is not a gift.

555
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:12,533
I have another special something

556
00:34:12,602 --> 00:34:14,673
I will bestow on you tonight.

557
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:16,675
Mm.

558
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:20,368
What is your name?

559
00:34:20,437 --> 00:34:22,301
Rene Sel.

560
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,787
The weak one-- he will help you
butcher the ram.

561
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,410
I don'’t need help.

562
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:30,137
You will show him
and you will be pleasant.

563
00:34:30,206 --> 00:34:32,035
He is a stranger to the knife.

564
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:34,002
No!

565
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,384
He sees you pointing
with your stick.

566
00:34:36,453 --> 00:34:39,732
Well, he will learn
without pointing.

567
00:34:44,565 --> 00:34:47,430
You.
Come with me.

568
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:56,301
Have you never
seen an Indian before?

569
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,854
Not alive, sir.

570
00:34:57,923 --> 00:34:59,338
Well, her blood is split.

571
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:01,858
She is Wendat and French
from her father.

572
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:05,068
We will expand your knowledge
of their kingdoms,

573
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:08,140
but first, you must learn

574
00:35:08,209 --> 00:35:11,109
the paths of my Doma.

575
00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:12,938
Always stay on the path.

576
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:15,458
I have cut them
to conform to the grand pattern.

577
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:17,218
Do you know
of the grand pattern?

578
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:19,807
-No, sir.
-It will be made clear.

579
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:21,809
But if you look,

580
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:23,845
it is all around.

581
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:25,502
I will stay on the paths.

582
00:35:25,571 --> 00:35:27,055
And do not cross the bog.

583
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,713
There are things in there
you do not wish to meet.

584
00:35:29,782 --> 00:35:33,061
And stay away from the cabin
unless you are invited.

585
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,615
Do I have your word

586
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:37,065
you will convey these rules
to Monsieur Duquet?

587
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,067
Yes.

588
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,001
Do not deceive me, Monsieur Sel.

589
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,763
I can see through the trees

590
00:35:44,832 --> 00:35:46,937
and around the whole
of the land.

591
00:35:47,006 --> 00:35:49,526
And what I do not see
comes to me in dreams.

592
00:35:49,595 --> 00:35:51,321
I shall make it clear to Duquet.

593
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,911
Now, tell me,

594
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,707
what is the most
important thing?

595
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:03,057
Blood.
Family.

596
00:36:03,126 --> 00:36:05,301
I have no family.

597
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,303
Well, that'’s not possible.

598
00:36:07,372 --> 00:36:09,305
Just a brother,

599
00:36:09,374 --> 00:36:11,962
but he drowned under river ice.

600
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:14,758
Well, you must build another
here. Sow anew.

601
00:36:37,885 --> 00:36:40,128
Give me that knife.

602
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,338
You will cut your foot.

603
00:36:46,652 --> 00:36:48,930
I need a word with your father.

604
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,346
He is indisposed.

605
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:51,795
-[growls]
-[grunts]

606
00:36:54,488 --> 00:36:57,145
You should teach this boy
some manners.

607
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,218
Pointing a knife at a lady.

608
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:02,944
Is that true?

609
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,740
Huh? Out.

610
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:08,571
Out.
Everyone, out, out.

611
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,814
-[banging on table]
-Out! Out!

612
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:15,233
There is a man at the inn.

613
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:16,993
He is asking after Mr. Cross.

614
00:37:17,062 --> 00:37:19,375
His name is Mr. Hamish Goames.

615
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:21,480
In what manner is he asking?

616
00:37:21,549 --> 00:37:23,862
He'’s from
the Hudson'’s Bay Company.

617
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:28,004
Mr. Cooke has already met him.
What else?

618
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:30,489
And I have kept my ears open,
as you have asked.

619
00:37:30,558 --> 00:37:33,251
I don'’t know what you
and Mr. Cooke are up to,

620
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,598
nor do I care,
but I will have my payment now.

621
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:39,360
I have no money. It'’s all on
the table with a pair of queens.

622
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:41,811
Well, get a marker.

623
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:45,884
I will club your balls
into your belly.

624
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:49,370
-LAFARGE: Henri, away. Here.
-[coins clinking]

625
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:56,550
I won'’t be party to any crime.

626
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:58,276
There is nothing to worry about.

627
00:37:58,345 --> 00:38:00,588
Just tell me
where is this Mr. Goames.

628
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:04,212
He is searching west of town,

629
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,630
near where those poor families
were killed by the Iroquois.

630
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:10,288
He is not a man
to come at frontwise.

631
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:12,635
Go back to your inn...

632
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:16,017
and sit on that little husband
of yours.

633
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:19,538
We will be asking for a refund

634
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:21,022
for those tables
you built for us.

635
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:23,887
They are coarse
and poorly constructed.

636
00:38:23,956 --> 00:38:27,132
We will not
be taken advantage of.

637
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:29,307
[Lafarge chuckles]

638
00:38:35,451 --> 00:38:36,900
[gas hissing]

639
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:43,148
-This ram is not fit to eat.
-[scoffs]

640
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:44,632
It is fine.

641
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:47,186
There are good bits in all,
even this ram.

642
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:49,568
You will have to learn
how to make do here.

643
00:38:49,637 --> 00:38:52,295
Three years is a long time.

644
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:54,366
I will not serve three years.

645
00:38:54,435 --> 00:38:55,781
Mm.

646
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,473
Then you should have
never left France.

647
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:59,647
Here.
Give me the knife.

648
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:02,029
[sighs]

649
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:10,244
Go on.
Make the heaven cut.

650
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:12,419
I can'’t.

651
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:16,526
You will not survive here.

652
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:21,359
[gasps]

653
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:24,154
It is a sign of Strendu.

654
00:39:25,259 --> 00:39:26,536
Where did this come from?

655
00:39:28,055 --> 00:39:29,505
What is the matter?

656
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:39,894
What did you see?

657
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:43,139
Hurry.

658
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:46,384
HAMISH:
If Cross was at the scene
of the massacre, he'’s gone now.

659
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:47,833
YVON:
Maybe.

660
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,114
Would you like a poem
while the potatoes fry?

661
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:56,083
I will have to see
the settlement for myself.

662
00:39:59,086 --> 00:40:02,089
Then I shall give the trees
verse then.

663
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:10,269
"I feed a flame within,
which so torments me,

664
00:40:10,338 --> 00:40:13,928
"that it both pains my heart,
and yet contents me;

665
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:18,208
"'’tis such a pleasing smart,
and I so love it,

666
00:40:18,277 --> 00:40:22,005
"that I'’d rather die
than once remove it.

667
00:40:22,074 --> 00:40:25,940
"Yet he, for whom I grieve,
shall never know it,

668
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:30,669
"my tongue does not betray,
nor my eyes show it;

669
00:40:30,738 --> 00:40:34,673
"not a sigh,
nor a tear my pain discloses,

670
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:37,469
"but they fall silently,

671
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:40,610
like dew on roses."

672
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,336
TREPAGNY:
Give us this day

673
00:40:42,405 --> 00:40:44,890
our super substantial bread.

674
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:47,341
Remit our debts
and forgive our debtors.

675
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,103
Keep us from temptation
and free us from evil.

676
00:40:51,172 --> 00:40:52,726
For thine is the kingdom,

677
00:40:52,795 --> 00:40:55,522
the power and the glory,

678
00:40:55,591 --> 00:40:57,627
for ever and ever.
Amen.

679
00:40:57,696 --> 00:40:59,595
[quietly]:
Amen.

680
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:08,431
Perhaps Monsieur Sel
could pass...

681
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,020
the sel.

682
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:13,919
[chuckles softly]

683
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,995
Was the ram not fit
for the stew?

684
00:41:22,203 --> 00:41:24,205
Spoilt.

685
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:27,277
Through and through?

686
00:41:28,382 --> 00:41:31,489
MARI:
Yes, it was.

687
00:41:36,632 --> 00:41:38,357
Putrid, it was.

688
00:41:38,426 --> 00:41:40,290
And the hide?

689
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,192
Worms got to it.

690
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,713
A shame.

691
00:41:49,886 --> 00:41:52,751
It would have made nice hinges

692
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,166
for the cabin.

693
00:41:54,235 --> 00:41:56,859
We will see about the hide
tomorrow.

694
00:41:56,928 --> 00:42:00,863
One must not waste
what God has provided.

695
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:12,564
[singing indistinctly]

696
00:42:19,744 --> 00:42:21,539
She is beautiful.

697
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:26,474
Find yourself
an Indian wife then.

698
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,959
[sighs]

699
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:31,341
I will find a wife
back in Paris.

700
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,343
You can'’t leave.

701
00:42:33,412 --> 00:42:35,345
We'’re bound to our word.

702
00:42:37,278 --> 00:42:39,798
My word means nothing.

703
00:42:42,698 --> 00:42:45,114
Trepagny
will hold me responsible.

704
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:46,391
How can he?

705
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,013
There is nothing here for us,

706
00:42:48,082 --> 00:42:50,878
just trees and bugs
and dead things.

707
00:42:50,947 --> 00:42:54,261
We have been tricked
into serving a mad squatter.

708
00:42:56,712 --> 00:42:58,817
He will hunt you down
if you leave.

709
00:43:02,441 --> 00:43:05,617
Then we shall make a game of it.

710
00:43:16,145 --> 00:43:17,664
[grunts]

711
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:31,367
Can you hear it?

712
00:43:33,438 --> 00:43:35,820
God in the whirlwind.

713
00:43:37,718 --> 00:43:41,135
He can feel us
trampling his kingdom.

714
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:42,550
In the waste,

715
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,795

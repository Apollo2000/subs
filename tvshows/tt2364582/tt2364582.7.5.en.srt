Previously on Marvel's
"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,005
I have orders to kill him.

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:06,207
Put the gun down now! That's an order.

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:09,010
The kid we let live in 1931

5
00:00:09,012 --> 00:00:11,946
had come back to haunt us in 1955.

6
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:16,017
I think S.H.I.E.L.D. has
been infiltrated by Hydra.

7
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:17,121
Say hello to Howard.

8
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:18,211
You were shot

9
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:20,054
after delivering that gadget.

10
00:00:20,056 --> 00:00:21,829
I'm not dead.

11
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:23,464
We didn't change history. We just...

12
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:25,000
faked your death.

13
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:28,102
Job is done.

14
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:29,608
No more prying eyes.

15
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,823
You're alive, but to
anyone not on this plane,

16
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:33,073
you were killed at that hotel.

17
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,808
Here we go.

18
00:00:36,646 --> 00:00:39,613
Let me guess... we're
not in 1955 anymore.

19
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:40,814
Nope.

20
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:43,150
I have been left behind to help you.

21
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:45,786
S.H.I.E.L.D. will destroy
all you have built.

22
00:00:45,788 --> 00:00:47,921
- It is time to prevent that.
- How?

23
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,659
By doing exactly what I say.

Now, this is the
New York City I remember.

37
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:57,825
The honking, the smell of hot dog water.

38
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,059
And these are the clothes

39
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:00,894
the grown-ups wore when we were kids,

40
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:03,330
am I right?

41
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,899
Still not gonna give me anything, huh?

42
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:08,569
Even copping attitude
would be a warm relief.

43
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:10,103
Hard to care about where we stand

44
00:02:10,105 --> 00:02:11,772
when the only emotions I have

45
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:13,707
are the ones other people pass to me.

46
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:14,908
Oh!

47
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,076
Like this guy here,

48
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:18,446
who's feeling ticked off and impatient!

49
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,050
Well, that's good that you're learning

50
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:24,751
to label and communicate them.

51
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:26,387
That's good. Very healthy.

52
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:28,555
Now that feeling's extended to you.

53
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:42,035
- Hey, looking sharp.
- _

54
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,737
Thanks.

55
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:44,872
Where's Agent Sousa?

56
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:46,507
He's still inside,
picking out his threads.

57
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:48,175
How's he handling the transition?

58
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:51,406
Honestly, the fact that he's not
projectile vomiting from the shock

59
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:52,708
is a miracle.

60
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,917
What happened to blending in?

61
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:00,220
I just don't understand the
functional appeal of those...

62
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,356
elephant... pants.

63
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:04,602
- You mean the bell-bottoms?
- Sure.

64
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:05,970
How do people in your time

65
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:08,773
function with all the extra
fabric around their feet?

66
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:09,974
I got news for you.

67
00:03:09,976 --> 00:03:11,442
This isn't actually our time period.

68
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:12,578
Well, fortunately,

69
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,379
there's unfashionable
squares in every decade,

70
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,248
so you are... set.

71
00:03:18,518 --> 00:03:20,985
And nobody seems to
look you in the eye now.

72
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:23,955
Hmm. Wait 'til they all get cellphones.

73
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:25,189
So, I was thinking,

74
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:27,792
how do you guys know I was
supposed to die in 1955?

75
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:29,227
It's in the history books.

76
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:30,495
Yeah, but...

77
00:03:30,497 --> 00:03:32,730
but what if you always
plucked me out of time?

78
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:34,165
Does that mean I always survive?

79
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:36,200
And if we end up in your present,

80
00:03:36,202 --> 00:03:37,869
will we even be in the same timeline?

81
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:40,171
I'd stop thinking about it.
Your brains will spill out.

82
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:41,973
Simmons can explain... sort of...

83
00:03:41,975 --> 00:03:43,940
but maybe you'd feel more comfortable

84
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:45,176
staying back on Zephyr One.

85
00:03:45,178 --> 00:03:46,411
No. No, no, no.

86
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:48,046
I'm here. No going back.

87
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:51,883
Might as well dive in
and embrace the 1970s.

88
00:03:51,885 --> 00:03:54,218
♪ Freaky deak, freaky deak ♪

90
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:02,627
I can't believe this old
hideout is still running.

91
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,762
Did you ever stop by back in the day?

92
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:05,930
Once or twice.

93
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:07,832
Only the top brass knew about it.

94
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,233
Good place to lie low.

95
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:10,368
Oh, yeah?

96
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,370
I wish I could've seen it back then.

97
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:14,238
I heard Dooley had a reserved booth

98
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,973
with one of those plaque
things next to it...

99
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:18,910
Okay, Dad, let's not keep
Enoch waiting any longer.

100
00:04:18,912 --> 00:04:21,312
He's been chilling

104
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,316

Sometimes you punch the bag,

111
00:05:24,177 --> 00:05:27,945
sometimes the bag punches
you, am I right?

112
00:05:27,947 --> 00:05:29,247
I get that Mack wants me to do

113
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:30,982
combat training before
I return to the field,

114
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:33,684
but seriously, I got kidnapped
by a Hydra boss one time.

115
00:05:33,686 --> 00:05:35,953
I don't think Freddy will
be bothering you anymore,

116
00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:38,723
considering his funeral
was three years ago.

117
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:40,344
Good riddance.

118
00:05:40,346 --> 00:05:41,746
Not that I was...

119
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:44,348
rooting for his death, but kinda.

120
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:48,320
Did you hear anything from Bobo?

121
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:53,324
Bobo...

122
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:55,425
or grandpappy,

123
00:05:55,427 --> 00:05:56,694
whatever you want to call him.

124
00:05:56,696 --> 00:05:59,464
Oh, Fitz. No, I haven't heard.

125
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,933
But, um, even if I had,
I couldn't disclose...

126
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:03,334
Right, because the Chronicoms

127
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:05,203
will probe our brains
and blah, blah, blah,

128
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:07,739
and it's very dangerous,
no one can know... I get it.

129
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:09,407
We'll be reunited soon.

130
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:11,008
Well, I hope so.

131
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,978
Because if you and Fitz don't...

132
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:18,217
bump lemons... so to speak...

133
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:23,087
You know, my mom is
never going to exist,

134
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:25,556
and then I won't be born...

135
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:27,091
again.

136
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:29,293
I think.

137
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:32,063
But, honestly, I've made
so many mistakes in my life,

138
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:34,098
I wouldn't mind a chance
at a little do-over.

139
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,400
Wouldn't it be easier
to prevent the mistakes

140
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:38,636
through, say, preparation?

141
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:44,142
Taking the hint.

142
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:45,576
Letting you get back to work.

143
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:48,412
Bye, Nana.

144
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,024
Looks like it always did.

145
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:35,459
A good place to hole up.

146
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:37,628
Any year, right?

147
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,297
Happy now?

148
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:40,865
Not yet.

149
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:42,099
History says S.H.I.E.L.D.

150
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:44,902
abandoned this place in '72, but...

151
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:46,871
You had to see it for yourself.

152
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:49,507
Yeah.

153
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,211
I like the simple pleasures in life...

154
00:07:53,213 --> 00:07:55,513
a preserved timeline,

155
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:58,083
an empty base, and good company.

156
00:08:00,787 --> 00:08:03,455
Recon isn't the only
reason why we're here.

157
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:06,991
- You're for real?
- Yeah.

158
00:08:06,993 --> 00:08:09,493
I'm for real.

159
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:11,128
We left the plane alone.

160
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,165
In, uh... In my book,

161
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:17,568
that constitutes as a date night.

162
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,671
I was wondering why you brought me here.

163
00:08:20,673 --> 00:08:23,407
I'm hardly even fit for recon.

164
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:25,543
What if we run into complications, Mack?

165
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:27,511
You're damn fine at what you do,

166
00:08:27,513 --> 00:08:28,880
with or without your powers.

167
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:30,081
They don't define you.

168
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,550
Then why do you call me Yo-Yo?

169
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:34,218
'Cause you always bounce back.

170
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:11,690
Something's different.

171
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:32,944
Ohh. Okay.

172
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:35,613
Glad you're enjoying yourself.

173
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:38,916
Any word on Enoch?

174
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:41,619
Oh, uh, negative.

175
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:44,021
Um, you know, I'm worried

176
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:46,223
that it's more serious than we think.

177
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:48,526
Also, I might be drunk.

178
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:49,593
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

179
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:50,761
I think you might have discovered

180
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:53,531
- a new form of Contact High.
- Hmm.

181
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,032
They're all three sheets to the wind.

182
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:57,802
I'm at least one sheet to the wind.

183
00:09:57,804 --> 00:09:58,970
Give me a moment.

184
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,575
I talked to the staff,

185
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:07,979
and, uh, they haven't
seen Enoch in at least...

186
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:09,780
over a year.

187
00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:17,621
I'm better now.

188
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,792
Good to know S.H.I.E.L.D.
is going strong.

189
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:23,794
Just wish I knew what
they were celebrating.

190
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:26,598
Whatever it is, it seems
to be centered on him.

191
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,071
No. Is that...

192
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:35,639
Little Ricky?

193
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:39,043
If by Little Ricky you mean
General Rick Stoner, then yes.

194
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:41,645
He's top brass at
S.H.I.E.L.D. You knew him?

195
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:43,180
Yeah.

196
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:44,849
I remember when he was an enlistee.

197
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:47,718
Poor kid couldn't
tell a mag from a clip.

198
00:10:49,322 --> 00:10:51,555
Alright, thank you.
Thank you for coming.

199
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:53,324
Ladies and gentlemen,

200
00:10:53,326 --> 00:10:57,695
I would like to thank all
of you for being here today.

201
00:10:57,697 --> 00:11:00,765
I know that you are all excited

202
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:05,036
to, uh, kick off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
next phase in global security.

203
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:08,172
So please welcome the man responsible,

204
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:10,841
my boss and our friend,

205
00:11:10,843 --> 00:11:12,576
Wilfred Malick.

206
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:24,188
Freddy's still alive.

207
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,556
Thanks, General.

208
00:11:25,558 --> 00:11:26,924
So good to be here.

209
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:29,527
I got my start working
in this gin joint,

210
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:31,629
long before it was a S.H.I.E.L.D. asset.

211
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:33,798
Look how far we've come.

212
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,700
From hiding underground,
keeping vigilant watch,

213
00:11:36,702 --> 00:11:38,602
to having eyes in the sky,

214
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:41,872
ensuring the Earth's safety.

215
00:11:41,874 --> 00:11:46,210
Using targeting satellites
and pinpoint laser telemetry,

216
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:48,813
S.H.I.E.L.D. will now be
able to neutralize hostiles

217
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:52,316
anywhere in the world
before they pose a threat.

218
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:53,717
This sound familiar to you?

219
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:55,219
Yeah.

220
00:11:55,221 --> 00:11:57,755
Sounds like Hydra's 40
years ahead of schedule.

221
00:11:57,757 --> 00:11:59,223
I present to you...

222
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:01,058
Project Insight.

223
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:18,271
So, these folks are secretly squids.

224
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:20,440
No, just a few at the top are Hydra.

225
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:22,775
Most are loyal S.H.I.E.L.D.,
like Stoner.

226
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:25,645
Seems to me the joint is still
pretty jazzed about Insight.

227
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:27,613
They think it'll keep the world safe.

228
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:29,849
Nobody figures it's a Hydra plot.

229
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:32,518
Same happened in my time.

230
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,655
So the past is doomed
to repeat the present.

231
00:12:35,657 --> 00:12:37,824
Any idea how Hydra got Insight so early?

232
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:40,426
I got a feeling it's the Chronicoms.

233
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:42,295
You sure, or is that
just a trout in the milk?

238
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:51,065
We call it circumstantial evidence,

239
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:53,773
so yes, but I like it.

240
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:56,009
The Chronicoms told me if
I didn't take their deal,

241
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:57,610
they'd alter the timeline.

242
00:12:57,612 --> 00:13:01,547
Keeping Malick alive past
1970 must be the first thread.

243
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:04,350
You're saying the
timeline is already broken.

244
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:06,018
So I died for nothing.

245
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,253
You look alive to me.

246
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:08,654
But maybe you should've left me.

247
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:10,623
I could've stopped Hydra back then.

248
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,125
No telling how that would've played out,

249
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:15,194
especially with the Chronicoms involved.

250
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:16,529
Looks like we have some work to do.

251
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:17,630
Let's make the rounds,

252
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:19,499
get some intel on Project Insight.

253
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:21,568
Keep an eye out for Enoch.

254
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:25,138
Oh, and one more thing.

255
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,806
Keep a low profile.

256
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:28,841
You're kind of famous
among S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

257
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:30,476
You get made, the jig is up.

258
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:33,346
Got it. I'll stay off the radar.

259
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:35,114
Is that a thing? Off the radar?

260
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:36,583

purchasing you an alcoholic beverage

265

would be a violation of HR guidelines.

266

However, uh, if you need assistance,

267

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,010
Long story, but apparently,

328
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:17,011
Freddy's son Nathaniel is still alive,

329
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:19,248
and he was also supposed to die in 1970.

330
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,283
Another change in the timeline.

331
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:23,252
- Get any intel?
- No.

332
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:26,422
But I did get a clue on
where we could find some.

333
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:27,823
Project Insight?

334
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:30,759
And Freddy Malick is responsible?

335
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:32,761
We suspect the
Chronicoms kept him alive,

336
00:16:32,763 --> 00:16:35,865
but we can't be sure 'til
we get ahold of Enoch.

337
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:37,566
And you still haven't found him yet?

338
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:38,734
We're looking.

339
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:39,935
I'm sure he'll turn up,

340
00:16:39,937 --> 00:16:41,770
and he knows how to contact us.

341
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:43,370
You know, if you have
his last whereabouts,

342
00:16:43,372 --> 00:16:45,107
I can take point on the search.

343
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:47,810
I appreciate your concern
for a 30,000-year-old robot,

344
00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:50,312
but Project Insight is our priority.

345
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:51,714
Copy that.

346
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:53,983
I'll see what I can
pull from radio chatter.

347
00:16:53,985 --> 00:16:56,118
- Good luck.
- You, too.

348
00:16:58,322 --> 00:17:00,155
Malick's still alive?

349
00:17:00,157 --> 00:17:01,990
So Daisy was right. I
should've taken him out.

350
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:03,592
It's not your fault.

351
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:05,628
You made the right call
to preserve the timeline.

352
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,074
No, to hell with the status quo.

353
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:08,597
Thousands of lives are at risk.

354
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,932
There's still time.

355
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:11,767
Insight hasn't even launched yet.

356
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:13,769
But Insight is just the
part that we know about.

357
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,471
The guy's had three extra years.

358
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:17,240
Who knows what else he's gotten into.

359
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,077
All of this looks different.

360
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:25,714
These guys have been busy.

361
00:17:25,716 --> 00:17:30,553
It looks like they're rerouting
power to something big.

362
00:17:30,555 --> 00:17:32,621
Probably nothing good.

363
00:17:32,623 --> 00:17:34,390
Let's take the Quinjet and get back.

364
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:35,824
What, are you worried?

365
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:37,860
It's still S.H.I.E.L.D.,
just an active base.

366
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:39,795
You saw the man in blue.

367
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:41,764
The Agent in the throwback uni?

368
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:44,833
Well, hell, I thought
he looked pretty tight.

369
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:46,869
You ever see a James Bond movie, Mack?

370
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:50,005
An underground base full
of men in jumpsuits...

371
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:52,007
always a bad deal.

372
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:09,659
See? Called it.

373
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:16,131
He mentioned a windowless office.

374
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,234
Malick must be using this space.

375
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:26,141
What, have you been here before?

376
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:27,743
A few days ago.

377
00:18:27,745 --> 00:18:28,945
1931.

378
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:33,950
He redecorated.

379
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:39,823
Whoa. High-tech.

380
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:42,926
It must be his new base of operations.

381
00:18:56,774 --> 00:18:58,774
Hydra won't be needing this, will they?

382
00:18:58,776 --> 00:19:01,677
Good thing about computers in 1973...

383
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,947
no firewalls.

384
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:06,715
I have no idea what that means.

385
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:08,584
What are you looking for?

386
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:11,620
It's a list of targets for Insight.

387
00:19:11,622 --> 00:19:13,922
These are mostly S.H.I.E.L.D. assets.

388
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:15,592
Wait.

389
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:17,259
Bruce Banner?

390
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:18,560
Never heard of him.

391
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:20,107
That's 'cause he's just a kid now,

392
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:22,164
but in a few decades,
he becomes an Avenger.

393
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,899
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

394
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:26,268
It's a good thing.

395
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,501
S-So they'll do a bad thing...

396
00:19:28,503 --> 00:19:30,305
pick him off while he's still young.

397
00:19:30,307 --> 00:19:32,441
Exactly.

398
00:19:32,443 --> 00:19:34,376
I'm starting to think
you guys made the timeline

399
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:35,945
worse than it was before.

400
00:19:35,947 --> 00:19:37,646
We have no time to speculate.

401
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:39,768
Speculate? This is more than
just a trout in the milk.

402
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:44,086
There's only one way Hydra could
have gotten names from the future.

403
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:54,874
They're here. Time to go.

404
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:57,310
Hey.

405
00:19:57,312 --> 00:19:59,479
Just wanted to thank you
for coming in tonight.

406
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:00,646
Pleasure.

407
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:02,014
It's an honor to serve S.H.I.E.L.D.

408
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:03,182
I bet it is.

409
00:20:03,184 --> 00:20:06,052
Uh... sorry,

410
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:08,588
what's your name again?

411
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,089
Patrick.

412
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:12,174
- Patrick Kutik.
- Right.

413
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:13,877
And remind me, where did you come from?

414
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:14,961
Uh, processing.

415
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,395
Systems Analysis.

416
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:18,030
It's a little bit of quantitative.

417
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:19,799
Some days, a lot of qualitative.

418
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,667
Have you ever been up to River's End?

419
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:23,301
I just bought a house in town.

420
00:20:23,303 --> 00:20:24,537
I can't say that I have.

421
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:25,972
Yeah?

422
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,007
My friends told me differently.

423
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:37,651
Did you really think I
wouldn't remember you?

424
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,610
Those are Chronicoms? They look...

425
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,412
Subtle, I know.

426
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,813
So, what's our play?

427
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:57,522
We first met 40 years ago,

428
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:59,658
in this very room.

429
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,327
I've lived an entire
lifetime since then.

430
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:03,795
What have you been doing?

431
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:06,137
You should've taken our offer
when you had the chance,

432
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,505
Mr. Coulson.

433
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:10,308
Surrender now, and we'll
go easy on the rest of you.

434
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,449
Counter offer.

435
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:20,184
Let us go, and the kid walks.

436
00:21:20,186 --> 00:21:21,352
You wouldn't.

437
00:21:21,354 --> 00:21:23,120
Nathaniel's got nothing to do with this.

438
00:21:23,122 --> 00:21:24,822
He's a ripple.

439
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:26,490
Doesn't belong here.

440
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:28,993
I'd hate to do something
we'd all regret.

441
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:30,362
So what's it gonna be?

442
00:21:31,865 --> 00:21:33,664
Enough.

443
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,300
This ends now.

444
00:21:39,272 --> 00:21:41,873
Stand down. Stand down!

445
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,917
Sorry, kid. It's nothing personal.

446
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:55,887
This is strange behavior.

447
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:57,739
I had no choice. They have my son.

448
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:58,907
Get them.

449
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:02,660
So S.H.I.E.L.D. takes hostages now?

450
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:04,429
Anything else you aren't telling me?

451
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:14,238
I'll explain later. Let's go.

452
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:23,881
We got to find some
wheels and get out of here.

453
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:34,359
Come with me if you want
to continue to exist!

454
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:38,262
Enoch, you're here.

455
00:22:38,264 --> 00:22:39,363
Yes.

456
00:22:39,365 --> 00:22:41,899
As I have been for the last 40 years.

457
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:42,934
Now buckle up.

458
00:22:42,936 --> 00:22:44,235
Sorry we left you behind,

459
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,335
thanks for the lift,

460
00:22:45,337 --> 00:22:46,704
and sweet ride.

461
00:22:46,706 --> 00:22:48,072
Thank you.

462
00:22:48,074 --> 00:22:49,440
Consumer Reports gave this vehicle

463
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:50,841
a five-star safety rating,

464
00:22:50,843 --> 00:22:52,977
and its fuel economy is best in class.

465
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:08,060
It's time we change the rules.

466
00:23:09,796 --> 00:23:12,263
So, Hydra's attempting Insight in 1973.

467
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,131
With no Helicarriers.

468
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:15,741
According to Malick,
S.H.I.E.L.D. has a system

469
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:17,007
of satellites and lasers,

470
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:18,403
which, as I say it, sounds really cool,

471
00:23:18,405 --> 00:23:19,971
but it's definitely not cool.

472
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:22,006
And it explains the launch
pad at the Lighthouse.

473
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:23,908
Must be where they're planning
to send up the satellite.

474
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,276
Any idea who the targets are?

475
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,611
Well, we found a dossier of
mostly S.H.I.E.L.D. assets...

476
00:23:27,613 --> 00:23:28,946
Bruce Banner, Nick Fury.

477
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:30,014
Peggy Carter.

478
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:31,482
Picking us off, one by one.

479
00:23:31,484 --> 00:23:32,984
Not yet.

480
00:23:32,986 --> 00:23:35,886
If we move now, we can disable
Insight before it's launch capable.

481
00:23:35,888 --> 00:23:37,121
Guys, I think something's wrong.

482
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:38,674
They know we're coming,
so we have to assume

483
00:23:38,676 --> 00:23:40,157
the Lighthouse is
fortified with a battalion...

484
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,993
Guys! Is it supposed to do that?

485
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:46,864
Simmons, what's happening?

486
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,602
We're about to jump.

487
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:53,004
Tell me you can override it.

488
00:23:53,006 --> 00:23:55,105
I'm trying, but something's
messed with the algorithm.

489
00:23:55,107 --> 00:23:57,274
How is that possible?

490
00:23:57,276 --> 00:23:59,210
The Chronicoms have changed plans.

491
00:23:59,212 --> 00:24:01,211
- They're jumping early.
- To when?! Where are we going?

492
00:24:01,213 --> 00:24:02,780
I don't know! I can't control it!

493
00:24:02,782 --> 00:24:04,181
This is our only chance to stop Insight.

494
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:06,150
We can't be on this ship.

495
00:24:21,134 --> 00:24:22,367
You tried.

496
00:24:24,203 --> 00:24:25,436
There's nothing else you could've done.

497
00:24:25,438 --> 00:24:27,405
How far did we jump?

498
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:33,380
_

499
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,981
Happy 200.

500
00:24:38,618 --> 00:24:40,785
Happy Bicentennial.

501
00:24:40,787 --> 00:24:42,454
God bless America.

502
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:46,657
Sir.

503
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:48,225
We have the official green light.

504
00:24:48,227 --> 00:24:50,393
Project Insight is ready for launch.

505
00:24:50,395 --> 00:24:51,462
Well, then let's give them

506
00:24:51,464 --> 00:24:54,231
the biggest darn fireworks
they've ever seen.

507
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:09,191
Three years.

508
00:25:09,193 --> 00:25:11,589
How the hell did we just
jump three more years?

509
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:14,226
I told you, I don't know.
We can't control it.

510
00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:16,533
Well, who does?!

511
00:25:24,642 --> 00:25:26,175
Enoch.

512
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:27,409
Where have you been?

513
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:30,179
Here. Where you abandoned me.

514
00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:31,213
For 40 years.

515
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:33,215
Something's wrong.

516
00:25:33,217 --> 00:25:36,251
Without you, I feel like
I've been... slipping.

517
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:37,752
Was I supposed to know
that we would jump?

518
00:25:37,754 --> 00:25:40,222
- I keep forgetting.
- Jemma Simmons,

519
00:25:40,224 --> 00:25:41,623
you are forgetting?

520
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,059
And getting confused. I...

521
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:46,429
- I'm not sure...
- Have you told anyone else?

522
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,199
I'm afraid to.

523
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:52,168
But why am I afraid to tell these...

524
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:55,837
Come with me.

525
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,240
Everything will be fine.

526
00:26:00,844 --> 00:26:01,877
Why did we just jump?

527
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:04,413
Agent Sousa. I'm sorry.

528
00:26:04,415 --> 00:26:05,948
We're... We are working on it,

529
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,416
- but it's complicated.
- Complicated.

530
00:26:07,418 --> 00:26:09,017
Then explain it to me. I'm a big boy.

531
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:11,320
Uh, we don't f-fully understand...

532
00:26:11,322 --> 00:26:13,589
You're in charge, and you
don't know how this works?!

533
00:26:13,591 --> 00:26:15,591
Nobody understands the time drive.

534
00:26:15,593 --> 00:26:17,836
- That is by design.
- So you're screwing with time,

535
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:19,864
but you have no idea what you're doing.

536
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:21,697
Hey. Back off! She's trying.

537
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:23,033
That's not good enough!

538
00:26:23,035 --> 00:26:24,766
You're playing with matches
and burning the house down.

539
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:25,867
Leave her alone!

540
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:27,236
Not until I get some answers.

541
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:28,770
Lives are at stake.

542
00:26:28,772 --> 00:26:30,465
I was taken out of my life for this.

543
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:32,134
Yeah, we all were!

544
00:26:34,778 --> 00:26:36,179
We all were.

545
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:40,048
Listen up!

546
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,684
It's launch day for Project Insight.

547
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:45,120
Hey, it's better than the day after.

548
00:26:45,122 --> 00:26:48,056
We move fast, we stop that satellite.

549
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:49,791
How? The base is fortified by now.

550
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:52,227
And the Zephyr can't open
fire. We'd give up our position.

551
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:55,264
We infiltrate on the ground.
May and I can sneak in.

552
00:26:55,266 --> 00:26:56,299
With these.

553
00:26:57,268 --> 00:26:58,467
We're gonna blow up the place?

554
00:26:58,469 --> 00:26:59,835
We're gonna flood it.

555
00:26:59,837 --> 00:27:01,270
If we can position the charges right,

556
00:27:01,272 --> 00:27:02,304
we can rupture some leaks

557
00:27:02,306 --> 00:27:03,605
and fill the base with lake water.

558
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:05,874
Which would set off evac
protocol and shut down the launch.

559
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:07,397
If we can't tell
S.H.I.E.L.D. from Hydra,

560
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:09,211
our best bet is to clear everybody out.

561
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:10,245
Exactly.

562
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:11,346
We need the base empty

563
00:27:11,348 --> 00:27:12,781
to preserve its state in the timeline.

564
00:27:12,783 --> 00:27:14,149
Hydra could be holding prisoners.

565
00:27:14,151 --> 00:27:15,450
They could get trapped in the flood.

566
00:27:15,452 --> 00:27:16,985
That's where you come in.

567
00:27:16,987 --> 00:27:18,620
I need you to hack
into the security system

568
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:19,921
and get us a surveillance feed.

569
00:27:19,923 --> 00:27:21,256
Once we have eyes, we'll scan

570
00:27:21,258 --> 00:27:22,424
and make sure no one is left behind.

571
00:27:22,426 --> 00:27:24,159
I'm going with her.

572
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:25,661
I'd rather be out there
working the problem

573
00:27:25,663 --> 00:27:27,596
than in here where we
disappear at any moment.

574
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:39,775
What about Malick?
We got a plan for him?

575
00:27:39,777 --> 00:27:40,942
The waves won't stop coming

576
00:27:40,944 --> 00:27:42,444
until we remove him from the timeline.

577
00:27:42,446 --> 00:27:45,314
Coulson said Malick has
an estate in River's End.

578
00:27:45,316 --> 00:27:47,316
I want you to take
the Quinjet and find it.

579
00:27:47,318 --> 00:27:49,117
I'm in.

580
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:51,119
Malick's kind of my
area of expertise now.

581
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:52,821
Good. Find Malick, and bring him in.

582
00:27:52,823 --> 00:27:55,256
- And do what with him?
- I don't know yet.

583
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:57,159
We can't keep him
locked up forever, Mack.

584
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:58,193
We'll figure it out.

585
00:27:58,195 --> 00:27:59,995
Just bring him in. The clock's ticking.

586
00:28:08,057 --> 00:28:10,758
Had a feeling you'd be back today.

587
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:15,861
You know, I have the best view in town

588
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:17,030
for watching the launch.

589
00:28:17,032 --> 00:28:19,166
That is not why I am here.

590
00:28:19,168 --> 00:28:22,035
We need to talk about your
transgression in New York.

591
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:23,584
At the bar?

592
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:24,919
That was three years ago.

593
00:28:24,921 --> 00:28:26,454
You're still angry about that?

594
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,256
Chronicoms do not get angry.

595
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:30,291
We adapt.

596
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:31,416
In fact, you taught us a lesson

597
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,428
about human behavior that day.

598
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,330
- Did I?
- You were handed victory

599
00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:38,032
and the power to eradicate
thousands of your foes.

600
00:28:38,034 --> 00:28:41,269
Yet you would have thrown
it away to save one person.

601
00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:43,371
My son.

602
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:45,306
I had no choice.

603
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:47,375
It only seemed that way.

604
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:49,511
The fatal flaw in the human condition,

605
00:28:49,513 --> 00:28:51,746
which you'll now help us exploit.

606
00:28:51,748 --> 00:28:53,081
Sibyl, our predictor,

607
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:54,949
has seen that S.H.I.E.L.D.
will find you here.

608
00:28:54,951 --> 00:28:56,951
And when they do,

609
00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:58,686
you will have leverage.

610
00:29:08,598 --> 00:29:11,167
Why not just put these two on the list?

611
00:29:14,104 --> 00:29:16,037
That would not be as effective.

612
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:18,106
We want S.H.I.E.L.D.
to reveal themselves,

613
00:29:18,108 --> 00:29:20,074
to give up their position.

614
00:29:20,076 --> 00:29:23,378
You will deliver this message.

615
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,647
Loud and clear.

616
00:29:34,157 --> 00:29:36,791
You do your thing. I got your back.

617
00:29:36,793 --> 00:29:39,327
I'm guessing you don't
really carry a piece, do you,

618
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:42,231
seeing as you got that
super serum powers.

619
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:47,036
Yeah, it's not really
a super serum thing.

620
00:29:51,074 --> 00:29:52,875
Didn't expect a straight
answer out of you.

621
00:29:57,681 --> 00:29:59,948
How is there a firewall already?

622
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:09,524
Seems things just get worse
the later in time you go.

623
00:30:09,526 --> 00:30:12,494
I think this is my last stop.

624
00:30:12,496 --> 00:30:14,629
It's okay. This is just a setback.

625
00:30:14,631 --> 00:30:16,030
My software will crack it.

626
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:18,933
It just needs... a minute to load.

627
00:30:18,935 --> 00:30:21,403
_

628
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,006
Maybe you need a bigger computer.

629
00:30:25,008 --> 00:30:27,475
That thing's... too small.

630
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,545
What?

631
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:32,514
Um...

632
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:33,615
What?

633
00:30:34,818 --> 00:30:36,518
What's that?

634
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,551
This is a phone.

635
00:30:39,222 --> 00:30:41,323
But only old people use it for calls.

636
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:46,394
How did you do that?

637
00:30:46,396 --> 00:30:49,731
Check it out.

638
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:51,333
Wow.

639
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:53,902
Wow!

640
00:30:53,904 --> 00:30:55,370
Yeah, you look...

641
00:30:55,372 --> 00:30:57,939
you look okay for a guy
who just aged 20 years.

642
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:07,082
Looks like I missed a lot.

643
00:31:10,487 --> 00:31:11,519
I'm sorry.

644
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:14,489
This is just so weird and messed up,

645
00:31:14,491 --> 00:31:15,522
but the Chronicoms jumped,

646
00:31:15,524 --> 00:31:17,692
and we had to dive in after them.

647
00:31:17,694 --> 00:31:19,527
Without us, it's...

648
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:21,796
it's way worse.

649
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:23,097
I get it.

650
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:25,433
Just...

651
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:27,468
wish I could've said some goodbyes.

652
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,178
Daisy's in.

653
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,546
We've got eyes in the base.

654
00:31:38,548 --> 00:31:39,647
The doors are unlocked.

655
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:41,716
Coulson, May, you're clear for entry.

656
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:51,626
I'm digging these throwback uniforms.

657
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:53,528
Covert and fashionable.

658
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,798
Should get us past
the security perimeter.

659
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:01,169
We're at the first checkpoint.

660
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:03,404
- Waiting on access.
- Copy that.

661
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:05,673
Kinda feels like back in the day.

662
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:07,842
We were good Agents together,

663
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:10,278
regardless of what we became later.

664
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,081
Just wondering if it'll
ever feel that way again.

665
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,817
I'm wondering if I'm ever going
to feel anything again.

666
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:23,791
We're approaching the hangar.

667
00:32:24,995 --> 00:32:27,595
Copy that. I'm working on
unlocking the next checkpoint.

668
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:28,796
Just give me a sec.

669
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:30,932
Hey, could you help open that panel?

670
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:44,745
They told me if someone
poked around in the system,

671
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:47,315
it would be you.

672
00:32:51,655 --> 00:32:54,489
So happy you came back into my life.

673
00:33:08,974 --> 00:33:12,342
T-minus 5 minutes to launch.

674
00:33:16,981 --> 00:33:18,612
We're at the second checkpoint.

675
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:20,282
Daisy, can you get us in?

676
00:33:20,284 --> 00:33:22,885
Daisy?

677
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:24,286
Daisy, do you copy?

678
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:25,877
Simmons, I'm not getting a response.

679
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,089
Her signal has dropped.

680
00:33:27,091 --> 00:33:29,458
Keep trying to reach her.
We're running out of time.

681
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:38,264
You of all people.

682
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,100
Yeah, I didn't think
I'd see you again either,

683
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:41,169
but here we are.

684
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:44,240
Actually, I had a notion
that you'd turn up.

685
00:33:44,242 --> 00:33:47,491
Just like they said you would.

686
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,626
We have a fine view
of the launch... moments away.

687
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,562
Hmm?

688
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:52,596
Well, I hate to interrupt

689
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:54,488
your otherwise leisurely afternoon...

690
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,566
The launch isn't happening.

691
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:57,134
- S.H.I.E.L.D. is shutting it down.
- That so?

692
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:58,792
Because I can't escape the feeling

693
00:33:58,794 --> 00:34:01,138
that you guys have no idea
what you're up against.

694
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,372
Well, then you can fill us in

695
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,841
'cause you're coming with us now.

696
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:05,109
No.

697
00:34:05,111 --> 00:34:07,511
I'm not going anywhere.

698
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,546
Cell blocks 1 through 6 are clear.

699
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,348
Any word from Daisy and Sousa?

700
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,449
Still nothing.

701
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:13,951
Do you think they've been compromised?

702
00:34:13,953 --> 00:34:15,619
Let's hope not.

703
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:16,949
We're less than 5 minutes from launch.

704
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:19,123
We have to get Coulson
and May into position.

705
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:21,792
Is there some other way to
bypass the security gates?

706
00:34:29,502 --> 00:34:32,269
Coulson, May... new plan.

707
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,344
General Stoner! Wait.

708
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,947
Agent McBride, is that you?

709
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:47,284
I never thought I'd see you again.

710
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:49,445
General, I can't explain
everything I'm about to say,

711
00:34:49,447 --> 00:34:50,721
but you have to believe me.

712
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:52,356
You cannot launch that satellite.

713
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:54,124
Chastity, who is this man?

714
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,659
Listen to me.

715
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,943
S.H.I.E.L.D. has been
infiltrated by a Hydra cell,

716
00:34:57,945 --> 00:35:00,296
aided by sentient time-traveling aliens.

717
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,565
STTAs?

718
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:04,635
Synthetic or organic?

719
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:06,470
A combination of both, actually.

720
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,640
Sounds problematic.

721
00:35:09,642 --> 00:35:12,543
Well... this could take some doing.

722
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:13,911
Exactly.

723
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:16,092
That's why we need you to
suspend the launch protocol,

724
00:35:16,094 --> 00:35:17,127
and then we can...

725
00:35:17,129 --> 00:35:18,563
Chastity, what are you...

726
00:35:20,057 --> 00:35:21,857
Hey.

727
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:23,725
I was getting through to him.

728
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:25,093
He felt otherwise.

729
00:35:30,634 --> 00:35:31,677
Sorry, sir.

730
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:34,036
T-minus 3 minutes to launch.

731
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:54,356
If you keep fighting the Chronicoms,

732
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:58,026
things are only going to get messier.

733
00:35:58,028 --> 00:36:00,696
We have something
you'll desperately want.

734
00:36:00,698 --> 00:36:03,165
Will you quit talking? Let's go.

735
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:05,000
It's time you answer for your crimes.

736
00:36:05,002 --> 00:36:07,436
The ones you've committed
and the ones you're about to.

737
00:36:07,438 --> 00:36:10,439
The dominos are already falling.

738
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:11,740
Come on.

739
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:15,677
The Chronicoms knew exactly
how this was going to unfold.

740
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,880
They let you think that
you had a fighting chance...

741
00:36:21,952 --> 00:36:24,721
T-minus 2 minutes to launch.

742
00:36:27,758 --> 00:36:30,392
... but they were always 10 steps ahead.

743
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:37,633
And even if you figure
out what's going on,

744
00:36:37,635 --> 00:36:40,769
there's nothing you can do...

745
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:43,338
because the Chronicoms see everything.

746
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,127
They see what you're going to do,

747
00:36:45,129 --> 00:36:46,329
and they know exac...

748
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:51,713
They see that coming?

749
00:36:51,715 --> 00:36:52,848
What did you just do?

750
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,783
He's supposed to be dead, right?

751
00:36:54,785 --> 00:36:55,984
Status quo.

752
00:37:04,795 --> 00:37:05,895
No.

753
00:37:07,598 --> 00:37:10,165
T-minus 1 minute to launch.

754
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:15,437
59, 58, 57, 56...

755
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:16,972
- Charge is in position.
- ... 55...

756
00:37:16,974 --> 00:37:20,208
- Mack, we're ready to detonate on your signal.
- ... 54, 53...

757
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,810
Waiting on your signal, Mack.

758
00:37:26,617 --> 00:37:27,617
Mack.

759
00:37:33,123 --> 00:37:34,624
Are those prisoners?

760
00:37:37,461 --> 00:37:38,794
They're my parents.

761
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:45,868
If Coulson and May flood the base...

762
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:49,338
... then they'll drown.

763
00:37:54,445 --> 00:37:57,179
Insight.

764
00:37:57,181 --> 00:37:59,014
We can't let it launch.

765
00:38:07,658 --> 00:38:08,758
Abort.

766
00:38:11,128 --> 00:38:12,662
Abort.

767
00:38:14,998 --> 00:38:18,433
12, 11, 10...

768
00:38:18,435 --> 00:38:20,969
Abort. Abort.

769
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:22,137
Are you sure?

770
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:23,772
Mack, this is our only chance.

771
00:38:23,774 --> 00:38:25,340
Abort!

772
00:38:25,342 --> 00:38:26,941
... 5, 4...

773
00:38:26,943 --> 00:38:29,010
... 3...

774
00:38:29,012 --> 00:38:31,546
2, 1.

775
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:33,348
Ignition.

776
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,559
Hold it.

777
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:40,061
... down.

778
00:38:40,063 --> 00:38:42,157
Get your hands up. Now!

779
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:58,739
- Initiate countermeasures.
- Mack, are you saying that...

780
00:38:58,741 --> 00:39:00,108
I'm saying arm the damn missiles.

781
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:46,455
Direct hit.

782
00:39:46,457 --> 00:39:48,757
Missiles detonated on impact.

783
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:50,092
Insight has been destroyed.

784
00:39:52,095 --> 00:39:53,995
But we just gave up our position.

785
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,027
We'll return in a moment.

786
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,031
White hair.

787
00:40:07,033 --> 00:40:10,201
Round glasses. Total "Mein Kampf" vibe.

788
00:40:10,203 --> 00:40:12,503
You can't miss him.

789
00:40:12,505 --> 00:40:14,038
No. Mnh-mnh.

790
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,541
No, Daniel Whitehall.

791
00:40:16,543 --> 00:40:20,044
Daniel. Cell block D.

792
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:22,290
No, I don't want to see the old man.

793
00:40:22,292 --> 00:40:23,648
I just want his instructions.

794
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:27,919
Detailed instructions.

795
00:40:27,921 --> 00:40:32,222
Yes, genius, I want them written down.

796
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:33,457
He had a theory

797
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:35,794
about transferring enhanced
abilities surgically.

798
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:40,299
I'm gonna find out if it works.

799
00:40:41,305 --> 00:41:41,371

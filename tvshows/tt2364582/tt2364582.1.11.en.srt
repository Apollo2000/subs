- He can never know.

What is Centipede?

00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:16,210
<i>It's an intravenous

When the tide turned in our favor,

11
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:24,551
- Centipede flipped Hayward's kill switch.
- Don't do th...

<i>Po's the strategist.
Raina's the recruiter.</i>

00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,588
Perhaps this Clairvoyant's the money.

14
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:29,523
- Why do they want you?
- They've taken Coulson.

15
00:00:29,557 --> 00:00:30,691
Take care of my boy!

Mike!

How'd you get your
hands on this, Vanchat?

22
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:01,487
It's what I do ... Find alien
scrap that no one else can,

23
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:04,089
then offer it to people who
fully appreciate my efforts.

Mm, I appreciate the hell out of them.

Mr. Vanchat.

You actually managed to
reopen all your stitches.

Just hope Vanchat can
lead us to Centipede.

40
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:08,176
Well, the Chitauri metal he was selling

41
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,312
is an exact match to what
Centipede used for their device.

42

We find Centipede, we find Coulson.

Don't ask questions, Agent Kob.

00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:24,425
Honestly, how many agents do they
think they can cram on this plane?

47
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,093
It's only gonna get more crowded.

48
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:27,662
We're set to pick up more men

49
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:29,997
when Agent Hand dumps
Vanchat off at the fridge.

50
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:32,099
Honestly, I think
it's good they're here.

51
00:03:32,134 --> 00:03:33,268
We need fresh eyes.

52
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:35,269
It's been 36 hours since
Agent Coulson was taken,

53
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:36,971
and none of us have gotten any rest.

54
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:40,041
Oh, joy. Agent Hand is
giving another briefing.

55
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:50,250
The burnt remains
recovered at the site

56
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:52,519
are believed to be those of
Agent trainee Michael Peterson.

57
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:54,888
Other physical evidence
has proven scarce.

58
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:57,291
Nothing relating to Mr. Po,
his Centipede associates,

59
00:03:57,325 --> 00:04:00,060
- or their location has been found.
- Any progress with Vanchat?

60
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:01,795
Nothing actionable, Agent Ward,

61
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:04,298
but I have my best
interrogator in there right now.

62
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:06,800
Vanchat will talk, and
rest assured, when he does,

63
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:10,536
not a single stone will be left unturned
until we take down Centipede.

64
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:13,479
- And find Agent Coulson.
- And get Coulson back.

65
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:17,443
We have a security breach.
Someone's hacking the system.

66
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:23,449
Just in time.
Can you override this?

67
00:04:23,483 --> 00:04:24,850
What do you think you're doing?

68
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:26,352
The money trail's our
key to finding Coulson.

69
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:28,754
I just need to gain access
to Vanchat's financials,

70
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:31,557
and from there, I should be able
to trace Centipede's payments

71
00:04:31,592 --> 00:04:33,259
and then hack into their account.

72
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:35,561
You're the consultant ...
the one who shot Agent Sitwell.

73
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:38,964
- Technically, that wasn't me ...
- I want you off this plane immediately.

74
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:41,539
- What?
- Wait.

75
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:43,802
I know I'm not some badass
field agent like May or Ward,

76
00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:47,439
but this is what I do.
You can't just kick me off this mission.

77
00:04:47,473 --> 00:04:51,376
Listen, I will do whatever you say.

78
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,812
All this protocol crap
doesn't matter to me.

79
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:55,714
All that matters to me is Coulson.

80
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:57,915
Well, "all this protocol crap"
matters to me.

81
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,817
You're a distraction, and you're gone.

82
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:04,723
Agent Hand, I know Skye's
methods are unorthodox,

83
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:08,923
but she's a member of this team.
She can help.

84
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:11,563
Agent May, your professional opinion ...

85
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:14,832
Will this girl be of any
use to us on this plane?

86
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:16,200
No.

87
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:21,305
Increase her restriction level.

88
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,942
Confiscate her laptop and phone,
then have her delivered to debrief.

89
00:05:24,977 --> 00:05:27,778
I'll do it. I'm her S.O.

90
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:41,492
It's clear that May has
an axe to grind with me,

91
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:43,160
but that was way out of line.

92
00:05:43,194 --> 00:05:45,462
No one knows what's in
May's head except May.

93
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:46,563
Don't worry.

94
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:48,498
Coulson will make this
right when he gets back.

95
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:50,633
I can find him, Ward.

96
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:53,770
I believe you.
I've seen firsthand what you can do,

97
00:05:53,805 --> 00:05:56,173
even without S.H.I.E.L.D. resources.

98
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:00,911
- Hang on, hang on.
- We have something for you.

99
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:04,614
- You made me a sandwich?
- Yes, it is that.

100
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:07,183
<i>It's a satellite phone ...
damper resistant.</i>

101
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:09,585
<i>You get one shot before
your bracelet shuts it down.</i>

102
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,555
- So only call in case of emergency.
- What do I even need this for?

103
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,123
I'm gonna be spending
the next three days

104
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:16,025
in a S.H.I.E.L.D. broom
closet getting debriefed.

105
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:17,360
That's right.

106
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:19,696
A few agents are coming here
to pick you up for debriefing...

107
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,664
<i>in exactly 12 minutes.</i>

108
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,634
<i>Good luck.</i>

109
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:34,576
Don't touch Lola.

110
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,745
Mm.

111
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:42,617
- Can you feel that?
- Don't stop.

112
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:45,887
Listen to him.

113
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:48,423
Who ordered this?

114
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:00,034
<i> It seems you passed out.</i>

115
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:05,206
Now maybe you're ready to share
what memories you're seeing.

116
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:13,313
I saw... Jordan...

117
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:17,818
<i>hitting that game-winner over
Russell in the '98 finals.</i>

118
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,119
So clutch.

119
00:07:19,153 --> 00:07:22,055
Agent Coulson, we're gonna
turn the machine back on

120
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,259
and open your mind.
It's time to stop fighting it.

121
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:27,794
If you don't, you won't
survive the process.

122
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:30,430
I'll let you kill me
before I give you anything.

123
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:34,134
Seems you have a taste
for that, anyway ...

124
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:36,904
murdered Mike Peterson
in front of his own son.

125
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:39,506
Mr. Peterson chose that end.

126
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,309
We gave him his life
and his child unscathed.

127
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:44,778
You're just upset

128
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:47,246
because that man's death
hit so close to home,

129
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:52,018
seeing a boy lose his
father at such a young age.

130
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:54,854
As you did.

131
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,791
A defining moment.

132
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:02,128
- The Clairvoyant saw that.
- I hate to break it to you,

133
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,330
but your telepathic friend is a fraud.

134
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:08,600
Otherwise, he'd know all these
answers, and I wouldn't be here.

135
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:11,470
It's true ... this is strange.

136
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:14,873
My friend can see that you died.

137
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:16,642
You went cold.

138
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:20,378
Your heart was torn to pieces.

139
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:24,583
What the Clairvoyant can't
see is what happened after ...

140
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:27,252
<i>how they brought you back from the dead.</i>

141
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:31,056
For some reason, Agent Coulson,
you're different.

142
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,757
Now, why is that?

143
00:08:37,796 --> 00:08:41,099
So we have to do this the hard way.

144
00:08:56,773 --> 00:09:00,341
<i>Just need an exploit ...
some way in.</i>

145
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:07,348
<i>- Oh, what?
- Come on!</i>

146
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:09,349
<i>Something with wireless, maybe.</i>

147
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:21,563
Hey, Lloyd.
You might be my way in.

148
00:09:32,808 --> 00:09:35,710
- That's what I said. Yeah.
- One second.

149
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:38,801
Of course, I love truffles,
but not on that.

150
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,385
What an idiot.

151
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:45,786
No, sweetie, listen to me.
It was a private jet.

152
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:49,990
Of course there was wi-fi.
He should've at least texted you back.

153
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,230
<i>No, that's too much!</i>

154
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,567
I know the night-night rounds
no longer affect the Centipede soldiers,

155
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:04,805
but all we want to do is
disable them, not kill them.

156
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:07,441
- I'm good with either, frankly.
- Fitz, you don't mean that.

157
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:08,942
Those soldiers are just men who ...

158
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,110
Who could smash your skull
open with a single punch.

159
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:12,478
But they're being controlled.

160
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,547
Centipede is making them
fight against their will.

161
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,849
Well, they took Coulson,

162
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:17,183
and I don't care what we
have to do to get him back.

163
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:18,417
We need to bring him home.

164
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,988
<i>What's this guy doing,
lulling Vanchat to sleep?</i>

165
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,859
I'm going in.

166
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,671
Damn it!

167
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,445
Okay, Skye, just need a plan "B."

168
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,902
<i>Roadside assistance.
We see you've had an accident.</i>

169
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,103
Yeah.

170
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:14,706
Can you send somebody to
tow me back to my house?

171
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,042
<i>Of course.
I'll dispatch someone right away.</i>

172
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:20,144
<i>Are you okay?</i>

173
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:23,580
Yeah. I'm good.

174
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:54,137
Agent Hand needs you, says it's urgent.

175
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:04,714
Time to talk.

176
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,319
The names of all your buyers,
alphabetically would help.

177
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,020
I'm not telling you a bloody thing.

178
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:12,789
That's how you want to play it?

179
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,698
Rochambeau you?

180
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:24,333
- Rochambeau!
- Scissors!

181
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:26,869
Fitz!

182
00:12:33,243 --> 00:12:35,744
I've got all day.

183
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,885
All right!
All right, I'll talk! I'll talk!

184
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:16,116
<i>The town that the bomb forgot.</i>

185
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,020
It was built in the '40s for nuclear testing,

186
00:13:20,054 --> 00:13:23,056
but when the cold war
ended, the town was spared.

187
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:25,158
Not exactly prime real estate.

188
00:13:25,193 --> 00:13:27,461
Mm, true.

189
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:30,630
There's nothing but desert
for hundreds of miles.

190
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:37,371
But I really like it.
It's nice here.

191
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:38,872
<i>The children are always playing...</i>

192
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,144
...yet never make a sound.

193
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:48,648
Shall we get back to it, then?

194
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:55,522
So, you sure you don't want
me to take it to the dealer?

195
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:59,325
- No, thanks. I got a guy.
- All right. Thank you.

196
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:12,305
Dollar bills, y'all.

197
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:37,728
<i>Lloyd Rathman's office.</i>

198
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:40,432
This is the L.A.P.D.
I need to speak with Mr. Rathman.

199
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:43,001
We've recovered a stolen
vehicle registered in his name.

200
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:44,402
<i>Oh. Was it damaged?</i>

201
00:14:44,437 --> 00:14:47,538
Yes, ma'am. We have two
officers waiting at his home,

202
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:49,040
ready to take a statement.

203
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:53,478
How long do you think it'll
take Mr. Rathman to get there?

204
00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:06,056
<i>You're in a lot of trouble, Mr. Rathman.</i>

205
00:15:06,091 --> 00:15:07,658
Who the hell are you?

206
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:12,429
Agent Melinda May with S.H.I.E.L.D.

207
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:17,647
Look, clearly there's
been a misunderstanding.

208
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:19,149
I'm a legitimate businessman.

209
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:21,917
S.H.I.E.L.D. has evidence your
company has been siphoning funds

210
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:24,854
into an offshore account
for some very bad people.

211
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:26,622
My clients' business is their business.

212
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,658
Well, my business is
catching those guys,

213
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:31,560
and if it turns out you've made
a profit from just one of them,

214
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:34,229
S.H.I.E.L.D. is prepared to
freeze all of your assets.

215
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:38,400
- I'm calling my lawyer.
- Do that and my offer's off the table.

216
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,602
What offer is that?

217
00:15:40,636 --> 00:15:45,280
Immunity ... you walk...
free and clear.

218
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:47,442
S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't
touch a single asset.

219
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:51,012
Not even your party boat in Key Largo.

220
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:53,181
And if I say no?

221
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:55,248
You spend the next five
years in the fridge.

222
00:15:55,283 --> 00:15:58,719
- The fridge?
- It's worse than it sounds.

223
00:15:59,888 --> 00:16:03,223
- All right, what do you want?
- Follow me to your office.

224
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:06,426
We've got some work to do.

225
00:16:09,964 --> 00:16:13,300
<i>Vanchat's intel is paying off.</i>

226
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:16,069
We're pursuing every known buyer
of Chitauri metals around the globe.

227
00:16:16,104 --> 00:16:18,939
The largest has a warehouse in Sydney.
We're heading there now.

228
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:21,508
This is our chance to
take down Centipede.

229
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:25,279
- I want everyone in full tactical.
- And what about Agent Coulson?

230
00:16:25,313 --> 00:16:27,113
If we're lucky, Centipede's
holding him in Sydney.

231
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:28,281
Dismissed.

232
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:33,720
Agent Ward, a moment.

233
00:16:33,754 --> 00:16:37,890
First, your friend Skye left the plane
and never arrived for her debrief,

234
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:40,927
then Vanchat almost flies
out of the interrogation room.

235
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:43,830
- Do we have a problem?
- No, Agent Hand.

236
00:16:43,864 --> 00:16:47,433
Your man wasn't getting
answers, so I stepped in.

237
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:49,969
Without my permission.
Well, congratulations.

238
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:53,105
Thanks to you and your
unique interrogation skills,

239
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:58,010
we now have active strike teams
running raids all over the world.

240
00:16:58,045 --> 00:17:00,946
- The question is, why?
- Excuse me?

241
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,314
It's unprecedented,

242
00:17:02,349 --> 00:17:05,684
this kind of response for
a level 8 operative,

243
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:10,389
the sheer manpower involved.
I've been on the phone all day ...

244
00:17:10,423 --> 00:17:14,426
Director Fury, Commander Hill...
everyone wants an update.

245
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:17,395
Frankly, I don't understand it.

246
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:20,631
No single agent is that important.

247
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,768
Coulson is.

248
00:17:31,777 --> 00:17:35,179
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s gonna find me
before you break me.

249
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:36,280
S.H.I.E.L.D.?

250
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:39,584
Well, the Clairvoyant
sees an end to all that.

251
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:45,757
<i>He doesn't look so good.</i>

252
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,393
Raina, what took you so long?

253
00:17:48,427 --> 00:17:52,029
- I was tending to our other subject.
- The persuasion skills

254
00:17:52,063 --> 00:17:53,998
I've spoken to the
Clairvoyant so much about

255
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:57,601
would be better served here
with me, breaking this man.

256
00:17:57,635 --> 00:17:59,803
I would never use force
to bend a man to my wishes.

257
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:01,071
He's being difficult.

258
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:03,374
- He's being beaten.
- Into submission.

259
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:06,543
The Clairvoyant requested
it and will tell me to ...

260
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:08,645
See?

261
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,716
Yes?

262
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,051
No.

263
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:18,388
Well, I've only just begun.
My methods are sound.

264
00:18:18,423 --> 00:18:19,890
I assure you ...

265
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,492
Right here.

266
00:18:25,862 --> 00:18:27,830
Yes.

267
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:33,469
The Clairvoyant would
like to speak to you.

268
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:42,744
This is Raina.

269
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:46,414
Yes.

270
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,818
I agree.

271
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:55,457
Thank you.
I'll put him back on.

272
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:00,361
Yes, I'm here.

273
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:20,931
<i>There a problem?</i>

274
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:25,402
<i>Victoria Hand.
We don't exactly see eye to eye.</i>

275
00:19:25,437 --> 00:19:28,639
<i>I'm sure she's utilizing all
of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s resources</i>

276
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:32,442
- to find Coulson.
- Not all of them.

277
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:35,411
You know, it wouldn't hurt to
have Skye working an exploit.

278
00:19:35,446 --> 00:19:40,050
- Why didn't you stick up for her?
- Excuse me?

279
00:19:40,084 --> 00:19:41,985
She has proven herself
on multiple missions.

280
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:46,877
She's a part of this team.
You let her get tossed.

281
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:50,526
All I did was tell Hand the truth.

282
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:53,596
Skye's no use to us on this plane.

283
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:55,898
- How can you say that?
- She's not.

284
00:19:57,134 --> 00:19:59,902
Not with all these agents
here over her shoulder,

285
00:19:59,936 --> 00:20:01,571
monitoring her every move.

286
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:05,040
- You wanted her off the plane.
- Outside the system.

287
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:07,342
That's how Skye works best.

288
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:12,214
You don't have to
assume the worst of me.

289
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:16,318
<i> Agent May, change of plans.
Sending new coordinates now.</i>

290
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:19,821
<i>We found their helicopter at a
laboratory outside the Mojave desert.</i>

291
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:22,090
Copy that. Coordinates received.

292
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:25,622
Hang on to something.

293
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:45,430
You want me to hack into
a Swiss bank account?

294
00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:47,798
Just need you to type in
your private corporate I.D.

295
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:49,033
to get me in the door.

296
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:51,135
Yeah, well, letting you
in that door is a crime.

297
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,169
Come to think of it,

298
00:20:52,203 --> 00:20:53,671
how do I know you're
not just some criminal?

299
00:20:53,705 --> 00:20:56,273
In my experience, a
federal agent shows a badge.

300
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:58,108
You want to see my badge.

301
00:21:02,781 --> 00:21:04,414
S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol six alpha victor.

302
00:21:07,452 --> 00:21:11,821
There.
That's my badge.

303
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:14,558
Great.
Just got my high score in Tiny Wings.

304
00:21:14,592 --> 00:21:18,261
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been watching you
for quite some time, Mr. Rathman.

305
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:20,897
You're a prime exploit ...
the gambling, the divorces,

306
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:23,533
that money pit in the Caymans.

307
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:25,702
You're even behind on your
child-support payments.

308
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:28,404
Ugh, that's a clerical thing.
My ex knows that.

309
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:32,040
- But does David know that?
- David thinks I'm a cool dad.

310
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:33,442
David thinks you're a jackass.

311
00:21:33,477 --> 00:21:37,879
You got to fix that, Lloyd.
Kids need someone they can look up to.

312
00:21:37,914 --> 00:21:40,782
Now... start typing.

313
00:21:42,085 --> 00:21:44,586
<i>PD security! Don't move!
That's it. Nice and easy.</i>

314
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:47,155
Keep your hands where I can ...
ugh!

315
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:49,190
<i>On the ground!</i>

316
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,995
Okay, I-I'm typing, I'm typing.

317
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:56,431
<i>You S.H.I.E.L.D. guys don't mess around.</i>

318
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:01,769
This is turning into an
interesting day, isn't it?

319
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:02,903
So, you're my friend now?

320
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:05,773
'Cause I've seen what
you do to your "friends."

321
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:08,042
- Mr. Po?
- Yeah.

322
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:12,847
He was a murderer incapable of remorse.

323
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:16,551
I was thinking of Mike Peterson,
Chan Ho Yin.

324
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,386
I gave them what they asked for.

325
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,557
Mike wanted to be a hero to his son.
Now he is.

326
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,660
Did Akela Amador want
a bomb in her head?

327
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:27,528
The people you work
for are just as capable

328
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:30,564
of using cruel means to
reach a justified end.

329
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:34,734
And who do you work for, Raina?
The Clairvoyant?

330
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:39,139
Yes.

331
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:41,107
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

332
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:44,778
Today was the first time
I personally made contact.

333
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:50,249
- My heart's still racing.
- He has you building super soldiers.

334
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:53,486
The Clairvoyant gives
us guidance, formulas.

335
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,057
- For what?
- The changing world,

336
00:22:57,091 --> 00:23:00,393
<i>the world your organization
brought upon us.</i>

337
00:23:00,427 --> 00:23:04,363
We're new to the business
of what you've been doing for decades.

338
00:23:04,398 --> 00:23:06,732
So now what?
You have soldiers?

339
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:09,902
You can make them strong,
you can control them.

340
00:23:09,936 --> 00:23:12,205
In an instant, you can kill them.

341
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:15,541
Yes, but we can't
bring them back to life.

342
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:19,345
You were killed.

343
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:22,981
<i>Now you're here.</i>

344
00:23:23,016 --> 00:23:26,952
We want to know how.

345
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:29,188
Don't you?

346
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:33,926
I'd like to turn the machine on again.

347
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:39,731
<i>It induces theta brain-wave frequencies</i>

348
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:44,636
to help uncover the secrets
buried in the subconscious.

349
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,673
If you cooperate, you
can surf those waves.

350
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:53,144
I've gone surfing.
That is definitely not like surfing.

351
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:56,280
You've been resisting.
Fight the waves and you'll drown.

352
00:23:56,314 --> 00:24:01,759
Your brain will cook.
You'll stop breathing ... again.

353
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,888
Then that's what it'll be,

354
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:06,991
or I hold out until my
team comes to find me.

355
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:10,561
Either way, you will not
get classified intel from me.

356
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:13,364
I'm not interested in those secrets.

357
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:17,468
The Clairvoyant can see within
any agency, any government.

358
00:24:17,502 --> 00:24:20,937
He knows what the President
dreams about at night.

359
00:24:20,972 --> 00:24:23,140
I want what you want ...

360
00:24:23,174 --> 00:24:26,143
to uncover a different secret...

361
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:32,849
the secret S.H.I.E.L.D.
is keeping from you.

362
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:39,476
<i>All right, we're
logged in, but you do realize </i>

363
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,407
you can't transfer these
kinds of funds online.

364
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:44,715
I'm not looking to transfer funds.
I'm looking for transaction records.

365
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:49,628
Go to your account history.
We need to open up a terminal emulator,

366
00:24:49,663 --> 00:24:51,388
- see what kind of encryption they've got.
- Okay.

367
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,590
If it's an SSL 256 or
an A.E.S. twofish serpent,

368
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,892
- we're in business.
- Yeah.

369
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,594
- Quantum key, that's another story.
- Right.

370
00:24:58,629 --> 00:25:02,933
Lloyd.
What is happening here?

371
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:05,802
Yeah, account history.
Where is that?

372
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:12,875
Delete that second line.

373
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,578
<i>Press "return."</i>

374
00:25:15,612 --> 00:25:19,482
Thing is, I have an assistant
that does all this for me.

375
00:25:19,516 --> 00:25:22,051
- That's it.
- So, this Vanchat ...

376
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:23,586
is this the guy you're trying to bust?

377
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,622
No, we already have him in custody.
What I wanna know

378
00:25:26,657 --> 00:25:28,825
is who's recently paid
Vanchat a lot of money.

379
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:31,226
I backtrack those payments
to the buyer's account

380
00:25:31,261 --> 00:25:33,295
and get a record of all
the purchases she's made,

381
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,514
maybe use it to track her down.
Click there.

382
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,904
Hello, Raina.
Let's see what you've been up to.

383
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:45,807
- Print that.
- Great. So are we done here?

384
00:25:45,842 --> 00:25:47,809
One last thing.

385
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,785
And you're clinging to
the one thing you have ...

386
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:58,920
fond memories of your recovery.

387
00:25:58,955 --> 00:26:00,221
So, this person you work for

388
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:03,925
told you I died and
have gaps in my memory.

389
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,595
Ever think your mind reader

390
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:08,763
might just be looking
up symptoms online?

391
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:11,199
I was also told it
keeps you up at night,

392
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:13,734
that you crave answers,
that you're troubled by the fact

393
00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:16,637
<i>that when you asked for
answers, you were denied.</i>

394
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:20,041
- Isn't that true?
- I trust the system.

395
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:24,173
They keep secrets for a reason.

396
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:28,849
But why would S.H.I.E.L.D. keep
details of your death from you?

397
00:26:28,884 --> 00:26:30,851
They're your family ...

398
00:26:30,886 --> 00:26:35,723
Your only family since
you've lost your mother, too.

399
00:26:35,757 --> 00:26:40,260
- Now, after all you've sacrificed...
- Sacrifice is part of the job.

400
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:43,531
- I would give my life ...
- You didn't just give your life,

401
00:26:43,565 --> 00:26:48,868
you gave up your chance
at a normal one, at love.

402
00:26:52,807 --> 00:26:55,708
And she did love you, Agent Coulson.

403
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:01,080
How could you know that?

404
00:27:01,114 --> 00:27:04,516
Do you miss her?
Dinners at the Richmond.

405
00:27:04,551 --> 00:27:07,753
Do you miss hearing her play?

406
00:27:09,622 --> 00:27:12,858
You didn't even have a
chance to say goodbye.

407
00:27:12,892 --> 00:27:15,527
I-I couldn't.
I-I can't.

408
00:27:15,562 --> 00:27:19,064
She cried for days
after S.H.I.E.L.D. told her you died.

409
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:24,870
They shattered her heart with a lie,

410
00:27:27,172 --> 00:27:29,641
- and now they're lying to you.
- No.

411
00:27:31,043 --> 00:27:34,479
- No, they're not.
- I know you don't want to believe it,

412
00:27:34,513 --> 00:27:38,483
but you can't tell me
nothing makes you doubt,

413
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:42,552
makes you wonder what
happened in Tahiti.

414
00:27:42,587 --> 00:27:45,322
It's a magical place...

415
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:53,364
- I keep saying that.
- Don't you want to know why?

416
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:08,122
Turn it... turn it on.

417
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:10,547
<i>The Centipede soldiers each have a port</i>

418
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:13,449
<i>on their delivery device
to inject refills of serum.</i>

419
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:17,120
But with this injector cuff, we
can use the port to our advantage.

420
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,355
By injecting a refined
dose of dendrotoxin

421
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,492
- to incapacitate the soldier.
- How's it work?

422
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:27,363
Oh, just simply lock it around
the Centipede soldier's forearm.

423
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:29,132
<i>And night-night, superpowers.</i>

424
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,967
Sounds like riding a
bull for eight seconds.

425
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:36,672
- Yeah, exactly. It's that simple.
- Yeah.

426
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,543
Hello?

427
00:28:40,577 --> 00:28:44,379
- Simmons, it's me.
- Why, hello... Dr. Nugent.

428
00:28:44,414 --> 00:28:47,349
<i>Is someone there?
God, don't try to lie.</i>

429
00:28:47,383 --> 00:28:49,584
You are the worst at this.
Remember our safe word.

430
00:28:49,618 --> 00:28:53,055
Manscaping?
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

431
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:56,324
Um, I am right as rain.
Couldn't be better, old chap.

432
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,960
<i>- You three, out.
- Listen up.</i>

433
00:28:58,994 --> 00:29:02,164
I may have a lead on where
Centipede's holding Coulson.

434
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,397
Skye?

435
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,936
What have you found?

436
00:29:09,337 --> 00:29:11,906
We're about to launch a major
assault on a Centipede lab,

437
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:13,240
and you want to take your team

438
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:15,043
to the desert based
on a hunch from Skye?

439
00:29:15,077 --> 00:29:16,210
It's not a hunch.

440
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,613
Skye followed the money from
Vanchat back to Centipede.

441
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:21,182
Turns out they recently purchased

442
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:23,451
a small development less
than 100 miles from here.

443
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:25,319
Well, that's great news for
their real-estate portfolio,

444
00:29:25,353 --> 00:29:27,421
but we have confirmed
activity at the lab.

445
00:29:27,456 --> 00:29:30,357
I'm taking a strike team to investigate.
End of story.

446
00:29:30,392 --> 00:29:31,592
<i>So we split up.</i>

447
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:33,094
You take the strike team
and go after Centipede.

448
00:29:33,128 --> 00:29:36,997
We'll investigate Skye's lead,
see if Coulson's there.

449
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:38,966
You backed my decision to
kick Skye off the plane.

450
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,167
- Seems like it worked out.
- Seems like you played me.

451
00:29:41,202 --> 00:29:42,535
<i>Look, this isn't personal,</i>

452
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,572
but I am taking my team and
we're gonna find Coulson.

453
00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:49,042
Send backup if you want.

454
00:29:56,616 --> 00:30:00,120
What makes you so sure
this machine will even work?

455
00:30:00,154 --> 00:30:01,887
It worked on me.

456
00:30:04,758 --> 00:30:11,063
One thing before we start ...
what is it with the flowers?

457
00:30:11,098 --> 00:30:16,602
Who doesn't like flowers?
I'm glad you noticed.

458
00:30:18,204 --> 00:30:19,672
Close your eyes and relax.

459
00:30:24,444 --> 00:30:29,281
I want you to think back to
your first memory after you died.

460
00:30:31,717 --> 00:30:33,785
<i>What do you see?</i>

461
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:41,193
Sandy beach, blue waves ...
just as I remember it.

462
00:30:41,227 --> 00:30:43,227
Focus on the details.

463
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:48,533
- Can you feel that?
- Don't stop.

464
00:30:51,003 --> 00:30:55,339
<i>Listen to him!
Who ordered this?</i>

465
00:30:55,374 --> 00:31:00,611
- W-what?
- Director Fury himself.

466
00:31:24,235 --> 00:31:26,770
Got creepy?

467
00:31:47,957 --> 00:31:49,191
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

468
00:31:52,462 --> 00:31:55,734
There's nowhere to run!

469
00:32:04,578 --> 00:32:09,982
<i>Agent Coulson, something's
happening, isn't it?</i>

470
00:32:13,788 --> 00:32:15,754
Listen to him.

471
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:17,924
<i>I need you to look at your surroundings.</i>

472
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,929
<i>I can't take it anymore...</i>

473
00:32:22,963 --> 00:32:24,996
Try and describe what you see.

474
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:31,503
<i>Are you still in Tahiti?
Tell me.</i>

475
00:32:31,538 --> 00:32:34,907
It's dark.
There's nothing.

476
00:32:34,941 --> 00:32:37,843
Everything is dark.

477
00:32:38,545 --> 00:32:42,080
<i>Coulson's gotta be here somewhere.
We need to split up.</i>

478
00:32:42,114 --> 00:32:46,852
- Or run.
- I'll take care of him.

479
00:32:46,886 --> 00:32:48,454
Are you sure?

480
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:53,358
- I got this.
- Come on, let's move!

481
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,631
Coulson!

482
00:33:41,973 --> 00:33:46,543
Now, Coulson, where the hell are you?

483
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:10,132
<i> He's drifting.</i>

484
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:14,236
<i> He's drifting.</i>

485
00:34:16,606 --> 00:34:18,741
- This is wrong.
- Can you feel that?

486
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:19,775
Don't.

487
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,644
- Listen to him.
- Stop.

488
00:34:21,678 --> 00:34:23,746
- Who ordered this?
- Director Fury himself.

489
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,513
This is wrong!

490
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:30,618
<i>Listen to him!</i>

491
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,888
Let me die, please.
Please, please.

492
00:34:33,923 --> 00:34:36,925
Please, I'm begging you, let me die.

493
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,562
Please. Please let me die.

494
00:34:40,596 --> 00:34:42,464
<i>Let me die, please!</i>

495
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:45,500
<i>Please! Let me die!</i>

496
00:34:45,534 --> 00:34:48,703
<i>Please! Let me die!</i>

497
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:56,077
Stop fighting it, Agent Coulson.
Stop fighting it.

498
00:34:56,111 --> 00:34:59,080
Please let me die.

499
00:34:59,114 --> 00:35:00,581
It's for his own good.

500
00:35:02,117 --> 00:35:05,486
Please, let me die!
Please, let me die!

501
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,820
<i>Please, let me die!</i>

502
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,790
<i>Let me die.
Let me die.</i>

503
00:35:11,593 --> 00:35:13,027
Coulson, Coulson.

504
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:16,563
Come back, come back,
come back, come back...

505
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,133
Come back, come back.

506
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:24,938
Skye.
Skye.

507
00:35:28,142 --> 00:35:30,744
Skye.

508
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:39,118
Nice jacket.

509
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:44,658
Bet there aren't any flowered
dresses where she's going.

510
00:35:44,692 --> 00:35:46,126
Amen to that, sister.

511
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:00,372
<i>- Dismissed.
- Let's go, madam.</i>

512
00:36:07,147 --> 00:36:09,015
Just got off the phone
with headquarters.

513
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:10,550
Director Fury was very relieved.

514
00:36:10,584 --> 00:36:13,753
I understand you've been busy.
Heard you put some miles on my plane.

515
00:36:13,787 --> 00:36:15,755
The manhunt has yielded
some impressive results.

516
00:36:15,789 --> 00:36:18,223
Centipede operations have been
taken down around the globe.

517
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:19,859
Any word on the Clairvoyant?

518
00:36:19,893 --> 00:36:22,428
Nothing yet, but it's gonna
be awfully hard to stay hidden

519
00:36:22,462 --> 00:36:24,796
now that the Clairvoyant's
on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar.

520
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:29,068
Good, because Raina knew things
about me ... personal things.

521
00:36:29,102 --> 00:36:31,836
- I want to know how.
- My men and I are taking her

522
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:33,372
straight to headquarters
for questioning.

523
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:36,408
- We'll be in touch.
- Agent Hand?

524
00:36:37,376 --> 00:36:42,614
- Thank you... for everything.
- Good to have you back.

525
00:36:42,648 --> 00:36:47,018
Honestly, this bus
isn't really my style.

526
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:06,770
I just want to say...
thank you.

527
00:37:13,944 --> 00:37:15,912
Now get back to work.

528
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:29,726
I heard what you did for me.

529
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:34,998
I think it's time...
that we remove this.

530
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:39,802
Disengage bracelet.

531
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:43,172
- Are you kidding me?
- Thought you'd like that.

532
00:37:48,512 --> 00:37:52,848
Back in that room, did
they learn anything?

533
00:37:52,882 --> 00:37:55,116
No.

534
00:37:56,253 --> 00:37:57,386
Did you?

535
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:02,190
I heard what you were saying.

536
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:05,961
It wasn't real.

537
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:12,067
They were just messing with my head...

538
00:38:12,101 --> 00:38:15,236
but I appreciate your concern.

539
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:32,120
<i>Evening, Doctor.</i>

540
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:38,926
- Agent Coulson.
- You weren't operating on my heart.

541
00:38:38,961 --> 00:38:43,764
- I know about Tahiti.
- I was afraid this day would come.

542
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:46,734
- Because of what I'd do?
- Because of what I've done.

543
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:54,908
After New York, you weren't dead
for 8 seconds or 40 seconds

544
00:38:54,942 --> 00:38:56,643
or whatever they put in your file.

545
00:38:56,677 --> 00:39:01,582
You were dead for... days.

546
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:03,049
That's impossible.

547
00:39:03,084 --> 00:39:07,153
It should be, but Director
Fury moved heaven and Earth.

548
00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:11,157
He had a team of scientists
working around the clock

549
00:39:11,191 --> 00:39:15,294
using procedures that no
good Doctor would ever allow.

550
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:16,796
You were there.

551
00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:20,600
Fury brought me in during
the seventh operation.

552
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:24,470
We kept you conscious to
monitor brain activity,

553
00:39:24,505 --> 00:39:26,972
but you were in extreme pain.

554
00:39:27,007 --> 00:39:30,876
The neurological damage...
it was catastrophic.

555
00:39:32,812 --> 00:39:37,016
- I wanted to die.
- And we should have let you.

556
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:41,954
The trauma you'd endured was...
Ungodly.

557
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:44,957
Why was that machine
messing with my brain?

558
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:48,493
After what you'd been through...

559
00:39:49,528 --> 00:39:53,732
 we wanted to restore
the man you'd once been,

560
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:59,937
so we gave you a pleasant
memory of a beautiful island.

561
00:39:59,972 --> 00:40:06,010
We didn't want you to be that...
thing.

562
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:15,118
What did I become, Doctor?
Tell me.

563
00:40:15,153 --> 00:40:18,121
You'd lost your will to live.

564
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:23,827
We tried to give it back.

565
00:40:27,732 --> 00:40:33,937
I'm sorry, Agent Coulson.
Truly, I am.

566
00:40:33,971 --> 00:40:37,540
If you only knew.

567
00:40:52,221 --> 00:40:55,591
<i>"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."
will return in a moment.</i>

568
00:41:28,596 --> 00:41:30,364
H-hello?

569
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:36,871
Anybody there?
Hello?

570
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,223
No.

1
00:00:01,503 --> 00:00:04,704
Previously on
"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:07,072
I know that... Agent Coulson
was killed in action.

3
00:00:07,106 --> 00:00:08,541
Welcome to level 7.

4
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,810
Some say it was only for
8 seconds, but I feel different.

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,978
What is Centipede?

6
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,913
It's an intravenous
filter for his blood.

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,449
Very similar to the serum Dr. Erskine
developed in the '40s for the...

8
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:20,953
- Super soldiers.
- Listen, Doctor, your product works.

9
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,689
It appears the volatility in
the serum has been neutralized.

10
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,091
Who is the woman you referred to?

11
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,792
Some rich girl in a flower dress.

12
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:30,595
We all have to do things
that make us uncomfortable

13
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:34,065
if we are ever to get our
toy soldiers off the shelf.

14
00:00:39,642 --> 00:00:42,718
1x10 - The Bridge

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

16
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:03,093
That seat is taken.

17
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:18,741
Perimeter breach, quad four!

18
00:01:18,776 --> 00:01:21,176
Three guys just crashed the prison!

19
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,579
Security breach!
Security breach!

20
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:28,050
Time to go.

21
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:35,024
Sir.

22
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,359
Excuse me?

23
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:42,551
- Time to go, sir.
- It's time to go... sir!

24

 sync & correction by f1nc0
~ addic7ed.com ~  

25
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:10,058
- Mission briefing in 5.
- Okay.

26
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:13,361
- Katherine Shane?
- Do you know her?

27
00:02:13,395 --> 00:02:15,629
We ran a few ops together in the '90s.

28
00:02:15,664 --> 00:02:17,698
Smart, resourceful.

29
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:22,403
- Had a soft spot for Truffaut movies.
- Easy there, charm school.

30
00:02:22,438 --> 00:02:25,773
According to these files,
Agent Shane could be my Mom.

31
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:30,911
Even if Shane was the agent
who dropped you off at the orphanage,

32
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:32,680
it doesn't mean she's your mother.

33
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:34,381
I started looking into
all the female agents

34
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:36,083
- active when I was born.
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:02:36,117 --> 00:02:39,086
Needle, haystack, I know. But
then I factored in age and marital

36
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:42,055
status, and then I built a
program to narrow down the field.

37
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,724
You're still looking at a long road.

38
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:48,561
Well, it would be a lot shorter
if I could access more files.

39
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:51,263
Maybe you could remove
my internet nanny?

40
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:54,067
- I'm talking about my tracking bracelet.
- I got that.

41
00:02:54,102 --> 00:02:55,102
- So you'll take it off.
- No.

42
00:02:55,136 --> 00:03:00,172
But I asked May to look into
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s more restricted files.

43
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:05,211
I was kind of hoping
to keep this private.

44
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:08,915
Agent May specializes in private.

45
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:10,583
Let's go.

46
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:31,770
Nice feint.

47
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:35,438
I read your file.
I know you favor your left.

48
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:39,011
That's in there? What else?

49
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:42,247
Nothing that's news.
You don't play well with others.

50
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:46,951
I think I've proven that I can...

51
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:50,688
- ...more than once.
- Not here.

52
00:03:50,722 --> 00:03:52,723
Towel down.

53
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:56,461
I need you both in the
command center in 5.

54
00:03:57,663 --> 00:04:00,065
At 08-00 hours,

55
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:03,133
three men infiltrated the
Havenworth federal penitentiary.

56
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:05,803
Infiltrated?
More like cannonballed.

57
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:08,005
They were in and out in
less then two minutes.

58
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,441
Left no prints at the scene,
but we do have one lead.

59
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:13,477
Centipede.

60
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:17,048
Seems they salvaged some of
their research from Hong Kong.

61
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:20,617
So we were right. Chan's platelets
solved their combustion problem.

62
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:23,153
Now they can create super soldiers
with no fear of explosion.

63
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:25,021
Maybe don't get so excited about it.

64
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:29,259
Two of Centipede's labs have been
destroyed, but they keep popping back up.

65
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:31,928
Now they have at least three
of these guys, maybe more.

66
00:04:31,963 --> 00:04:33,530
Who did they break out?

67
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:38,334
Edison Po, former Marine,
expert in tactics and rapid response.

68
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:40,937
He fell off the grid in '08,

69
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:43,339
reappeared 18 months
ago at a diner in Boston.

70
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:45,508
Where he stabbed a friend's eyes out.

71
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,944
With a steak knife,
then finished his meal.

72
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:50,546
That's funny.
Po doesn't look crazy.

73
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:54,049
I'm kidding.
The guy is a walking mug shot.

74
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:56,018
Which means he shouldn't
be too hard to track down.

75
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:59,822
Finding Po and these Centipede soldiers
is a top priority for S.H.I.E.L.D.

76
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:02,992
We'll be running point, but
we won't be working alone.

77
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:04,927
What team did HQ send for backup?

78
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:09,231
Not a team ... a person, someone
who can help us fight fire with fire.

79
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:12,835
- Somebody we worked with before?
- Not exactly.

80
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,259
Did I beat Captain America's time?

81
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:40,061
Not even close.

82
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:46,100
Excuse me.

83
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:50,590
- Agent Coulson?
- Mr. Peterson,

84
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:54,876
if you could put that bulldozer
back where you found it...

85
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,244
we need you to suit up.

86
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:11,678
This is a bad idea.

87
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:14,581
While I have you in a good mood,

88
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:16,549
you should know that Skye's
trying to I.D. the agent

89
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,251
that dropped her off at the orphanage.

90
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:21,287
We agreed to protect her from the truth,

91
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:25,364
so I told her you were looking into it.
She may come to you.

92
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:30,196
One mistake at a time.

93
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,264
Agent Coulson, Agent May.

94
00:06:35,435 --> 00:06:38,871
Last time you saw her, you
threw her into a brick wall.

95
00:06:38,905 --> 00:06:41,007
Right.

96
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,043
First time around, I
wasn't who I wanted to be,

97
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:47,513
but now I get it.
Having all this ... it's a privilege.

98
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:49,081
And training to be an agent,
working with S.H.I.E.L.D.,

99
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:52,150
it's me trying to do
better, trying to be better.

100
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:55,186
I just need you to give me a shot.

101
00:06:56,422 --> 00:07:00,868
Everyone deserves a second chance.
But let me be clear ...

102
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:03,061
there will not be a third.

103
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:05,698
- Understood, sir.
- Good.

104
00:07:05,752 --> 00:07:08,386
It's not good. At all.

105
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,588
The guy was a ticking
time bomb ... literally.

106
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:13,124
HQ wouldn't have sent him
if he was still combustible.

107
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:15,060
They must have found a way
to stabilize him somehow.

108
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:16,527
They stabilize his attitude?

109
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,730
'Cause he was pretty
hostile in Union Station.

110
00:07:18,764 --> 00:07:21,566
Well, it's not like we haven't opened
up our doors to other people ...

111
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,102
people with questionable track records.

112
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:27,171
Not cool, but true.

113
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:30,274
And don't worry about Mike.
He's a good guy.

114
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:31,743
Who's been in the Centipede program.

115
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:33,911
Exactly. He can give us
some superpower backup.

116
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:34,945
Yeah.

117
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,481
Just saying, this could
easily go sideways.

118
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:41,986
I mean, the last time we saw this guy,
he was a raging homicidal maniac ...

119
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:47,191
He's standing right behind me, isn't he?

120
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:50,694
Mr. Peterson,
this is Agent Grant Ward.

121
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:53,297
He's the man who shot
you at Union Station.

122
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:55,366
Fitz-Simmons designed
the weapon he used,

123
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,967
- and I think you remember ...
- Kidnap victim.

124
00:07:58,002 --> 00:08:00,303
You joined S.H.I.E.L.D.?

125
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:04,941
Yeah. Turns out, guys
in suits ... not so bad.

126
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:08,912
Look, I know Union Station
could have gone another way.

127
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:13,182
Another team might not have
let me out of there alive.

128
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:16,219
I owe you ... all off you.

129
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:19,722
That's bygones and water under
a distant bridge far away.

130
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:24,093
- How's your son?
- Still with my sister.

131
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:28,164
He thinks I'm working construction,
but he's good, happy.

132
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:31,634
- So, what do we have?
- Not much on Po.

133
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:33,469
I checked his previously known addresses

134
00:08:33,503 --> 00:08:36,271
and old military contacts...
came up empty.

135
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:38,273
We've been looking for where
Po might be on the outside.

136
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:41,244
Let's look at his life on
the inside ... at the prison.

137
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,914
See if that gets us any leads.
Anything on the Centipede soldiers?

138
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:47,449
We found a facial recog
match on one of them.

139
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:49,284
Name's Brian Hayward.

140
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:50,953
Stationed in Afghanistan
for three years,

141
00:08:50,987 --> 00:08:53,088
then fell of the radar when he got back.

142
00:08:53,122 --> 00:08:56,891
Only living relative ... sister, Laura,
Sophomore at the University of Ohio.

143
00:08:56,926 --> 00:09:00,595
She's our best shot at finding Hayward.
You and I will go talk to her.

144
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:02,230
Have May set a course for Cleveland.

145
00:09:09,972 --> 00:09:13,274
With all the high-tech gadgets
and gizmos at our disposal,

146
00:09:13,308 --> 00:09:18,112
it's easy to forget about
the simple tools of the past.

147
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:21,983
What can I do for you?

148
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:23,684
I'm just curious about
what you want me to do,

149
00:09:23,718 --> 00:09:26,553
- where you need me.
- Here, on the plane.

150
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:28,389
But shouldn't I be out in the field?

151
00:09:28,423 --> 00:09:30,691
I mean, that's why you
brought me here, right?

152
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:32,059
You'll get your chance.

153
00:09:32,094 --> 00:09:34,261
Right now I need you to go
down to the lab for some tests.

154
00:09:34,296 --> 00:09:37,564
I'm stable.
They already tested me at Sci-Ops.

155
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:41,602
I know. I also know that
using your powers takes a toll.

156
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:45,939
I need to understand your limits,
for your sake as well as my team's.

157
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:50,477
The lab's downstairs.

158
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:54,680
I have to put away four times what
I used to just to keep my energy up.

159
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:56,483
Uh, and after you use your strength?

160
00:09:56,517 --> 00:10:00,387
Maybe 10 times the food?
And I usually crash afterwards.

161
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:05,725
- It's really hard on my body.
- Hard body. Got it.

162
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,394
You do know we have equipment
that can take measurements.

163
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:10,596
- No need to do it manually.
- My mistake.

164
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:13,933
Well, no matter. I'll send the
numbers to you straight away.

165
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:17,102
I need measurements to
build you a diagnostic suit

166
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:19,505
so we can monitor your
vitals in the field.

167
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,642
As for fabrics, how does a polymer blend

168
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:25,678
with 10 layers of treated
composite material sound?

169
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:30,182
- Sounds great?
- Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

170
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:34,328
Uh...
Sorry.

171
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:37,122
I'm sorry. I was ...
I was just looking at it, and ...

172
00:10:37,157 --> 00:10:39,124
Oh, no, it's okay.
I'm used to it.

173
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:42,127
They tried to take it off
me at the Sci-Ops facility.

174
00:10:42,162 --> 00:10:44,074
Realized they couldn't
do it without killing me.

175
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:45,496
I'm afraid we're terribly curious.

176
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:47,601
How did they stabilize
the Extremis in you?

177
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:49,434
- And keep you from exploding?
- Yeah.

178
00:10:49,468 --> 00:10:52,403
Oh, that wasn't them.
That was you two.

179
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:54,773
- Come again?
- What's that?

180
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:58,076
Your gun.
It somehow froze me

181
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,044
right at the moment I
was about to explode,

182
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,281
helped my body absorb
the serum, stabilize.

183
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:08,419
- Your weapon saved my life.
- Well...

184
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:11,089
All that, and it didn't
even leave a scar, so...

185
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:13,124
- Well, I...
- Well, I should think not.

186
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:15,726
Yeah, we couldn't have that, could we?

187
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,961
It would be a shame,

188
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:19,597
especially when you're so,
well, formed and symmetrical.

189
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:22,232
And wh...
when did you stop talking?

190
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,702
About three embarrassing sentences ago.

191
00:11:24,736 --> 00:11:27,437
Yes, right.

192
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:38,548
"Psychology of women:
Unraveling the female psyche."

193
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,882
That's an actual book?

194
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:44,020
It's a whole course.
Hayward's sister's in there now.

195
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:48,625
We'll be at the school in 10.
We'll catch her on her way out.

196
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:52,095
Whole class... on women.

197
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:55,464
Time was, you just
had to figure them out.

198
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:57,466
Solving the puzzle was half the fun.

199
00:11:57,501 --> 00:12:00,369
You solve a lot of puzzles in your day?

200
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:06,642
A few.
Some more worth it than others.

201
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:10,045
One was... especially rewarding.

202
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,583
- What happened?
- I died.

203
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:18,854
Oh.
I guess she wasn't level 7, sir?

204
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:24,993
She was a cellist, second
chair, Portland symphony.

205
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:27,963
Saw her play whenever I was in town.

206
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,700
Ever see a beautiful
woman play the cello?

207
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:35,303
It's something else.

208
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:39,274
She laughed at my jokes, too,
which was a very nice bonus.

209
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:43,344
- You know where she is now?
- Of course I do.

210
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:50,084
- I'm sorry, sir.
- I was gone for months.

211
00:12:50,118 --> 00:12:51,886
The Avengers thought I was dead,

212
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,657
so I had to keep that up ...
S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol.

213
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,893
It's probably better this way.

214
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:01,295
Maybe if she'd been
part of the agency...

215
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:05,632
In my experience, that's
just asking for trouble.

216
00:13:12,973 --> 00:13:14,241
Hey.

217
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:19,479
Coulson told me you were
helping to, you know,

218
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:22,082
find my long-lost folks, so thanks.

219
00:13:22,116 --> 00:13:25,219
I'm glad you're in on this with me.
It means a lot.

220
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:29,555
Right, I can tell
you're really into this.

221
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,092
Um, I've done a lot of
the heavy lifting already,

222
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:33,593
came up with a short list.
I thought you might ...

223
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:37,430
We're on a mission, Skye.
Is this why you called me here?

224
00:13:37,464 --> 00:13:42,102
No. I was just working on
this while I waited for you.

225
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:44,270
Uh, I called 'cause I
found something about Po.

226
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:46,105
Show me.

227
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:49,642
Po only had one visitor during
his prison stint ... her.

228
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:50,743
You notice the outfit?

229
00:13:50,777 --> 00:13:53,879
Miles said a girl in a flower dress
asked him to hack S.H.I.E.L.D.

230
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:55,914
This could be the same girl.

231
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:58,117
- Can we hear the conversation?
- That's the bummer ...

232
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:00,453
there was no audio, but
it's not a total loss.

233
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:02,921
I was able to use S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
lip-reading program,

234
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:05,057
because we have one of those!

235
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:07,676
It didn't work on the girl
because she never

236
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:08,593
looks up at the camera,

237
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:12,330
but Po did ... once ...
and it caught this.

238
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,034
The Clairvoyant does
not like to be touched.

239
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:18,370
I wrote that down,

240
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:21,172
so we don't have to
hear that again ... ever.

241
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:23,642
- The Clairvoyant.
- Yeah.

242
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:25,677
Does that mean anything to you?

243
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:29,748
But it means something to them ...
to Po and whoever that woman is.

244
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:32,917
- Her name's Raina.
- You know her?

245
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:35,419
Yeah, she recruited me for Centipede,

246
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:38,122
came up to me at the hospital
where I did my back therapy

247
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:42,226
out of the blue.
Told me she could change my life.

248
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:02,413
Nice to cut my own meat again.

249
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:04,415
The steak was to your liking?

250
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:07,417
Overcooked, and the ambience...

251
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:10,153
We're not here for the decor.

252
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:15,826
We've stabilized the
serum, added the implant,

253
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,161
and now we need the Clairvoyant's help

254
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:19,896
in finding the key to stage three.

255
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:22,866
I've asked before.
The Clairvoyant has trouble seeing

256
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,069
the man you're looking
for and his weaknesses.

257
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:31,974
I don't mean to upset you.
It's the way of things.

258
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:33,810
This is what's upsetting me.

259
00:15:35,145 --> 00:15:38,214
This S.H.I.E.L.D. teams has
destroyed two of our operations.

260
00:15:38,248 --> 00:15:41,917
We move every few days now
to be safe.

261
00:15:41,952 --> 00:15:47,923
Which causes challenges for
our maintenance problems.

262
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,560
We can't overstate the toll
this takes on our soldiers.

263
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:53,729
They are drained after every mission.

264
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:01,302
Our men need regular
injections, constant upkeep.

265
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:04,673
Difficult when S.H.I.E.L.D.
has us on the run.

266
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:09,043
Then it's time to stop running.

267
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:18,631
We're running
her through our systems.  

268
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,260
Maybe we can get an I.D.,
but we're guessing

269
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:23,000
she's Centipede's recruiter
and Po's her latest recruit.

270
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:26,371
Three super soldiers dive-bomb
a prison, pluck him out?

271
00:16:26,405 --> 00:16:28,739
He's her number-one draft pick.

272
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:29,641
But why him?

273
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:31,576
Centipede's making more soldiers.

274
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,646
Maybe they want Po to
coordinate them, lead them.

275
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,281
His background's tactical strategy.
He fits the bill.

276
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:41,251
So, these guys have super soldiers,
an expert military strategist,

277
00:16:41,286 --> 00:16:42,753
and a Clairvoyant who
can see the future.

278
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:44,755
Anyone else thinking
about switching teams?

279
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,190
They couldn't have a psychic.

280
00:16:46,224 --> 00:16:49,126
There are none on the index.
They're a myth.

281
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:51,428
- So was Thor.
- Maybe it's an alias.

282
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:54,498
Run it through our database
and see if anything pops up.

283
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:57,155
Ward is approaching
Hayward's sister now.

284
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:01,564
- Laura Hayward?
- That's me.

285
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,575
Sorry to bother you,
But I was hoping you could help me out.

286
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:07,842
- I hope so, too.
- I'm looking for you brother, Brian.

287
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:11,347
- Have you seen him lately?
- I'm ... I'm sorry. Who are you?

288
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:16,720
Ah. Dan Filch,
Ohio State gaming commission.

289
00:17:16,754 --> 00:17:20,256
We're trying to contact
Brian, tell him the good news.

290
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,127
- He won the lottery?
- $50,000.

291
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:27,129
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

292
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:29,998
And you're looking for him?
Don't you guys want to keep the money?

293
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,201
Sure, but we have to at least
try and contact the winners

294
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:35,572
before the ticket expires.
Your brother's does in six days,

295
00:17:35,573 --> 00:17:39,141
- so if you know where he is ...
- I don't. Sorry. We're not close.

296
00:17:39,175 --> 00:17:42,545
I haven't spoken to him since
he got back from Afghanistan.

297
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:47,315
Well, now you have a reason to ...
50,000 reasons, actually.

298
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:50,485
So let us know if you hear from him.

299
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,121
Okay.

300
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,961
Not sure why you wanted to go
with the lottery story, sir.

301
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,596
- It's a tough sell.
- Exactly.

302
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:03,965
Nothing makes people more suspicious

303
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:08,270
than a handsome man
offering them free money.

304
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:10,672
She's making the call now.

305
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,009
Brian, it's me.

306
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:18,946
Some guy was just waiting for me
at school, said you won the lottery.

307
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:23,751
I know, right?
We're not that lucky.

308
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:30,457
- Is he local?
- No. He's in Oakland, California.

309
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,273
Come in!

310
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:52,512
Oh, it almost looks homey.

311
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:55,048
Is that Ace?

312
00:18:58,286 --> 00:19:01,955
What a cutie.

313
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:05,825
He must be so proud of you,
his dad working for S.H.I.E.L.D.

314
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:09,161
Which he can't know with
everything being classified.

315
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:10,996
That's all right.
He knows I'm working.

316
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:12,699
Called him on his birthday

317
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:15,368
and gave him all
the "Heroes of New York" action figures.

318
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:17,443
Nice.

319
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:24,276
- Are you two close?
- We're a team.

320
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:27,146
I'd do anything for this little guy.

321
00:19:28,815 --> 00:19:33,886
It's got to be the best feeling,
son looking up to you

322
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,855
who wants to grow up
to be just like you.

323
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:40,084
Yeah.
Looks like he's growing fast, though.

324
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:52,471
You said you wanted your shot.
Here it is.

325
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:57,458
I won't let you down.

326
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:05,984
- I think it's quite smart.
- How does it feel?

327
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:08,875
Feels good. Comfortable.

328
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:12,055
Having powers is cheating,
but the suit's pretty cool.

329
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,828
It's perfect for an array
of tactical missions.

330
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:17,862
Yeah, also measures your heart rate,
systolic pressures, and glucose levels.

331
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:20,330
All while providing state-of-the-art
ballistic protection.

332
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:22,767
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

333
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:25,569
- Oh, no. Thank you.
- We've never been so proud.

334
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:26,970
Hayward's
cellphone has been traced

335
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:30,407
to an abandoned factory
about eight miles from here.

336
00:20:30,441 --> 00:20:32,542
Probably Centipede's new lab.

337
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:34,711
Certainly been there M.O...
we destroy one factory,

338
00:20:34,745 --> 00:20:37,381
they set up another, putting
us back to square one.

339
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:39,831
- This time, I want answers.
- Means we go in quiet,

340
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:41,851
do minimal damage to the
facility and the people inside.

341
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:45,254
Ward, May, you'll go in
through the west entrance.

342
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,123
Mr. Peterson and I will enter
through the loading dock.

343
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:49,291
You'll run the back end from outside.

344
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:51,226
We're doing this just us?

345
00:20:51,261 --> 00:20:53,395
We've been playing
whack-a-mole with these guys

346
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,797
since Ward first
picked me out of my van.

347
00:20:55,832 --> 00:20:57,980
Shouldn't big S.H.I.E.L.D.
be sending in backup?

348
00:20:58,113 --> 00:21:00,535
Trust me, they already did.

349
00:21:02,572 --> 00:21:04,272
Let's move.

350
00:21:05,842 --> 00:21:07,241
No pressure.

351
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:24,292
- We alone here?
- It appears so.

352
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,060
The only heat signatures
we're reading are yours.

353
00:21:26,095 --> 00:21:28,997
But there's a weird electronic signal.
I'm trying to isolate it.

354
00:21:30,031 --> 00:21:34,135
Place looks emptied out.
Think we're too late?

355
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,703
Fitz, dial Hayward's number.

356
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:37,571
Find out.

357
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,020
Uh, sir, you've got company.

358
00:21:53,054 --> 00:21:54,388
Yeah, we do.

359
00:21:58,459 --> 00:22:00,793
Coming your way.

360
00:22:16,744 --> 00:22:20,312
- Usually packs a bigger punch.
- Yeah, I remember.

361
00:23:02,654 --> 00:23:03,921
What's happening?

362
00:23:03,956 --> 00:23:06,257
His systolic and diastolic
pressures are dropping.

363
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:08,793
- Heart rate's plummeting, as well.
- Sir, he's in bad shape.

364
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:10,361
Between the physical
exertion and this wound,

365
00:23:10,396 --> 00:23:11,862
his vitals are dangerously low.

366
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:37,787
Who's behind Centipede?
Who's doing this?!

367
00:23:37,822 --> 00:23:42,092
I won't say anything.
I promise.

368
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:47,764
No! Please! Don't do th...

369
00:24:03,413 --> 00:24:08,917
That's Mike Peterson,
one of our first subjects.

370
00:24:08,952 --> 00:24:12,622
He hasn't been injected with the serum
in awhile, but he still has his powers.

371
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:19,162
No. What he has is
your key to stage 3.

372
00:24:25,729 --> 00:24:28,662
The one on the
left is Akela Amador's.  

373
00:24:28,696 --> 00:24:29,797
Hayward's is on the right.

374
00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:31,365
Now, his prosthetic
was slightly damaged,

375
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:33,901
but based on digital reconstruction,
we can now confirm

376
00:24:33,935 --> 00:24:36,936
that the technology
is virtually identical.

377
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:39,105
Hayward's prosthetic has the
same internal power source,

378
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,882
backscatter capabilities,
and biomechanics as Amador.

379
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,778
So Centipede also
designed the eye implant?

380
00:24:44,812 --> 00:24:48,415
- These guys are serious multitaskers.
- Who's akela Amador?

381
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:50,216
Former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent,

382
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:52,718
the first person we encountered
with this eye technology,

383
00:24:52,753 --> 00:24:56,256
a good agent who was forced
to do some bad things.

384
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:59,926
- We helped her.
- Kind of a pattern with you guys.

385
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,328
So then ... those
soldiers at the warehouse

386
00:25:02,362 --> 00:25:05,899
were forced to attack us
through that eye thing?

387
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:09,402
They were getting orders.
When the tide turned in our favor,

388
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:14,106
Centipede flipped Hayward's kill switch,
told the other guys to run.

389
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,509
Can you track the eye feed like
before, find their location?

390
00:25:16,543 --> 00:25:20,222
Nope ... they've upgraded since Amador.
Their feed's untraceable now.

391
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:24,417
Their technology keeps advancing
at a disturbingly rapid pace.

392
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:27,119
They must have endless
manpower, resources.

393
00:25:27,153 --> 00:25:29,121
And someone with a fat wallet.

394
00:25:29,155 --> 00:25:31,483
Po's the strategist.
Raina's the recruiter.

395
00:25:31,518 --> 00:25:34,045
- Perhaps this Clairvoyant's the money.
- That makes sense.

396
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,948
If I could see the future,
I'd go straight to Las Vegas.

397
00:25:35,982 --> 00:25:38,483
Whoever's behind them
may or may not be psychic,

398
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:41,453
but they're one step
ahead of us every time.

399
00:25:41,487 --> 00:25:45,457
I need to update HQ.
This is bigger than we thought.

400
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,634
- I spoke with the Clairvoyant.
- And?

401
00:25:56,669 --> 00:26:00,904
I'll share the information
when the time is right.

402
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:06,410
I would love to hear much
more than just... information.

403
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:09,847
Will you... tell me what he's like?

404
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:13,108
Never.

405
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:20,457
The last person who tried
to learn these things

406
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:22,793
got a knife for it.

407
00:26:22,827 --> 00:26:25,562
I don't want to have
to do that again, Raina.

408
00:26:25,597 --> 00:26:29,060
You have such pretty eyes.

409
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:36,306
I understand.
You can't even whisper to me about him.

410
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:42,311
No, I can't. But I did tell
the Clairvoyant about you.

411
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:47,682
Spoke at length about your many virtues.

412
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,622
How sweet.

413
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,941
- I'll pour you a Scotch.
- Don't ever do that again.

414
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:17,878
- Brandy, then?
- When we're out in the field,

415
00:27:17,913 --> 00:27:20,748
your head needs to be
on the op, not on me.

416
00:27:20,782 --> 00:27:23,984
Time-out.
Still playing catch-up here.

417
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,820
- What are you talking about?
- You taking a punch for me?

418
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:30,457
- I don't need your protection.
- You think I don't know that?

419
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:32,492
I took that punch 'cause
you're faster than me.

420
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:34,361
You could do more good on your feet.

421
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:39,567
- It was tactical, not personal.
- My mistake.

422
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:43,903
I am not some recruit who can't
separate church from state.

423
00:27:43,938 --> 00:27:46,540
I'm on the same page as you.

424
00:27:46,574 --> 00:27:49,309
So don't flatter yourself.

425
00:27:55,248 --> 00:27:58,844
Sorry. I didn't mean to crash.

426
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:04,016
What do you want?
This about that thumb drive again?

427
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:06,492
- No.
- Good.

428
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:08,027
Look, I get that you don't
want to help with that

429
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:10,263
loud and clear, big
neon, flashing lights.

430
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:12,382
- But I didn't ask, okay? Coulson ...
- Coulson doesn't want

431
00:28:12,383 --> 00:28:15,835
to tell you the truth.
The truth is...

432
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:19,738
You have to decide why you're here.

433
00:28:19,772 --> 00:28:22,425
We have a mission, and it's
not to find your parents.

434
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,526
If you can't put aside
your personal attachments,

435
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:27,546
then you shouldn't be here!

436
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,859
- Oh, come on in.
- Thanks.

437
00:29:14,893 --> 00:29:18,796
- You doing okay?
- Afraid I won't be...

438
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,666
much good to you for
the next couple days.

439
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,832
That's understandable.

440
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:26,370
You went above and
beyond at that warehouse,

441
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:31,107
- had our backs more than once.
- Thank you, sir.

442
00:29:31,252 --> 00:29:34,488
But I know Centipede's still out there.
No, we still got a lot of work to do.

443
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:40,059
True. But according to your
S.O., hard work's your specialty.

444
00:29:41,762 --> 00:29:45,031
- Said you train 24/7.
- I want to be the best.

445
00:29:45,065 --> 00:29:47,466
And that's admirable.

446
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:51,070
But you hadn't left the training
facility since you got there,

447
00:29:51,105 --> 00:29:54,073
Which means you haven't seen
your son since Union Station.

448
00:29:56,108 --> 00:30:00,813
Ace is fine.
We... we talk all the time.

449
00:30:01,847 --> 00:30:06,585
But you haven't been to see him.
Why?

450
00:30:10,223 --> 00:30:11,724
Mike!

451
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,298
Because the last time he saw me...

452
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:24,236
I was a monster.
My kid saw that.

453
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:29,741
You can't fix that from here.
And staying away, not being there...

454
00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:38,015
I've seen firsthand
the kind of damage that can do.

455
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,153
The last thing I want to do is hurt Ace.

456
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:46,475
He's... he's my son, but...

457
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,195
- maybe he's better off without me.
- I don't think that's true.

458
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,866
When I took this job, I made a choice,

459
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,269
the same choice everyone
else here made ...

460
00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:00,872
this life over the other one,

461
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:07,411
the one with holiday dinners
and PTA meetings, recitals.

462
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:11,014
It's not easy.

463
00:31:11,717 --> 00:31:16,547
But if the time comes to make
the hard call, it's simpler.

464
00:31:17,455 --> 00:31:19,689
But you have a son.

465
00:31:19,723 --> 00:31:22,959
You have someone waiting
for you to come home.

466
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:26,882
You need to think about that.

467
00:31:27,487 --> 00:31:29,499
You need to think about him.

468
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:33,377
Before you make your choice.

469
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:52,321
Hello?

470
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:55,391
- Hey, Ace.
- Dad!

471
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:58,660
It is so good to hear your voice, buddy.

472
00:31:58,694 --> 00:31:59,861
And I got some good news ...

473
00:31:59,896 --> 00:32:01,630
I'm gonna get to come home
and see you for a bit.

474
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:05,377
Awesome! Then maybe you
can meet my new friend.

475
00:32:05,412 --> 00:32:09,070
She said she knows you.
She's here right now.

476
00:32:09,104 --> 00:32:12,741
Ace, who's there with you?
Where's your Aunt Mindy?

477
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:16,010
Hello, Mike.

478
00:32:16,045 --> 00:32:20,375
Remember when I told you
I could change your life?

479
00:32:28,204 --> 00:32:31,071
They want a trade ...
Ace for his father.

480
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:33,539
- They've set a time and a place.
- Bloody savages.

481
00:32:33,574 --> 00:32:36,275
They want to experiment on him,
determine how he still has his abilities.

482
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,727
And we're gonna let them?
We've fought these guys before.

483
00:32:38,762 --> 00:32:39,112
We don't have a choice.

484
00:32:39,146 --> 00:32:41,647
The instructions they gave
Mr. Peterson were very specific.

485
00:32:41,682 --> 00:32:43,349
I called HQ, told them to stand down.

486
00:32:43,383 --> 00:32:45,685
- Stand down?
- So we take them alone.

487
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:48,321
We should at least have a
hostage-rescue unit In support of this.

488
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:50,723
They said they would murder my son.

489
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:55,428
If we make one wrong move.

490
00:32:55,462 --> 00:32:59,598
Any electronics, any comms,
any sign of surveillance

491
00:32:59,632 --> 00:33:02,164
and they'll terminate the arrangement.

492
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:04,069
I'll give myself up, no
problem, get him back.

493
00:33:04,104 --> 00:33:07,305
- I can figure it out from there.
- You're still recovering.

494
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,175
We can't just hand you over
to them like that, can we?

495
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,411
Fitz-Simmons have a non-electronic
method of tracking him.

496
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:16,130
Simmons has fabricated
an odorless scent.

497
00:33:16,165 --> 00:33:17,481
I have an instrument
which can detect it.

498
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:20,585
Works like a bloodhound, can track
someone from over 50 kilometers.

499
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,122
After we make the trade,
we'll be able to follow Mr. Peterson.

500
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:26,524
Buy him some time to get his
strength back. We'll find him.

501
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,427
I don't care what happens to me.
As long as my boy is...

502
00:33:31,764 --> 00:33:36,834
I promise you, we're
gonna get your son back.

503
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,626
At least let me escort
him out for the exchange.

504
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:04,961
Mr. Peterson requested me.

505
00:34:04,996 --> 00:34:08,671
I'm comfortable with that,
and if things go South,

506
00:34:08,706 --> 00:34:11,334
I need you back here,
taking point on the team.

507
00:34:11,368 --> 00:34:15,807
- Is Ward in position?
- Yes.

508
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,341
But I don't like any of this.

509
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:21,931
There'd be something
wrong with you if you did.

510
00:34:27,516 --> 00:34:31,220
Once the swap happens,
I'll fire up my equipment.

511
00:34:31,254 --> 00:34:33,623
We'll be able to track
you wherever they take you.

512
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:36,091
Just don't do anything
that'll endanger my son.

513
00:34:36,126 --> 00:34:38,027
We won't, but we want to make sure

514
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:42,031
Ace has his dad at the
end of the day, too.

515
00:34:42,065 --> 00:34:43,799
Time to go.

516
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:20,601
My team won't let you down.

517
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:22,636
It wasn't supposed to go down like this.

518
00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:24,672
I'm gonna make this right, I swear.

519
00:35:28,942 --> 00:35:30,511
Damn it.

520
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:44,858
Hello, Mike. It's been awhile.

521
00:35:46,494 --> 00:35:52,832
Your son is adorable,
and he looks just like you.

522
00:35:53,867 --> 00:35:57,871
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

523
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,106
Lucky for you.

524
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,445
I have to thank you, Mike,
for holding up your end of the deal.

525
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:10,316
Let's just make the trade.
Give us Ace, and you can have him.

526
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,586
Oh, that wasn't the deal.

527
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:17,990
I'm so sorry.

528
00:36:20,827 --> 00:36:24,830
Let me know when I can
activate comms and the tracker.

529
00:36:24,864 --> 00:36:26,832
What's happening here, Mike?

530
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:32,504
Well, in exchange for his son,
we asked Mike to deliver you.

531
00:36:42,148 --> 00:36:45,359
I'm not at full strength, but I can
still crush your throat. New deal!

532
00:36:45,394 --> 00:36:47,519
My son for your life!

533
00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:51,856
Sadly, my employer cares no
more for my life than your son's.

534
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:58,863
If I die, so does he,
and his death will be so much worse.

535
00:37:00,433 --> 00:37:05,269
- You need to let her go.
- I told them they could have me.

536
00:37:05,303 --> 00:37:08,372
But they want you.
Why do they want you?

537
00:37:08,406 --> 00:37:13,644
I don't know, but if you kill this
woman, you'll never see your son again.

538
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,114
But how will I look him in the eye?

539
00:37:17,448 --> 00:37:20,351
How will I explain what I did?

540
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:23,287
We talked about this.

541
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:30,961
I'm so sorry.

542
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:42,138
Let's finish this.

543
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:52,181
Dad!

544
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:56,395
There's his son.

545
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,554
Oh, thank god. I have
no stomach for this.

546
00:37:58,588 --> 00:38:01,424
On my mark, activate comms and tracker.

547
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:15,370
- If there had been any other way...
- You made the only choice you had.

548
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,727
What happened?
They've taken Coulson.

549
00:38:39,762 --> 00:38:42,097
All right, call it in.
We need backup.

550
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:44,799
I have a shot.

551
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:47,802
Do not engage.
They'll kill Coulson.

552
00:38:47,836 --> 00:38:50,038
Stand down. I'll contact HQ.

553
00:38:51,406 --> 00:38:54,842
- You okay?
- I'm fine, Dad.

554
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:56,978
S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ,
this is S.H.I.E.L.D. RG422.

555
00:38:57,012 --> 00:38:59,280
We need immediate satellite support.

556
00:39:00,314 --> 00:39:03,517
Ace, I've got to make something right.

557
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:07,754
Daddy loves you so much,
okay? Stay with Skye.

558
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:10,958
You remember Skye, right?
Keep him safe.

559
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:12,126
Take care of my boy!

560
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:19,900
Nooo!

561
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:25,072
Mike!

562
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,945
Where's Coulson?

563
00:39:35,615 --> 00:39:39,319
Oh, my god.
Coulson.

564
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:24,074
- We land in half an hour.
- Good.

565
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:27,110
The sooner we begin, the better.

566
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:32,816
Whatever this is, whatever
you think you're doing,

567
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:36,586
it won't work.
I won't give you what you want.

568
00:40:36,621 --> 00:40:40,624
You will.
And we want is simple.

569
00:40:42,026 --> 00:40:47,663
We want you to tell us
about the day after you died.

570
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:54,332

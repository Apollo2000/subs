What are you doing here?

96
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,160

99

Should I bring the kids over?
They're asking about you.

100
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,200
Don't bring them here,
it's a house of death.

101

They're your kids, they want to see you.

102
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,760
Gali, you shouldn't be here either,
go home.

103
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,200
You're not the only one who lost him.

104
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,240
Your kids lost their grandpa, too,
you know.

105
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,440
You need to get up

You don't get it.

107

You just don't get it.

108
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,320
When Boaz died,

109
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,680
I didn't know how to cope with it,
but Noga was so young,

110
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
I couldn't let myself sink.

111
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,040
And you can't let yourself sink either.

112
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,800
Gali, for your own sake,

113
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,120
keep yourself and the kids away from me.

114
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,000
Keep away from me.

115
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,640
-I'm so sorry.
-About what?

116
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,000
About...

117
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,320
how things ended between us.

118
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,400
You need to get out of here.
Will you come stay with us for a few days?

119
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,320
I'll prepare a room for you.

120
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,440
The Secret Service
found a nice place for us.

121
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,360
The kids would be thrilled
if you stayed with us a bit.

122
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,200
We'd all be together.

123
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,080
I don't want them to see me like this.

124
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,600
I'm finished.

125
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,240
I'm dead.

126
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,080
-I'm dead.
-Don't say that.

127
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,160
Hey, I'm here with you.

128
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,800
I'm here.

129
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,440
I'm worried about you and the kids.

130
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,840
Whoever comes near me dies.

131
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,200
I'm sorry.

132
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,240
I'm sorry...

133
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,880
I apologize.

134
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,320
I'm sorry.

135
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,400
You mean a lot to me, okay?
Take care of yourself. For me, okay?

136
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,080
And you know I'm here for you
if you need me.

137
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,760
Okay?

138
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,360
Okay.

139
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,640
-Hey, Gali.
-I just left his house.

140
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,520

<i>I think you guys should get here.</i>

142
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,680
I understand.

143
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,880
[What's the occasion?]

144
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,960
[No occasion.
Hanan made these and brought me some.]

145
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,320
[Why do you even talk to her?]

146
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,080
[She's an old woman, Samir,
she doesn't know what's going on.]

147
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,080
[Poor lady.]

148
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,360
[What is it, Samir?]

149
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,440
[To be honest, Nidal,]

150
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,160
[I don't understand you anymore.]

151
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,200
[You tell me not to see my wife]

152
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,560
[and to trust no one.]

153
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,840
[I get it, we're under siege.
But then you go and chat with a woman]

154
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,200
[who's affiliated
with the Palestinian Authority.]

155
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,120
[You think she won't double-cross you?]

156
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,080
[On the contrary.
She's shielding us from them.]

157
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,640
[Nobody would come near an elderly woman.]

158
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,000
[That's precisely
why I chose this apartment.]

159
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,960
[-What if she rats us out?]
[-Why would she?]

160
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,200
[Because people like her
don't like people like us.]

161
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,880
[I wish I understood your reasons.]

162
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,840
[Samir, that's enough.]

163
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,880
[Just trust me.]

164
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,440
[I don't need preaching about what Dad
would say, certainly not from you.]

165
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,680
[He had a hard time
when you were living in Europe.]

166
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,400
[It bothered me to see him get agitated
whenever your name came up.]

167
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,840
[I didn't understand why.]

168
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,320
[I figured...
he ought to be proud of you.]

169
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,080
[Instead, he suffered. It pained him
to hear that you were doing drugs]

170
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,560
[and going to hookers in Amsterdam.] [But Abu Nidal was a strong man.]

171
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,160
[He kept working and giving speeches
until the very end, like a lion.]

172
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,640
[As if nothing was wrong.]

173
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,760
[I was lost.
I wasn't the Nidal you know today.]

174
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,600
[I was going through a rough patch
and tried to escape from it all.]

175
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,840
[I'm doing all this
to repent for my sins.]

176
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,440
[How exactly?]

177
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,800
[By not calling home anymore?]

178
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,240
[Or by joining ISIS?]

179
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,400
[You think Dad didn't know about it?]

180
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,280
[You're the one who killed him, Nidal,
not the Jews.]

181
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,760
[The Jews simply made him a Shahid,]

182
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,920
[but he had already died
long before that.]

183
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,000
[Not a day went by
where I didn't try to contact him,]

184
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,800
[but he wouldn't take the call.]

185
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,800
[I begged Mom to convince him,]

186
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,200
[but he wouldn't have it.]

187
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,000
[And why?]

188
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,800
[Because I wasn't with Hamas.]

189
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,400
[Is that any reason for a father
to shun his eldest son?]

190
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,040
[Samir,]

191
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,600
[Abu Nidal died a Shahid.]

192
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,480
[He died.] [He died...]

193
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,160
[He died, still angry with me.]

194
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
[You still think it's my fault?]

195
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,600
<i>Doron!</i>

196
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,280
Greetings and salutations, buddy.

197
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,360
-Good evening.
-What are you doing here? It's late.

198
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,800
We'll be leaving soon.
We just popped in for a visit, bro.

199
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,040
"Popped in"? What's all this stuff?

200
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,680
The entire team is on their way,
we're starving.

201
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,440
Come on out, I'll work the grill.

202
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,960
-You coming?
-Yes.

203
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,640
I'll just put my shoes on.

204
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,280
Cheers, pal.

205
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,000
How are you doing?

206
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,760
How am I doing?

207
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,760
Can't leave you alone with a girl
for a minute, huh?

208
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,320
Nice catch.

209
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,040
Here they come.

210
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,760
The whole clan is here.

211
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,040
<i>[No, man, I don't think so.]</i>

212
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,120
<i>[I know how these youngsters</i>
<i>get lured in by ISIS,]</i>

213
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,000
<i>[but it takes two to tango.]</i>

214
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,840
<i>[Trust me, the guy is filled</i>
<i>with hatred and resentment.]</i>

215
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,320
<i>[He'll end up alone, mark my words.</i>
<i>Alone!]</i>

216
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,680
<i>[Someday you'll see that I,</i>
<i>Abu Maher, was right.]</i>

217
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,480
Talk to me.

218
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,920
-Chuck Nurit, rare?
-Medium, Steve. I hate blood.

219
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,200
Like hell you do...

220
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,240
You love blood. You're bloodthirsty.

221
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,360
-And you? Steak? Kebab?
-I trust the chef.

222
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,960
If he grills as good as he drives,
then good luck to us all.

223
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,880
Come here, your meat is ready.

224
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,520
There you go, buddy.

225
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,720
Thanks, pal.

226
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,480
-Have some foreskin, you prick.
-I'd like a foreskin shish kebab, please.

227
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,200
Play something refreshing.

228
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,320
<i>Lisa is the fairest of them all</i>

229

<i>Her beauty is unmatched</i>

230
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,440
<i>I am left here with the memories</i>

231
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,360
<i>Since she went away</i>

232

<i>Daybreak will come, I promise</i>

234
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,960
<i>And Lisa will surprise yet again</i>

235
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,320

Doron...

243

Leave him alone.

244
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,320
-Maybe we went too far.
-Poor guy.

245
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,280
[Thanks.]

246
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,680
The barbershop operation is all set.

247
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,360
Everyone's ready.

248
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,920
I can't.

249
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,840
I've lost my edge.

250
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,560
What are you talking about?

251
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,200
I don’t want to put you guys at risk.

252
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,000
Bro, I need you there.

253
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,520
We set up cameras
at all their meeting points.

254
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,440
He's bound to come there for sure.
If you're in, then I'm calm.

255
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,720
I'm not in.

256
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,640
Bro, if you do this,

257
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,440
I'll go in with you.

258
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,080
Like old times, you and me, okay?

259
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,960
We'll have each other's back. Together.

260
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,960
I love you, bro, but I can't do it.

261
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,720
I love you, too.

262
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,000
Listen,

263
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,680
I know what happened to Shirin.

264
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,920
I know how you feel right now.

265
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,920
You have to go out there and kill
the son of a bitch who killed your father.

266
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,680
And that's it.

267
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,400
You know that.

268
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,760
He won't stop.

269
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,240
He won't stop until we put a stop to it.

270
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,520
You have to kill him.
You and no one else.

271
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,960
[Blood for blood.]

272
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,120
For you,

273

for your father,

274
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,760
and for Shirin.

275
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,000
Got it?

276
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,680
If you don't do this,
you'll never forgive yourself. [Welcome, Um Omar, what an honor.]

277
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,360
[Thank you, Abu Maher,
thank you for seeing me.]

278
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,000
[Don't mention it. Abu Omar
helped me a lot back in the day.]

279
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,280
[I'll never forget what
your husband did for me.]

280
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,600
[-Did you offer Um Omar any refreshments?]
[-Of course! Coffee is on its way.]

281
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,240
[After you.]

282
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,800
[-Bring a cigarette pack with you.]
[-Yes, sir.]

283
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,680
[Welcome.]

284
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,200
[What an honor.]

285
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,840
[Have a seat.]

286
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,920
[How can I help you?]

287
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,400
[-Don't hesitate.]
[-Thank you.]

[I don't know
if this means anything, but...]

290

[I've rented out my downstairs unit.
You've been to our house once, remember?]

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,160
[Long ago, before the death of Abu Omar,]

[-may he rest in peace.]
[-Bless you.]

293
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,440
[Well,
I've rented out the downstairs unit]

294

-Hey!
-Hey.

300
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,880
-Are you alright?
-Yes.

301
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,880
Just wanted to see the kids.

302
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,640
Sure, come in.

303

Yes.

305

-Okay.

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,840
-Daddy?
-Yes?

314
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,600
When do we go home?

315
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,080
You'll be back home soon.

316
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,680
-Want to sleep over?
-Yeah, Daddy, sleep next to me!

317
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,080
Where's Eyal?

318
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,800
He's with his kids.

319
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,400
-Daddy, stay.
-Can't, I've got too many sheep to feed.

320
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,480
-Daddy?
-Yes?

321
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,720
I miss Grandpa.

322
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,360
So do I.

323
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,920
Very much.

324
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,320
It's late, go back to sleep, okay?

325
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,760
-Okay.
-See you tomorrow?

326
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,160
-Okay.
-Good night.

327
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,200
Good night, sweetie.

328
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,920
My love.

329
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,200
I love you.

330
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,120
Good night.

331
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,080
Want some coffee?

332
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,600
Sure, thanks.

333
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,720
Good thing I brought some mugs from home
because there's nothing here.

334
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,400
Sorry, I have nothing to offer you
with the coffee, it's just that...

335
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,840
"Voicemail"

336
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,360
[My brethren believers,
tomorrow, God willing,]

337
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,200
<i>[we will commence the crucial stage</i>
<i>of our battle against the Zionists.]</i>

338
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,200
<i>[Tomorrow, God willing,]</i>

339
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,400
<i>[we will continue in the path</i>
<i>of the Shahids who died for this cause.]</i>

340
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,120
<i>[Fight for the sake of God]</i>

341
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,760
<i>[and know that He is attentive</i>
<i>and all-knowing.]</i>

342
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,000
<i>[Don't come to work tomorrow.</i>
<i>We're closed.]</i>

343
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,800
<i>[Bye.]</i>

344
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,320
Any updates from the north?
Fill me in, folks.

345
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,920
We have solid intel

346
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,520
that Al Makdasi will be arriving
at the barbershop in the next few hours.

347
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,440
I'll be with you in the field,
Kaspi will serve as the Command Post.

348
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,280
We'll be sitting by the entrance,

349
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,840
but once he arrives,

350
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,240
we all...

351
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,520
take down the son of a bitch.

352
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,840
Got it?

353
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,280
[It can't be!]

354
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,840
[Don't sweat it, Abu Maher,]

355
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,200
[it happens to everyone.]

356
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,840
[Remember that time
we found out that Abu Mazen's chair]

357
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,200
[and Yasser Arafat's office were bugged?
The Jews are sneaky.]

358
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,320
[-The Jews didn't plant this.]
[-Who, then?]

359
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,240
[That's a high-quality device,
not something you buy online.]

360
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,400
[Only God knows.
In any case, thank you very much.]

361
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,280
[Bashar, not a word of this to anyone.]

362
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,320
[-I'm at your command, Abu Maher.]
[-Goodbye.]

363
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,120
<i>[Hello, Abu Maher.]</i>

364
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,320
[-Hello, Captain Ayub.]
<i>[-How are you doing?]</i>

365
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,920
[Very well.]

366
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,160
<i>[Have you looked into</i>
<i>what we discussed yesterday?]</i>

367
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,800
[Yes, I have.]

368
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,480
<i>[And? Is everything alright?]</i>

369
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,560
[-You were right, Captain.]
<i>[-Sorry to hear that.]</i>

370
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,960
<i>[This will all be over soon.]</i>

371
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,400
<i>[I hope he hasn't got</i>
<i>any more surprises lined up.]</i>

372
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,320
<i>[-Goodbye, my friend.]</i>
[-Goodbye.] Hey, guys,
are you the new upstairs tenants?

373
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,640
Yep.

374
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,240
Nice to meet you, I'm Yonatan. -I'm Eitan.
-I'm Moti. Nice to meet you.

375
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,720
-Isn't that heavy?
-Don't worry,

376
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,560
we've lifted heavier things.

377
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,080
Wish I could help you,
but I've got a bad back.

378
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,000
In any case,
I'm here if there's any problem.

379
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,800
Welcome.

380
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,200
One more thing.

381
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,480
If you guys have bikes, keep them
in the shed, don't block the entrance.

382
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,560
-Don't worry.
-Thank you very much.

383
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,840
-Have a good day.
-Have a good day.

384
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,120
-Thank you very much, Moti.
-Thank you.

385
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,800
You spoke nicely, bro.

386
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,760
Thanks, "Yonatan."

387
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,160
[Have you prayed?]

388
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,840
[Not yet.]

389
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,440
[Come on, let's go.]

389
00:36:12,305 --> 00:37:12,155

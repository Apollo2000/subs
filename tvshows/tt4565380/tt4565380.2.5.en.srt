1
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,040
Yours?

2
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,280
Thanks.

3
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,560
You take judo?

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,480
Yeah.

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,120
-What's your name?
-Ido.

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,160
Ido.

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,800
-Is your dad home?
-No.

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,640
Where is he?

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,800
In Ezuz, with Grandpa. Who are you?

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,760
Ido!

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,480
I'm his friend from the army.

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,040
Have a good day, buddy.

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,400
-Ido, who was that?
-A friend of Dad's.

14
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,880
-Dad.
-Idodi, what's up?

15
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,560
-Which one of you spoke with him?
-Calm down.

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,360
-What did that man want?
-Nothing, he was nice.

17
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,000
Did he have an accent?

18
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,680
They spoke outside.
He went away as soon as he saw me.

19
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,320
Everything okay? What's up, Ido?

20
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,760
-Doron, what's the matter?
-Give us a minute.

21
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,600
-You gotta leave, now.
-What do you mean?

22
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,960
I mean, it's dangerous here.

23
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,040
-Can you tell me what's going on?
-Not now.

24
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,600
-Where would we go?
-Stay with me, on the farm.

25
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,840
-Are you kidding me?!
-You think you can protect them?

26
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,560
Doron, you don't live here.
You don't decide, we will.

27
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,120
-This isn't your house!
-Hey! It's not yours either, so cool it!

28
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,000
Idodi,

29
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,800
look carefully and tell me
if this was the guy you saw, okay?

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Is that him?

31
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,200
You recognize him? Is it him?

32
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,000
-Yes.
-Are you sure?

33
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,600
I think so. Okay.

34
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,800
Who is he?

35
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,360
Just some guy, everything's okay.

36
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,560
-Really?
-Don't worry.

37
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,040
[ARABIC]
[Who is it?]

38
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,640
[Samir.]

39
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,600
[Samir!]

40
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,120
[How are you, my darling?] [Let me see you.]

41
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,960
[Are you okay?]

42
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,320
[Thank God, I'm fine.]

43
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,400
[-Where's my mom?]
[-At the market, she'll be back soon.]

44
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,920
[Sit down.]

45
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,080
[Sit.]

46
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,440
[No, I'll go take a shower.]

47
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,640
[I'll come help you.]

48
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,680
[Don't worry about me.]

49
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,720
"Moreno"

50
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,720
-Hi, Steve.
-Hello.

51
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,040
Hope I'm not interrupting.
There's some stuff that Moreno...

52
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,680
I mean, Mickey, left behind at the unit,
so I figured--

53
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,120
Come in.

54
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
-I didn't mean to interrupt.
-You're not.

55
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,840
-Sorry about the mess.
-It's fine.

56
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,360
-Is your mom home?
-No, she went out.

57
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
Want anything to drink?

58
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,280
I'll make us some tea.

59
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,960
-Tea?
-With whiskey?

60
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,960
-Seriously? Tea with whiskey?
-Everything goes with whiskey.

61
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,080
All right.

62
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,680
You guys wrapped it in toilet paper?

63
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,040
-To keep it from breaking.
-You're like children.

64
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,520
What's this?

65
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,560
"From Training Camp 15
to Maj. Michael Moreno,

66
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,680
for your contribution
to national security."

67
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,240
Oh, and there's even
a tiny drawing of a fighter jet.

68
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,400
And a model of one.

69
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,840
Toys.

70
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,360
Must be fun at your "summer camp."

71
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,480
I thought they'd mean something to you.

72
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,760
They don't mean shit.

73
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,320
Sorry.

74
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,600
Memorabilia isn't my thing.

75
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
How are you holding up?

76
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,120
Sometimes the alcohol makes me
sadder instead of happier.

77
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,240
I'm sorry... What are you sorry about?

78
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,720
I thought these things would
cheer you up, I didn't mean to...

79
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,840
You think it turned him on?

80
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
What?

81
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,000
I always assumed he was in it for...

82
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,440
you know,

83
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,680
the action on the side.

84
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,080
Well, I...

85
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,000
I should leave. Don't leave.

86
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,680
I'm sorry.

87
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,080
Okay, I'll stop.

88
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,640
Damn it...

89
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,160
Looks like you have two weeks
worth of poop in your diaper.

90
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,480
What a cutie.

91
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,960
Damn it.

92
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,680
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

93
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,800
Ever notice that you're always sorry?

94
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,480
I'm sorry for always being sorry.

95
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,640
Don't be sorry, I had fun.

96
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,640
-You okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

97
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,640
[-Hearty appetite, son.]
[-Thank you.]

98
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,480
[Remember what your father used to do
when he returned from interrogations?]

99
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,360
[You were little.]

100
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,520
[He'd burn all his clothes,]

101
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,520
[especially the ones they gave him,
anything they gave him,]

102
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,560
[just in case the clothes were wired.]

103
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,480
[Those barbaric Jews
always come up with something new.]

104
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,560
[Thanks, Mom.]

105
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,560
[Eat up, my darling.]

106
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,160
[It's over.
Everything will be all right from now on.]

107
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,000
[God willing.]

108
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,280
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

109
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,440
-Daddy?
-What?

110
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,000
Did you ever use a gun?

111
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,760
No.

112
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,400
Well, yeah, at a shooting range.

113
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,520
Were you ever shot at?

114
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,160
Let's talk about something else.

115
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,360
-Did you ever fight in a war?
-Yes.

116
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,560
In Israel, everyone does.
Isn't that right, Eyal?

117
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,160
Not everyone.

118
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,040
No reason to fight all the time, Doron.

119
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,080
We're so lucky.

120
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,600
-Why?
-That you didn't die, that you didn't die

121
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,560
like Uncle Boaz.

122
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,880
[-Your mom will give you the shots.]
[-Do they hurt?]

123
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,440
[Just a little.]

124
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,120
[-Dr. Shirin?]
[-One moment.]

125
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,560
[You wanted to talk with your husband.]

126
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,520
[You'll get better.] [I can't talk here.]

127
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,280
[Go over there,
he'll call you in two minutes.]

128
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,320
[Hello?]

129
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,520
<i>[Shirin?]</i>

130
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,800
[Yes, Walid?]

00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,720
[How are you?]

132
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,120
<i>[Fine, I'm at work.]</i>

133
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,840
[-Is Captain Ayub still hounding you?]
[-Not at all.]

134
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,360
<i>[Really?]</i>

135
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,000
[Apparently I'm not that important.]

136
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
[I miss you.]

137
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,240
[Me, too.]

138
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,200
<i>[I want to see you all the time,]</i>

139
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,880
[but they won't let me.]

140
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,200
[Too bad,
because it's the right time of month.]

141

<i>[You know.]</i>

142
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,960
[What?]

143
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,560
[I'm ovulating.]

144
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,000
[These next couple of days
are the best time.]

145
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,640
[I can't right now.]

146
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,280
[I understand, you're right.]

147
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,120
[You have to stay safe,
that's most important.]

148
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
[You know what? I'll find a way.]

149
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,080
<i>[I'll be fine, leave it to me.]</i>

150
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,560
[I'll find us a safe place to meet
and let you know.]

151
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,280
[Are you sure?]

152
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,520
[I'm sure.]

153
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,960
[Love you.]

154
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,360
[Me, too.]

155
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,440
He was at my house, Gabi!
Do you understand? At my house!

156
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,240
The entire system
is working for you, Doron,

157
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,720
you have a team guarding your house 24/7.

158
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,280
I want a guard for my father and my kids

159
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,280
and undercover agents
whenever Gali leaves the house!

160
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,240
-Didn't I tell you she should move?
-I told them, but she and Eyal refuse!

161
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,440
I see.

162
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,040
-How did that bastard enter the country?
-Who, Eyal?

163
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,000
-Yeah, Eyal...
-All right, calm down.

164
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,480
-He could easily enter with a fake ID.
-Did Samir talk?

165
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,320
Samir's just a student, he has
no part in his brother's activities.

166
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,960
-Did you shake him?
-I did. Should I have a go at him, Gabi?

167
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,240
-We don't have him anymore.
-What do you mean?

168
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,360
-He's been released.
-What?

169
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,080
There's no evidence linking him
to his brother, you know the drill.

170
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,000
Gabi, he tried to kill me
and you're letting his brother go?!

171
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,360
Are you crazy?! This is outrageous!

172
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,480
His house is under the surveillance
of unit 8200 and security cams.

173
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,200
If he's working with Nidal,
let him slip up.

174
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,880
He's not worth shit in custody! Doron!

175
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,520
Doron!

176
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,560
Stop acting up.
We're all busting our humps for you.

177
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,400
-Remember what happened last time.
-Fine.

178
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,320
-I mean it!
-I said, fine!

179
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,080
"Anat, Moreno's sister"

180
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
"Are you home? I'm here in Holon."

181
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,120
"Where are you?"

182
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,960
Hi.

183
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,800
-Is this a bad time?
-No, come on in.

184
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,680
You surprised me. You didn't
answer my calls, so I figured...

185
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,480
Yeah, well...

186
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,520
I'm sorry, I felt we left
some things unresolved between us

187
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,240
and, you know,
I didn't want it to get awkward.

188
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,600
-Yeah, we got a little carried away.
-Yeah.

189
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,400
Look, I didn't want to hurt you.

190
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,080
I pretty much forced myself on you.

191
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,360
I was... very drunk,

192
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,920
but if I wouldn't drink, I'd cry, so...

193
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,640
Yeah.

194
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,040
So, I don't...

195
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,640
I don't think it's gonna work out.

196
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,360
Okay.

197
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,160
All right.

198
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,920
Want some coffee?

199
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,200
-No sugar.
-Okay.

200
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,920
No sugar, you said?

201
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,360
Wise-ass...

202
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,320
What's this? You jerk off to sponge cakes?

203
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,920
Look inside, you'll get horny, too.

204
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,760
You cook?

205
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,240
Is that a problem?

206
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,720
Not at all.

207
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,840
It's absolutely charming.

208
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,440
I took a cooking class once,
but I didn't finish it.

209
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
Really? Why not?

210
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,000
Operation Protective Edge.

211
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,520
-Why didn't you continue afterwards?
-I will one day.

212
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,880
-To be a chef?
-Yeah.

213
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,880
-Wow. So you'll cook for me sometime?
-Of course.

214
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,240
-So do it.
-I will. I want to open my own restaurant.

215
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,760
Amazing.

216
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,160
What?

217
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,400
What's up?

218
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,920
What do you mean, now?

219
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,640
Okay, don't go there alone,
I'll come with you.

220
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,440
-The unit?
-Yeah. Doron needs me for something.

221
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm sorry. It's okay.

222
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,560
[Let me help you, Auntie.]

223
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,400
[You're an old woman,
it must be difficult.]

224
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,160
[You know nothing about women.]

225
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,520
[Why not?]

226
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,520
[You never tell a woman she's old.]

227
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,120
[-Maybe that's why I never got married.]
[-I guess so.]

228
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,640
[Here is fine.]

229
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,680
[Thank you, thank you very much.]

230
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,960
[Want some tea?]

231
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,120
[-I'm making some for myself.]
[-Sure.]

232
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,680
[That's my husband, Hassan, Abu Omar,]

233
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,320
[may he rest in peace.
He died three years ago.]

234
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,720
[-May he rest in peace.]
[-We had some good years together.]

235
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,560
[When was that?]

236
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,360
[Up until '87, before the beginning
of the Resistance and this whole mess.]

237
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,880
[People used to come here from Tel Aviv.]

238
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,360
[We had Israeli friends, nice people.]

239
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,800
[The Beatles?]

240
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,440
[What, no good?
Because they're not one of ours?]

241
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,680
[On the contrary,
they're good, I like them.]

242
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,480
[I lived in Europe for a while,
I prefer their later albums.]

243
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,440
[Excuse me.]

244
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,920
[-I'm sorry, I have to take this call.]
[-No problem.]

245
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,960
[-Excuse me.]
[-Go ahead.]

246
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,920
[I'm listening.]

247
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
<i>[You told me to call</i>
<i>if I saw anything unusual, right?]</i>

248
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,320
[-Talk.]
[-There was a fight here at the hospital]

249
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,200
[and suddenly she disappeared.]

250
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,120
<i>[She met with suspicious people</i>
<i>on the roof.]</i>

251
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,600
[-When?]
[-A few days ago.]

252
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,120
Thanks for coming along, bro.

253
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,200
Sure thing, man.

254
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,720
I wouldn't let you do this alone.

255
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,880
A threat to your family
is like a threat to my own, bro.

256
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,840
Thanks. There goes the son of a bitch.

257
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,560
-Let's roll.
-Wait, wait. Let him go in first.

258
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,840
Let's go. [Samir!]

259
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,360
[Samir, how's it going?]

260
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,640
[-Stay back!]
[-Did you know Nidal was at my house?] [-Samir, who is this man?!]
[-Shut up!]

261
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,760
[-Don't talk to her like that!]
[-Shut your mouth!]

262
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,280
[Your brother was at my house.]

263
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,480
[He spoke with my son. So I figured
I'd come talk with his family, too.]

264
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
[I told you I have nothing to do with it.]

265
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,840
[Neither does my son!]

266
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,120
[Tell your brother that if he ever
comes near us again, I'll kill you]

267
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,040
[and then I'll kill your mother
and your beautiful, pregnant wife!]

268
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,400
[I'm crazy, you know.]

269
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,560
[I killed your father with my own hands.]

270
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,560
[Tell your brother that
if he ever comes near us, it's over.]

271
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,120
[You'll all be dead. Understood?]

272
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,680
[-Understood?]
[-Samir...]

273
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,880
[Understood?]

274
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,840
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Upon you be peace.]

275

[Where's Nidal?]

276
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,280
[I need you, Walid.]

277

[You?]

[What do you want from me?]

279
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,960
[I have something to tell you.]

280

281
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,120
[Amir?]

282

319
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,560
[I was at the marketplace with Marwa.
He threatened us.]

320
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,640
[God, forgive us our sins.]

321
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,760
[-I want to flee to Jordan, Nidal.]
[-I swear to God, I'll kill him.]

322
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,160
[-You hear me?]
[-Yes, no problem.]

323
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,120
[I want to flee with Marwa to Jordan.]

324
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,280
[I'm serious.]

325
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,720
[-Will you help us?]
[-Sure, whatever you want.]

326
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,840
<i>[Abu Seif, our hero.</i>
<i>Peace be upon you, fighter.]</i>

327
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,760
[Upon you be peace.
How are you, Abu Hazem?]

328
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,360
<i>[Praise God the Almighty.]</i>

329
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,000
<i>[I haven't seen you</i>
<i>since the Yarmouk battle.]</i>

330
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,720
<i>[We hear a lot about you here.]</i>

331
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,400
[-All thanks to Almighty God.]
[-<i>May you be blessed.]</i>

332
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,680
[What about what we discussed?]

333
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,560
<i>[We have our guy in Nazareth,</i>
<i>I sent you his address last time.]</i>

334
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,000
<i>[Nidal, our people here</i>
<i>expect some action on your part,]</i>

335
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,240
<i>[that you do something on our behalf.]</i>

336
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,760
[I've cleansed our homeland
of the undercover Unit Commander.]

337
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,880
<i>[That's not what we need.</i>
<i>You know who we are.]</i>

338
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,200
<i>[This opportunity</i>
<i>comes once in a lifetime.]</i>

339
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,440
[But my father's friends
have stopped all funding]

340
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,400
[and my means are running low.]

341
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,160
<i>[It's time that you left them.]</i>

342
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,240
[I know.]

343
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,160
<i>[I believe in you, Abu Seif.]</i>

344
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,120
<i>[Nobody before you had the courage</i>
<i>to raise the ISIS flag in Palestine.]</i>

345
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,200
[With the help of God,
I won't let you down.]

346
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,560
<i>[To victory, Abu Seif!]</i>

347
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,840
[-Goodbye.]
<i>[-Peace be upon you.]</i>

348
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,760
RAMALLAH, Al-MASYOUN NEIGHBORHOOD

349
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,760
The mission is to stop Walid.

350
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,640
He's the West Bank's senior terrorist
and he’s responsible for killing Boaz.

351
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,920
Steve and Sagi, you'll be disguised
as Palestinian traffic officers. Avihai, Nurit and Doron, you get off
at the entrance to the hotel, split up,

352
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,640
and wait for the package.

353
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,360
Do you trust her
that this isn't an ambush?

354
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,520
We trust no one. In case of an ambush,

355
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,240
you take everyone down, including her.

356
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,360
[-Where are you?]
[-I'm near the hotel.]

357
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,480
<i>[I'm waiting for you.]</i>

358
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,320
[Don't let him be with me for too long.
I'm scared.]

359
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,440
<i>[I know. But you'll be fine.</i>
<i>This'll all be over soon.]</i>

360
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,240
[-What do I do with the cell phone?]
<i>[-Get rid of the SIM card.]</i>

361
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,480
<i>[-How will you know where I am?]</i>
<i>[-We see everything.]</i>

362
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
[Goodbye.]

363
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,520
She passed us.

364
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,520
[The "shadow" is here.]

365
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,800
Good, it means Walid is in the area.

366
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,960
<i>Everyone, be alert.</i>

367
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,760
Vehicle approaching.

368
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,880
[-Get in.]
[-Who are you?]

369
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,040
[Walid sent me. Get in.]

370
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,400
<i>-They're putting her in a cab, Eli.</i>
-Do you see Walid?

371
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,160
<i>Negative, no visual ID.</i>

372
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,840
<i>Okay, the cab is your target now.</i>
<i>Stay on it.</i>

373
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,640
[The "shadow" is on to us.]

374
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,240
-Are you sure?
[-Not certain.]

375
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,280
<i>Can you handle him?</i>

376
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,600
[Sure.]

377
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,120
<i>Avihai, get in the car.</i>

378
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Don't lose them.

379
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,600
-Good luck.
-Go, go!

380
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,360
[-Where do I know you from?]
[-What, you forgot?]

381
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,560
[-Am I supposed to remember you?]
[-Come with me, I'll remind you.]

382
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,480
[You were at the hospital!]

383
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,880
<i>-Nurit, what's the status?</i>
-All clear. Evacuate me.

384
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,840
[Where are you taking me? Tell me where!]

385
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,640
[You'll see.]

386
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,000
<i>Keep them in sight, but don't get exposed.</i>

387
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Left, left, turn left.

388
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,240
Eli, he turned left into the marketplace.

389
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,480
<i>I see that. Don't go in.</i>
<i>Keep your distance.</i>

390
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,400
But I'm losing sight of her.

391
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,360
Doron, don't do anything
until we have a positive ID.

392
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
Identify anyone? Recognize anything?

393
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,840
-Where are they?
<i>-We see nothing.</i>

394
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,160
They've driven off somewhere,
I see nothing.

395
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,840
[Walid!]

396
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,840
[Walid, what is it?]

397
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,520
[What is it?]

398
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,680
[Walid?!]

399
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,880
[-Walid!]
[-Nidal told me.]

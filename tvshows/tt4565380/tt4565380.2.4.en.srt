1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,560
[ARABIC]
[In the name of God...]

2
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,800
How's it going, bro?

3
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,800
-Where to?
-Herzliya.

4
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,640
-Work.
-Work?

5
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,080
-Gardening, bro.
-I see.

6
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,280
-All of you?
-It's a big project, thank God. -Cool, have a good day.
-You, too.

7
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,840
[We passed, we passed!
Thank Almighty God!]

8
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
From now on, we speak only Hebrew.
We're in Israel.

9
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,400
It's alright, guys.

10
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,160
[Bilal, come.]

11
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,640
[Bilal, get me the big screwdriver.]

12
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
Hi, guys!

13
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,280
What's up?

14
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,160
Everything okay?

15
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,920
Everything's fine, thanks.

16
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,160
-Need any help?
-No, thanks, everything's fine.

17
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,040
You sure?

18
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,840
Everything's fine, God willing.

19
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,840
What did you say?

20
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,480
[Come.] [-Get in!]
-Halt! Halt!

21
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,320
[-Get in now!]
[-Bilal!] [Bilal! What about Bilal?!]

22
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,800
[Bilal!]

23
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,960
Listen up.
The attack occurred two hours ago.

24
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,160
Sadly, one soldier was killed,

25
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,560
he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

26
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,600
But he heroically took down
one of the terrorists.

27
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,520
Our security cam footage shows that
this squad was there a few days ago,

28
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,680
probably practicing. They spoke Hebrew.

29
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,880
Fluent enough to pass the checkpoint.

30
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,960
It looks like Al Makdasi.

31
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,760
Why they pulled over is unclear.

32
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,200
The body was ID'd as Bilal Abu Hassan,
a student at Birzeit University.

33
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,640
He was a member of Al-Kutla,
the Hamas' student association.

34
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,840
Damn it,
so now these assholes speak Hebrew?

35
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
-That's our working premise.
-Damn it...

36
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,760
Any recordings?

37
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
-How fluent is their Hebrew?
-It's unclear.

38
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,360
The Secret Service says
they study Hebrew at universities.

39
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,880
Let me make this clear:
They're no amateurs.

40
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,280
We've never dealt with this before,
it's a whole new level of sophistication:

41
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,760
"Jewish impostors."

42
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,760
Wait, I'm not done.

43
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,160
I want to discuss
what happened in the village.

44
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,680
I specifically ordered who goes inside
the house, so what happened?

45
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,600
-What happened? You know what happened.
-I went inside.

46
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,600
I installed the camera.
What's the problem?

47
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,000
What's the problem? It wasn't your job,
I was very clear about that.

48
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,240
-But I got the job done, didn't I?
-Do you know what "orders" are?

49
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,240
-Do you know what using good judgment is?
-Don't tell me about good judgment.

50
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,520
Fine, I apologize, it won't happen again.
Can I go now?

51
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,000
-Yes, now you can.
-Thanks.

52
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,960
Just so we're clear,
I'm not done with you yet.

53
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,320
Go over the photos.

54
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,760
Dismissed.

55
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,440
[Come here.]

56
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,400
[Is anyone following you?]

57
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,360
[Then why were you late?
You kept me waiting.]

58
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,760
[Sorry. The soldiers
pulled everyone over for inspection]

59
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,960
[-because some soldier was killed.]
[-I can't go on living like this,]

60
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,000
[running around like a dog.
I think the Secret Service is on to us.]

61
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,840
[Don't worry, things will calm down soon.]

62
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,080
[It's all because of Al Makdasi.]

63
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,760
[I told Walid not to trust him.]

64
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,400
[Walid stopped obeying authority
the day I told him he's the successor.]

65
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,240
[Did you know he let Al Makdasi
hide in the house in Rumana?]

66
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,120
[Instead of killing him,
he's helping him.]

67
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,120
[-What a mess.]
[-Let's go.]

68
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,440
[Move it!]

69
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,080
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hey, Gali.

70
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,160
I got your message,
but I can't make it today.

71
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,480
I have to leave early in the morning.

72
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,080
<i>Doron, I can't talk right now, okay?</i>
<i>Jalal the AC repairman is on his way,</i>

73
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,320
<i>-so I have to go to the ATM.</i>
-Who's Jalal?

74
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,240
<i>It's part of the AC's warranty,</i>
<i>he's coming for inspection.</i>

75
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,800
What inspection?
What are you talking about?

76
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,200
-<i>I don't know, that's what they said.</i>
-Who?

77
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,000
<i>The company.</i>

78
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,120
Gali, don't let him in
until I get there, understand?

79
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,080
Are you nuts? He's on his way.

80
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,320
<i>I said don't let him in until I get there!</i>
<i>Thanks!</i>

81
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,880
[Hold your heads up high.]

82
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,360
[Be proud of Bilal, God granted him
the honor to die a Shahid.]

83
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,520
[Be proud of yourselves, too!] [We killed a soldier today]

84
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,840
[and we'll kill many more, God willing.]

85
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,600
[We'll get back at those Jewish dogs
with God's help.]

86
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,800
[What about Bilal's funeral?]

87
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,520
[We can't go.]

88
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,000
[We'd all like to pay our respects to him,]

89
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,240
[but the Jews and the Authority
are after us.]

90
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,120
[But, Nidal, every organization
will send reps to his funeral,]

91
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,000
[-even the Jihad.]
[-What don't you understand, Ahmad?]

92
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,120
[We can't go.]

93
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,600
[Perhaps no organization
will claim responsibility for the attack,]

94
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,040
[which means that from now on
we operate in full secrecy.]

95
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,680
[Is that clear? All eyes are on us now.]

96
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,120
[They photograph everyone who attends
these funerals, am I right, Maher?]

97
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,760
[-Why do you ask me?]
[-Why not?]

98
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,040
[-I'm not my dad.]
[-But I bet you know.]

99
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,400
[Ahmad!]

100
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,320
[Cool it.]

101
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,880
[I asked him a simple question
as he must know if they do or don't.]

102
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,320
[We come before family
and before anything else.]

103
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,720
[Right, Maher?]

104
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,960
[The Jews don't knock on the door
when they come to kill.]

105
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,320
[Open the door, Ali.]

106
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,080
[It's Walid.]

107
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,480
[Hello, Walid.]

108
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,480
[-Pack your things and leave the house.]
[-Why?]

109
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,520
[The movement's leaders
are sick of the trouble you cause us.]

110
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,240
[Define "us."]

111
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
[You?]

112
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,960
[What don't you understand?]

113
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,040
[You shouldn't have carried out
the attack. This was against the orders.]

114
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,040
[We tried to kidnap a soldier.]

115
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,640
[-Isn't that what Hamas wants?]
[-I'll tell you what Hamas wants.]

116
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
[-Is kidnapping a soldier wrong?]
[-No.]

117
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,560
[You neither kidnapped him alive
nor returned with his body.]

118
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,240
[We couldn't.]

119
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,200
[That's why I told you
not to carry out an attack.]

120
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,760
[Had we successfully kidnapped him,
would you claim responsibility?]

121
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,240
[The movement would.]

122
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,200
[Nobody can claim responsibility
over an attack in the name of Hamas.]

123
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,520
[Who will take responsibility and pay for
Bilal's funeral and the mourning tent?]

124
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,720
[Not us.]

125
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,600
[You won't decide for Hamas.]

126
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,000
[He is not Hamas]

127
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,240
[and Hamas can't fund people like him.]

128
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
[I'm not Hamas?]

129
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,560
[I am the son
of Sheikh Abu Nidal Awdallah.]

130
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,960
[Who are you?]

131
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,200
[I am Hamas' military wing commander,
you piece of shit,]

132
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,200
[and from this moment
I order you to shut the fuck up!]

133
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,560
[You think we're a bunch of jackasses?
That Abed wouldn't tell me]

134
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,480
[that you pressured him
into giving you Doron's address?]

135
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,520
[Nidal, don't forget who you are.]

136
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,840
[Which side are you on?]

137
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,200
[Which side?]

138
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,920
[If you all don't leave this house,]

139
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,160
[I'm through with you]

140
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,760
[and things will end very badly.]

141
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,080
Hey!

142
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,520
-Who are you?
-Jalal. I'm here to check the AC.

143
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,440
[-Where are you from?]
[-From Nazareth, what's the problem?]

144
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,160
[Stop what you're doing and leave!]

145
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,400
-But the lady scheduled me.
-Oh, yeah?

146
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,120
-Who sent you, huh?!
-Doron...

147
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,080
-Who sent you?!
-Doron, what are you doing?!

148
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,000
-Let go of him!
-Who do you work for?

149
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,080
-What are you doing?!
-"Core International."

150
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,760
-"International," huh? Get the hell out!
-Leave him alone!

151
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,440
-Excuse me?
-I said, get out!

152
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,360
I'm calling the police, and you, ma'am,
owe us 250 shekels for the visit.

153
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,800
[-Beat it! Get out!]
-Calm down!

154
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,400
What's with you?

155
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,360
Come, let's go inside.

156
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
I'm sorry...

157
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,520
-Are you out of your mind?!
-I'm sorry.

158
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,000
-Don't come over here anymore.
-Gali...

159
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,720
I won't let you behave like this
in front of my kids!

160
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,240
-I'll get a restraining order against you.
-Gali, come on...

161
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,560
What was that about?!

162
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,440
[We're here, Abu Samara.]

163
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,960
[Thank you.]

164
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,360
[Wait here. Keep your eyes open.]

165
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,120
[Sure thing.]

166
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,000
[-The envelope.]
[-Oh...]

167
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,080
<i>[The Occupation army has announced</i>
<i>that one of its soldiers has been killed]</i>

168
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,560
<i>[in an operation</i>
<i>carried out by Palestinians.]</i>

169
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,360
<i>[According to the Occupation army's</i>

<i>in one of the IAF's elite units...]</i>

171
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,080
This house has a history
which you all know too well:

172
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,280
It was one of the Panthers’ hideouts.

173
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,680
According to intel,
Al Makdasi was spotted there.

174
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Given this indication,
we obviously don't have much time.

175
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,720
We have to gear up and head out.

176
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,160
Any questions?

177
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,560
I want you all to be extra alert.
We've taken enough shit till now.

178
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,720
Doron, come here,
I want to have a word with you.

179
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,680
What is it?

180
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,200
You won't be joining today's operation.

181
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,320
-What do you mean?
-You're staying put.

182
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,440
-What are you talking about, Eli?
-You think you can do as you please?

183
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,280
The first thing I told you
was no funny business,

184
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,560
but I guess you misheard me.
You won't do as you please here.

185
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,520
-Go fuck yourself.
-Doron...

186
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,640
[Stay, I'm making coffee.]

187
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,680
[-No time for coffee, I'm in a rush.]
[-Where to?]

188
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,480
[A soccer game with Nasser and his cousin.
We only have the court for 90 minutes.]

189
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,840
[You play soccer dressed like that?]

190
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,560
[My clothes are in the bag.]

191
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,960
[Why aren't you wearing
the Adidas sneakers you asked for?]

192
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,200
[Are those in the bag, too?]

193
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,040
[I forgot them at Nasser's.
He's bringing them to the court.]

194
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,720
[Fine, let's have some coffee.]

195
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,600
Atalef, this is Commander.
What's going on there?

196
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,240
<i>Atalef to Commander,</i>
<i>everything's clear, no gunmen.</i>

197
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,240
<i>-I'm leaving in two minutes.</i>
-Roger.

198
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,200
-They're going to hunt down my source.
-Looks like he fucked you over, Gabi.

199
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,240
NABLUS, RAFIDIA

200
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,360
[-Is everything alright?]
[-Absolutely.]

201
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,080
[It's smaller than it looked
in the photos, but it's nice.]

202
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,280
[I wrote down two rooms
because that room is also a bedroom.]

203
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,320
[It doesn't get rented out often
because it's below ground level,]

204
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,480
[-that's why it's also cheap.]
[-I'm fine with it.]

205
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,280
[It's usually girls, students,
who rent it.]

206
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,440
[Don't worry, I'll keep it tidy.]

207
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,480
What a surprise, huh?

208
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,640
-Amazingly, it's not your fault this time.
-No shit.

209
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,160
It's not always about you.
This time it was an intel slipup.

210
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,640
Whatever.

211
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,920
[This is a standard lease contract.]

212
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,360
[Yes, I'll read it.]

213
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,320
[Is it a problem if I pay you in cash?]

214
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,600
[Not at all.]

215
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,600
[What did you say you do in Nablus?]

216
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,760
[I was living in Jordan for a while]

217
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,040
[and came back to help out
with the family business.]

218
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,120
[You know, times are tough,
so I came to be close to my family.]

219
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,600
[Well, you're a good son.]

220
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,200
[Did you leave your wife behind
in Jordan?]

221
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,000
[No, I didn't, actually.]

222
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,960
[Fadi?]

223
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,160
[You don't look like a "Fadi."]

224
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,840
[Yeah, I get that a lot.]

225
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,840
[Need anything else? Internet?]

226
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,280
[-It's what you youngsters want, right?]
[-Exactly.]

227
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,240
[-Don't worry, I'll take care of that.]
[-Thank you very much, Auntie.]

228
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,800
["Auntie"? My name is Hanan.]

229
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,040
[Alright.]

230

[-Tasnim.]
[-Shirin.]

231

[Where are you off to?]

232
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,040
[Today is Shahid Abu Ahmad's
memorial day.]

233
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,120
[-Oh, that's right.]
[-Aren't you coming?]

234
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,560
[The Jews are watching me.
I don't want them to arrest me again.]

235
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,960
[You poor thing.]

236
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,040
[They've got collaborators everywhere,]

237
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,600
[so Walid asked that I watch out.]

238
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,960
[Your husband is right.]

239
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,920
[Nassrin isn't coming either.]

240
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,240
[Abu Ahmad's widow? Is she scared, too?]

241
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,120
[Scared? No. The damn woman
took her kids and fled to Berlin]

242
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,960
[-to live there.]
[-Really?]

243

[Yes, she has a nice house
and lives a peaceful life]

246
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,760
[Oh, right, may God forgive me...
Wait here, darling.]

247
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,840
[Excited about going to the memorial day?]

248
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,560
[Of course, all the girls at school
are going to sing a song.]

00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,120
Hisham isn't answering.

305
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,680
-Isn't it always like that?
-Yeah, but everyone's after him now.

306
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,440
I hope they didn't trick us
into exposing him.

307
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,400
This is the list of Hebrew students
the investigation uncovered.

308
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,640
-There are quite a few.
-Thanks.

309
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,200
-Dana...
-I marked them for you.

310
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,880
Go home, will ya?

311
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,080
"Maher Muhammad Imad Asheikh"

312
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,280
[Me and my cursed luck...]

313

<i>[-Hello?]</i>
[-Hello, Abu Maher.]

314

[-How are you?]

315
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,960
[I'm fine, praise God. But you know,
we're not getting any younger.]

316
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,680
[Listen,]

317
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,880
[I understand that the people
who carried out the attack spoke...]

318
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,840
[Hebrew.]

319
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,360
[You mean, not Israelis?]

320
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,600
[No. Palestinians.]

321
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,840
<i>[They spoke fluent Hebrew,]</i>

322

<i>[not like the old folks</i>
<i>who used to work in Israel.]</i>

323

<i>[These were young guys.]</i>

324
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,480
[The one who got killed
was studying Hebrew at Birzeit.]

325
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,720
[You know anything about this?]

326
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,320
[No, this is all new to me.]

327
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,920
[-This is crucial.]
[-Captain Ayub, you worry too much.]

328
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,560
[You know, Abu Maher,
worrying is our job.]

329
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,400
[Take care of yourself. Goodbye.]

330
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,760
[You, too, my friend.]

331

<i>[The person you have called</i>

332
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,160
What's up? Can we talk?

333
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,640
What are you doing here this late?

334
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,440
I need to talk to you about something.

335
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,400
-About the operation?
-No, no.

336
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,440
Remember the camera
we installed in Shirin's home?

337
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,640
I know, she took the picture down,
we lost the image.

338
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,080
-Well, she saw me.
-When?

339
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,400
When I installed the camera. We spoke.

340
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,600
-Why didn't you--
-Hear me out. It's good for us.

341
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,120
She wants to help us,

342
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,400
-she wants out of the country.
-How do you know?

343
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,200
-She wrote to my username.
-What username?

344
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,760
The one I used
back in the operation in Ramallah.

345
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,240
Doron, are you crazy? Are you purposely
defying orders just to endanger yourself?

346
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,600
Gabi, you taught me "For by wise counsel
thou shalt make thy war."

347
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,640
But we're up against a classic situation
of kidnapping or killing

348
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,000
a counterterrorist operative!
Remember the Amna Muna affair?

349
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,720
-Yes.
-If she's double-crossing you--

350
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,680
-She's not.
-I said "if"!

351
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,560
This could all be a trap.
They could be setting us up,

352
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,400
tempting her to talk with you,
which is easy since you're a jackass...

353
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,560
-Yep.
-Then set a meeting point

354
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,040
-and kidnap you. Classic!
-That's not the case.

355
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,400
Says who?
They're just as crafty as we are!

356
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,600
So what should I do, Gabi?
Tell her to leave me alone?

357
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,520
I can get you Walid and Al Makdasi,
I thought you'd be thankful!

358
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,680
-Yeah, thank you.
-You're welcome!

359
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,720
Alright.

360
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,280
From now on,
I tell you when to contact her.

361
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,280
Doron, I want to know
where you go, with whom,

362
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,320
what you do and what you say.
Is that clear?

363
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,280
Don't do anything without my approval
or you'll be at risk.

364
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,400
Do you even realize the consequences
if you are kidnapped?

365
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,440
Fine, I'll set up a meeting.

366
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,680
No.

367
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,560
They could ambush us.

368
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,360
-You can meet with her spontaneously.
-Okay.

369
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,320
-I'll tell Eli not to bust your balls.
-Thanks.

370
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,600
So, how's your son doing?

371
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,840
Get outta my office, you idiot.

372
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,840
NABLUS, RAFIDIA HOSPITAL

373
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,240
Be alert, guys,
they'll be there any minute.

374
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,240
[Excuse me, my wife
has been waiting here for two hours.]

375
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,160
[I'm a doctor,
a nurse will be right with you.]

376
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,840
[Shame on you. Is this how
you treat patients? Look at her!]

377
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,200
[-Let go of me.]
[-Not until a doctor tends to my wife!]

378
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,960
[-You're a doctor? Then tend to her!]
[-Sir, sir!]

379
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,840
[Let go of her or I'll break your arm.]

380
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,320
[-Cool it, pal.]
[-You cool it!]

381
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,600
[Go up to the roof.
Amir Mahajne is waiting for you.]

382
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,880
[Who do you think you are, butting in?!]

383
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,560
[You think you run this hospital?!
Watch it, kid!]

384
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,880
[Sir, all I wanted is
to ensure there is no trouble.]

385
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,040
[The doctor works very hard,]

386
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,040
[so cut her some slack.]

387
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,800
[Okay?]

388
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,640
[Okay.]

389
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,400
[Champ.]

390
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,360
[-Are you alright?]
[-What are you doing here?]

391
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,920
[I preferred not to come to your house,
there are too many eyes on you.]

392
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,440
[Move the bed!]

393
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,760
[-Get it out of the way!]
[-Sorry...]

394
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,800
[I have something for you.]

395
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,240
[Here you go.] [Sorry they took it away from you, but...]

396
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,240
[-we still have to issue you an exit visa.]
[-Great.]

397
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,720
[The "shadow" has exited.]

398
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,440
[I know that he visits you sometimes.]

399
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,920
[They'll kill him next time.]

400
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,040
[It's best that we both avoid that.]

401
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,240
[Promise me you won't kill him]

402
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,240
[-and I'll tell you when we can meet.]
[-Alright.]

403
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,360
[He saved my life.
They were going to kill me and my family.]

404
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,040
[I understand, Shirin.
I'm sick of all this violence.]

405
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,000
<i>Doron, he headed straight for the stairs.</i>
<i>You have 30 seconds.</i>

406
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,680
[We must hurry up.]

407
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,920
[-This is for you.]
[-What is it?]

408
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,280
[A SIM card for your phone
so you can call me directly.]

409
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,160
[Take it out before your meeting
so they won't track you, okay?]

410
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,720
[-Okay?]
[-Thank you.]

411
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,720
[Thank you.]

412
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,840
[Shirin...]

413
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,880
<i>[Do you love him?]</i>

414
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,560
[I don't love him. I owe him.]

415
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,360
Doron, move it,
the guard will be on the roof any second.

416
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
[I have some work to do here.]

417
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,360
[I'll call you back, okay?]

418
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,560
[Where is everybody?]

419
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,680
[It's too risky for us all
to meet in one place.]

420
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,160
[My dad keeps calling me nonstop.]

421
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,520
[Good for you,
your dad worries about you.]

422
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,160
[What did you tell him?]

423
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,560
[That I got bruised playing soccer.]

424
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,480
[He's starting to get suspicious.]

425
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,920
[It'll be alright, God willing.]

426
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,080
[What's our next step?]

427
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,760
[We wait.]

428
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,800
[We wait?]

429
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,520
[Go home and stay with your family.]

430
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,920
[Alright?]

431
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,800
[Goodbye.]

<i>It's been a while. Any news?]</i>

before we can move on to the next phase.]

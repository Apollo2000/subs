1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,760
Go, go, they're driving off.

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,040
We're leaving.

3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,200
-There's someone in the passenger seat.
<i>-Any ID?</i>

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,240
-It's not Walid, it's someone else.
-Maintain the status quo.

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,400
Eli! Someone got in without our notice,

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,280
Walid could be in the back seat.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,440
-Steve, get closer.
-Copy. On our way.

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,520
[ARABIC]
[I know you've been betraying me.]

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,760
[-No...]
[-Be quiet.]

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,760
[-Walid...]
[-I said, be quiet!]

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,280
[Take it.]

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,880
[Look what I found.]

13
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,800
[Where are you traveling to?]

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,240
[Nowhere, I always carry it with me.]

15
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,400
[What is that?]

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,800
[I had no idea about that!]

17
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,280
[I'm sorry.]

18
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,840
[I didn't know, I'm sorry.]

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,840
We've lost the signal.

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,200
Guys, we've lost her signal.

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,840
-What?!
<i>-Keep them in sight.</i>

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,120
They must've found her passport.

23
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,560
[Walid... I'm sorry, Walid.]

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,320
[What did those dogs promise you
to sell me out?]

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,000
[I'd never do that, Walid. I love you.]

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,560
[-Walid...]
[-We were supposed to have children.]

27
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,520
[We're working on it, aren't we?]

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,840
[You must die! Now!]

29
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,160
[Close your eyes.]

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,880
[-Walid, what's gotten into you?]
[-Close your eyes.]

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,520
Eli, I'm about to lose sight of them.

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,720
You've got clearance.

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,760
Go, go, go!

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,800
<i>[Taxi, halt!]</i>

35
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,920
<i>[Pull over.]</i>

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,560
[Stop over there.]

37
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,080
[You keep your mouth shut, understood?!]

38
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
[Hey, bro, everything alright?]

39
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,400
[License and registration, please.]

40
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,640
[Here you go.]

41
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,400
[Is there a problem?]

42
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,640
[I don't know.]

43
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,160
[Is there a problem?]

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,360
[Do you know this man?]

45
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,560
[He's my husband.]

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,480
[Your husband.]

47
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,400
[It's him.]

48
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,320
[Step out of the car, please.]

49
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,680
[You, too.]

50
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,120
[-I swear I'll kill her!]
[-Drop your weapon!]

51
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,760
[-I swear I'll kill her!]
[-Drop your weapon, you son of a bitch!]

52
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,400
[Drop your weapon or I'll kill her!]

53
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,000
[I'll kill her!]

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,080
[On your knees!]

55
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,480
Doron! Doron!
Bro, let go of him!

56
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,080
<i>We got Walid, I repeat, we got Walid.</i>

57
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,040
<i>Three to five gunmen.</i>
<i>We're engaging in battle.</i>

58
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,320
Give me a sec.

59
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,080
[Are you alright?]

60
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,440
[We couldn't tell
if he was in the car or not.]

61
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,880
[Well, he was.]

62
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,120
[I know, and we caught him.]

63
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,640
[-Why did you tamper with my passport?]
[-I knew nothing about that,]

64
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,040
[really, I swear.]

65
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,560
[I'm such a fool.
Why did I ever believe you?]

66
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,600
[Enough, it's over.] [He destroyed my passport!]

67
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
[We'll issue you a new one.]

68
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,640
[You did your part.]

69
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,760
[Where will I be until then?]

70
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,800
[Give me a minute.]

71
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,240
No talking to him during the ride
so that he "sings" later on.

72
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,560
No problem.

73
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,760
What is she to do now?

74
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,640
-We'll take her in until her flight.
-I'm not keeping her in detention, Gabi.

75
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,800
-Expect me to put her up at the Hilton?
-Yes.

76
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,280
I never put a lead up at a hotel
in Tel Aviv, are you nuts?

77
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,520
I'll see if the apartment in Givatayim
is vacant.

78
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,800
Thanks.

79
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,560
-If it's occupied, vacate it, okay?
[-Yes, "sir."]

80
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,400
-I'll ask Ronen to update you every hour.
-Why Ronen?

81
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,040
-He's taking her there.
-I am.

82
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,560
-You wish.
-Gabi, look at her.

83
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,200
[Oh, man...]

84
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,040
Let me end this properly, okay? Please?

85
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,640
Fine. And clean yourself up,
you can't walk around Givatayim like that.

86
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,040
Thanks.

87
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,040
Hey, hey, hey!

88
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,280
Soldier, halt.

89
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,760
I'm taking her, it's okay.
Alright? Thank you.

90
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,760
[I'm sorry. Come with me.]

91
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,520
[I would’ve never agreed to this
had I known it would turn out this way.]

92
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,080
[-You thought he'd just hop in the car?]
[-I didn't think I'd be there to see it.]

93
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,320
[Fine. Buckle up.]

94
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,040
Bravo!

95
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,760
Don't stop. Keep pouring.

96
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,960
Is everyone set?

97
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,560
-You call this cheap crap "being set"?
-That's all the budget we have.

98
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,040
Well, I sincerely want to thank you all

99
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,760
for your truly exceptional work.
We caught that piece of shit!

100
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,200
I can tell you that I'm happier today

101
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,400
than I was the day we wiped out Al Jabari.

102
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,120
And y'all know why.

103
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,280
To Boaz.

104
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
-To Boaz.
-To Boaz.

105
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,200
-I want to keep it short.
-So keep it short.

106
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,280
This unit has suffered
some serious losses,

107
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,800
but you've managed to recover,
and that's downright admirable.

108
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,280
It's a pleasure working with you.
Some tough missions lay ahead for us,

109
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,120
but I'm sure we'll accomplish them all.

110
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,600
[They've caught Walid
and Hassan has fallen Shahid.]

111
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,760
["Never think of those who have been
killed in the cause of God as dead.]

112
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,440
[Rather, they are alive with their Lord,
receiving provision."]

113
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
[God's infinite justice.]

114
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,200
[He'll talk.]

115
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,520
[He won't. He doesn't know
about this apartment, either.]

116
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,400
[In the end they all talk.]

117
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,240
[Which is why we must carry out
our plan faster. We don't have time.]

118
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,840
[What do you mean, "we don’t have time"?]

119
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
[Nidal,]

120
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,480
[now that Walid is out,
you can replace him.]

121

[Samir,]

122
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,400
[even if they threaten to behead me,
I'll never work for Abu Samara.]

123
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,960
[This is your chance to become commander.
Who besides you can lead the movement?]

124
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,240
[That snake hates me
just as much as he hated Abu Nidal.]

125
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,800
[If you leave Hamas,]

126
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,960
[your men will leave you.]

[-I won't degrade myself, Samir.]
[-Degrade?!]

[I have a detailed plan.
I'm not wasting my time now.]

129
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,080
[When will you get Marwa and me
out of here?]

130
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,560
[Now's not a good time.]

131
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,400
[What's that?]

132
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,880
[I promised Marwa that we'd leave,
based on what you said.]

133
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,320
[Samir, getting you out
would mean transferring you to Jordan,]

134
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,520
[where the Jordanian Intelligence
is waiting to catch you.]

135
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,600
[Then I'll escape to Qatar, to Doha.]

136
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,800
[I know Hamas has ties there,
they'd find me a job.]

[Samir.]

138

[Samir...]

139
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,720
[To get both of you out of here without
getting caught, we'd need money! A lot!]

140
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,240
[And I refuse to beg Hamas!
Now, let me solve this my own way.]

141
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
[Understood?]

142
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,680
[I can't hear you.]

143
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,280
[Understood.]

144
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,800
[Good.]

145
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,640
[We're almost there.]

146
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,800
-Hey, how are you?
-Fine, and you?

147
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,720
Alright.

148
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,880
Go on up, I'll buzz you in.

149

[If you'd like to shower,
there are clean towels on the bed.]

[Where's Walid?]

151
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,880
[He's fine,
he's in the detention facility.]

[-What will they do to him?]
[-They're interrogating him.]

[You did the right thing.]

154
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,520
[Good night.]

155
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,800
[I can stay a bit longer.]

156
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,400
[I'd like to get some sleep.]

[Go.]

158
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,200
[Are you sure?]

159
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,680
-Hey.
-What's up?

160
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,720
[Shirin.]

161
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,840
[Leave me alone.]

162
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
[You're not staying here.]

163
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,520
[He'll kill me.]

164
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,400
[He's in jail.]

165
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,880
[-He'll send someone.]
[-I won't let that happen.]

166
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,280
[You think I believe anything you say?]

167
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,120
[Are you done feeling sorry for yourself?]

168
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,920
[Come on, get up.]

169
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,400
[-Come with me.]
[-Where to?]

170
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,160
[Home, with me.]

171
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,160
[-Your home?]
[-Would you rather stay here?]

172
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,560
[Let's go.]

173
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,640
[Come on, let's go.]

174
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,800
[Come.]

175
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,760
[How are you, Walid?]

176
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,000
[Praise God.]

177
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,440
[I'm Amira. Sorry we get to meet
under these circumstances.]

178
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,400
[Is there anything you need?]

179
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,560
[Can I help you in any way?]

180
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,960
[Have you had anything to eat or drink?]

181
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,400
[Do you really care?]

182
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,240
[Of course I do.]

183
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,640
[I don't like the way
they tied your hands.]

184
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,120
[I'll ask the guard to untie you.]

185
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,320
[In any case, you'll have to stand trial
for several indictments,]

186
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,280
[that's for certain.]

187
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,360
[But if you help me, we could help you.]

188
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,080
[Your friend Nidal,
who calls himself Al Makdasi.]

189
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,720
[Your wife
was more communicative than you.]

190
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,320
[She's smart.]

191
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,720
[Your exact opposite.]

192
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,800
[If that's so, then I'm proud to be dumb.]

193
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,400
[Why do you say that?]

194
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,720
[Look how pretty she is.]

195
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,960
[I bet you'll miss her.]

196
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,840
[I'll just leave this here for you.]

197
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,520
[I'll be back soon, so you can give me
some details about Al Makdasi.]

198
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,640
[I thank you all
for coming here today.]

199
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,360
[I don't take it for granted.]

200
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,000
[-What happened with Walid?]
[-I heard someone ratted him out.]

201
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,880
[We've heard all sorts of rumors lately,
but one thing we know for sure is]

202
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,440
[that Hassan and Jihad got to be Shahids,
in the name of God.]

203
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,960
[Two grooms in heaven,
in the name of God.]

204
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,280
[As Shahids,
will Hamas support their families?]

205
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,360
[Only God knows.]

206
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,480
[But now, with Walid in jail
and Hamas stuck in its tracks,]

207
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,840
[this is our chance.]

208
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,080
[Once we get to work,
we'll be unstoppable.]

209
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,160
[And I know very well that
you all need financial support.]

210
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,280
[God willing,
I'll get some cash tonight.]

211
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
[I promise you,]

212
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,360
[I have a whole plan figured out.]

213
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,240
[My good men,]

214
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,040
[Israel does not want peace.]

215
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,360
[Trust me, they left us with no choice
but the Resistance.]

216
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,440
[And you are the Resistance.]

217
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,880
[You are hope.]

218
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,760
[Let us unite]

219
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,680
[and with the help of God]

220
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,200
[we'll do things that no Zionist mind
could ever imagine.]

221
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,000
Well?

222
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,640
[Who's with me?]

223
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,400
[I'm with you.]

224
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,520
[-Me, too.]
[-So am I.]

225
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,640
[Ali?]

226
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,280
[I'm with you.]

227
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,320
[Nizar, check this out.]

228
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,120
[Nidal.]

229
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,040
[One second, guys.]

230
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,120
[What is it?]

231
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,000
[-I think my dad is suspicious.]
[-Why?]

232
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,600
[He keeps asking me where I am
and why I'm not at home.]

233
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,000
[What else?]

234
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,280
[-He searched my room.]
[-Did he find anything?]

235
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,000
[-No, I don't bring anything home.]
[-Any chance someone followed you here?]

236
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,200
[No, I don't think so.]

237
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,720
[Go home now,]

238
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,560
[stay with your family,]

239
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,000
[and go back to university.]

240
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,600
[-And?]
[-And that's it.]

241
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,120
[What? But, Nidal, you promised
I'd take part in an attack.]

242
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
[Maher, your time will come.]

243
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,080
[You'll be of more help to us
if your father trusts you.]

244
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,000
[Maher,]

245
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,400
[respect your father.]

246
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,040
[He is first and foremost your father.]

247
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,240
Hello?

248
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,640
<i>-Did you drop her off at the apartment?</i>
-Yes, a while ago.

249
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,920
Then why did the guard
tell me you took her out of there?

250
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,200
-We're going out to eat.
<i>-Doron.</i>

251
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,320
-What?
<i>-Think carefully about what you're doing.</i>

252
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,360
We're going out to eat,
what's the big deal?

253
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,280
Then order take-out, return to
the apartment and keep an eye on her.

254
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,800
I'm not taking my eyes off of her,
trust me.

255
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,200
<i>Hamas is threatening to carry out</i>
<i>retaliation attacks following the arrest</i>

[You sing horribly.]

[Hungry?]

266
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,000
Ready to order?

267

[This. And I'll start with that.]

269
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,160
Okay. Some tahini and a salad, please.

270
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,440
Anything to drink?

271
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,960
[What are you drinking?]

272
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,320
-Water, please.
-I'll have a beer.

273
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,680
No problem.

274
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,800
[-Did you see the look she gave me?]
[-She's just a grouchy waitress.]

[-It must be my looks.]
[-You look like a princess.]

"Gali: Don't bother. The kids are asleep."

"Call me if there's a problem."

280
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,320
[Everything alright?]

281
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,400
[Sure, why do you ask?]

282
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,200
[That was just my ex-wife.]

283

[Why did you get divorced?]

[I think we're past that phase.]

[-We didn't get along.]

-I couldn't.
-Sure, you could,

-you'll help me paint the gazebo.
-Screw you.

Viagra?

312
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,240
Pretty close.

00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,920
Have you ever been in therapy?

315
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,680
Me, talking to someone for an hour...?

316
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,920
How do you say "post-trauma" in Arabic?

317
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,200
"Bost-trauma."

318
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,600
"Bost-trauma."

319
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,560
[Where've you been?]

320
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,040
[And don't you dare lie to me.]

321
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,400
[With friends.]

322
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
[With whom? Where? What did you do?]

323
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,280
[I'm not a little kid
who has to tell you everything!]

324
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,040
[Don't move when I'm talking to you!]

325
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,360
[-What did I do?!]
[-Why are you two yelling?]

326
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,040
[-You're waking up the neighbors.]
[-He's lying to my face.]

327
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,840
[-What's going on?]
[-Nothing. I was with friends.]

328
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,120
[This is between me and him.]

329
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,440
[Excuse me?]

330
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,960
[Fine, but keep it down.]

331
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,760
[I'm sorry.]

332
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,800
[What are you sorry about?]

333
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,040
[For lying to you.]

334
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,680
[Then talk. Tell me the truth.] [It's not that complicated.]

335
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,560
[-I know.]
[-Come on, tell me, I'm your father.]

336
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,520
[Talk.]

337
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,280
[There's this girl... but we didn't
do anything and it's over, I swear.]

338
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,480
[A girl?] [Fine. Go take a shower.]

339
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,200
[Did you two make up?]

340
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,840
[He said he's sorry,
said he was with a girl.]

341
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,240
[That's the last thing we needed.]

342
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,040
[I don't know.]

343
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,320
[Should I believe him or not?]

344
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,360
[Try to be more sensitive towards him.]

345
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,560
[For me.]

346
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,080
[He has to feel
that he can tell us anything.]

347
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,080
[Don't scare him away.]

348
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,000
[I'm scaring him away?]

349
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,160
[That boy is my life.]

350
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,600
[Don't forget, he's a very sensitive kid.]

351
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,760
[Fine. Don't worry.]

352
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,760
[Good night.]

353
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,880
[Good night.]

354
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,680
[Give me the bolt cutter.]

355
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,920
[Hold this.]

356
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,400
[One, two, three...]

357
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,320
Doron?

358
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,160
Everything okay?

359
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,800
-Yes, sorry, didn't mean to wake you.
-I wasn't asleep.

360
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,760
[Shirin, this is my dad, Amos.
Amos, this is Shirin.]

361
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,320
[-Nice to meet you.]
[-Same here.]

362
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,280
[Shirin will be staying with us
for a few days.]

363
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,960
Alright, in my room
there are sheets, towels,

364
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,600
-whatever you need.
-Cool. I'll go get them.

365
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,600
[Be right back.]

366
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,920
[-Sorry for the inconvenience.]
[-No, no, it's fine.]

367
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,640
[Go ahead, it's the door on the left.]

368
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,960
[Thank you.]

369
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,320
-Where are the sheets?
-Upper shelf.

370
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,480
Doron,

371
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,080
-no good can come of this.
-I know.

372
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,880
[Well, let's take a break.]

373
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,920
[I'll be leaving soon.]

374
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,960
[I don't intend to talk.]

375
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,520
[You don't have to.]

376
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,800
[Just write down everything you know.]

377
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,280
[Where you last saw him,
how you contact Al Makdasi, everything.]

378
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,880
[May it be God's will that
you burn in hell until Judgment Day,]

379
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,480
[you evil spawn of Satan!]

380
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,360
Enough.

381
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,920
[Where is Al Makdasi?]

382
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,160
[In hell, where I hope you end up.]

383
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,200
More, please.

384
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,000
Stop.

385
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,720
[Where is Al Makdasi?]

386
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,440
[You think I'm stupid?]

387
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,440
[That your stupid strategies
will get me to talk?]

388
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
[You can't touch me.]

389
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,200
[Tell Gabi...]

390
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,480
<i>[I know his name is Gabi...]</i>

391
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,920
<i>[that I will personally hunt him down]</i>

392
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,560
<i>[and murder him and his children.]</i>

393
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,400
Ayub! Ayub!

394
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,240
-Ayub! Ayub!
-Move!

395
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,200
You'll have me kicked out over this!

396
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,200
Keep him in stress position for 12 hours.

397
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,720
[Motherfucker!]

398
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,720
[Hello?]

399
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,160
<i>[We've been robbed.]</i>

400
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,160
[-What did they take?]
<i>[-50,000 shekels.]</i>

401
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,600
<i>[But I think I know</i>
<i>the son of a bitch who did this.]</i>

402
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,240
[That bastard!]

403
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,480
[Sweet dreams.]

404
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,960
[Thank you.]

405
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,880
[Doron...]

406
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,960
[Could you sit here until I fall asleep?]

407
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,160
[Sure.]

408
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,240
[Thank you.]

409
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,440
[You're welcome.]

410
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,400
[Here.]

411
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,400
[Thanks.]

[ARABIC]
[People, help me, please!]

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,600
[Somebody help me, please!]

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,000
[-People, help me, please!]
[-What's going on?]

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,400
[Bring some water.]

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,680
[Bring him over.]

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,760
[-Bring him over.]
[-I don't know what happened.]

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,520
[Lay him down.
Get an ambulance. Let me see.]

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,400
[Give him some water.]

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,840
[Some water, quick!]

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,080
[-What happened to him?]
-[Move over.]

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,840
[-I was hurt.]
[-What is it? Let me see.]

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,000
[Anybody who moves gets
a bullet in the head! Back off!]

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,760
[Back off!]

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,600
-Is everyone alright?
-Yes.

16
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,480
[-What did I do?]
[-Quiet!]

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,520
[-Quiet!]
[-Quiet.]

18
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,840
[You wanted to smuggle in
nerve gas through Aqaba]

19
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,280
[and explosives through Syria.]

20
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,800
[I see you know everything.
So what do you want from me?]

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,720
[Someone's fixing us a big "shabang"
and we don't know who.]

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,400
[Neither do I.]

23
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,800
[Listen, I know you're worried too,
not just me.]

24
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,400
[Want one?]

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,960
[I don't smoke.]

26
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,240
[Why not?]

27
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,040
[Look,]

28
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
[with the treatment
she's getting,]

29
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,920
[Nadia could live for two years
maximum in total misery and then--]

30
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,560
[In our society,
someone of your status]

31
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,840
[would've gotten his daughter a kidney
transplant in Hadassah long ago,]

32
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,640
[but in your society, the Authority
gives preference to its people]

33
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,400
[and your children are at the
bottom of the priority list.]

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,680
[You could save her life,]

35
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
[your daughter could live well
like her friends do,]

36
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,480
[like she deserves.]

37
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
[I'm doing everything
in my power.]

38
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,840
[Ali, I've got five children,
may God keep them safe.]

39
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,560
[I promise you that if one of them
were in Nadia's condition,]

40
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,360
[I'd jump through hoops for him.]

41
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,200
[Nothing would stop me.]

42
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,600
[Ali, who's behind
the nerve gas story in Aqaba?]

43
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,760
[I'd kill everyone on this earth
for my daughter.]

44
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,120
[I'd give up my life for her,
no questions asked.]

45
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,680
[You, sir, all you need to do is
give me one name.]

46
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,120
[One name, Ali.
And we'll take care of your kid.]

47
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,480
[-Abu Ahmad.]
[-Who?]

48
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,480
[Abu Ahmad. Taufiq Hammed.]

49
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,680
[You're making fun of me.]

50
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,680
[This won't end well.]

51
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,000
[I swear to you.]

52
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,280
[-The Panther.]
[-The Panther is dead. We killed him.]

53
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,000
-Stop!
-You had it coming!

54
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Stop!

55
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,920
Let's see what you've got.

56
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,120
You can feel the astringency.

57
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,760
-Is that merlot?
-It's not ready yet, Moreno.

58
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,120
Why are you here?

59
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,120
Abu Ahmad is alive.

60
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,600
-Which Abu Ahmad?
-Your Panther.

61
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,760
-Impossible. I killed him.
-Sadly, it is possible.

62
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,640
But don't sweat it,
he won't be alive much longer.

63
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,040
We're finishing him tomorrow
at his brother's wedding.

64
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,920
We got a heads-up he'll be there.
Most likely.

65
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,080
But I killed him, Moreno,
what's going on?

66
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,680
That's why I wanted you
to hear about it from me.

67
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,160
-But there was a funeral for him.
-Yes, there was.

68
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,680
I'm just not sure the team will get
a definite visual of him on field,

69
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,400
so I could use someone
who's already killed him before.

70
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,320
Look, if you feel unready to be
on field, stay in the command post.

71
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,320
We'll equip the team with cams,

72
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,480
you'll identify the bastard
and they'll finish him.

73
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,640
You'll get to cheer them
and eat all their pastries.

74
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,360
It's only for two hours.

75
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,440
What do you say?
Two hours. It'll be quite a show.

76
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,720
No, no, no. No way.

77
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,560
Too bad. I thought
you'd jump at the opportunity.

78
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,040
Opportunity?

79
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,560
To settle the score.

80
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,320
I've settled my score with the
Panther a long time ago.

81
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,920
I have a new life,
I'm happy.

82
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,440
I meant, settle the score
with yourself.

{\an9}SILWAD VILLAGE
NORTH OF RAMALLAH

84
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,440
[-Congrats, groom.]
[-Thanks, take care.]

85
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,920
[-Shut up and you'll be fine.]
[-Let me go!]

86
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,040
[-I'm getting married tomorrow!]
[-Get in!]

87
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,920
[Let me out!]

88
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,040
[Please, help me,
I have to get out of here.]

89
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,920
[I didn't do anything.]

90
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
[Taufiq?]

91
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,680
[Wow, it's been 18 months
since someone called me Taufiq.]

92
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,360
[I've missed you guys.]

93
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,400
[I've missed you.]

94
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,640
[I can't believe my little brother
Bashir is getting married.]

95
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,000
[Stop crying.]

96
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
[Stop, or your eyes
will swell up.]

97
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,280
[Will you be at the wedding?]

98
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,120
[I'm a Shahid (martyr).
Shahids don't go to weddings.]

99
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,960
[But the Jews have stopped
looking for you.]

100
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,200
[Right, and I don't want them
to start all over again.]

101
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,560
[Take this, Brother.
It's a gift for you and Amal.]

102
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,600
[I couldn't.]

103
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,080
[Take it, don't let me down.]

104
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,520
[Groom.]

105
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,000
[Taufiq, you must see Amal,
she's so pretty.]

106
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
Dad?

107
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,600
What's up, sweetie?

108
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,880
What are you doing?
Give me the keys.

109
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,640
-Where are you headed? To Moreno?
-Yes. Give me the keys.

110
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,320
-Why get into this again?
-I'm not, don't worry.

111
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,760
So then why are you going?

112
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,920
To take care
of something and come back.

113
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,760
-Give me the keys.
-Let someone else take care of it.

114
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,320
Come on, give me the keys!

115
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,280
How could you do this
without telling me?

116
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,920
Is this because I'm doing it
or because I didn't tell you?

117
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,240
You need to discuss
things like that with me!

118
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,040
-What's there to discuss?
-A lot!

119
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,840
We have two kids at home
who need you.

120
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,440
-Gali, give me the keys.
-No way.

121
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Give me the keys!

122
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,800
Talk to me for five minutes,
and I will.

123
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,440
For fuck's sake!

124
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,840
Doron!

125
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,480
Team 8200 will handle
the antenna

126
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,960
that'll pick up the signal
400 meters from the house.

127
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
The problem is
access to the house.

128
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
We can't physically block the area
and risk exposing our team.

129
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
I was thinking--

130
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,600
[-Good morning.]
[-Good morning.]

131
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,640
[-Hey, handsome!]
[-My dear.]

132
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,080
[-How are you?]
[-Fine.]

133
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,800
[Our main man,
so good to see you.]

134
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,000
[-How are you, buddy?]
[-What's up?]

135
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,280
[-I'm fine, and you?]
[-Alive and well.]

136
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,000
Doron will remain in the command post
during the operation.

137
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,760
Moreno, I decided
to join the team on the field.

138
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,080
Anything you care
to share with me?

139
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,520
Didn't you tell him?

140
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,480
You said you wanted
to squash grapes.

141
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,120
Doron will help us
identify Abu Ahmad.

142
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,840
He's the only one
who saw him alive.

143
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,360
Bro, it's your call.
I don't want to interfere, okay?

144
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,000
If you want me in the command post,
I'll stay there. It's your call.

145
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,000
-Look who's here.
-Bro! Move over.

146
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,960
-What's up?
-Get a load of this hunk.

147
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,400
Give us a hug, man.

148
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,680
Bashir Hammed, the Panther's younger
brother, is getting married today,

149
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,920
and we'll be there too.
Abu Ahmad might show up.

150
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,640
According to Intelligence,
he's still alive.

151
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,040
How? Didn't Doron kill him
18 months ago?

152
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,960
-Apparently, he didn't.
-Ali Karmi claims he's still around

153
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,520
and we must
at least check it out.

154
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,600
But Moreno, he hasn't been on
the field in 18 months. No offence.

155
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,680
-What's with you?
-What's the matter?

156
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,720
Hey, this isn't open for debate.

157
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,480
Eli will go over the plan
with you and...

158
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,000
you'll be nice.

159
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,800
I don't get it,
we're going to kill a dead person?

160
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,840
Everyone,
study the route carefully,

161
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,040
especially this emergency
rescue spot.

162
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,560
And this spot
is the helicopter meeting point.

163
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,840
Steve, you lead the way.

164
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,280
Avihai,
according to aerial photographs,

165
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,000
you have a 50 meter clearance

166
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,520
to reach the house
and the street.

167
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,160
Naor comes in as a guest.
Doron and I enter with the pastries.

168
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,320
-Boaz, you'll be at the observation
post. -No way. I'm going in.

169
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,960
Look, we can't both
enter the house.

170
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,080
-It's not fair towards Gali.
-What's she got to do with it?

171
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,080
She's my wife and your sister,
that's what.

172
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,400
Eli and I decided
you'll block the street.

173
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,240
-Eli, come on!
-It's not up for discussion.

174
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
Boaz, are you a child?

175
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
It's a big operation, with many
people, entrances and exits.

176
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,360
I need someone outside.
Should that be me?

177
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,440
Field radios open, no talking
unless we're exposed.

178
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Remember who we're dealing with.

179
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,680
Abu Ahmad killed 116 Israelis

180
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,440
in suicide bombings
that he himself carried out.

181
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,160
116 Israelis.

182
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,480
He's killed more than
any other terrorist.

183
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,720
Women,

184
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,440
children,

185
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,160
elderly,

186
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,000
and soldiers.

187
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,080
The bastard is a murderer
and a dead man.

188
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,040
He's a dead man!

189
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,360
Today we're settling
the score with him.

190
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,600
Good luck.

191
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,720
[Make it shorter
so it doesn't drag along the floor.]

192
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,320
[Hold on, I'll be right back.]

193
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,400
[What are you doing here?
Did anyone see you come in?]

194
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,680
[Of course not. They're all busy
getting groomed and pretty.]

195
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,440
[I can't wait for this mess
to be over!]

196
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,000
[Now it's just you and me here.]

197
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,640
[You're crazy,
wait for tonight.]

198
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,520
[You're a better person
than me.]

199
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,560
[Of course,
a million times better.]

200
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,440
[What's this?]

201
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,360
[-A wedding present.]
[-From whom?]

202
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,480
[Bashir, I don't take money
without knowing whom it's from.]

203
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,120
[I know whom it's from.
Don't you trust me?]

204
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,920
[We'll build a house with this money
and raise lots of kids.]

205
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,920
[No, no, no.]

206
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,920
[Wait for tonight, crazy girl.]

207
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,200
-Get out of the car.
-Why?

208
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,960
Just get out.

209
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,280
Soldier, bro,
I have to get to a wedding.

210
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,000
You're backing up traffic.
Move it.

211
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,360
-Move.
-Come on,

212
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
you can see the car
is full of wedding pastries.

213
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,320
Come on.
Get in the jeep.

214
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,480
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Peace be upon you.]

215
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,840
[Congratulations, groom.]

216
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,840
[-Congratulations.]
[-Thanks.]

217
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,520
{\an9}DAUD'S KNAFEH PASTRIES

218
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,080
[Welcome, dear guests.]

219
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,760
[We're here on this joyous occasion
that celebrates happiness and love,]

220
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,560
[but I'd like to just mention
my younger brother,]

221
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,520
[Abu Taufiq, may he rest in peace,
Bashir's father,]

222
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,160
[and Abu Ahmad,
Taufiq Mustafa Hammed,]

223
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,480
[the brave Panther and
Shahid (martyr), Bashir's brother,]

224
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,720
[who I wish
was with us today.]

225
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:35,520
[With us, however, is Nassrin,
Abu Ahmad's brave wife.]

226
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,360
[Let us say the "Fatiha"
to pray for their souls.]

227
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
["Fatiha".]

228
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,600
[-May God have mercy on us all.]
[-May God have mercy on us all.]

229
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,160
[When I see you, Bashir,
and you, Amal,]

230
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,480
[I say to myself,
this is the best revenge.]

231
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,920
[Despite all that the occupation
has done to us,]

232
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,080
[we still bear children.]

233
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,680
[We're successful, we raise families,
have children and prosper.]

234
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,040
[-Here you go, Abu Khalil.]
[-Thank you.]

235
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,080
[May God have mercy on us all.]

236
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,880
[We'd like to thank brother Abu Khalil
for coming specially from Amman.]

237
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,080
[And now, dear guests,
it's time to celebrate.]

238
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,880
[May God bring joy to you all.]

239
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,720
[Let's sing and dance.]

240
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,640
So, how's civilian life?
How are the olives?

241
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,840
No, no olives.
I grow grapes. I make wine.

242
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,080
Like merlot, Bordeaux?
That stuff?

243
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,640
Bordeaux is a place, bro.
Not a grape.

244
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,040
You've really cleaned up, ah?

245
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,480
So, how's Gali doing?

246
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,040
Boaz said she's thrilled
to have you home again.

247
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,520
Yeah, we're happy,
you know.

248
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,320
I don't know, bro.

249
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,120
-Samir.
-Copy.

250
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,160
Your boss at the bakery just
got a call, someone saw the arrest.

251
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,720
-Does the mother know about it?
-Not as far as we know.

252
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,400
Should we go back, Eli?

253
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,560
You want to go back?

254
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,760
I don't know,
are they on to us or not?

255
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,960
-Moreno, are they on to us or not?
-No, nobody's on to you.

256
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,960
Relax, I was just filling you in.

257
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,600
Chill out, it'll be alright.

258
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,080
Those two are like the old guys
from "The Puppets".

259
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,760
"The Muppets".

260
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,240
How do you know that show?
It was aired before you were born.

261
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,640
-You know I know everything.
-May God help me.

262
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,400
[Do you think
he'll show up?]

263
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,440
[I don't know.
You know I'm against it.]

264
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,120
[Why should he show up now?]

265
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,600
[He wants to see you,
don't you realize that?]

266
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,960
[But why now of all times?
Just to put himself in danger?]

267
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,120
[Now's not the time to discuss this.
It's Bashir's wedding. Let's go.]

268
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,080
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Upon you be peace.]

269
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,680
[-Are you from
"Daud's Knafeh Pastries"? -Yes.]

270
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,800
[I'm Samir and this is Najib.
We'll take care of your wedding.]

271
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,240
[God willing, I hope so.]

272
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,960
[-What took you so long?]
[-We got held up a bit at the checkpoint.]

273
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,120
[Good thing you're here,]

274
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,480
[because leaving the Hammed family
with no sweets is a crime.]

275
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,320
[Go on, start serving.
Lower the flame.]

276
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,120
[-He's in the area, he should be here.]
[-How do you know?]

277
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,320
[His wife told me.]

278
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,520
Getting married, ah? Idiots.

279
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,040
-How's your ex-wife?
-Which one?

280
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,440
Moreno, get married already, so you
can get divorced and live it up.

281
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,560
What's up, Chuck Nurit?
Wanna marry me?

282
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,680
I don't believe it.
It's Amjad Abu Khalef.

283
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,920
We've been on his tail for two years!
-Not now.

284
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,840
-Hell yeah. Tell them to get him.
-Forget Abu Khalef now.

285
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,920
[Don't worry.]

286
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,280
[Thank you very much.]

287
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,600
[-What is it?]
[-The guy from "Daud's Knafeh Pastries".]

288
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,520
[He called to apologize that his guys
are held up at the checkpoint.]

289
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,040
[What? But they're here.]

290
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,280
[Tell them to call him
and calm him down. Call him.]

291
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,920
[They suspect us.]

292
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,400
[We have a problem.]

293
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,080
[What is it?]

294
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,880
[They're looking at us.]

295
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,440
[They must be on to us.
Let's go.]

296
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,240
[-Give me a minute.]
[-No, we have to go now!]

297
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,040
[Guys, please help us
move a table outside.]

298
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,240
[Sorry, we're in a big rush,
we have another event to get to.]

299
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,600
[You arrived late and now you won't
help? Don't make the guests work.]

300
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,920
[-Sorry, we're in a rush.]
[-Just five minutes.]

301
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,320
[Come with us.]

302
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,080
[Just five minutes. Come.]

303
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,320
[Please.]

304
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,720
[-Not a word.]
[-What did we do?]

305
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,120
[Not a word!
Answer only when spoken to.]

306
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,640
[We spoke to your boss.]

307
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,040
[We asked
where his workers are,]

308
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
[the ones who got held up
at the checkpoint.]

309
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,840
[-And?]
[-He said he sent two workers,]

310
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,200
[one with green eyes
and black hair with gel,]

311
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,280
[and the other is dark and fat.]

312
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,360
[We changed the staff last minute.
Abu Eyad wasn't at the bakery then.]

313
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,920
[I'm not buying this bullshit.]

314
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,680
[Sir, I'm really sorry
about the misunderstanding.]

315
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,320
[Please call him again.]

316
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,320
[Tell him they sent
Samir and Najib over instead.]

317
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,680
[Call him.]

318
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,520
Turn off their cellular reception.

319
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,080
No calls can get through beyond
a 200-meter radius of the house.

320
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,360
[It's busy.]

321
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,720
[-Sir--]
[-Step back!]

322
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
[You want to kill me?]

323
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,520
[I have a family to provide for.
The checkpoint held us back.]

324
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,480
[We have another wedding
to get to.]

325
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,920
[-I beg you, talk to him.]
[-Dial.]

326
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,400
[Still busy.]

327
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,840
[Sir, I'd hate to keep
the other family waiting.]

328
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,720
[If our boss hears we got there late
and that we upset you as well--]

329
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,880
[-Alright.]
[-Alright?]

330
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,240
[-Thank you.]
[-Thank you.]

331
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,720
[-Thank you.]
[-Thank you.]

332
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,080
[Why?]

333
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,240
[Fauda, fauda (Chaos)!]

334
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,760
[Steve, get to the meeting point!]

335
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,120
[Move back!]

336
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,040
[Move back!]

337
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
[Bashir!]

338
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,160
[Bashir!]

339
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,600
[Amal!]

340
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,720
[Bashir! Bashir!]

341
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
[Bashir!]

342
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,000
[Bashir!]

343
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,520
[Get out of here!]

344
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
[Let me through!
Let me through!]

345
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,000
-What's going on?
-He fucked up my leg!

346
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,080
-Drive, drive!
-God damn it!

347
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,800
[Stay with me.]

348
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,320
That's Abu Ahmad!
Stop the car!

349
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,240
I told you to stop!

350
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,320
Get in the car, Doron!
That's an order!

351
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,120
Reporting, abort! Abort!

352
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,600
Drive! Drive!

353
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,240
-I can't go through here!
-Follow him!

354
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,400
-They're in for one hell of a fauda.
-Those damn bastards.

355
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,680
Calm down.

356
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,960
-Avihai, contact Moreno.
-Okay, okay.

357
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,040
Moreno, do you copy?
Doron escaped, chasing some old guy.

358
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,480
He's sure it's Abu Ahmad.

359
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,080
The entire village is on your tail.
Get out now!

360
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,880
-Where's Doron?
-I don't know, Moreno.

361
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,800
Nurit,
send a chopper in right now.

362
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,320
Now, now, now!

363
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,120
-It'll be okay, relax.
-Why did he leave the vehicle?

364
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,120
-Why did he get out?
-He saw Abu Ahmad.

365
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,040
-He thinks he saw Abu Ahmad.
-I'm not ditching him, Eli!

366
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,160
Get in, get in!

367
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,560
They're headed west,
two alleys north of you.

368
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,360
-There he is, can't you see?
-Drive.

369
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,600
What's this here?
Turn on the flashlight.

370
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,280
Moreno, what's going on?
Do you see Doron?

371
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,040
You're inches away from him,
I repeat, inches away.

372
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,480
There are three men running east,
200 meters ahead of you.

373
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,720
There!

374
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,000
Guys, get ready for action.

375
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,360
[He's here, he's here.]

376
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,400
[He's here, I just know he is.]

377
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,520
[-Come on.]
[-He's here.]

378
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,240
[Enough, come on.]

379
00:40:24,305 --> 00:41:24,755

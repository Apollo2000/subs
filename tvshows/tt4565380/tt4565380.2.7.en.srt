1
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,560
[ARABIC]
[Okay, and what did you do?]

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,560
[Nothing.]

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,520
[What are you in for?]

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,920
[They claim I was a member
of the tunnel-digging unit in Gaza.]

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,760
[Are you Gazan?]

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,440
[I noticed a slight accent.]

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,240
[Are you Bedouin?]

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,160
[Not in the least.]

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,800
[Besides, what's with all the questions?]

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,600
[Do you know who I am?]

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,120
[No. Am I supposed to know?]

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,000
[I'm Walid Al-Abed.]

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,120
[Nice to meet you. I'm Mohammed Deif.]

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,120
[I'm serious.]

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,400
[Stop it, don't play games.]

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,880
[What's your real name?]

17
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,480
[I told you, my name is Walid Al-Abed.]

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,600
[You're Walid Al-Abed?]

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,760
[Hamas' military wing commander
in the West Bank?]

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,680
[That's right.]

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,480
[What an honor. I can't believe it.]

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,840
[My friends from the unit will never
believe I shared a cell with you.]

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,160
[-So you're one of ours.]
[-Of course I am.]

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,760
[I'm a relative of Abu Al-Abed,
AKA Ismail Haniyeh.]

25
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,200
[I hope you're not a politician like him.]

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,080
[No, pal. As you can see,
I have the hands of a farmer.]

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,680
[-Or rather a tunnel-digger.]
[-Exactly.]

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,680
[How did you get arrested?]

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,160
[You know, somebody ratted me out.]

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,520
[The "songbirds."]

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,400
[What family did you say you're from?]

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,520
[Shamasna.]

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,760
[And what's your name?]

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,440
[Ahmad.]

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,560
[Ahmad Shamasna.]

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,280
["In the name of God,
the Compassionate and Merciful.]

37

[Lord of all the worlds.]

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,480
[Ruler on the Day of Reckoning.]

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,600
[You alone do we worship.]

40
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,640
[Guide us on the straight path, the path
of those who have received your grace,]

41
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,440
[not the path of those
who have brought down wrath,]

42
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,800
[nor of those who wander astray."]

43
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,160
[-Good morning, Madame Shirin.]
[-Good morning, Amos.]

44
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,640
[Did you sleep well?]

45
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,440
[Everything's fine.]

46
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,040
[I'm making idjeh.
You know what idjeh is?]

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,920
[Of course.]

48
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,720
[-Want some?]
[-Yes, thanks.]

49
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,600
[Where'd you learn to speak Arabic?]

50
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,000
[What do you mean, where?]

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,400
[I was born in Baghdad.
My wet nurse was Arab.]

52
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,600
[But you don't have a Baghdadi accent.]

53
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,120
[Were you also like him?]

54
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,480
[-Define "like him."]
[-An undercover operative.]

55
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,200
[My dear...]

56
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,120
[We each have our own past.]

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,360
[Let's eat.]

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,240
[Ever been to Baghdad?]

59
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,800
[No, it's too dangerous.]

60
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,000
[Dangerous? It was an awesome city.]

61
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,840
[We all lived there together,
Arabs and Jews.]

62
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,480
[It was the best place on earth.]

63
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,360
[So that's why you're both--
half Arab, half Jew?]

64
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
[That's right, my dear.]

65
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,080
[I'm an Arab-Jew.]

66
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,600
What are you reading?

67
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,040
"Anna Karenina."

68
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,280
Tolstoy in Arabic?

69
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,080
So...

70
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,080
Wanna go for a drink later?

71
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,280
There's a bar near my place.

72
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,320
-I'm too tired.
-Just for a quick beer.

73
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,200
I'd have to drive home afterwards...

74
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,640
Well, you could...

75
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,680
you could sleep over at my place.

76
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,520
-Sagi...
-What?

77
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,520
We're friends, right?

78
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,160
Yep, we're friends.

79
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,720
-Why the long face, cutie?
-Leave him alone.

80
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,480
-What did I do?
-Knock it off, Herzl.

81
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,160
What are you reading, "Pinocchio"?

82
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,240
-Yes.
-He dies in the end.

83
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,320
Sagi.

84
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,960
You didn't know about Nurit's thing, huh?

85
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,120
-What thing?
-With Moreno.

86
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,160
I'm such a moron.

87
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,200
[Don't beat yourself up.]

88
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,360
-Thanks, bro.
-Go get ready.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,720
Eli, we're still waiting.
Everything's quiet.

90
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,240
I've ID'd a patrol car.

91
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,560
Attention, there's a Palestinian Authority
patrol car not far from you.

92
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,520
<i>It's patrolling the entire area.</i>

93
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,200
Roger.

94
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,400
Here he comes.

95
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,440
Be back here in an hour.

96
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,960
-Eli, he's entering her house.
-Don't go in until he leaves.

97
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,800
<i>Let him fuck her, it'll relax him.</i>
<i>Remember, this is a peaceful abduction.</i>

98
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,600
The patrol car
is driving into their street.

99
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,480
Doron, the PA patrol car is approaching.

100
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,520
I'm on it.

101
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,800
[Hello, guys. Is there a problem?]

102
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,000
[Everything's fine.
License and registration.]

103
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,360
What's he doing?

104
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,800
-Let's get out there.
-Give him a second.

105
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,720
[Here you go, pal.]

106
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,240
Doron, tap twice if we're good to go.

107
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,200
[-Palestinian Preventive Security agent?]
[-I am.]

108
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,920
<i>[We're busy here. Do you need anything?]</i>

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,440
[You know what? I need some help.]

110
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,680
[Drive to the Clock Square.
If you see a red Volkswagen,]

111
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,520
<i>[clear the street</i>
<i>so it can speed through it, okay?]</i>

112
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,280
[Yes, sir. We're under your command.]

113
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,680
<i>[Thanks, pal.]</i>

114
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,240
[Goodbye.]

115
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,640
Well?

116
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,480
Everything's cool.

117
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,680
What's taking him so long?

118
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,680
What's wrong with a little foreplay?

119
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,840
The package is out, awaiting pickup.

120
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,800
<i>You have clearance.</i>

121
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,600
Sagi, you're with me.

122
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,680
[Excuse me, got a light?]

123
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,880
[I don't smoke.]

124
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
[Let's go.]

125
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,080
[Hey, Abu Samara. What's up, buddy?]

126
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,280
[Care for an after-sex smoke?]

127
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,360
Tough guys, huh?

128
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,880
[Peace be upon you, Abu Samara.]

129
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,920
[How do you like your coffee?]

130
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,040
[Black or with sugar?]

131
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
[Look, Abu Samara,]

132
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,200
[I don't have much time.]

133
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,120
[You have two options:
You either cooperate with us]

134
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,240
[or you go to jail.]

135
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,080
[Captain Ayub,]

136
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,760
[don't bust my balls.]

137
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,320
[What do you want?]

138
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,920
[Tell me everything you know
about Al Makdasi.]

139
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,360
[Al Makdasi?]

140
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,520
[Today everyone calls himself Al Makdasi.]

141
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,560
[I see.]

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,840
[Nidal Awdallah. Know him?]

143
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,080
[I'm not some kid
you can threaten to send to jail.]

144
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,720
[You want a Shahid? I'll be one.
It would be an honor.]

145
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,240
[I'm Hamas, in case you forgot.]

146
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,120
[Not one of your Fatah collaborators.]

147
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,880
[Greetings to you, Shahid.]

148
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,080
[I don't recall seeing you shooting at us.
I only remember you hiding in Rafidia,]

149
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,400
[at our last entrance into the city.]

150
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,520
[Shahid... Shahid, my ass.]

151
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,240
[There are soldiers
and there's the higher command.]

152
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,720
[What's the word in Hebrew?]

153
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,560
"A military leader"?

154
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,520
[I'm not like you, Captain Ayub,
stuck in the same place for 15 years.]

155
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,600
[I'm a military leader.]

156
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,440
[I'll show you
what kind of leader you are.]

157
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,200
[Check out these photos I got.]

158
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,440
[You're really photogenic, you know?]

159
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,280
[Do you, Abu Samara?
Your curly hair is lovely.]

160
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,360
[Same as the curly hair... on your back.]

161
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,160
[I get these photos every Thursday.]

162
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,240
<i>[Today is Thursday, Thursday]</i>

163
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,360
<i>[Welcome back, Thursday, welcome back...]</i>

164
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,480
[She's pretty. What's her name?]

165
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,040
[Now, listen to me.]

166
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,440
[Nobody knows about this meeting,
not even your mistress.]

167
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,200
[You either help me with the guy
who calls himself Al Makdasi]

168
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,120
[or Al Arabiya News will be broadcasting
your photos with this pretty lady.]

169
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,000
[I have no contact or communication
with Nidal.]

170
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,480
[He does whatever he wants.]

171
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,520
[He calls us traitors.]

172
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,000
[You can take him down for all I care.]

173
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,880
[We already told him
he's no longer Hamas.]

174
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,320
[If you don't want his ISIS friends
coming here, you'd better act fast,]

175
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,920
[but I can't help you.]

176
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,320
[I'm not a traitor.]

177
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,160
[If you want to take him down,
that's your business.]

178
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,800
[Now listen.
This is how it's gonna go down:]

179
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,560
[You'll contact him and say that you
want him to replace Walid Al-Abed]

180
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,720
[as Hamas' military wing commander
in the West Bank.]

181
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,560
[You'll set up a meeting with him,
saying you want to appoint him.]

182
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,880
[Didn't you hear what I just said?
I'm not a traitor.]

183
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,600
[Just like you didn't betray Abu Ahmad
and your wife]

184
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,200
[and your friend Samir Taha]

185
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,240
[who's doing life in prison
because he wouldn't rat you out]

186
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,360
[and now you're fucking his wife
every morning.]

187
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,040
[Did you honestly think
I didn't know who she is?]

188
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,520
[You truly have no fear of God.]

189
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,080
[Here. I've put Um Nidal's
phone number in this phone.]

190
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,240
[We'll know when you've called her.]

191
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,400
[Are you a man?]

192
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,040
[No.]

193
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,080
[A woman?]

194
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,120
[Well, obviously.]

195
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,400
[You could be an object.]

196
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,160
[I told you, only people.]

197
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,320
[Are you an animated character? Popeye?]

198
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,000
[No, bro, I told you, I'm a woman.]

199
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,960
[-Who then, Miri Regev?]
[-You're crazy.]

200
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,520
[Why Miri Regev?]

201
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,520
[Tell me,]

202
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,080
[what's it like
being the military wing commander?]

203
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,120
[-What do you mean?]
[-I mean,]

204
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,200
[it must be a great honor.]

205
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,480
[I bet your family, friends, women,
really admire you.]

206
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,800
[Yep.]

207
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,840
[But what's it worth
if I never get to see them?]

208
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,240
[Yep.]

209
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,920
[Say,]

210
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,640
[out of all your operations,
which are you most proud of?]

211
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
[Did you seriously just ask that?]

212
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,440
[Listen, you don't have to answer
if it makes you uncomfortable.]

213
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,040
[Were you really a member
of the military wing?]

214
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,800
[Of course.]

215
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
[Why?]

216
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,920
[Forget it, forget it.]

217
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,480
[-Any more questions?]
[-All done.]

218
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,440
[Return to your bunks!]

219
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,760
Get up!

220
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,880
[Wait...] [Easy now...]

221
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,960
[Son of a bitch!]

222
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,720
[Hands against the wall!]

223
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,720
[Watch him!]

224
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,480
[-Be quiet.]
[-You dog!]

225
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,200
[-You dog!]
[-Calm down.]

226
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,400
[Calm down.] [Excuse me.]

227
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,280
[-What is it?]
[-His glasses.]

228
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,960
[-Um Nidal is here.]
[-Let her in.]

229
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,360
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Upon you be peace.]

230
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,880
[-How are you?]
[-Praise God.]

231
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,800
[Um Nidal, you know how dear
the Sheikh was to me]

232
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,360
[and how much I love
the entire Awdallah family,]

233
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,840
[but Nidal won't settle down.]

234
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,080
[He doesn't listen to anyone,
neither to me nor to the leadership.]

235
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,120
[-He's hindered the movement.]
[-He's made a mistake. He knows that.]

236
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,880
[I know there's some friction
between him and the movement.]

237
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,520
[I know you're all angry at him,]

238
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,720
[but I have to remind you, Abu Samara,]

239
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,160
[my son Nidal was raised
in the lap of the movement.]

240
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,480
[He admired the Sheikh]

241
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,280
[and all he wanted was
to be part of the movement.]

242
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,000
[Do you know why we had to meet here?]

243
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,400
[Because of your son.
We're all hiding because of him.]

244
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,800
[He's still young and all he wanted
was revenge. That's why he did it.]

245
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,120
[I beg you, Abu Samara,]

246
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,360
[for my sake
and for the sake of the Sheikh,]

247
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,680
[don't harm my son.]

248
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,320
[God forbid, Um Nidal.]

249
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,560
[I'd never do that.]

250
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,280
[Talk to him. He's like a son to you.]

251
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,680
<i>[He'll do whatever you say.]</i>

252
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,000
[Nidal...]

253
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,880
[I have some news
that's more important than the game.]

254
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,120
[Listen to me.]

255
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,200
[Abu Samara met with Mom.]

256
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,000
[He wants to meet with you.]

257
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,600
[Mom spoke with Abu Samara?
Who asked her to?!]

258
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,440
[You should be grateful to her.
He needs you and your men, Nidal.]

259
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,560
[It's a great opportunity for us.]

260
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,160
[Samir, my dear,]

261
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,320
[I know that your intentions are good,]

262
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,480
[but forget about Abu Samara.]

263
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,760
[We don't need Abu Samara. Forget it.]

264
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,560
[We have money,
we're all set, praise God.]

265
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,560
[What's that?]

266
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,040
[Look.]

267
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,200
[It helps you see clearly at night.]

268
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,960
[Don't turn it on.]

269
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,160
[No way...]

270
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,160
[Give this to Mom and Marwa.]

271
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,560
[You got this from ISIS?]

272
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,680
[Do they want you to carry out
an attack on their behalf?]

273
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,000
[Yes.]

274
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,880
[But first they want
a video of my swear-in.]

275
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,120
[Do you realize what this would mean?]

276
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,120
[You'd be betraying Hamas.]

277
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,400
[-Samir...]
[-Don't "Samir" me!]

278
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,600
[Why ISIS, huh?]

279
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,920
[You want all our Shahid father died for
to disappear in the blink of an eye?]

280
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,920
[And for whom? For those animals?!]

281
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,800
[You expect me to wait around
for Abu Samara and his men?]

282
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,640
[You know what your leadership did
when Assad bombed the Muslims in Syria?]

283
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,920
[They all fled to Qatar,
to five-star hotels with hot tubs.]

284
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,520
[The ones you call "animals"
were the only ones]

285
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,880
[who took up weapons
and defended the Muslims,]

286
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,360
[the only ones who said
we must kill those who are killing us.]

287
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,680
[They went there and fought,
they waited for no one!]

288
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,120
[Nidal,
this isn't Syria, this is Palestine,]

289
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,800
[where our father created
a well-established movement,]

290
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,800
[and you're spitting in his face
instead of repaying him.]

291
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
[They're the ones who spat in my face!]

292
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,480
[They exiled me!]

293
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,560
[I don't even get
why you're fighting for Hamas.]

294
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,240
[You're the one who wants out,
I'm the one who's staying.]

295
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,160
[Come on, Nidal, I'm asking you,
for the sake of Um Nidal.]

296
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,840
[It's an opportunity for both of us.]

297
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,160
[Meet with him,
what's the worst that could happen?]

298
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,360
Al Makdasi thinks he's about to be made
the new military wing commander,

299
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,280
but he's in for a big surprise.

300
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,200
Estimated time of arrival:

301
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,080
After midday prayers, at about 1:00 p.m.

302
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,320
Location: The Kasbah in Nablus.
You all know what I'm talking about.

303
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,600
Not far from there, near the mosque,
a few years back,

304
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,400
is where the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades
killed Yaniv,

305
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,160
so be extra alert.

306
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,080
Be advised that evacuation
could take quite some time

307
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,480
due to all the alleyways
and density of the area.

308
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,080
Remember,
it's the shittiest area of Nablus.

309
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,200
We worked hard on this intel.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime intel.

310
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,080
Stay focused.

[Keep your eyes open,
I don't know what's in store for us.]

323

According to the drone footage,
the alleyways are clean.

324

<i>Keep your eyes open, vehicles</i>

325
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,880
Abu Samara is here.
Doron, at your nine o'clock.

326
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,960
[They're going in.]

[-Thanks.]
[-No problem.]

332
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,160

333
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,320
[Put your faith in God.]

334
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,320
Nurit, someone's coming towards you
from the west,

335
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,120
<i>bearded, wearing a gray shirt.</i>

336
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,440
Keep on him, he could be a terrorist.

00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,040
[He passed me.]

338
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,360
-ID him for me.
-Ten seconds.

339
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,240
Nizar Abu Rmeile, Hamas activist.

340
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,200
<i>Attention: The bearded guy with the cap</i>
<i>is probably armed,</i>

341
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,720
<i>likely there to clear the way</i>
<i>for Al Makdasi.</i>

342
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,440
Keep your eyes open and stay alert.

343
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,640
Eli, he's on the phone.

344
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,520

[What are you doing here?]

347
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
[-Waiting for a friend, why?]
[-Who's your friend?]

348
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,560
Sagi, tap if you've been exposed.

349
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,040
[What is it, pal?]

350
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,160
[What's your name?
What are you doing here?]

351
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,760
[Take it easy, man, it's cool.]

352
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,880
Nice save.

353
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,960
Two guys with black caps approaching you.
Eli, clearance to fire?

354
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,680
Negative, 300,
only if you have definite ID.

355
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,760
[Got a light?]

356
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,680
[What's your name?]

357

[-Munir.]
[-Munir what?]

358
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,680
[Munir what?]

359
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,320
He's been exposed! Get in there, Doron!

360
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,840
[-Munir what?]
[-You ask too many questions.]

361
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,160
<i>Doron, go in there, he's been exposed!</i>

362
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
[Hands up!]

363
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,760
<i>300, they need covering fire!</i>
<i>Stay with them!</i>

364

365
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,560
Get outta there!

366
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
Steve, go in there now!
The whole village is attacking them!

367
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,640
[Back off!]

368
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,760
[Back off!]

369
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,280
God damn it... Fucking son of a bitch!

370
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,440
What the hell happened to you?

371
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,720
-It was my lighter. Thanks.
-Don't thank me, you moron.

372
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,440
-He got away because of you!
-Doron, fuck off! Fuck off!

373
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,080
-Don't talk to me like that!
-Why were you kicked out of

374
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,880
-that 1-2-3-4 unit of yours?
-Doron, what's your problem?

375
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,800
-Stay out of this!
-Don't tell me to stay out of this! Shut up and butt out!

376
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,120
Who the hell do you think you are?

377
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,560
How many of our men
got killed because of you?

378
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,840
This is your personal story, Doron,
admit it.

379
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,480
It's all about you and your vendettas.

380
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,600
My vendettas? They're <i>our </i>vendettas!

381
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,960
So that they don't kill me, you
and your friend here,

382
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,000
who should be thanking me
for saving his life, and so should you!

383
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,560
["Your friend got away"]

384
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,040
[Ayub, you son of a bitch!]

385
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,760
[Nidal, you piece of shit!]

386
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,480
[I'm so fucked!]

387
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,360
[Drive to house number five,
have it guarded 24/7,]

388
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,600
[and get all of Walid's men there,
you hear?]

389
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,200
So...?

390
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,520
Cut it out, Nurit,
I don't need you to defend me.

391
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,480
-Come on, tell me.
-Tell you what?

392
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,120
What happened?

393
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,200
I don't want to talk about it.

394
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,240
You panicked?

395
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,960
Yeah, a little.

396
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,160
It can happen to anyone, and it does.

397
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,760
Nurit, it shouldn't happen to anyone,
certainly not to me

398
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,440
and certainly not when we're there
to take down a terrorist, okay?

399
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,760
Stop tripping, it happens to everyone.

400
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,280
He asks me for a light and my lighter
won't work. I keep trying and trying,

401
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,440
and my hand starts shaking
right in his face

402
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,160
and I can tell the bastard is on to me,

403
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,640
I know he's gonna kill me.

404
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,280
Then motherfucking Doron swoops in,

405
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,000
shoots him in the head,
I get sprayed with his blood,

406
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,040
and then he humiliates me in front
of everyone. Who needs this shit?!

407
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,480
-I didn't sign up for this.
-Welcome.

408
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,200
-Is that it? "Welcome"?
-Yes. Don't be a pussy.

409
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,280
That's how it is here.

410
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,040
Doron saved your life
and already forgot what happened there.

411
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,880
Let it go.
We make mistakes and we move on.

412
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,440
Here.

413
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,320

[Did they show you an actual clip?]

465
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,280
[Yes, they did.] [Okay, and?]

466
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,040
[And what?]

467
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,480
[What did he say?
Was it really the Sheikh's son?]

468
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,440
[Why, do you know him?]

469
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,160
[I did, back when we were kids.
He was one of ours.] [-You mean, Hamas?]
[-Yes.]

470
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,360
[The Sheikh's son tried to save me
from the bitch who sold me out.]

471
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,200
[We're talking too much, Ahmad Shamasna.]

472
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,120
[This place is full of "songbirds."]

473
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,040
[Hi.]

474
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,120
[Hi.]

475
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,400
[Are you mad at me?]

476
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,040
[Why would I be?]

477
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,280
[I don't know.]

478
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,240
[You look angry.]

479
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,120
[Say,]

480
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,920
[don't you ever get confused between
being Amir Mahajne and Doron Kabilio?]

481
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,760
[I'd go insane.]

482
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,400
[It's hard to explain.]

483
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,880
[Try.]

484
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,240
[When I'm on your turf,]

485
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,200
[I feel more at ease.]

486
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,960
[No pressure on me.]

487
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,520
[I'm just Amir.]

488
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,160
[-But it's a lie.]
[-No, it's not a lie.]

489
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,920
[It's easier for me there.]

490
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,360
[-It feels real.]
[-Real? How?]

491
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,520
[Everything you told me was a lie.]

492
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,640
[What I feel towards you isn't a lie.]

493
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,760
[You said you're from
the Palestinian Preventive Security,]

494
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,040
[but look at what you actually do.]

495
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,320
[You said you were single,]

496
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,280
[but you're married, with two kids.]

497
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,440
[I called you Amir.]

498
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,880
[I slept with Amir.]

499
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,920
[How were you planning
to get out of this lie?]

500
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,480
[-I was gonna level with you.]
[-When?]

501
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,880
[After Hamas killed me]

502
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,920
[or after you got me pregnant?]

503
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,160
[-Well...]
[-How could you live with yourself?]

504
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,400
[How can you live with yourself now
when you look at me?]

505
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,240
[Nobody knew about our relationship.]

506
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,360
[I swear by my children's lives.]

507
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,520
[Nobody ordered me to love you.]

508
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,720
[It was a secret and it still is.]

509
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,000
[-Do you even realize what you've done?]
[-I didn't mean for this to happen.]

510
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,640
[There's a reason why I'm here with you]

511
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,800
[and that's why you're in my home,
here, with me.]

512
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,520
[Come on.]

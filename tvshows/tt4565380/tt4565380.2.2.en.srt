You alright?

7

-I heard that...
-Where are the kids?

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,280
At Gali's, like you asked.

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,600
They can't be here. Go take a shower,
I'll get you something to eat.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,520
I'm not hungry.

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,160

[Where? Are they following you?]

30
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,680
[No.]

31
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,480
[The army broke in
and turned the house upside down.]

32

[Is anyone after you, Samir?]

33
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,560
[Are you sure?]

34

[Come in.]

[Um Nidal is a hero, Samir.]

[And she's your mother, Samir.]

48

[One of us must stay by her side]

49
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,840
[and bless her with a grandson.]

[-Hello, Captain Ayub.]
[-Hello.]

[-Where's Abu Maher?]
[-In his office. There's a meeting.]

[-Why didn't he come out to greet me?]
[-I don't know. But you're welcome.]

[You're Maher, aren't you?]

54
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,240
[How did you know?]

55
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,840
[I've known you since you were...
this tall.]

[-The "blessing" has come to visit us.]

58
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,040
[-Have a seat.]
[-Thank you.]

59

[How are you? What's new?]

60
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,280
[Maher, get Captain Ayub
a cup of black coffee.]

61
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,040
[With sugar.]

62
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,840
[Maher, with sugar, please.]

63
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,240
[What's new?]

64
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,680
[We've called in the reserve units.]

65
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,760
[We're not talking house demolitions.
This will be a full-throttle invasion,]

66
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,000
[like in 2002.]

67
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,440
[How can I help?]

68
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,240
[I want to know everything
about Al Makdasi.]

69
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,000
[Whoever assisted him
or wants to assist him,]

70
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,320
[who armed him and who funded him.]

71
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,040
[If anyone so much as brought him a candy,
I want his name.]

72
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,280
[Captain Ayub, I'm head of the
Palestinian Preventive Security.]

73
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,960
[Under no circumstances
will I allow you to bark at me.]

74

[Abu Maher,]

75
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,920
[Moreno was my friend.]

76
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,960
[I know. May God have mercy on his soul.]

77
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,120
[Let me make this clear:]

78
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,040
[We won't stop until we catch him.]

79
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,240
[It would be a pity to take the long way,
innocent people might get hurt.]

80
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,280
[Help me.]

81
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,560
[He's not working alone.]

82
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,880
[First find Walid Al-Abed.]

83
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,040
NABLUS, RAFIDIA HOSPITAL

84
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,560
[-Good morning, Doctor.]
[-Good morning, how are you?]

85
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,080
[-I'm alright, and you?]
[-Fine, thanks.]

86

[Walid.]

87

[You're endangering my patients,
you know that?]

88
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,080
[I wish you'd leave this hospital.]

89
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,160
[I feel as if you tend
to everyone but me.]

90
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,160
[Alright, come with me.]

91
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,880
[Jihad, keep an eye out on the hallway.]

92

[Peace be upon you, Abu Samara.]

[Upon you be peace.]

94

[How are you? What's new?]

95
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,400
[He's using you.]

96
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,640
[Are you worried about me?]

97
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,600
[I'm worried about our men,]

98
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,480
[they are about to go through some
serious shit because of Al Makdasi.]

99
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,560
[He did what every one of our people
wanted to do.]

100
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,000
[I don't care.
It's neither my decision nor his.]

101
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,520
[You know very well
who decides on the strategy.]

102
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,640
[The last thing I need is that all our men
will hide like mice because of him.]

103
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,200
[You're just a kid.]

104
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
[I made a mistake promoting you.]

105
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,080
[You pulled me out of the hideout
at midday for this?]

106
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,000
[We're all hiding. So am I.]

107
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,520
[Do you realize how much trouble
he's causing us?]

108
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,360
[Where is he?]

109
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,120
[I have no idea,
I've stopped all communication with him.]

110
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,080
[Besides, he did something
which is not simple at all.]

111
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,000
[-He killed the undercover Unit Commander.]
[-Wake up, kid!]

112
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,840
[On the streets, Al Makdasi is a hero.]

113
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,120
[But he's no hero.]

114
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,920
[He's a conniving snake]

115
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,880
[and you will be
the first one he strikes.]

116
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,880
[If by mistake any communication
happens with him,]

117
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,160
[tell him
that he must obey the leadership,]

118
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,000
[that they won't tolerate this
any longer.]

119
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,760
[Walid, I'm giving you brotherly advice.]

120
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,400
[Stay away from him.]

121

[Soldiers!]

123

[Too late!]

127
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,360
[Relax, wait till they leave.]

128
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,520
[Halt!]

129
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,560
[Halt!]

130
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,160
[-I work here.]
[-I know who you are.]

131

[On the floor! On the floor!]

132
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,680
[-What do you want from me?]
[-Not a word!]

133

[-I'm a doctor.]
[-Be quiet.]

134

[I told you
that man brings nothing but trouble.]

135
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,800
[Now he calls himself
Abu Seif Al Makdasi.]

136
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,480
[Conveying a message to him won't do.
I have to meet with him.]

137
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,040
[Arrange me a meeting with him,
understood?]

138
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,200
[Step on it!]

139
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,800
[-Is everything alright?]
[-No. Go.]

140
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,600
[What are you doing?]

141
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,800
[You said the army was there,]

142
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,840
[I want to see if they blocked
the road to the house.]

143
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,640
[Why are you carrying a cell phone
with you in the first place?!]

144
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,640
[I bet there's a drone right above us
because of you!]

145
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,760
[You idiot!]

146
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,720
[Don't you understand
we've gone underground?]

147
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,200
[That means no phones,
no internet, nothing!]

148
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,440
[Go, go!]

149
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Let's get this over with, bro.

150
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,800
Let's do it.

151
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,520
"With great sorrow we announce
the death of our son Michael Moreno."

-I'm sorry for your loss.
-Thank you.

154

How are you holding up?

155
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,120
He loved you so much.

156
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,640
I'm sorry...

157
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,680
Why didn't you watch over him
more carefully?

158
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm so sorry...

159
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,560
-Stay safe.
-Sorry for your loss.

160
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,760
Hey, Nurit.

161
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,880
-Could I have a word with you?
-We have nothing to talk about.

162
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,600
-It was bound to happen, wasn't it?
-Fine...

163
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,520
I can't take it anymore.

164
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,320
You're the one who’s supposed
to console me, aren't you?

165
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah. How are you?

166
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,440
Okay, I took enough Valium
to sedate four people.

167
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,640
-I could use one, too.
-I highly recommend it.

168
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,600
Especially with vodka.

169
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,320
I'm sorry.

170
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,440
Were you there?

171
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,160
Yes.

172
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,080
Did you see him?

173
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,480
He didn't feel a thing.

174
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,880
Gimme a break...

175
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,440
-Come here, bro.
-One second.

176
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,320
-Easy now.
-Thanks.

177
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,400
How about laying off the whiskey?

178
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,440
Okay.

179
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,960
Enough of this.

180
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,600
-What's this?
-He got it after Operation Katana.

181
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,960
-Really?
-Is it any good?

182
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,120
They went all out, 12% alcohol.

183
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,880
"To Moreno, with appreciation
for your work in Operation Katana."

184
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,520
Open it. Who cares where he got it?

185
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,160
Did you get a load of Moreno's sister?

186
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,040
-Anat?
-Yeah, man...

187
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,320
-She's cute.
-"Cute"? Are you blind?

188
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,360
-What about her?
-Everything.

189
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,000
-Moreno's sister?
-Yeah, bro.

190
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,200
-You know what I'd do to her?
-No, what?

191
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,920
I'd bang her all the way to kingdom come.

192
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,040
Bro, behind you.

193
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,360
Little ass. I love that.

194
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,160
She's right there.

195
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,720
Sorry.

196
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,000
Idiot.

197
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,320
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

198
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,800
So you wouldn't bang me?

199
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,000
I would.

200
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,920
I mean... never mind, I'm sorry.

201
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,560
-Anat.
-Hi, I'm Steve.

202
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,000
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

203
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,960
-Here's to Moreno.
-To Moreno.

204
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,240
It's good.

205
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,440
The minister didn't skimp on him.

206
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,000
Come join us.

207
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,440
I...

208
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,400
You dope...

209
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
You know why he never drank this?

210
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,240
He kept it for a year in his lousy fridge
and it never got cold.

211
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,000
He hated that fridge.

212
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,840
Like, get a new one, cheapskate,
how expensive could it be?

213
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,320
He used to duct-tape its door shut...
Moron.

214
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,960
I'd like to say a few words.

215
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,960
For years we suffered the stench
of this mini fridge, day after day.

216
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,800
It didn't cool anything

217
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,560
and yet it excelled
in making lots of noise,

218
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,680
leaking and whatnot, but...

219
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,320
Dead.

220
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,480
Nurit!

221
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,040
Chuck Nurit!

222
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,280
It's all here.
He kept a ton of whiskey here.

223
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
Eli?!

224
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,680
-What's up?
-What are you guys doing here?

225
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,120
-What are you doing here, man?
-Are you here for the shivah?

226
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,240
Not exactly.

227
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,200
-How have you been?
-Come here.

228
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,280
-How's it going, man?
-How are you?

229
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,000
-How's everything?
-Look at him!

230
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,840
-This is Sagi.
-Sagi.

231
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,600
Unit 2735.

232
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,000
You gave up the AC
to be in the heat of things.

233
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,240
-What's new?
-What's going on?

234
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,800
They pulled me out of training in London,
told me to catch the first plane here.

235
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,840
Really? Why?

236
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,880
The minister wants me
to take over for Moreno.

237
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,720
Oh.

238
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,360
Wait, isn't officer training
a prep program for unit 400?

239
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,800
That's what I thought, too.

240
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
I met with the minister and the head of
the Intelligence Directorate all morning.

241
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,600
They want us back in the field ASAP.

242
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,400
Everything's on hold
until Al Makdasi is dead.

243
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,280
Dead.

244
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,200
Not captured, not interrogated.

245
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,880
Dead.

246
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,520
And not just because of Moreno.

247
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,160
They estimate
he's targeting the entire unit.

248
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,320
Look, I...

249
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,520
I also feel like crap,
but we gotta get back to work,

250
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,080
we're running out of time.
We won't stop until we finish him off.

251
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,160
Do we have any intel on him?

252
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,360
He's currently working with Walid Al-Abed.

253
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,640
While Ayub tracks down Walid,
we'll work on possible MOs.

254
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,160
Now I want you all to hit the sack.
I need you focused tomorrow morning.

255
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,040
Get going.

256
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,200
Find a designated driver.

257
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,960
Doron...

258
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,360
Hold on, I need to talk to you.

259
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,200
Give me one.

260
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,720
How's your leg?

261
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,680
Fine. Moreno ruined your vacation, huh?

262
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,640
-You call officer training a vacation?
-It's in England, sounds peaceful.

263
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,840
"Peaceful..." It was fuckin' boring.

264
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,240
The food sucked.

265
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,800
I couldn't understand
half of what they were saying.

266
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,080
Why not?

267
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,720
Half of England is Arab.

268
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,840
What do we do, Eli? What do we do?

269
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,080
We take down that son of a bitch.

270
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,960
Don't let it get to you,
now’s not the time,

271
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,240
I need you here with me, focused.

272
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,480
I have no time for bullshit.

273
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,600
I have to be able to trust
that you're working with me

274
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,320
and to trust that you're working
as part of the team.

275
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,440
Sure thing, bro.

276
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,080
Including Naor?

277
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
What about Naor?

278
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,040
No bullshit.

279
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,240
No talking behind his back.

280
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,480
I'm not a child, Eli.

281
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,400
[You got married. Congratulations.]

282
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,680
[Allow me.]

283
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,680
[During your studies abroad,
didn't you live in the Latin Quarter?]

284
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,000
[That's some quarter, huh?]

285
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,360
[Great food.]

286
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,400
[I once had
salted caramel ice cream there.]

287
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,760
[What a delight...]

288
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,800
[What was the name of that shop?]

289
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,400
[It was a small shop,
they'd close at four o'clock.]

290
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,760
"Mon Petit Éclair."

291
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,520
[Bravo. That's the one.]

292
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,960
"Mon Petit Éclair."

293
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,600
[And across from it there's a mosque.]

294
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,840
[You used to pray there, didn't you?]

295
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,840
[I'm not religious.]

296
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,960
[What do you want from me?]

297
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,640
[I need to know where your husband is.]

298
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,480
[So do I.]

299
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,120
[When did you see him last?]

300
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,480
[A few months ago.]

301
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,840
[Must be tough.]

302
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,520
[It's very tough.]

303
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:42,960
[Your husband is now Israel's
most wanted man. A true honor.]

304
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,960
[I bet people are encouraging you, Shirin] [but you see,]

305
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,960
[he's connected to the killing]

306
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,520
[of a high-ranking officer]

307
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,680
[and to another attack
where civilians were killed.]

308
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,880
[I can't let you go until
you give me some sort of information.]

309
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,120
[Do you really think I'd sell him out?]

310
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,560
[You have nothing on me.]

311
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,480
Nurit, Sagi...

312
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,040
Assume your starting position.

313
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
Go!

314
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,200
Nice one, Nurit!

315
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,280
Very good, resume contact. Contact!

316
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,960
Nice!

317
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,800
Come on, Sagi.

318
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,440
Come on, resume contact.

319
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,600
Protect your face, Nurit.

320
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,360
Nice one.

321
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,520
Waiting for your tap, Nurit.

322
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,160
Waiting for your tap!

323
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,920
Nurit, give it up.

324
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,960
Waiting for your tap, Nurit.

325
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,680
-Nurit, I'm waiting for your tap.
-Give up!

326
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,160
-Surrender!
-Break contact!

327
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,520
Why?! Why'd you stop?!

328
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,960
Son of a bitch...

329
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,440
Let's move on.

330
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,000
Doron, Naor.

331
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,160
Let's practice. Midriff only.

332
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,680
Go! Resume contact.

333
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,840
Good job, good job.

334
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,960
Resume contact.

335
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,080
What's gotten into you?! Get a grip!

336
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,960
What are you doing?!

337
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,080
Step back. Calm down, you two.

338
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,520
Fine.

339
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,240
Get ready.

340
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,400
Protect your faces.

341
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,520
Get set.

342
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,440
Go!

343
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,240
-Come at me!
-Break it up!

344
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,600
-Stop!
-Naor! Naor!

345
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,920
Let go of him!

346
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,120
-Enough!
-Break it up, guys!

347
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,400
Let go of him!

348
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,560
-Break it up!
-Stop!

349
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,480
-Come at me!
-Enough!

350
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,720
-Let go of me!
-Don't touch me!

351
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,960
Come at me, you coward!

352
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,960
-What happened out there?
-You saw him.

353
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,640
-I asked you to resolve things in private!
-Don't lecture me, Eli!

354
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,880
I'm not lecturing you!
I'm reassessing things here,

355
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,320
all the regulations, all the systems,
which includes you,

356
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,800
-and I see you've got a problem.
-No, I don't.

357
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,480
I'll talk to him.

358
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,160
You bet you will.
If you two can't work together,

359
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,640
-you'll be the one leaving.
-Fine.

360
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,960
I'll talk to him.

361
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,800
Good. Thanks.

362
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,400
And go see Ayub, he needs you. [God will ease her pain.]

363
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,320
[May God keep your wife strong.]

364
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,720
[Don't worry.]

365
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,760
[I'm not worried.]

366
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,680
[But none of this would've happened
had you not acted like an idiot.]

367
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,040
[-I didn't mean to.]
[-Learn to obey orders.]

368
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,320
[Hello, Father.]

369
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,040
[-How are you?]
[-How are you?]

370
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,840
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Upon you be peace.]

371
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,000
[-Welcome back.]
[-Thank you.]

372
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,480
[-How are you?]
[-All is well, thank God.]

373
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,280
[First of all, you should know
we wired money to your mother.]

374
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,240
[What they've done to your home is awful.]

375
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,600
[God bless you, Abu Samara. After you.]

376
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,960
[-Your father, may he rest in peace...]
[-Thank you.]

377
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,920
[...he was a father to us all,
you know that,]

378
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,760
[and you mean a lot to us.]

379
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,400
[We're sure you'll go far,]

380
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,000
[but first, you must obey
the movement's orders.]

381
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,200
[With all due respect to everyone,
Abu Samara,]

382
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,440
[blood comes before orders.]

383
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,560
[And there's a personal vendetta.]

384
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,840
[Those are old concepts.]

385
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,880
[If everyone retaliated
however they see fit,]

386
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,240
[there would be no end to it.]

387
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,200
[I have no choice.]

388
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,120
[I'm not consulting with you]

389
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,000
[and I'm not your friend.]

390
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,640
[I'm the leader of Hamas in the West Bank
and your commanding officer.]

391
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,280
[Don't worry. Nidal will do as he's told.]

392
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,960
[It's the movement's orders
to cease all activity.]

393
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,480
[It's a mistake.]

394
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,160
[I didn't ask your opinion.]

395
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,960
[Your father, may he rest in peace,
was a wise man.]

396
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,280
[Our strength lies in our unity.]

397
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,560
[If one member takes matters
into his own hands, we'll come apart.]

398
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,720
[May he rest in peace,]

399
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,880
[but if he saw
the state the movement is in today...]

400
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,560
[What was that?]

401
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,440
[The last member to carry out attacks
was Abu Ahmad, may he rest in peace.]

402
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,000
[We've been at a standstill
ever since he sacrificed his life.]

403
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,920
[You've turned into
the Palestinian Authority--]

404
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,800
[you talk a lot and then cut deals
with the Zionists behind our backs.]

405
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,440
[-I suggest you weigh your words.]
[-Why?]

406
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,280
[-Am I wrong?]
[-What do you know anyway?]

407
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
[You've only just returned.]

408
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,840
[You think you've come back?
You're still a tourist!]

409
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,920
[If you disapprove,
you're welcome to return to Syria.]

410
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,800
[At least there they know
how to handle traitors.]

411
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,120
[This is your final warning!]

412
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,120
[Carry out one more independent operation]

413
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,600
[and you'll be through with Hamas!]

414
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,600
["God, would You destroy us for what
the foolish among us have done?"]

415
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,240
[-Good thing your father can't hear you.]
[-Hold it, hold it...]

416
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,240
[Mention my father one more time
and you'll never again]

417
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,920
[-see the light of day.]
[-Nidal...]

418
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,120
[-Watch it, you jackass!]
[-Calm down!]

419
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,680
[We're all on the same team here,
we're not enemies!]

420
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,680
[-Let's calm down and talk.]
[-I'm done talking.]

421
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,560
[And you, Walid,
must decide whose side you're on.]

422
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,560
-Hey, what's up?
-Barbur, recharge this for me.

423
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,840
Fuck...

424
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,680
What is she doing here?

425
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,280
<i>[They entered the city.]</i>

426
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,640
<i>[There's already one casualty,</i>
<i>a 19-year-old.]</i>

427
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,840
She's here because of Walid.

428
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,000
He's the only one who knows
how to get to Al Makdasi.

429
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,400
You expect me to talk to her?
She'll never cooperate with me.

430
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,960
No harm in trying, Doron.
Besides, she's my only lead.

431
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,600
I can't let her go
until she gives me what I need.

432
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,960
Don't promise her anything.

433
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,400
<i>[Wouldn't you feel guilty</i>
<i>if there were casualties?]</i>

434
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,800
Excuse me?

435
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,200
-Get out.
-Excuse me?!

436
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,000
[-What's he doing here?]
[-Ayub will explain it to you.]

437
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,120
-Give me the keys.
[-Come back!]

438
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,400
She has to stay handcuffed.

439
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,080
[Come back!
Please don't leave me alone with him!]

440
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,960
What is he doing?!

441
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
Dana, it serves our purpose. Sit down.

442
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,480
[Stay away from me and don't touch me.]

443
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,920
[Uncuff yourself.] [How are you doing, Shirin?]

444
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,600
[Are you alright?]

445
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,600
[I'm here to help you.]

446
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,160
[Go away. Please.]

447
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,080
[I'm here to help you.]

448
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,560
[What do you want from me?]

449
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,280
[I'm here to help you get out of here.]

450
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,840
[Then release me,
what are you waiting for?]

451
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,960
[You're mad at me,]

452
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,760
[and rightfully so,]

453
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,280
[but I'm not to blame for everything
that happened to you.]

454
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,960
[I can help you.]

455
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,520
[How?]

456
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,720
[I'll get you out of the West Bank
if you want.]

457
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,360
[I'm married.]

458
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,800
[Yes, I know that.] [Where would you send me?]

459
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,440
[Wherever you like, even France.]

460
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,680
[Again with the lies?]

461
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,160
[That's not true!]

462
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,880
[I never lied about
my feelings towards you.]

463
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,120
[You lied about everything!
You didn't even tell me your name!]

464
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,720
[My name is Doron Kabilio.]

465
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,920
[I'm a divorced father of two,
a boy and a girl.]

466
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,000
[Can I uncuff you now?]

467
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,520
[Please,
it pains me to see you like this.]

468
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:40,200
[I'll never believe a word you say,
don't you understand?]

469
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,040
[I really want to help you,
I owe you that much.]

470
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,240
[If you give us Walid,]

471
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,120
[I'll relocate you and you'll be free.]

472
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,080
What the hell are you doing?!

473
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,280
Did you think she'd talk
if there's nothing in it for her?

474
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,560
So now I'm supposed to send her to France?

475
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,040
Can you?

476
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,960
I don't know.

477
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,600
First get her to talk, then we'll see.

478
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,320
Bye.

479
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,040
Hope you didn't promise
to fly her business class.

480
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,840
BIRZEIT UNIVERSITY

481
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,040
[The story you told us
was very compelling.] Ahmad, what story did you choose?

482
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,960
-Okay, out of the three, I choosed...
-No. "Chose."

483
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,280
Out of the three stories I read,

484
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,440
I chose "Lie Land." I believe what the protagonist
is saying is

485
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,360
that lying that something bad happened
to someone is more credible

486
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,880
than saying that something good
happened to someone.

487
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,280
[You don't have to use
such an Israeli accent.]

488
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,840
I think the story was quite interesting,

489
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,360
-but I didn't found it amusing.
-No. "Find."

490
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,640
-I didn't find it amusing.
-Good.

491
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,040
[Today's lesson was very fruitful.]

492
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,760
[Don't forget your weekly assignment.
Good job, everyone.]

493
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,520
[When did you get a chance to read it?]

494
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,640
[I didn't. I read half
and then watched the movie.]

495
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,480
[It's a ton of pages,
I never would've finished it in time.]

496
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,120
[Hello, "Lie Land"!]

497
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,400
[Wanna go get a haircut?]

498
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,480
[Sure, let's go.]

499
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,120
[Marwa.]

500
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,560
[-Hey there, darling.]
[-Hey there, sweetheart.]

501
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,400
[How are you feeling?]

502
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,400
[Alright, no morning sickness today,
thank God.]

503
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,840
[Thank God.]

504
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,400
[In the name of God...]

505
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,200
[Are we next?]

506
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,440
[Yes, we are.]

507
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,320
[Excuse me,]

508
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,960
[have you been to this doctor before?]

509
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,280
[She's great.]

510
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,440
[-Great-great or...?]
[-Great.]

511
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,680
[Thanks.]

512
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,160
[See? I told you,]

513
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,480
[she's the best there is,] [-well worth the money.]
[-Alright.]

514
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,520
[Excuse me.]

515
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,840
[Samir! Samir!]

516
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,880
[-Get out!]
[-Samir!]

517
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,960
[Leave! He'll be alright.]

518
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,560
[Samir!] [Where is your brother?]

519
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,280
[I don't know.]

520
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,040
[Where is your brother?]

521
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,000
[Where is he?]

522
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,160
[I don't know.]

523
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,880
[He won't tell anyone, not me nor my mom,]

524
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,960
[as you already know.]

525
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,040
[Liar!] [Do you know who I am?]

526
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,840
[Do you know who I am?]

527
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,880
[Doron.]

528
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,000
[Correct.]

529
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,520
[And I'll kill you just as I killed
your father, understand?]

530
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,360
-Doron!
-Shut up!

531
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,720
[Your brother wants a vendetta?
He's got one coming!]

532
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,920
[He killed my friend,
and you and he are gonna pay for it.]

533
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,120
[Doron, stop!]

534
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,680
[Where is he?
Tell me where your brother is!]

535
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,880
[I'm not afraid to die,
I'm a Shahid just like you!]

536
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,080
[-Where is he?]
-That's enough.

537
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,840
Take him in.

538
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,680
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Hi, guys.]

539
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,240
[Upon you be peace.]

540
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,920
[Come on in.]

541
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,000
[What did you two talk about?
I came in only after--]

542
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,640
[-I heard what he said.]
[-You're wrong.]

543
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,000
Speak Hebrew.

544
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,760
How was the lesson?

545
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,640
-Good.
-"Sababa."

546
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,520
Say "sababa."

547
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,000
Sababa.

548
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,080
It was sababa.

549
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,480
It's great that you're all here.

550
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,280
We have a lot of work to do.

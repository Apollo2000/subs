1
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,360
It's boiling hot in here.

2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,880
Give him some water. Let's go.

3
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,080
It's time.

4
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,480
God is with you.

5
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
Have no fear.
Go, leave the bag there and come back.

6
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,080
We can't screw this up, you know.

7
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,480
I assembled it myself.

8
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,440
<i>They'll be on to me.</i>

9
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,120
Relax and trust God, my friend.
Have no fear.

10
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,680
Nidal, tell him to come back.

11
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,560
Let's get out of here
before they're on to us.

12
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,600
I'm not afraid, but look at them,
they're all around me.

13
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,000
<i>It's alright, have no fear.</i>

14
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,120
Trust God and don't be afraid.
Go, God is with you.

15
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,360
<i>Do as we planned,</i>
<i>put the bag down and come back.</i>

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,760
Tell him to come back
before they catch us, too!

17
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
Everything's under control, okay?

18
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,760
Come, come.

19
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,280
Where to?

20
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,240
Get in,
we have to be there in 30 minutes.

21
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,480
Let's have some coffee.

22
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,480
Slow down, you're killing the engine.

23
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,920
Do it for the kids, Doron.

24
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,480
Peace be upon you.

25
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,440
May the peace, mercy and blessing
of God be upon you.

26
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,200
-Peace be upon you.
-Upon you be peace.

27
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,120
-Isn't Abu Ala'a around?
-He couldn't make it today.

28
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,640
He told me
you needed twenty sacks of hay.

29
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,520
Twenty, that's right.

30
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,000
-I'm Izat Abu Kwaider.
-Nice to meet you.

31
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,800
What would you like to drink?
Coffee? Tea?

32
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,560
No, thanks.

33
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,680
We'll be leaving in five minutes.

34
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you. Thanks.

35
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,000
-Goodbye.
-Farewell.

36
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,040
Let's roll.

37
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,440
<i>In the name of the all merciful God,</i>

38
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,000
<i>Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades,</i>

39
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,960
<i>the military wing of</i>
<i>the Islamic resistance movement Hamas,</i>

40
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,080
<i>has claimed responsibility</i>
<i>for the heroic attack</i>

41
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,080
<i>in the settlement of Oranit</i>

42
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,800
<i>that led to the killing</i>
<i>of five soldiers of the Occupation.</i>

43
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,960
The window is clean.

44
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,160
There's no need, I'm telling you.
Listen, do you hear me?

45
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,480
Easy now.

46
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,360
-What...?! Who are you?
-Drive.

47
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,560
Drive, drive.

48
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,240
Open the door.

49
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,160
What's going on?

50
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,720
Quiet! Sit down!

51
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,680
Kidnapping me?
Is that what we've come to?

52
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,800
Are you crazy?

53
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,480
What gives you the right to kidnap me?

54
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,480
I didn't kidnap you.

55
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,480
We're friends, aren't we?

56
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,200
I don't know anything about it.

57
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,120
Children died there.

58
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,200
As I said, I know nothing.

59
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,720
But I'm sure now you know
who did it, don't you?

60
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,560
The Shahid,
the Shahid that committed the attack.

61
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,080
No, no, no. I'm not referring
to that son of a bitch.

62
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,920
I want to know
who recruited him to Hamas.

63
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,440
Who authorized that attack?

64
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,760
-Was it Abu Samara?
-We're in a shitty situation,

65
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,040
-it's shitty!
-Relax, my friend, relax.

66
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,760
Here.

67
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,680
Have some orange juice.

68
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
There are rumors.

69
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,280
I like rumors.

70
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,640
From what I heard,
it's some guy from Syria.

71
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,800
They say he was trained by ISIS,
an explosives expert.

72
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,920
His nickname is "Al Makdasi."

73
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,600
But who is he?

74
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I already told you, I know nothing.

75
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,000
If anything should happen to you,
call my safe phone number.

76
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,720
Yes, sir.

77
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
What are you doing?

78
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,920
What's so funny? I could've killed you.

79
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,680
I don't think so. With a tray?

80
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,160
Why did you come here?

81
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,760
The Jews are watching the house
all the time.

82
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,800
I don't care. I had to see you.

83
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,880
I can't.

84
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,040
I can't today.

85
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,560
Go take a shower.

86
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,960
I'll prepare you something to eat.

87
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,880
Do you want French toast?

88
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,680
I want you.

89
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,560
God bless your hands.

90
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,600
Should I prepare some
for your friend as well?

91
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,200
There's no need. Come sit with me.

92
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,560
-Have you spoken to my mother?
-Yes, she misses you a lot.

93
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,320
-And how is your mother?
-She's alright.

94
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,360
She sends her regards
and thanks for everything. You can't just show up here.
They'll catch you.

95
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,960
Don't worry.

96
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,120
I'm familiar with all their tactics,
I know when they're in the area.

97
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,080
-I see them around here all the time.
-Don't worry.

98
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,560
-Don't risk your life.
-Don't worry.

99
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,480
Fine.

100
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,560
Do you want anything else?

101
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,160
A baby boy.

102
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,720
Or a girl.

103
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,760
Or even twins.

104
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,160
Soon, God willing.

105
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,720
-Come.
-Where to?

106
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,560
Follow me.

107
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,640
Hurry up.

108
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,400
Move it, mister.

109
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,840
Peace be upon you, Abu Ala'a.

110
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,800
May the peace, mercy and blessing
of God be upon you.

111
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,640
-How is your father doing?
-He will be alright, God willing.

112
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,400
-It's nothing too serious.
-May he get well soon, God willing.

113
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,440
-Thank you.
-Come with me.

114
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,560
Look, Abu Ala'a,
if my father owes you money,

115
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,800
we can work it out.
There's no need for war.

116
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,880
If there's anything you need, I'm here.

117
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,400
That's not the issue.

118
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,520
I have something to show you.

119
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,680
Come. Talk.

120
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm sorry, Sheikh. I never...
The drugs--

121
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,960
Enough!

122
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,200
Tell him what you told me.

123
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Tell him who was shooting at him.

124
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,720
Al Makdasi.

125
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,640
Who's Al Makdasi?

126
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,600
Talk!

127
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,280
Al Makdasi, that's what they call him.

128
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,920
Who is Al Makdasi?

129
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,920
Talk!

130
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,240
He's connected to Hamas.

131
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,200
He's looking for you.

132
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,599
He's got your photo, he personally
wants to take you down.

133
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,200
Who sent him?

134
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,040
Nobody.

135
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,760
Where's he from?

136
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,200
Tell him!

137
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,000
They say he's Sheikh Awdallah's son.

138
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,480
They also say...

139
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,080
that you blew up his father,

140
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,320
that you strapped
an explosive belt on him.

141
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,400
Peace be upon you.

142
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,280
May the peace, mercy and blessing
of God be upon you.

143
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,280
Get in, don't be shy.

144
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,760
-How are you?
-Praise God. And you?

145
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,680
Praise God.

146
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,720
Let's go.

147
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,920
We have to make a quick stop on the way.

148
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,360
Where?

149
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,960
You'll see soon enough.

150
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,680
Alright.

151
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,640
Where did it happen exactly?

152
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,200
Nidal, let's get out of here,
this place is too exposed.

153
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,720
Walid, I want to know.

154
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,040
You were here, right?

155
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,040
My dear, it's not--

156
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,840
-Where was he standing?
-Abu Ahmad made me do it,

157
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,160
-I had no choice.
-I'm not blaming you, Walid.

158
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,120
Over there.

159
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,600
What parts of him did you bury?

160
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,800
Nidal...

161
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,080
His head?

162
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,120
Nidal, for God's sake,
I beg you, let's go.

163
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,360
Tell me, Walid.

164
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,680
His head
and any body parts we could find.

165
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,320
We combed the area.

166
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
We paid our respects to him.

167
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,000
Abu Nidal was a father to us all.

168
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,080
May God's mercy be upon him.

169
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,080
God bless you.

170
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,360
"May God deliver me
from the evil Satan. In the name of God, the infinitely
Compassionate and Merciful.

171
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,240
Praise be to God,
Lord of all the worlds.

172
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,520
The Compassionate, the Merciful.
Ruler on the Day of Reckoning.

173
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,800
Guide us on the straight path,

174
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,360
the path of those
who have received your grace,

175
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,320
not the path of those
who have brought down wrath,

176
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,240
nor of those who wander astray. Amen."

177
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,280
Let us put our faith in God.

178
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,080
Let us put our faith in God.

179
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,520
God is grand.

180
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,720
My dear.

181
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,320
You're crazy.

182
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,520
-The Jews were here today, you know.
-Yes, but I have something here.

183
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,080
I'm sorry.

184
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,280
I didn't mean to interrupt,
I'm just here to pick up something.

185
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,880
Hi, Nidal, it's no bother.

186
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,280
-She's dying for us to move out of here.
-And you?

187
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,080
I can't leave Mom all alone.

188
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,840
For God's sake, where is it?

189
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,840
It's the middle of the night,
where will you go?

190
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,360
All eyes are on me, buddy.
I don't have much time.

191
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,200
-May God help you.
-Have you seen my bag?

192
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,000
Here it is.

193
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,200
God bless your hands, Um Nidal.

194
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,960
I worry about you, my son.

195
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
I worry about you, too, Mother.

196
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,440
Samir, darling, go to sleep.

197
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,640
Yes, Samir, go to sleep.

198
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,600
Put your trust in God.

199
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,360
Watch out for yourself.

200
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,560
If there's anything you need,
you know who to turn to.

201
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Good night.

202
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,880
-Good night.
-Good night, buddy.

203
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,080
Nidal, wait. I must talk to you
before you leave.

204
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,440
Alright.

205
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,000
I know why you came back here, Nidal.

206
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,080
You think what happened to your father
doesn't hurt me?

207
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,200
I was there today.

208
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,560
What for?

209
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,960
I had to see it with my own eyes.

210
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,520
You are a son of Hamas,

211
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,120
and you must lead the movement
like your father did.

212
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,960
Revenge won't help us,
it's not what's important.

213
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,360
Well, it is to me.

214
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,520
That Jewish dog

215
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,880
will die,

216
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,520
I promise you,
but don't waste your time on him.

217
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,560
What happens in life is more important.

218
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,760
The dead are already gone.

219
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,840
You're right, Mother.

220
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,480
Good.

221
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,480
"Ayub: You wanted me to use you, right?
I've got an idea."

222
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,440
NABLUS, JNAID NEIGHBORHOOD

223
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,560
Nidal.

224
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,840
Izat Abu Kwaider wrote a message
under Ali's username.

225
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,920
He wants to talk.

226
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,520
Alright. Bless you.

227
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,120
Peace.

228
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,080
-Enjoy your haircut.
-Thanks, Abu Naim.

229
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,040
-You're welcome, my friend.
-God bless your hands.

230
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,280
Thanks.

231
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,600
With your permission...

232
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,960
What did you want
to talk with me about?

233
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,880
The Sheikh wants me to meet with Doron.

234
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,280
<i>Why?</i>

235
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,920
The bastard suspects me. I guess
he wants to question me about you.

236
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,360
<i>But don't worry, I fled to Hebron.</i>

237
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,000
Don't meet with him.

238
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,120
<i>What's the problem?</i>

239
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,120
I have no choice but to meet with him.
The Sheikh will kill me.

240
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,240
<i>Well, may God be with you.</i>

241
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,880
Just wanted to update you.

242
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,160
Where will you meet with him?

243
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,040
I don't know,
but the Sheikh said in Jerusalem.

244
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,640
-Well, goodbye, then.
<i>-Hold on.</i>

245
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,360
Tell him to go to Nablus.

246
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,880
<i>Alone.</i>

247
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,760
He won't do it.

248
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,440
Tell him you know
who tried to take him down,

249
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,120
and he will come.

250
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,920
<i>There's a cafe</i>
<i>near the Great Mosque of Nablus</i>

251
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,360
Friday, before the prayer.

252
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,120
Salam aleikum, buddy.

253
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,560
NABLUS, THE KASBAH

254
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,280
I'm ready.

255
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,960
I'm ready. The area is clear.

256
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,480
Peace be upon you.

257
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,720
-How are you? Everything alright?
-Praise God.

258
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,440
Come on, relax.

259
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,080
Everything will be fine, relax.

260
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,200
Drink your water.

261
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
He needs a good slap.

262
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,240
Two coffees, no sugar. Thanks.

263
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,040
If you hear anything,
duck under the chair, okay?

264
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,320
Let me go, you don't need me.

265
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,880
Thanks, buddy.

266
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,320
You bet I need you.

267
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,080
We're in a meeting.

268
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,360
Relax, everything will be fine.

269
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,360
Man, you people got me into such a mess.

270
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,840
Listen, pal, you're lucky
you're not in heaven right now.

271
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,480
I'm exposed here,
it's making me nervous.

272
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,800
Everything seems calm.

273
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,720
<i>-Do you see him?</i>
-Yes.

274
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,000
Steve, go see what's in that bag.

275
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,760
<i>He came back for it, it's okay.</i>

276
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,400
Wait a bit longer.

277
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,320
Wait a bit longer.

278
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,400
What is it?

279
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,840
What is it?

280
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,080
What is it?

281
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,600
<i>He's running away!</i>

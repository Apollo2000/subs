00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,200
Hey, did you fall asleep? -Where to?
-Bar-Ilan University.

2
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,120
Show me your ID.

3
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,280
"Name: Eyal Cohen. Nationality: Jewish."

4
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,800
-You study there?
-Maybe next year.

5
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,920
That's why I'm going.

6
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,800
I see.

7
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,040
Using your army discharge bonus?

8
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,960
Yeah, you bet.

9
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,960
Nice. I'm thinking
of enrolling there next year, too.

10
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,200
-Good luck, bro.
-Thanks.

11

[ARABIC]
[Well, where is he?]

12
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,320
[How can you even eat? I feel sick.]

13
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,360
Shalom.

14
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,120
[Good job.]

15
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,680
[You'd have to be crazy not to be scared.]

16

[God willing, next time it'll be easier.]

17

[What is it?]

18
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
[What's wrong?]

19
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,120
[They've arrested Samir.]

20
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,000
[What do you want us to do?]

21
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,080
[We'll wait for Ali
to pass the checkpoint,] [finish practicing and head back home.]

22
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,560
[Understood?]

23
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,960
Are you insane?

24
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,400
What was that for? We already got him.

25
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,760
-What's with him?
-You're not a pro, you're just a psycho.

26
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,560
Thanks, Naor,
your feedback means a lot to me.

27
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,280
-Who do you think you are?
-Get out of my face before I--

28
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Before you what?

29
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,280
-Move!
-Before you what?!

30
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,520
-Naor!
-Come at me!

31
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,840
-Knock it off, Naor!
-Calm down!

32
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,080
I've had it with him!

33
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,880
We have to kick him out!

34
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,880
I thought this shit was over!

35
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,720
This is bullshit!

36
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,280
[Who is it?]

37
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,240
[-Who is it?]
[-It's me, Ismail.]

39

[Come in, darling.] [I'll take that.]

40
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,120
[Sit down, Ismail, darling.]

41
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,800
[Sit down, sweetie.]

42
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640

<i>[Don't give them any reason</i>

[My dear mother, don't worry.]

47
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,840
[I won't worry only if you promise
you'll do nothing until he's released.]

48
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,560
[-Mom...]
<i>[-Don't "mom" me.]</i>

49

[Promise me. Even if it takes a year.]

50
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,640
[I'm sure he'll be back home
in a few days.]

51
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,520
<i>[Good. Then pause your activities</i>
<i>for a few days.]</i>

52
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,000
[It's not that simple.]

53
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,440
[Think of your brother.
You're responsible for his safe return.]

54
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,520
[-You promised me he'd stay out of this.]
[-It's not my fault.]

[Nidal and I don't talk.]

65

[And even if we did,
I'd never rat him out.]

[But you see, my dear,]

68
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,440
[I want you to give him a message,]

69
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,360
[to get the hell out of here
because Hamas is after him.]

70
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,320
[He's the Sheikh's son.]

71
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,000
[They wouldn't dare.]

72
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,200
[Are you sure?]

73
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,880
[Did you know that your brother
is threatening Walid?]

74

[-No, he's not.]
[-You bet your ass he is.]

75
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,680
[So he's better off returning to Syria
or wherever he likes,]

76

[as long as it's away from here.]

77
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,120

it won't do any good.]

[Al Makdasi will never leave.]

79
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
I don't care,
resolve this between yourselves.

80
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,800
I have to resolve this?!
Who's the Unit Commander, me or you?

81
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,920
Eli, don't make me do your dirty work.
Doron isn't professional.

82
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,560
He's as professional as they come.

83
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,000
He's a has-been!
He's violent and can't control himself.

84
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,640
-He tore Al Makdasi's brother apart!
-I told him to do that.

85
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,120
-I did.
-Why?

86
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,520
Because I need Al Makdasi
furious enough to slip up.

87
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,280
-Is that what you wanted?
-Yes.

88
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,920
I want Samir to be afraid
we're gonna kill him

89
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,560
-so he conveys that to his brother.
-So that's our tactic now, huh?

90
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,200
Is that what they taught you in England?

91
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,720
-He might've gone a bit too far.
-A bit?

92
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,080
Yes, a bit! You expect me
to report to you before every operation?!

93
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,840
I guess we don't agree on
how a commander should behave.

94
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,600
Stop busting my balls, Naor.

95
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,880
Fine.

96
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
Let me make this easy for you: I'm out.

97
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,760
-Cut the drama...
-No drama.

98
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,760
Everyone here is insane, including you.

99
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,880
I don't want this anymore, enough.

100
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,760
Have you calmed down?

101
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,720
Let's take a dip in the spring,
it'll do you good.

102
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,320
Come on in!

103
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,600
You'll feel refreshed for the Sabbath.

104
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,480
Forget it, Dad.

105
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,120
You're crazy, I swear.

106
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,720
Wow!

107
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,280
You don't know what you're missing.

108
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,800
Well?

109
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,200
What's eating you up?

110
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,600
Any leads on Al Makdasi?

111
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,880
-The unit is working on it.
-And?

112
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,520
Performing searches, arrests,
following protocol.

113
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,200
You know,

114
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,800
when you were in 9th grade,
I traveled to Greece.

115
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,120
You didn't speak to me afterwards

116
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,320
because instead of a week,
I stayed for three.

117
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,840
It was in 8th grade,
and I didn't speak to you

118
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,120
because you left Mom by herself
during a holiday.

119
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,000
I wasn't in Greece.

120
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,560
I was in a Jordanian prison.

121
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,360
What?

122
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,480
They locked me up over the dumbest thing.

123
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,000
I had the perfect cover story,
could've been released the next day,

124
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,080
but Israel didn't want to ruin
ongoing talks with Jordan,

125
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,200
so they left me there
for more than two weeks.

126
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,960
I'm not telling you this
to sound like a hero,

127
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,840
I just want you to know

128
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,360
that the government doesn't
really care about your well-being.

129
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,720
They're all sons of bitches.

130
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,800
You're on your own, Doron.

[-Which Abed?]

[Abed from the cyber unit.
Take me to him.]

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,320
[Did she talk?]

159
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,120
[Listen, Abu Seif Al Makdasi,]

160
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,920
[Nidal,]

161
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,200
[I don't know how they discipline you
back in Syria,]

162
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,760
[but here you'd better
weigh your words before you speak.]

163
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,600
[I think you're confused.]

164
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,240
[Here you can't just do as you please.
There's no room for anarchy.]

165
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,800
[I'm your commander,
and you will follow orders.]

166
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,480
[Understood?]

167
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,040
[Open the door.]

168
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,200
Just tell Eli you didn't mean it,
that you were upset and you're sorry.

169
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,120
-You don't have to leave.
-I want to leave.

170
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,280
So that's it? You're leaving and he stays?

171
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,520
I can't stay in a place
that operates this way.

172
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,280
You're such a jerk!

173
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,640
Give Eli a chance, he was rushed
in here from England. He'll be great.

174
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,120
Gimme a break, Eli is Doron's puppet.
It's gonna end badly.

175
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,440
You should leave, too.

176
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,960
You don't have to be
an intelligence officer again.

177
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,720
Why not be a fighter in a different unit?

178
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,440
Naor, I'm not leaving.

179
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,680
Naor!

180
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,280
Sleep on it for a few days.

181
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,760
I already have.

182
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,520
I'm through with this place.

183
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,200
Fuck everybody.

184
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,520
Take care of yourself.

185
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,840
[Doctor!]

186
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,760
[What is it?]

187
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,640
[-What happened to her?]
[-She fell on the pavement.]

188
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,080
[Bring her inside.]

189
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,200
[-Oh, God...]
[-Thank you.]

190
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,520
[Thank you.]

191
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,840
[Walid...]

192
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,440
[I couldn't sleep all night.
I had to see you.]

193
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,360
[-Are you alright?]
[-Yes. They didn't harm me.]

194
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,520
[They just asked if I know where you are.]

195
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,760
[And?]

196
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,200
[I told them the truth,
that I don't know.]

197
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,720
[You are my life.]

198
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,280
[They think you were behind
the attack at the bus station]

199
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,240
[and the bomb that killed
their undercover Unit Commander.]

200
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,200
[You shouldn't have come.
They're around here for sure.]

201
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
[I wanted to see you.]

202
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,320
[Tell me, what did you tell them?]

203
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,760
[I just told you.]

204
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,280
[Tell me exactly what happened,
word for word.]

205
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,600
[They asked if I know where you are,]

206
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,320
[I told them I didn't.
They know very well that I don't know,]

207
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,680
[-I didn't even have to tell them that.]
[-And that's it?]

208
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,680
[That's all you said
in a five-hour interrogation?]

209
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,200
[Yes, I believe that was pretty much it.]

210
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,600
[Did you recognize
any of the interrogators?]

211
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,320
[It was a woman.]

212
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,440
[Only a woman?]

213
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,360
[There were a few of them.]

214
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,920
[-Captain Ayub?]
[-Yes. He was there.]

215
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,520
[-Was Doron there?]
[-Who?]

216
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,920
[Doron.]

217
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,200
[A woman and Captain Ayub, no one else.]

218
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,160
[Where are you going, what's wrong?]

219
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,920
[I don't like your tone of voice.]

220
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,600
[Why is your guy following me?]

221
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,760
[-Who, Jihad? At the hospital?]
[-Yes.]

222
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,200
[-He's protecting you from trouble.]
[-What trouble?]

223
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,240
[Trouble.]

224
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,160
[Here at home, no one will harm you,]

225
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,640
[but at the hospital, one of my "friends"]

226
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,480
[could try to hurt you just to get to me.]

227
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,120
[Come on, Shirin,
I'm doing this because I love you.]

228
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,200
It's boiling hot in here, turn on the AC.

229
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,720
There's no air.

230
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,960
Any unusual activity last night?
Anyone going in or out?

231
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,240
One elderly woman went in, probably ill.

232
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,760
Let me see.

233
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,600
Freeze the frame.

234
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,920
It was 1:00 a.m.,
doesn't that seem unusual?

235
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,720
I don't know what they consider unusual.

236
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,040
Why didn't you guys alert anyone?!

237
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,960
Replay it.

238
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,360
Pause. Zoom in.

239
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,440
More.

240
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,680
Look at the shoe.

241
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,000
Play the exit footage.

242
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,600
Pause. Zoom in.

243
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,840
It's Walid. That son of a bitch.

244
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,080
Send it to me, and wake up. Wake up!

245
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
Well?

246
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,680
It's gonna take a while.
He's not cracking.

247
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
We don't have much time.

248
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,480
The state attorney just announced
we have 48 hours.

249
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Are you serious?
Damn it, I can't work like this.

250
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,080
Where's Samir's phone?

251
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,800
[Your phone.]

252
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,280
[Pardon me. Your cell phone.]

253
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,120
[-I don't have Nidal's number.]
[-Call your wife right now] [and tell her you'll be in jail
for at least 25 years]

254
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,560
[and that your unborn child
will grow up fatherless.]

255
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,680
[You know, even the most
loving and faithful women]

256
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,560
[won't wait 25 years.]

257
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,960
[Let alone a woman as pretty as Marwa]

258
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,600
[who'll have no problem
landing a new husband.]

259
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,000
[Even if only five, ten years later.]

260
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,280
[Nobody will accuse her of betraying you.]

261
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,480
[I'm speaking from experience.]

262
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,120
[I've had three wives, God bless them.]

263
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,080
[One of them would fool around
with my friend while I was at work,]

264
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,360
[but I don't blame her]

265
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,600
[and I wouldn't blame Marwa.]

266
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,160
[Fine.]

267
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,160
[Let's ask Marwa what she prefers--]

268
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,720
[that you give me some intel
about your shitty brother]

269
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,720
[who traveled the world and left you
to take care of your widowed mother]

270
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,120
[and who wasn't there
to protect your father,]

271
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,840
[or that you choose her
and return home as early as today.]

272
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,920
[What are you doing?]

273
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,640
[Hang up.]

274
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,480
[-Um Nidal! It's Samir.]
[-Samir?]

275
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,520
[Samir?]

276
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,920
<i>[Samir?]</i>

277
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,440
[No.]

278
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,440
[It's Captain Ayub
from the Secret Service.]

279
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,560
[What is he saying?]

280
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,480
[Samir would like to consult with you
about something.]

281
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,520
[Hello?]

282
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,560
[Samir!]

283
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,920
<i>[My love, are you alright?]</i>

284
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,280
[I'm fine, praise God. And you?]

285
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,640
[What are they doing to you?
When will they release you?]

286
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,200
[Everything is alright,]

287
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,440
<i>[don't cry.]</i>

288
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,360
<i>[Marwa,]</i>

289
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,640
<i>[don't cry, soon I'll be released.]</i>

290
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,160
[I mean it,
they're treating me very nicely.]

291
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,720
[For God's sake, don't worry.]

292
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,840
[Tell my mom...]

293
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,200
[He will stay here
until we catch his brother.]

294
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,720
<i>[Whether it'll be sooner or later]</i>

295
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,040
<i>[depends on you, not me.]</i>

296
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,600
[Growing up fatherless
won't be easy for your child.]

297
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,320
[What did he say?]

298
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,760
[He hung up.]

299
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,080
[What are you doing?]

300
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,400
[It must be from him!]

301
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,680
[Those animals...]

302
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,840
[They're trying to break your spirit.
Don't let them do it.]

303
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,760
[Delete the photo!]

304
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,120
[No matter what happens here,
I promise you]

305
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,680
[that I will never get off your case.]

306
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,120
[You will curse the day you were born
if you don't help me.]

307
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,040
[And remember, at the end of the day,]

308
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,000
[I'm the only one in this world
who can help you.]

309
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,680
[You're young, a budding flower.]

310
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,800
The horny bastard sneaks in
to bang his wife, and we miss it.

311
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,920
I don't think it's the first time
he snuck in there.

312
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,120
I think he's hiding something there.
What do you think?

313
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,440
I think we should go in, check it out.

314
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,720
I was thinking of installing a camera
inside the house.

315
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,200
A camera inside the house?

316
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,280
-I'm gonna go full "Big Brother" on her.
-I see.

317
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,320
But you won't be installing it.

318
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,200
Someone else will.

319
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,880
I watched the video of you
interrogating Shirin.

320
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,640
I heard you.

321
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,000
You had something going on with her.

322
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,360
You bet I did, I had to recruit her.

323
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,880
Did you sleep with her?

324
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,320
Good for you, bro. You're not
installing the camera. Steve will.

325
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,840
-Don't you trust me?
-I trust you blindly.

326
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,480
But I don't want to get you
into problematic situations.

327
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,560
-And installing a camera is problematic?
-Drop it, Doron.

328
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,440
Steve will do it and that's that.

329
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,480
Fine.

330
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,440
[Hello, Marwa.]

331
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,600
[Hello.]

332
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,400
[How are you?]

333
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,120
[I'm alright.]

334
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,760
[But for God's sake, help Samir.]

335
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,160
[He's not like you,
he can't take the heat.]

336
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,320
[-Why does everyone keep saying that?]
[-Because he's different from you, Nidal.]

337
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,720
[I hope there'll be more next time.]

338
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,400
[Thank you.]

339
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,000
[And...]

340
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,200
[I also got you
some orange-flavored chocolate.]

341
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,600
[You're the only person I know
who likes this stuff.]

342
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
[I remember you as a kid,
can you believe it?]

343
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,520
[You were so pretty, God bless you.]

344
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,040
[Samir and I would look at you...]

345
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,200
[while you'd eat that awful
orange-flavored chocolate of yours.]

346
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,320
[More importantly,
what's your plan to get him out of there?]

347
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,880
[Right now my hands are tied.]

348
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,040
[But they'll release him
because they've got nothing on him.]

349
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,000
[He's strong, praise God,
he can take it.]

350
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,640
[Really? Can he?
Does this look like he can take it?]

351
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,440
[Who is it?]

352
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,120
<i>[Walid sent me. Open up.]</i>

353
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,400
[I don't know anything about this.]

354
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,600
<i>[I'm telling you I work with Walid.</i>
<i>Open up!]</i>

355
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,560
[Walid would've told me to expect you.]

356
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,360
[I won't talk to you nor to anyone else.]

357
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,360
<i>[If you don't want to open up, don't.</i>
<i>But you'll suffer the consequences.]</i>

358
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,160
[Get in here.]

359
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,280
[Sit down.]

360
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,760
[I need someone's address,
phone number and everything about him.]

361
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,920
[Listen, I have no idea who you are
and it seems like you don't know]

362
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,120
[-who you're talking to.]
[-I don't? Get up.]

363
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,920
[Write down his address for me.] [Look up "Doron Kabilio."]

364
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,000
[There must be dozens of Doron Kabilios.]

365
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,120
[-It could take time.]
[-We've got all the time in the world.]

366
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,360
What's going on? What's going on?

367
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,000
You're kind of quiet.

368
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,440
It's nothing. No reason.

369
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,280
She's headed towards you.

370
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,200
The coast is clear.

371
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,280
Copy.

372
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,960
I'm going in.

373
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,200
<i>-What's the status?</i>
-He left.

374
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,840
-Who?
<i>-Doron.</i>

375
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,160
<i>Doron, what are you doing?</i>
<i>Get back in the car, now!</i>

376
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,560
Doron!

377
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,600
Steve, I asked you
to install the camera, didn't I?

378
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,800
-Okay, but we didn't think--
<i>-Next time,</i>

379
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,200
if I tell you to do something, do it!
That's how it works! Are we clear?!

380
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,120
<i>He'd better not do anything stupid.</i>

381
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,200
I'm inside.

382
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,600
Doron, we want to know
if he's hiding anything in there.

383
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,600
Doron, what's the status?

384
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,160
Two minutes.

385
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,240
There's nothing here.

386
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,360
Doron, just install the camera.
We don't have much time.

387
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,760
She's approaching from the east.

388
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,960
Doron, forget the camera and get out!

389
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,360
How close is she?

390
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,440
<i>100 meters.</i>

391
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,840
90 meters.

392
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,360
80 meters.

393
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,360
<i>70 meters.</i>

394
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,840
<i>60 meters.</i>

395
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,320
50 meters.

396
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,360
40 meters.

397
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,280
<i>30 meters.</i>

398
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,960
<i>20 meters.</i>

399
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,080
Doron, get out, now!

400
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,240
<i>Doron, she's coming in! Get out! Now!</i>

401
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,440
<i>Doron, where are you?</i>

402
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,560
<i>Doron?</i>

403
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,440
Doron, cough if there's a problem,
tap twice if you're okay.

404
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,720
We have an image.

405
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,280
<i>Join Steve.</i>

406
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,440
Doron?

407
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,800
Doron?

408
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,000
-We've lost Doron's frequency.
-Fuck!

409
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,040
<i>300, what's going on there?</i>

410
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
<i>Is he leaving?</i>

411
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,880
Negative. He's still there,

412
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,120
<i>risking exposure.</i>

413
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,160
No image transmission.

414
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,240
<i>Steve, get ready</i>
<i>to pull him out if necessary.</i>

415
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,640
If she screams,
the entire village will swarm in.

416
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,080
[Coming.]

417
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,160
[Coming.]

418
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,840
[-Can we talk inside?]
[-No.]

419
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,000
[It's best if nobody sees me here.]

420
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,360
[I won't harm you.]

421
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,960
[I'm sorry to barge in,
but I have to talk to you.]

422
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,520
[Have you any idea what they'll do to me
if they find me with a man in the house,]

423
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,720
[and a Jew, no less? What would Walid do?]

424
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,640
[Don't you understand?
The entire neighborhood is watching me.]

425
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,120
[Shirin, nobody saw me.]

426
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,040
[Just leave me alone, please!]

427
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,360
[-I want to help you.]
[-I don't want to listen to you.]

428
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,840
[I can help you, Shirin.]

429
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,960
[I don't believe you.]

430
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
[You mean a lot to me.]

431
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,440
[I can't stop thinking about you,]

432
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,560
[and if you want,
I can get you out of the country,]

433
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,240
[but you must give me something.]

434
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,040
[I can't.]

435
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,600
[Walid is working
with a new guy from Syria.]

436
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,360
[I won't sell him out.]

437
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,920
[Do you know what he's doing?]

438
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,960
[If I betray him,]

439
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,080
[Hamas will murder my entire family,
understand?]

440
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,040
[Walid rescued me
from the mess you left me in.]

441
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,360
[Look, Shirin, war is about to break out.]

442
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,840
[Many people are going to die.]

443
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,120
[If Walid is in prison,
he will be safe, he will live.]

444
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,080
[If I help you, you won't kill him?]

445
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,200
[I won't.]

446
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,960
Doron, what's going on?
You're gonna expose us all.

447
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,880
<i>300, what's keeping him? See anything?</i>

448
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,320
He's in the backyard.
Waiting for an exit route.

449
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,000
[Listen,]

450
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:47,000
[if you want any help, send me a message
to this username, okay?]

[Goodbye.]

454
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,840
He's leaving.

455
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,920
300, wrapping it up,
heading towards the meeting point.

456
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,040
He's in the car.

457
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,880
What took you so long?!

458
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,360
You spoke to her, huh?

459
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,720
What?!

460
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,800
-Don't you ever learn?
-Just drive, man.

461
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,560
[-The fringes are worn outside the pants.]
[-No.]

[-They're supposed to show.]
[-But it makes no sense.]

463
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,440

One
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,540
8-2, where are you?

Two

We are on their side.

Peace and blessings of Allah be upon you.

Nine
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,900
Great Is Allah.

Ten
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,660
"Direct the path of us,

Eleven
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,380
"the path of those,
who is gifted With your grace.

Twelve
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,780
"And not the path of those on whom Your anger is directed,

Thirteen

"and not the paths of the lost."

Fourteen

Amen.

Fifteen
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,300
Will you come to the party today?

Sixteen
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,740
This is a family celebration.
What should I do there?

Seventeen
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,460
Buddy, we need you.
I need you.

Eighteen
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,060
I'll think.

Nineteen
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,860
Greetings, Abu Fadi.
- Hello, God bless you.

Twenty
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,660
Bashar, I'll tell you as a father,

Twenty one
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,980
he hasn't seen you in years,
but he loves you.

Twenty two
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,780
You're his son, and he's worried, too.

Twenty three
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,540
Even more than yours.

Twenty four
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,540
Okay.

Twenty five
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,180
Tell him about Safa?

Twenty six
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,460
Let him come to his senses,

Twenty seven
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,300
before he finds out,
that his son fell in love with a Bedouin.

Twenty eight
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,780
You'll drive him to his grave.

Twenty nine
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,500
God forbid.

Thirty
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,620
Today I will tear you up. -Look.

Thirty one
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,900
You're finished. -Look.

Thirty two
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,180
Then begin.

Thirty three
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,300
"A Boxing club in Dahiri"

Thirty four
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,660
Jihad, this is all you asked for.

Thirty five
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,420
You have half an hour. "Thank You, Icik.

Thirty six
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,540
Can you give me a spoon?

Thirty seven
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,140
Thanks.

Thirty eight
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,980
And the second spoon
stir the sugar in the water.

Thirty nine
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,780
You're a craftsman.
-This is my father's secret recipe.

Forty
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,140
Great mystery.

Forty one
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,740
Well.

Forty two
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,300
Itzik, are you ready? Hotly.

Forty three
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,540
You have Golden hands.

Forty four
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,900
Thank you very much, icik.

Forty five
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,100
Welcome. -Waited.

Forty six
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,060
What a scent. -Waited.

Forty seven
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,900
Guys, clear the table.
Why are you sitting down?

Forty eight
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,220
Ahmed, make the coffee.

Forty nine
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,940
Here's the treat
on the occasion of liberation.

Fifty
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,980
Excellent.

Fifty one
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,700
Before I arrived
I heard About Jihad Hamdan,

Fifty two
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,580
the father of all prisoners.

Fifty three
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,140
He went on a hunger strike in 2009

Fifty four
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,980
and held on as a prisoner
did not restore visits.

Fifty five
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,940
Fatah, Hamas, whoever you are.

Fifty six
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,420
He always knows,
when to help with business or advice,

Fifty seven
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,660
and when to break your arm.

Fifty eight
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,100
I really appreciate our acquaintance,
Abu Bashar.

Fifty nine
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,940
And I'm sure in your new life

Sixty
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:34,740
you will continue your heroic struggle
for Palestine, for the confrontation

Sixty one
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,260
and for the prisoners.

Sixty two
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,460
By the will of Allah. "By the will of Allah."

Sixty three
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,460
Well.

Sixty four
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,820
Protect, protect.

Sixty five
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,380
Protect...

Sixty six
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,460
Protect.

Sixty seven
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,580
Close, close.

Sixty eight
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,300
Close.

Sixty nine
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,940
You have a fight in two weeks.
How will you win?

Seventy
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,820
Remember what I said
after the fight in Ramallah?

Seventy one
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Do not rush.

Seventy two
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,180
Let the enemy work,
he attacks you and thinks he's going to tear you up.

Seventy three
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,540
And as soon as he gets tired,

Seventy four
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,100
you'll knock him out.

Seventy five
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,460
He won't even have time to understand anything.

Seventy six
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,100
Got it?

Seventy seven
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,620
Come on, don't be stupid.

Seventy eight
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,980
Come, come...

Seventy nine
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,300
Well.

Eighty
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,380
On the liver, on the liver...

Eighty one
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,020
Like this.

Eighty two
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,820
Great, more...

Eighty three
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,420
Close...

Eighty four
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,100
Bravo, hero.

Eighty five
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,100
Keep it up
and listen to Abu Fadi.

Eighty six
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,860
Bashar, bring the mats.

Eighty seven
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,620
Uncle, I'm not finished.

Eighty eight
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,100
Come on, you can concentrate
unable. -Flee.

Eighty nine
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,420
Great job, Abu Fadi.
-Thank.

Ninety
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,620
Will we see you at the reception?

Ninety one
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,380
Abu Fawzi, I told Bashar,
this is a family holiday.

Ninety two
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,140
So what? You're like family to us.

Ninety three
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,420
Or you'll be watching all night
football and complain about life?

Ninety four
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,020
Come and meet my brother.
He's heard a lot about you.

Ninety five
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,220
By the will of Allah.

Ninety six
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,340
My son is looking for you.

Ninety seven
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,620
Where are you going?

Ninety eight
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,860
I'll be back soon.

Ninety nine
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,860
I know where you're going,
I want to go with you.

One hundred
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,860
Train, Bashar.

One hundred one
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,180
I'll cover for you.
Take me with you.

One hundred two
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,860
Come on, 150 sideways, like you promised.

One hundred three
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,660
Step.

One hundred four
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,420
Where's Fauzi?

One hundred five
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,940
I thought I was Dating him.

One hundred six
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,820
Give me your phone.

One hundred seven
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,300
Brought it?

One hundred eight
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,540
Who's this?

One hundred nine
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,580
No questions, Abu Fadi.
Where is what we asked for?

One hundred ten
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,700
In the trunk.

One hundred eleven
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,900
Without hands.

One hundred twelve
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,540
Open.

One hundred thirteen
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,100
Stop, money first.

One hundred fourteen
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,180
Tell Fauzi to get in touch
with me if necessary.

One hundred fifteen
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,980
Ziad.

One hundred sixteen
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,020
My phone.

One hundred seventeen
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,700
Only without tricks.

One hundred eighteen
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,100
Steve, can you see them?

One hundred nineteen
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,940
That's right.

One hundred twenty
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,500
Sagi, Avihai. "We're after them."

One hundred twenty one
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,820
That's good, no closer.

One hundred twenty two
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,460
Sit on the tail.

One hundred twenty three
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,260
This is our chance to get there
before that bastard Fawzi.

One hundred twenty four
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,060
As long as he's free,
we will not live.

One hundred twenty five
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,940
They stopped at the car wash.

One hundred twenty six
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,540
Look attentively.

One hundred twenty seven
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,580
Fauzi might get hooked on them.

One hundred twenty eight
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,900
You can't see anything from here.

One hundred twenty nine
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,180
All right, wait where you are.
Keep us updated on development.

One hundred thirty
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,020
Sagi, avihai, you too. -Accepted.

One hundred thirty one
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,380
I spent 20 years in this cell
I thought about her every day.

One hundred thirty two
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,980
I don't know what it's going to be like.

One hundred thirty three
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,980
It's been so many years.

One hundred thirty four
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,940
I'm sure,
that she will receive you with dignity.

One hundred thirty five
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,500
I feel like a boy.
My heart is pounding.

One hundred thirty six
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,220
It's time to go, or they'll leave without you.

One hundred thirty seven
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,700
What are you doing?

One hundred thirty eight
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,940
Take this.

One hundred thirty nine
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,380
Not so easy
get rid of the habit.

One hundred forty
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,140
I congratulate you.

One hundred forty one
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,900
I won't forget you.

One hundred forty two
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,860
Good Luck, Abu Samara.
-Peace be with you.

One hundred forty three
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
I, Jihad Hamdan, hereby undertake

One hundred forty four
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,020
refrain from crimes,
in which I was convicted,

One hundred forty five
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,500
and also
from any other crimes.

One hundred forty six
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,420
And don't join
to terrorist organizations

One hundred forty seven
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,780
and other prohibited associations.

One hundred forty eight
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,420
All the best, Jihad.

One hundred forty nine
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,060
The father of the prisoners. -All the blessings.

One hundred fifty
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,140
Open the seventh.

One hundred fifty one
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,340
May Allah protect you. -Thank You.

One hundred fifty two
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,380
What's going on there?

One hundred fifty three
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,020
Nothing. Probably being laundered.

One hundred fifty four
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,580
Ali, they've been inside a long time.

One hundred fifty five
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,220
Curse. Where is the son of a bitch?

One hundred fifty six
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,700
Show me the pictures.

One hundred fifty seven
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,220
They're leaving.

One hundred fifty eight
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,380
Fawzi is not with them.
Fawzi is not with them. How do you understand?

One hundred fifty nine
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,860
Fauzi is not.

One hundred sixty
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,020
There was no tarp before.

One hundred sixty one
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,260
They covered the body with a tarp.

One hundred sixty two
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,100
Try carefully
look under it.

One hundred sixty three
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,100
Ali, there's an intersection ahead.

One hundred sixty four
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,460
Now is the time.

One hundred sixty five
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,380
Everything is ready.
There's something wrong here.

One hundred sixty six
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,180
Zoom in on this point.

One hundred sixty seven
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,740
The car is booby-trapped.

One hundred sixty eight
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,500
What are you talking about? What's inside?

One hundred sixty nine
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,620
Two large gas cylinders
and lots of wires.

One hundred seventy
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,420
Serious device. -Your mother.

One hundred seventy one
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,100
They're at the intersection
in a car bomb.

One hundred seventy two
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,980
What about Fawzi? "He's not here."

One hundred seventy three
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,300
I'm moving on to the second phase.

One hundred seventy four
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,820
Ali, we don't have Fauzi.

One hundred seventy five
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,260
We don't know anything
nor for that purpose any of the following.

One hundred seventy six
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,460
Let them take them out
from the settlement and stop.

One hundred seventy seven
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,700
Gabi, there's a bomb,
that's going to blow.

One hundred seventy eight
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,940
Okay.

One hundred seventy nine
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,780
In open areas,
like an accident.

One hundred eighty
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,580
I'll use the second phase.
Confirm.

One hundred eighty one
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,060
Accepted, phase two. -Driven.

One hundred eighty two
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,900
Show them.

One hundred eighty three
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,260
This road is clearly visible. "I understand."

One hundred eighty four
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,460
What is this shit?

One hundred eighty five
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,540
Easy, Hamdi.

One hundred eighty six
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,540
Good morning.

One hundred eighty seven
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,540
On the road pit,
we're redirecting everyone to the bypass.

One hundred eighty eight
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,300
Don't worry, we're careful. Miss.

One hundred eighty nine
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,100
What did you say?"
"Let's go, there's no pit."

One hundred ninety
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,420
Are you deaf or don't you understand?

One hundred ninety one
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,900
Take a detour,
or I'll call the police.

One hundred ninety two
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,340
Okay, no questions asked.

One hundred ninety three
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,460
Let's.

One hundred ninety four
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,940
That's it, they turned off.

One hundred ninety five
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,420
Stop.

One hundred ninety six
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,300
Ibrahim, out of the car!

One hundred ninety seven
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,620
Wrap up and leave.

One hundred ninety eight
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,500
You have to find Fawzi. This is not the end.

One hundred ninety nine
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,980
You'll get it.

Two hundred
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,460
I need a report on Doron.

Two hundred one
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,860
If the tournament in Amman will be
representatives of the UAE Association,

Two hundred two
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,540
you'll get a chance.

Two hundred three
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,860
You think so? "Why not?"

Two hundred four
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,660
Will you train,
you'll get another medal...

Two hundred five
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,740
As a result, you will be transported
the whole family in Dubai.

Two hundred six
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,700
And Safa will come with me.

Two hundred seven
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,620
Slow down.

Two hundred eight
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,860
You will be together,

Two hundred nine
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,140
but you must be patient,
he's smart and makes his own decisions.

Two hundred ten
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,260
You know how long ago
I haven't seen my children?

Two hundred eleven
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,780
My ex convinced the judge,
that I was dangerous.

Two hundred twelve
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,940
What ? These are your children.

Two hundred thirteen
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,420
But she didn't tell me.
Neither she nor the judge.

Two hundred fourteen
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,420
I will never refuse
from their children.

Two hundred fifteen
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,740
Keep it up. -Take care.

Two hundred sixteen
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,100
Haifa, please.

Two hundred seventeen
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,340
Rest, Abu Fadi,
you've worked so hard.

Two hundred eighteen
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,620
Thank You, Abu Fadi.

Two hundred nineteen
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,500
Are you hungry? Want a snack?

Two hundred twenty
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,620
Are you saying I'm getting fat?
Are you serious?

Two hundred twenty one
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,380
No.

Two hundred twenty two
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,740
For a man your age...

Two hundred twenty three
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,020
Normally.

Two hundred twenty four
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,140
Um Bashar, have a seat.

Two hundred twenty five
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,740
No, I'm too worried.

Two hundred twenty six
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,780
Haifa, what time is it?
It's time for me to go?

Two hundred twenty seven
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,580
Mom, there's still time. Relax.

Two hundred twenty eight
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,380
Who's asking you?
-Sit down.

Two hundred twenty nine
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,420
I'll sit down.

Two hundred thirty
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,060
Thank You, Abu Fadi.

Two hundred thirty one
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,860
What a reception. "All from the heart."

Two hundred thirty two
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,940
Um Bashar, with your permission.
-Certainly.

Two hundred thirty three
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,980
Can you talk?
-Certainly. What's new?

Two hundred thirty four
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,100
Bad business.
We prevented a terrorist attack.

Two hundred thirty five
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,500
One was seriously injured, the other was killed.

Two hundred thirty six
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,140
Fawzi was not with them. -Clearly.

Two hundred thirty seven
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,380
He will go to the bottom, to it will be
it's extremely difficult to get close.

Two hundred thirty eight
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,900
Abu Fadi,

Two hundred thirty nine
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,060
Haifa asks,
will you have lunch with us?

Two hundred forty
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,900
Or he suspects something,

Two hundred forty one
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,820
and you're with his family now.

Two hundred forty two
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,380
If I had my way,
I would have pulled you out.

Two hundred forty three
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,620
What are you talking about?

Two hundred forty four
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,140
Anyway, Gaby wants to meet.
We will discuss everything and decide.

Two hundred forty five
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,180
Okay, I'll be there later.

Two hundred forty six
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,780
Welcome, old man, we're waiting.

Two hundred forty seven
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,420
Everyone misses you.

Two hundred forty eight
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,980
Happily.

Two hundred forty nine
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,420
I apologize.

Two hundred fifty
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,940
Please, Abu Fadi. -Thank.

Two hundred fifty one
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,140
Treat. "No, I'm on a diet.

Two hundred fifty two
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,140
Hands.

Two hundred fifty three
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,540
Enjoy your meal.

Two hundred fifty four
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Abu Maher! -Welcome. -Expensive.

Two hundred fifty five
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,020
Good to see you.

Two hundred fifty six
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,860
It's an honor to see you here.
-My compliments.

Two hundred fifty seven
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,380
Abu Rami, good to see you. -Hi.

Two hundred fifty eight
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,140
How is your son?
- Praise be to Allah, counting the days.

Two hundred fifty nine
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,180
Fawzi Hamdan disappeared again.

Two hundred sixty
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,140
This scoundrel has nine lives.

Two hundred sixty one
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,980
He is lucky,
but she would turn away, too.

Two hundred sixty two
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,260
I hope it happens today.
"By the will of Allah."

Two hundred sixty three
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,820
So, where's Fauzi?

Two hundred sixty four
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,220
What is he planning? Who helps him?

Two hundred sixty five
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,860
And his uncle, Jihad Hamdan,
the father of the prisoners is released.

Two hundred sixty six
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,340
Will he join them?

Two hundred sixty seven
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,980
He's got blood all over his hands.

Two hundred sixty eight
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,100
He killed five informants,
organized terrorist attacks.

Two hundred sixty nine
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,060
Friends, talk to me.

Two hundred seventy
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,060
As far as we know,
Jihad Hamdan retired

Two hundred seventy one
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,140
and no longer a danger.

Two hundred seventy two
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,780
We don't know where Fawzi is now,

Two hundred seventy three
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,780
but we know how powerful
Hamas gained influence.

Two hundred seventy four
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,700
I'm tired of the news,
which I already know about.

Two hundred seventy five
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,820
Listen to me.

Two hundred seventy six
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,100
Today you and I will go to the General

Two hundred seventy seven
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,780
to extend the contract
coordination of security issues.

Two hundred seventy eight
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,420
But if there are terrorist attacks,

Two hundred seventy nine
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,860
like that one,
what we prevented today,

Two hundred eighty
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,180
there will be no agreement.

Two hundred eighty one
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,420
Abu Rami. -Yeah.

Two hundred eighty two
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,340
Go back to Hebron,
turn over the city, but find Fawzi.

Two hundred eighty three
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,340
I'll do it.

Two hundred eighty four
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,580
Bring captain Ayub
his favorite coffee

Two hundred eighty five
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,900
and sweets.

Two hundred eighty six
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,020
But without the sweets.

Two hundred eighty seven
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,380
Look at my belly. I'm on a diet.

Two hundred eighty eight
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,980
Very glad, captain Ayoub.

Two hundred eighty nine
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,100
Congratulations on your promotion. -Thank You.

Two hundred ninety
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,620
Head of the district.
I remember you as a rookie.

Two hundred ninety one
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,220
I remember you as a prisoner
before the Oslo agreement.

Two hundred ninety two
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,540
You had that mane.

Two hundred ninety three
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,420
That was 30 years ago.

Two hundred ninety four
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,500
And 30 kg ago.

Two hundred ninety five
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,980
Son of a bitch...

Two hundred ninety six
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,940
And you're asking for sweets?

Two hundred ninety seven
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,100
Hebron

Two hundred ninety eight
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,460
Yes. -Connect.

Two hundred ninety nine
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,220
Secure communication is established.

Three hundred
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,740
Fauzi, my friend,

Three hundred one
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,780
how was your day

Three hundred two
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,180
Hamdi and Ibrahim were killed,
may Allah protect them.

Three hundred three
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,620
May Allah protect them.

Three hundred four
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,900
Listen,

Three hundred five
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,140
The shahids know what they are doing,
they are not children.

Three hundred six
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,700
Rumors spread throughout Gaza.

Three hundred seven
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,140
Abu Mohammed,
I promise I'll check it out.

Three hundred eight
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,460
We have ahead of us
a long and difficult mission.

Three hundred nine
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,900
If near you
there's an informant,

Three hundred ten
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,660
all of our work
they won't cost anything.

Three hundred eleven
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,980
Follow the plan

Three hundred twelve
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,620
and check your people carefully.

Three hundred thirteen
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,660
It's possible,
that the traitor is very close.

Three hundred fourteen
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,780
Believe Me, Abu Mohammed,
I'll check it out.

Three hundred fifteen
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,060
I believe you, but you don't have enough people.
Suspend the operation?

Three hundred sixteen
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,060
No, Abu Mohammed.
Thank God, we have people.

Three hundred seventeen
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,780
Well. Their officer
meet today at 22: 30.

Three hundred eighteen
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,420
May Allah help us.
"It's His will."

Three hundred nineteen
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,100
Take care.

Three hundred twenty
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,620
He says there is a traitor among us,
in the circle of confidants.

Three hundred twenty one
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,380
You know Abu Mohammed,
he suspects everyone.

Three hundred twenty two
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,420
What about the coach?
Do you trust him?

Three hundred twenty three
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,020
Abu Fadi?

Three hundred twenty four
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,900
I've been following him for a week,
no problem.

Three hundred twenty five
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,540
Your father called
to a Boxing club in Jerusalem.

Three hundred twenty six
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,220
I spoke to his ex.

Three hundred twenty seven
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,780
Then who can it be?

Three hundred twenty eight
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,580
Don't forget,
that today is a happy day.

Three hundred twenty nine
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,020
You'll like it.

Three hundred thirty
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,420
And here he is.

Three hundred thirty one
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,020
Hi! With the return.

Three hundred thirty two
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,940
My dear.

Three hundred thirty three
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,580
Come on, open the gate.

Three hundred thirty four
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,980
Greetings, my dear brother.
You're just glowing.

Three hundred thirty five
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,340
My dear brother is back.

Three hundred thirty six
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,780
With the return.

Three hundred thirty seven
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,980
Say Hello to everyone.

Three hundred thirty eight
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,060
Daughter, don't jinx it.

Three hundred thirty nine
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,180
Dear, you have lighted the way for us
his return.

Three hundred forty
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,100
Hello, dear brother.

Three hundred forty one
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,740
I missed you so much. - Bashar.

Three hundred forty two
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,460
Don't jinx it.

Three hundred forty three
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,380
Come on, it's time to go.

Three hundred forty four
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,740
With the return.

Three hundred forty five
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,860
Let's get out of here.

Three hundred forty six
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,100
Are you talking now?

Three hundred forty seven
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,500
Gali, I didn't know either.
What could I do?

Three hundred forty eight
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,740
When? - I don't know, in a couple of hours.

Three hundred forty nine
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,660
I can bring the children,
but what should I say in the center?

Three hundred fifty
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,580
I'll talk to them myself.

Three hundred fifty one
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,540
What's their number?
"You don't have their number?"

Three hundred fifty two
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,580
I don't have a number. -Well.

Three hundred fifty three
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,980
03... -Wait.

Three hundred fifty four
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,900
Jihad, you will see,
how the Boxing club flourished.

Three hundred fifty five
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,220
Bashar, we'll take him to the club tomorrow.

Three hundred fifty six
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,260
Look,
what your son is capable of.

Three hundred fifty seven
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,340
You told me
about the fight in Amman? -No.

Three hundred fifty eight
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,860
In Amman?

Three hundred fifty nine
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,500
Look over there.

Three hundred sixty
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,460
Uncle, not now. "No, let him know,
what's going on here.

Three hundred sixty one
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,060
The Jews took the land family Tarauni

Three hundred sixty two
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,100
to build your own settlement.

Three hundred sixty three
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:53,140
But Bashar is right.
Today we celebrate.

Three hundred sixty four
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,500
Welcome back, brother.
You will be treated like this.

Three hundred sixty five
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,180
Hi. -Hi.

Three hundred sixty six
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,500
One hour.

Three hundred sixty seven
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,620
I must say that we are all
recording and shooting.

Three hundred sixty eight
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
Of course, it's all right.

Three hundred sixty nine
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,020
And in case of any violation

Three hundred seventy
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,540
I'll have to break the date.
"I understand.

Three hundred seventy one
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,420
Can I come in?
-Ask. -Thank You.

Three hundred seventy two
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,660
Dad. -Hi.

Three hundred seventy three
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,420
Hi, honey.

Three hundred seventy four
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,820
I've missed you so much.

Three hundred seventy five
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,180
I heard footsteps outside the window,
but it wasn't you.

Three hundred seventy six
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,620
Where's IDO? "He has a circle."

Three hundred seventy seven
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,620
Okay, more time for us.

Three hundred seventy eight
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,540
Dad, since when do you dress like this?

Three hundred seventy nine
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,420
This is all for a social worker.

Three hundred eighty
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,580
She scares me.

Three hundred eighty one
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,180
I wanted her to like me,
but she's really mean.

Three hundred eighty two
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,220
What do you want to play?

Three hundred eighty three
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,620
I don't want to play.
They have terrible games.

Three hundred eighty four
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:19,100
Nightmarish? Then what should we do?

Three hundred eighty five
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,300
What's this?
"Gifts for IDO and you." "Hooray!

Three hundred eighty six
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,260
Is this a new phone? Mom said,
not until next year...

Three hundred eighty seven
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,020
Nothing, I like it. Thanks, dad.

Three hundred eighty eight
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,780
Really? Do you like? -Yeah. -Nicely.

Three hundred eighty nine
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,780
Here, let me help.

Three hundred ninety
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,580
Now.

Three hundred ninety one
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,380
Dad is always confused
in these little things.

Three hundred ninety two
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,140
I don't have fingers, I have sausages,

Three hundred ninety three
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,580
that's why it doesn't work.

Three hundred ninety four
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,900
Done.

Three hundred ninety five
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,020
I missed you.
"I missed you, too, beautiful.

Three hundred ninety six
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,980
You're my baby.
"Dad, I'm not a baby.

Three hundred ninety seven
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,460
You'll always be a baby to me.

Three hundred ninety eight
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,100
This is very important. -Yeah.

Three hundred ninety nine
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,580
Nothing changes after school.
-True.

Four hundred
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,260
This is what you should appreciate.

Four hundred one
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,700
Everything is right. -Yeah.

Four hundred two
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,180
Hi. "How are you?"
-Normally. Where Is IDO?

Four hundred three
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,100
The appointment was made suddenly,
and he couldn't get free.

Four hundred four
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,340
Did you tell him I was coming?

Four hundred five
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,220
Friends, let's go
and make a new appointment.

Four hundred six
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,540
One minute.

Four hundred seven
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,300
You told him,
that I'm coming or not?

Four hundred eight
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,780
She did, but he had plans,
which he didn't want to cancel.

Four hundred nine
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,860
It just didn't work out. -Clearly.

Four hundred ten
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,380
I want to call him.
You can listen in on our conversation.

Four hundred eleven
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,780
I urge you

Four hundred twelve
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,940
disperse and set up a new meeting.

Four hundred thirteen
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,180
He was gone three times in a row.

Four hundred fourteen
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,620
Something happens every time.

Four hundred fifteen
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,380
He's my son, I want to see him.
What's wrong?

Four hundred sixteen
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,580
He didn't want to come.

Four hundred seventeen
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,820
He didn't want to, or did you?

Four hundred eighteen
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,900
Let's not do it now...
"I repeat, he is my son.

Four hundred nineteen
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,780
Don't touch me.

Four hundred twenty
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,780
It's alright.

Four hundred twenty one
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,940
How are you, old man? Want some coffee?

Four hundred twenty two
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,180
Coffee won't help me.
"You're getting soft."

Four hundred twenty three
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,660
A little sleep-deprived.
Everything will be fine.

Four hundred twenty four
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,340
Was rocky from Daheria. -Hi.

Four hundred twenty five
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,300
Rocky from Daheria. Let's.

Four hundred twenty six
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,060
How are you? I missed you.

Four hundred twenty seven
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,300
Hello, man. "How are you, brother?"

Four hundred twenty eight
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,860
Look at you.

Four hundred twenty nine
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,980
Six months of training?

Four hundred thirty
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,900
Hello my darling,
daddy's handsome...

Four hundred thirty one
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,700
You smell fresh.
"Fresh?" Prick.

Four hundred thirty two
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,700
I haven't slept in two months.

Four hundred thirty three
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,740
You didn't warn me about this,

Four hundred thirty four
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,580
that's why you'll be a nurse.

Four hundred thirty five
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,300
You won't like it.
"You'll like it."

Four hundred thirty six
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,620
Food ordered?
-Perfectly. "It can't be.

Four hundred thirty seven
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,020
Old man, this will pass.

Four hundred thirty eight
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,100
When will it pass? When?
"You're exaggerating.

Four hundred thirty nine
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,340
How are you? -Hi.
-Excuse. Doron.

Four hundred forty
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,220
You don't know each other?" -No.
"Yoav, this is Doron. Doron, Yoav.

Four hundred forty one
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,820
Be careful with it.
"I'm always careful.

Four hundred forty two
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,500
What's up? -Nicely.

Four hundred forty three
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,980
What do you say?" "About the guy?" Wuss.

Four hundred forty four
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,780
That's the problem.
I can still believe you,

Four hundred forty five
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,380
but not this freak.
He didn't say a word.

Four hundred forty six
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,340
It's my fault.

Four hundred forty seven
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,340
I thought in this team
there is an honest man.

Four hundred forty eight
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,460
I spoke, but you didn't listen.

Four hundred forty nine
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,740
Nurit. "Fat people want more?"

Four hundred fifty
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,820
Don't even try, my dear.

Four hundred fifty one
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,740
You will be told,
that time is getting shorter,

Four hundred fifty two
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,380
but don't listen to anyone.

Four hundred fifty three
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,460
Don't worry, I'm not planning on it.
-Certainly. "That's great.

Four hundred fifty four
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,340
Just make sure,
that he doesn't plan to either.

Four hundred fifty five
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:53,540
And you're serious about this.

Four hundred fifty six
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,540
Is she getting married? -Yeah. -Not believe.

Four hundred fifty seven
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,020
Are you crazy?
"You haven't been briefed at all."

Four hundred fifty eight
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,540
Here it is-fauda.

Four hundred fifty nine
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,540
Don't be silly, all children cry.

Four hundred sixty
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,540
What ?

Four hundred sixty one
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,380
Hello, baby.

Four hundred sixty two
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,620
What time is it?

Four hundred sixty three
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,260
Go to us.

Four hundred sixty four
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,220
Want to say Hello?
No, you don't.

Four hundred sixty five
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,900
I don't want one. That's it, you won.

Four hundred sixty six
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,100
Let the doctor through...
I'll sort it out now.

Four hundred sixty seven
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,180
Michael, let's go,
we have a serious conversation.

Four hundred sixty eight
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:36,700
Can I? -Necessary.
Take it and don't return it. "That's it.

Four hundred sixty nine
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,580
What ?

Four hundred seventy
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,820
Do I look bad?

Four hundred seventy one
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,340
You look wonderful, don't you?

Four hundred seventy two
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,620
Disregard.
I'm not here.

Four hundred seventy three
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,380
Is everything okay? Do they help you?

Four hundred seventy four
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,780
Yes, they do.

Four hundred seventy five
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,060
My mom helps,
that's not the problem.

Four hundred seventy six
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,180
Everything will be fine.
They grow up, don't they?

Four hundred seventy seven
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,580
They grow up, old man. Don't worry.

Four hundred seventy eight
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,940
Good morning.

Four hundred seventy nine
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,380
Are you a nurse?

Four hundred eighty
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,860
Not really.

Four hundred eighty one
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,940
What's your name?

Four hundred eighty two
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,420
Hamdi.

Four hundred eighty three
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,140
And then what?

Four hundred eighty four
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,420
Do you have a last name?

Four hundred eighty five
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,220
Hamdi, dear, to be honest,

Four hundred eighty six
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,180
you're already dead.

Four hundred eighty seven
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,580
On the radio they say
the death of two terrorists.

Four hundred eighty eight
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,860
They fell as shahids.

Four hundred eighty nine
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,700
You have two options.

Four hundred ninety
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,700
Will you talk to me calmly

Four hundred ninety one
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:12,460
and you'll get a chance to get in
to an Israeli prison,

Four hundred ninety two
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:18,380
where can you study
and call dad and mom.

Four hundred ninety three
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,660
Otherwise,

Four hundred ninety four
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,140
"prison of the dead" is waiting for you",

Four hundred ninety five
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,900
for those about whose existence
no one knows.

Four hundred ninety six
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,820
What do you say?"

Four hundred ninety seven
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,220
Drop dead.

Four hundred ninety eight
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,100
Give me your last name.

Four hundred ninety nine
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,940
Suleiman, bitch.

Five hundred
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,260
Hamdi Suleiman. From where?

Five hundred one
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,420
From Khan Younis.

Five hundred two
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,940
Please stop.

Five hundred three
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,740
Where exactly?

Five hundred four
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,060
From a refugee camp.

Five hundred five
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,980
From the Gaza camp?

Five hundred six
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,860
You nukhba?

Five hundred seven
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,260
How did you get here?

Five hundred eight
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,540
Through the tunnels? By sea? How many of you?

Five hundred nine
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,860
You know you're going to talk.

Five hundred ten
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,460
Why suffer?

Five hundred eleven
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,820
Is he unconscious? "I'm out of morphine."

Five hundred twelve
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,140
Gabi, we have a problem.

Five hundred thirteen
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,420
Skip them? -Miss.

Five hundred fourteen
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,740
Not bad.

Five hundred fifteen
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,740
Do you have your own Secretary?
- Got with the office.

Five hundred sixteen
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,380
How's life? - Great office.

Five hundred seventeen
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,060
And we are without a gift. -Without a gift.

Five hundred eighteen
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,940
Dana talked to the fighter Fawzi,

Five hundred nineteen
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,500
who survived the explosion.

Five hundred twenty
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,420
Hoping for 72 virgins,
I got Dana. -Ridiculously.

Five hundred twenty one
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,740
But I can be funnier.

Five hundred twenty two
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,140
This guy -

Five hundred twenty three
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,140
nukhba,

Five hundred twenty four
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,540
Hamas fighting elite from Gaza,

Five hundred twenty five
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,900
soldier Hani al-Jabari,
Abu Mohammed.

Five hundred twenty six
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,620
You understand?
"Honey's Fighter?" Not happening.

Five hundred twenty seven
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,860
Listen carefully.

Five hundred twenty eight
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,580
Fawzi Hamdan activates
a special unit of Hamas.

Five hundred twenty nine
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,740
From that moment -
full alert.

Five hundred thirty
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,020
I'll take care of it. "Will you do it?"

Five hundred thirty one
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,180
You've been there for six months,

Five hundred thirty two
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,500
and as a result, one explosion that
the drone could have made it from the air.

Five hundred thirty three
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,300
Gaby, calm down. What's the matter?

Five hundred thirty four
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,380
I'm sorry, I know you're working,

Five hundred thirty five
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,540
Today we are signing
the agreement on coordination.

Five hundred thirty six
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,060
You need to speed up the process.

Five hundred thirty seven
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,620
You will return to the settlement

Five hundred thirty eight
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,940
and, if necessary,

Five hundred thirty nine
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,420
will burn your cover,

Five hundred forty
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,100
but you'll get Fauzi,

Five hundred forty one
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,340
until it blew up
the entire West Bank.

Five hundred forty two
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,500
Is everything clear? -Clearly.

Five hundred forty three
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,660
You smell so good.

Five hundred forty four
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,220
When will you find a bride,
and we'll get rid of you?

Five hundred forty five
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,540
I can still get married at 40,
unlike you, spinster.

Five hundred forty six
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,140
Quiet.

Five hundred forty seven
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,500
Welcome. -Hello.

Five hundred forty eight
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,860
Welcome.

Five hundred forty nine
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,260
Thanks. -Thank You. -I wish you happiness.

Five hundred fifty
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,820
I forgot what you're looking for
clever girl.

Five hundred fifty one
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,420
Have you seen your father?"

Five hundred fifty two
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,060
Maybe he's in the shower.

Five hundred fifty three
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,340
He didn't leave the bedroom.

Five hundred fifty four
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,700
Mom, don't be nervous.

Five hundred fifty five
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,980
It doesn't work.

Five hundred fifty six
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,900
Hello. How are you?

Five hundred fifty seven
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,220
Well?

Five hundred fifty eight
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,340
Noor, I'm sorry.

Five hundred fifty nine
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,180
What are you sorry for?

Five hundred sixty
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,060
For ruining your life.

Five hundred sixty one
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,740
You didn't destroy anything.

Five hundred sixty two
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,940
Look, it starts all over again.

Five hundred sixty three
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,620
It's been so many years.

Five hundred sixty four
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,900
But you're still beautiful.

Five hundred sixty five
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,580
Men get better with time,

Five hundred sixty six
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,420
unlike the rest of us.

Five hundred sixty seven
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:38,860
You're still beautiful,
like the day we met.

Five hundred sixty eight
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,980
Good answer.

Five hundred sixty nine
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,460
Now let's go to the guests,

Five hundred seventy
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,340
until they went home.

Five hundred seventy one
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,020
Dad, do you remember him?
We were at school together. -Your friend.

Five hundred seventy two
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,820
Come on, someone wants to
say Hello to you.

Five hundred seventy three
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,100
Abu Bashar.

Five hundred seventy four
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,900
With the return. -Thank You.
"Is it nice to be home?"

Five hundred seventy five
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,860
Thank you, Abu Jamal, but don't.

Five hundred seventy six
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,460
This is a gift from the Movement.
You're one of us.

Five hundred seventy seven
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,060
Rest at home for a couple of weeks,
and we'll get you a job.

Five hundred seventy eight
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,540
Thank you very much.

Five hundred seventy nine
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,540
Thank You, Abu Jamal.
He will come, and I will see to it.

Five hundred eighty
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,900
Well.

Five hundred eighty one
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,260
All the best to you.
With the return. -Thank You.

Five hundred eighty two
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,500
Thank you for visiting. This is a great honor.

Five hundred eighty three
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,620
Be more friendly.
They'll set you up for life.

Five hundred eighty four
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,540
You're right, brother. Sure.

Five hundred eighty five
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,420
Bashar.

Five hundred eighty six
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,980
Let's go get acquainted
with the hero of the occasion.

Five hundred eighty seven
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,380
Dad.

Five hundred eighty eight
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,980
Dad, this is Abu Fadi, my coach.

Five hundred eighty nine
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,220
Greetings, Abu Fadi.

Five hundred ninety
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,780
It ranked fifth in Israel
in the Middleweight division.

Five hundred ninety one
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,340
Very pleasant.
-Mutually. You have an amazing son.

Five hundred ninety two
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,100
I couldn't grow it,
but I see he's in good hands.

Five hundred ninety three
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,100
Thanks for everything,
what you did for him.

Five hundred ninety four
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,940
Nasar says,
he's doing great.

Five hundred ninety five
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,660
Yes, you have a talented guy.

Five hundred ninety six
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,860
Thank you very much.
Very glad to meet you.

Five hundred ninety seven
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,020
Are you hungry? -Very.

Five hundred ninety eight
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,380
I have news from the investigator.

Five hundred ninety nine
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,220
There are many more of them.

Six hundred
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,860
With them came another cell,
maybe more.

Six hundred one
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,300
How did they get in here?

Six hundred two
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,060
Hani al-Jabari, that bastard,

Six hundred three
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,860
I don't care about anything. He will do anything,
to get to the manual.

Six hundred four
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,580
That's what scares me.

Six hundred five
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:44,540
Okay, are you on your way?
"Yes, I'll be there in half an hour."

Six hundred six
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,220
Okay, see you later. -While.

Six hundred seven
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,460
Central command headquarters,
to the North of Ramallah

Six hundred eight
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,180
Okay, I get it. Bye.

Six hundred nine
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,180
Ziad.

Six hundred ten
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,500
I heard that two people were killed.

Six hundred eleven
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,660
Who built the bomb, you or Fawzi?

Six hundred twelve
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,620
Leave It, Abu Fawzi,
it's none of your business.

Six hundred thirteen
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,700
Look, you're making a mistake,

Six hundred fourteen
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,660
which I might suffer from.

Six hundred fifteen
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,460
Come on, I want to talk to Fawzi.

Six hundred sixteen
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,260
I repeat, this is none of your business.

Six hundred seventeen
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,940
You're like children.

Six hundred eighteen
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,940
You will fail your entire operation.

Six hundred nineteen
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,260
Let me help you.

Six hundred twenty
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,700
Do you need a major goal?
There are enough of them.

Six hundred twenty one
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,940
Abu Fadi, where did this information come from?

Six hundred twenty two
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,700
A major goal?

Six hundred twenty three
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,900
I know more than you think.

Six hundred twenty four
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,940
Take me to Fawzi,
I'll talk to him.

Six hundred twenty five
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,540
Just today Fauzi said,
that there is a traitor among us.

Six hundred twenty six
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,820
He remembered you, too.

Six hundred twenty seven
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,340
You think I'm a traitor?

Six hundred twenty eight
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,740
Who are you, Abu Fadi? Who are you?

Six hundred twenty nine
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,940
Boxing coach
and the supplier of explosives?

Six hundred thirty
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,460
And in the house of Jihad, you are for your own.

Six hundred thirty one
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,540
Today is a double holiday.

Six hundred thirty two
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,860
Return Of Abu Bashar

Six hundred thirty three
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,820
and deliverance
our ranks from a traitor.

Six hundred thirty four
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,100
Did you think?..

Six hundred thirty five
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,380
Just in time.

Six hundred thirty six
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,180
Yes.

Six hundred thirty seven
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,220
Ayoub is injured. Ayoub is injured. -Gaby.

Six hundred thirty eight
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,780
Reinforcements are needed.

Six hundred thirty nine
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,300
Gaby.

Six hundred forty
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,460
Gaby!

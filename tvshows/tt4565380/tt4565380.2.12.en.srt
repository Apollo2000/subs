00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,280

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,880
Moti, the downstairs neighbor.

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,960
Hey, guys.

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,280
Is that your truck outside?

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, why? Is there a problem?

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,560
Yeah, it's blocking the parking area.
It's hard to get in.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,960
Could you please move it a little bit?

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
Sure, no problem.

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,880
-Do it now, okay?
-Sure.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,680
Thank you, bye.

15
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,160
I can assure you, nobody left
once the checkpoints were closed.

16
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,160
He must be activating them
from a distance.

17
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,640
Perhaps the police will capture him.

18
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,000
Roger, copy.

19
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,800
They found the explosives
in the huge truck downstairs.

20
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,640
-How much?
-Can't say.

21
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,120
We found documents.

22
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,360
They were in his wallet.

23
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,040
There's more than one truck.

24
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,440
<i>-Eli, what's going on?</i>
-His plan is unfolding.

25
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,880
<i>They took down two terrorists</i>
<i>and found a truck full of explosives.</i>

26
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,480
-Is he there?
<i>-No.</i>

27
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,760
<i>But Ayub says there's another truck.</i>
<i>It ain't over yet.</i>

28
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,960
-Okay, keep me posted.
<i>-Sure thing.</i>

29
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,680
We're all on it, Doron.

30
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,360
-Trust me.
-Great. Thanks.

31
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,240
Is everything okay?

32
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,040
There was an incident in Ramat Gan,
two terrorists are dead,

33
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,240
neither of them is Al Makdasi.

34
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,720
You all need to stay home
until we get a handle on this.

35
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,760
We have to take Ido to the tournament.

36
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,240
He's been practicing for months.
You want him to miss out on it?

37
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,280
I'll take him, okay?

38
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,240
We can't all go together,
he'll understand.

39
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,440
<i>The police force has killed two terrorists</i>

40
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,400
<i>who plotted an attack in Ramat Gan...</i>

41
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,520
Don't be nervous.

42
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,680
I saw how hard you practiced,
you'll beat them.

43
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,240
Besides, participating
is what counts, right?

44
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,280
But you better kick some butt.

45
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,880
<i>Roger, copy.</i>

46
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,440
Eitan, forward any info straight to me,
skip the paperwork, okay?

47
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,440
-Sure thing.
-Cool.

48
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,040
Ayub!

49
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,960
The SWAT team found this
on the terrorists they took down.

50
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,440
Thanks.

51
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,040
"Sports Center" -Yes?
<i>-Gali, sweetie, what's up?</i>

52
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,560
I can't get ahold of Doron,
have you heard from him?

53
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,400
<i>-He took Ido to his judo tournament.</i>
-Oh.

54
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,320
So they could already be there.

55
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,480
Is something wrong? Does it have to do

56
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,760
-with the incident in Ramat Gan?
-No... just have him call me back.

57
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,880
-Ayub, what's going on?
<i>-Probably nothing,</i>

58
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,360
-don't worry, dear.
<i>-That's not very reassuring...</i>

59
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm on it. Do me a favor,
send me Ido's number.

60
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,800
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Bye, sweetheart.

61
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
<i>You've reached the voice mailbox of...</i>

62
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,400
Send the SWAT team to locate a car
at the Ben-Zvi Sports Center

63
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,000
and track two cell phones, stat!

64
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,200
-What are you doing here, moron?!
-I was climbing the walls, bro.

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,880
Idiot.

66
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,560
What are you doing here?

67
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,000
What's going on?

68
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,080
Nothing new, we're still on call.

69
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,240
Fuck...

70
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,440
-That bastard has nine lives.
-Yeah.

71
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,400
-Hey, Gali, what's up?
-I'm glad I got ahold of you.

72
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,400
-Why, what's up?
<i>-Doron drove Ido to the tournament</i>

73
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,560
and I got a call from Ayub,
who freaked me out.

74
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,120
Said he's not answering his phone.
<i>I tried calling them both,</i>

75
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,120
<i>they're not answering.</i>
<i>I have a really bad feeling about this.</i>

76
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,080
She can't get ahold of Doron,
he's disappeared.

77
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,720
-Send me the address, we're on our way.
<i>-Thanks, Steve.</i>

78
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,000
Rest assured, Gali, we're on it, okay?

79
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,520
-You got the car keys?
-Yeah, I'll drive.

80
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,880
Yes, Avihai.

81
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,280
Yes.

82
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,920
I'm on my way.

83
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,080
-What is it?
-I gotta head back there.

84
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,560
-What happened?
-Nurit, it's alright,

85
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll be back soon.

86
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,200
You have to take off your robe.

87
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,200
Hi.

88
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,520
We tracked Doron's phone,
then another phone

89
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,120
which stopped near the Oranit checkpoint
entering the Territories.

90
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,080
Dispatch all Special Intervention Units
to the Tapuah settlement,

91
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,560
where we're setting up the command post,
and inform the head of Secret Service.

92
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,800
-What?
-An ultimatum issued by ISIS-Palestine:

93
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,880
"You have 24 hours to release
all ISIS and senior Hamas prisoners."

94
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,320
They sent a list.

95
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,520
Or else?

96
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,160
For fuck's sake...

97
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,720
What is it?

98
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,080
Let's get a move on.

99
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,120
Hurry up, let's go.

100
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,720
Kaspi, activate all visual surveillance
means at our disposal.

101
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,040
Okay. Borders, checkpoints,
unit 8200, run every single cam.

102
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,760
-The negotiation team is on its way, too.
-It's Al Makdasi's ploy to buy time.

103
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,480
We can't even contact the fucker.
Who will you negotiate with?

104
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,320
So what do I do? Release the prisoners?
Call off the dispatch?

105
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,040
He'll kill Doron
to boost his status in the Territories.

106
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,880
No captives have ever
been released that quickly.

107
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,000
He's just trying to aggravate Hamas.

108
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,800
Let's send Hamas a sincere message
that we're ready to negotiate

109
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,040
and let Nidal feel the heat.
What do we have to lose, Ayub?

110
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,320
[Hello?]

111
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,440
<i>[How are you, Abu Samara?</i>
<i>I see you're no longer the boss.]</i>

<i>-Hey, Gali.</i>
-Ayub!

131

I've been hearing rumors, what's going on?

132
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,360
<i>We still don't know. I'm on it.</i>

<i>It hasn't been confirmed yet.</i>

134
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,200
Were they kidnapped?

135
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,560
I don't know.

136
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,400
Where's my son?

137
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,440
I don't know, I'll call as soon as I know.

138
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,640
Gabi, that's not an answer,
tell me where my kid is! Now!

<i>I'm sorry, that's all I've got right now.</i>

<i>Gali, listen to me,</i>
<i>don't speak to any journalists,</i>

141
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,840
<i>it could endanger both Doron and Ido.</i> <i>And don't leave home, it's too risky.</i>

142
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,240
I need you to be strong now.

143
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,040
Gali?

144
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,120
Do you realize how many tunnels,
burrows and hiding places they have?

145
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,080
It's impossible to find someone
in just a few hours.

146
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,600
I've been through this before
and it ended badly.

147
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,400
We don't know that yet.

148
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,800
You weren't here
when we searched for those kids.

149
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,720
We looked all over the Territories.

150
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,480
-What's wrong, Mommy?
-Everything's fine...

151
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,240
put your sandals on.

152
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,560
Hurry...

153
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,920
But what is it?

154
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,120
Hold on.

155
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,480
Hey!

156
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,200
Ma'am, I got orders.

157
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,440
I'm sorry, I can't let you out.

158
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,840
Open up! I have to get out!

159
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,280
Sorry, ma'am, I got orders.
It's for your own good.

160
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,720
No, you have to let me out...

161
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
You have to...

162
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,680
Come here...

163
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,680
Commander Bazelet.

164
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,640
I'm almost done searching
the sheikh's house, the cube is clear.

165
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,680
Continuing to move along that route.

166
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,000
[Halt!]

167
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,440
[Halt!]

168
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,080
[-Move!]
[-Where are you going?]

169
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,000
[Move!]

170
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,840
[Wait here!
Abu Karim, they wouldn't stop.]

171
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,600
[Sorry, I didn't know what to do.]

172
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,440
[Hello, Abu Samara.]

173
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,720
[You sell weapons to that piece of shit?!]

174
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,280
[-To whom? What?]
[-What? To whom?]

175
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,800
[-To Al Makdasi! Stop pretending!]
[-But... did you tell me not to?]

176
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,560
[He's trying to fuck us over,
haven't you heard the news?!]

177
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,720
[-I have.]
[-So you never armed him?]

178
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,480
[No.]

179
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,840
[Sit down and have a drink.
Get him some water.]

180
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,080
[Did you know he's working
with someone named Musa Al-Khader?]

181
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,000
[Who?]

182
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,520
[Some guy who's always around Nablus.]

183
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,200
[I'll tell you
where you can find him, okay?]

184
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,360
[Listen, Marwa,]

185
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,840
[I know you have nothing
to do with all this,]

186
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,320
[nothing whatsoever.]

187
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,760
[I want to help you,]

188
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,760
[but you must help me, too.]

189
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,560
[We don't have much time.]

190
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,280
[Every second counts.]

191
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
[Where is Nidal?]

192
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,880
[Marwa, I asked you something.]

193
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,560
[Do you understand that unless we
find him right now, you will go to jail?]

194
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,240
[Is that what you want?]

195
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,440
[I'd never collaborate with you people.]

196
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,800
[Burn in hell, Zionist bitch.]

197
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,320
[Amira...]

198
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,040
[You know who I am, right?]

199
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,040
[Yes.]

200
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,640
[You either tell me
where Al Makdasi is hiding]

201
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,320
[or I'll make you have a miscarriage.]

202
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,040
[I will do it.]

203
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,320
[I don't know where he's hiding--
they blindfolded me--]

204
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,360
[but he gave me this.]

205
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,920
NABLUS, BALATA REFUGEE CAMP

206
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,040
[In order to maintain a high level
of performance and good quality...]

207
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,880
[Ismail?]

208
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,800
[Yeah, it's me, Ismail.]

209
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,560
[-What's wrong, pal?]
[-Nothing. I just brought you some food.]

210
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,240
[Get in.]

211
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,200
[Hello, Ismail. Come here.]

212
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,760
[Tell me, buddy,
what do they say on the news?]

213
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,840
[Nothing about the Jew,
but there's a lot of other stuff.]

214
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,680
[-Any reports about a big attack?]
[-No. You want to check it?]

215
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,400
[No, no, don't turn on the phone in here,
only outside.]

216
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,160
[Tell me, Ismail, did anyone call you
asking about me?]

217
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,960
[No.]

218
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,760
[Good.]

219
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,000
[Go outside with him, check the news.]

220
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,560
[-Come.]
[-Thanks, buddy.]

221
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,720
<i>Eli, what's your position?</i>

222
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,280
One kilometer south of Balata.
<i>Do you copy?</i>

223
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,800
Roger. We're trying to locate
the phone signal.

224
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,800
I'm sending you <i>new coordinates.</i>

225
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,640
Turn right, this road outflanks it.

226
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,760
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

227
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,280
[Right, Doron?]

228
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,400
[You killed my father,
I killed your father.]

229
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,240
[But remember, I'm not like you.]

230
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,280
[I don't kill civilians,
I don't murder children.]

231
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,680
[Sure, you do,]

232
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,320
[but with you people,]

233
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,240
[it's supposedly never intentional.]

234
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,320
[That's also how you killed my brother.]

235
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,120
[If I'm not mistaken,
it was you who killed your brother.]

236
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,880
[You shot him, didn't you?]

237
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,680
[God, forgive my sins.]

238
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,080
[Was it not?]

239
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,360
[Abu Seif!]

240
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,240
[-Come here.]
[-Was it not?]

241
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,320
[Huh?]

242
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,840
[You killed him!]

243
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,040
[What is it? Talk to me.]

244
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,920
[Ismail told me
that the Jews just reported...]

245
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,960
[The Jews reported that two terrorists
were killed in an apartment in Ramat Gan]

246
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,640
[and that explosives were found.]

247
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,920
[We mustn't wait.] [Go get the camera.]

248
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,080
Eli, the phone is on the move,
close to you guys.

249
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,080
<i>He just turned the corner.</i>

250
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,960
Eli, it's a kid.

251
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,600
Is he crossing the street?

252
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,160
It's a kid.

253
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,120
<i>Grab him! He's our only lead!</i>

254
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,560
[Slowly.]

255
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,120
We don't want to scare him.

256
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,240
[Kid!]

257
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
[Stop!]

258
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,360
[Kid!]

259
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,320
[Stop!]

260
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,560
Stop, stop!

261
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,960
<i>Kaspi, he entered an abandoned building,</i>
<i>we're on his tail.</i>

262
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,720
<i>Advance cautiously, it could be an ambush.</i>

263
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,480
<i>Eli, his phone signal is very weak,</i>
<i>it must be a real maze.</i>

264
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,040
<i>He's moving southeast.</i>

265
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,360
Copy.

266
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,280
[They let me talk to you
because I'm nice.]

267
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,840
[I have a son your age.]

268
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,000
[May your children die!]

269
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,720
[Buddy,]

270
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,440
[you know where Al Makdasi is, right?]

271
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,720
[I'll never tell you.]

272
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,280
[Listen, Ismail, buddy,]

273
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,240
[we must know where he is,]

274
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,560
[otherwise everyone will die.]

275
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,960
[You don't want that, do you?]

276
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,200
[Ismail, we're running out of time.]

277
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,280
[You know what I just got?]

278
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,760
[The phone number of your dad,]

279
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,840
[Abu Ismail.]

280
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,200
[Fine.]

281
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,240
[No, wait. Will they know it was me?]

282
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,840
[Of course not. How would they know?]

283
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,240
[You're a kid, you don't count.] [If I tell you,
promise not to tell anyone?]

284
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,840
[You have my word.]

285
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,360
[Unchain him.]

286
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,560
[This is it, Doron.]

287
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,000
[It's all over.]

288
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,440
[Get down on your knees.]

289
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,120
[Go on, Doron, don't waste our time.]

290
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,280
[Here. Read it.]

291
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,960
[I won't read this
until you let me talk to my son.]

292
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,240
[I want to say goodbye to him.]

293
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,000
[-Musa...]
[-Should I bring him in?]

294
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,200
Dad! Idodi,

295
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,600
I love you,

296
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,720
you're my boy,

297
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,200
always remember that.

298
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,440
You're strong, you know that, right?

299
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,320
-Do you?
-Yes.

300
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,360
I'm sorry you got involved in all of this.

301
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,920
Look at me.

302
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,000
Listen to me.

303
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,720
If there are suddenly lots of people here
and everyone starts shooting,

304
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,920
shut your eyes and lie on the floor, okay?

305
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,360
-Okay. Dad! Dad!
[-Come.]

306
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,400
[Go on, Doron, read it.]

307
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,840
"I, Doron Kabilio, son of Amos Kabilio,

00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,240
[-Fuck you and ISIS!]
[-I said, read the text!]

316
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,840
[You're a bunch of shitheads
in beards and dresses!]

317
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,240
[-You're all pieces of shit!]
[-Prepare to die!]

318
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,640
[Kill me and it's all over.
You'll be left with nothing.]

319
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,440
[Nidal, open the door!]

320
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,560
[Musa, go see who it is.]

321
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,360
[Hey, hey! Easy!]

322
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,360
[-Back off!]
[-Calm down, what is it?]

323
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,360
[Give me the soldier.]

324
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,160
[Settle down, Abu Samara.]

325
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,360
[This soldier is not yours.]

326
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,600
[I'll take all of you down, Nidal,
including you.]

327
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,160
[No one negotiates
on behalf of the movement.]

328
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,440
[This is an ISIS operation,
so stay out of it, Abu Samara.]

329
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,600
[Give me the Jew!]

330
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,080
[Who's the kid? Now you kidnap children,
Abu Seif Al Makdasi?]

331
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,760
[I told you to stay out of this,
Abu Samara.]

332
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,560
[I kidnapped the kid
and I'll do as I please with him.]

333
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,600
[You're a kid yourself! Get a grip!]

334
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,720
[Abu Samara,]

335
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,800
[he killed my father.
I alone will handle him.]

336
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,360
["I alone will handle him," huh?]

337
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Dad!

338
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,600
Ido!

339
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,840
Ido, put the gun down!

340
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,560
Ido, put the gun down!

341
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,320
Ido, look at me.

342
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,320
Ido, look at me!

343
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,840
Sweetie, put the gun down, Daddy's here.

344
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,720
I'm here, it's okay.

345
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,520
Ido, look at me.

346
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,160
I'm here, it's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

347
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,560
Put the gun down. Everything's okay.

348
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,680
It's okay. Put the gun down and get out.

349
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,680
I'll handle this. Get out.

350
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,440
Go.

351
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,360
Get out.

352
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,760
<i>Eli, the Special Forces</i>
<i>are two minutes away from you.</i>

353
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,760
Look, it's Ido! It's Ido!

354
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,440
It's Doron!

355
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,840
Doron!

355
00:34:35,305 --> 00:35:35,315

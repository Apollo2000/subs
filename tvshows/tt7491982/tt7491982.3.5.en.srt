1
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:05,744
Watching you two
struggle with that fire,

2
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:07,528
I thought we were gonna
freeze to death.

3
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:10,009
- Ask me, Ben and I did okay
for a couple city boys.

4
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:11,663
- Hey, come on, man.
- No, no.

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,188
- It wasn't my idea
to go camping in January.

6
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:16,625
- I got a great deal
on the cabin.

7
00:00:16,668 --> 00:00:18,583
- Of course you got
a great deal; It's January.

8
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:20,411
Everybody knew
it'd be 30 degrees.

9
00:00:23,544 --> 00:00:25,285
- Ben, you grew up
in New York too?

10
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:26,678
both: No.
- Baltimore.

11
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:28,332
He came to New York
for college.

12
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,464
-  That's where we met.
NYU.

13
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:32,292
Been together ever since.

14
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:36,775
Oh.
I will be right back.

15
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:38,821
Gotta go check on Gracie.

16
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:40,910
I'll just be a minute.

17
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:50,180
- I didn't realize you two had
been together since college.

18
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:51,485
- 11 years this month.

19
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:52,748
- I remember the first time

20
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,750
Rhonda brought Ben home
to meet our parents.

21
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:56,055
You were so quiet,

22
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:58,101
you barely said three words
the whole trip.

23
00:00:58,144 --> 00:00:59,493
- I was intimidated.

24
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:01,191
I mean, walking
into a family like that

25
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:04,716
when everyone was--

26
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:09,199
- Rhonda?

27
00:01:09,242 --> 00:01:10,591
Rhonda, what's wrong?

28
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:13,551
- She's gone!
Someone took Grace!

29
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:20,036
both: Grace!

30
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,385
- Grace!
- Grace!

31
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:22,734
- Grace!
- Grace!

32
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:24,867
- Grace!
- Grace!

33
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,651
- Grace!
- Grace!

34
00:01:26,695 --> 00:01:28,740
- Grace!
- Grace!

35
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:30,524
- Grace!
- Grace!

36
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:31,917
- Grace!
- Grace!

37
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:33,397
- Grace!
- Grace!

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,572
- Grace!
- Grace!

39
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:35,573
- Grace!

40
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:41,535
- Right there.
- What are you doing?

41
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:42,928
No, no.
- Yeah, come on.

42
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:45,017
Just a couple to commemorate...

43
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:46,018
- I'm not 14.
- Being out of the office

44
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:47,411
for once.

45
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:48,891
There she is.
Gimme that smile.

46
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:49,979
Gimme that sexy smile.

47
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:51,110
- Okay, all right.
Yeah, yeah.

48
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,330
- There she is.
- Mm-hmm.

49
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,811
Okay.

50
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:58,074
Okay, not our best.

51
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:59,640
- That was really bad.
- A few of those.

52
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:10,782
Aw, they're really beautiful.

53
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:12,958
Niece and nephew?

54
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,050
- No.

55
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:21,227
No, they're, uh--
they're actually mine.

56
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:24,361
- Yours?

57
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:29,583
You have kids?

58
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:31,847
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,762
- Were you married?
- No.

60
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:36,416
I was never married, but we
were together a long time.

61
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,941
They live with their mom
in Puerto Rico,

62
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:41,770
so I don't get to see them
as often as I would like.

63
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,864
Hey, I was gonna
tell you sooner, okay?

64
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:52,476
I just--I just wanted us
to be further along.

65
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:53,999
- "Further along"?

66
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:55,566
- That's not--I didn't--
- Okay, okay.

67
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,437
- I didn't mean it like--
I just...

68
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:59,483
you...

69
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:02,834
Hey, hey.

70
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:04,444
- It's Jubal.

71
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:06,098
I have to go.

72
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,714
- Her five-year-old,
Grace Harris,

73
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:15,934
was abducted from a cabin
in Harriman State Park

74
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,414
a little over an hour ago.

75
00:03:17,457 --> 00:03:19,198
Mother called it in, said
they were on a family trip--

76
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:21,722
Just Grace, her parents,
and her aunt and uncle.

77
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:23,550
- So where were the adults
when she was taken?

78
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:27,337
- Just outside the cabin,
sitting around a campfire.

79
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,860
Every parent's worst nightmare,right?

80
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:29,948
- Yeah.

81
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:31,167
What do we know
about the family?

82
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,864
- Her parents
are Ben and Rhonda Harris,

83
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:35,214
both 32 years old,
live on the Upper West Side.

84
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:38,348
She is an investment banker
with Pinnacle Financial.

85
00:03:38,391 --> 00:03:40,611
He's a defense attorney
with Kagan & Greene.

86
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:43,527
- We think they were targeted?

87
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,050
- Well, no ransom demand.

88
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:47,183
The girl was abductedfar away from home, so...

89
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,402
- All right, let's focus on
the surrounding area for now.

90
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:50,708
- Yeah.
- Send the K-9 Unit.

91
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:52,014
Let's get canvases started.
- Okay.

92
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:54,190
Maggie and OA aresetting up a mobile unit now.

93
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,626
- Okay, everybody, listen up!

94
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:56,888
We have a five-year-old girl

95
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:59,151
who has been missing
for two hours now.

96
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:00,718
We all know the deal:
longer she's gone,

97
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:01,719
the worse her chances get.

98
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:03,286
Scola, how we doing?

99
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:04,591
- Rangers took a team to cover
the west ends of the ground.

100
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:06,071
I'm headed east
with this group now.

101
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:07,507
- Agent Zidan.
- Yes?

102
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:09,161
Trooper Gates, state police.
You wanted to see me?

103
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:10,510
- I need you and your guysgoing door-to-door

104
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:11,903
to neighboring towns;get Grace's photo out there,

105
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:13,165
see if anyone's seenanything unusual.

106
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:14,427
- Got it.

107
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,690
- Ah, Trooper Gates.

108
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:17,866
Start withthe sex offender registry

109
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:19,432
in case we're dealingwith an opportunist.

110
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:20,781
- We'll check it out.

111
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:22,392
- K-9.
- Where do you need us?

112
00:04:22,435 --> 00:04:24,263
- I need youat the abduction site.

113
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:27,266
We need a full forensic sweepof the family's cabin.

114
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:31,096
Okay?All right, let's get to work.

115
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:34,317
- Hey.

116
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,014
What did you see
when you were last inside?

117
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:38,234
- Uh, I went into Grace's roomto check on her,

118
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:40,062
and it--the room was freezing.

119
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:43,195
And so I saw thatthe window was open, and...

120
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:44,805
I just can't believethis is happening.

121
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:46,720
We were checking on herevery 30 minutes.

122
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,418
- Okay, who was the last person
to see Grace?

123
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:49,941
- I was.
I checked on her around 8:30.

124
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:51,464
She was fine.

125
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:53,118
- We should've neverleft her alone.

126
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:55,904
- Honey, we were right outside.
There was nobody else here.

127
00:04:55,947 --> 00:04:57,166
- Someone was here.

128
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:58,558
Someone was here,and they took our daughter.

129
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:00,386
- Okay.

130
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,519
Have you seen
anyone else around?

131
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:03,737
both: No.

132
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:04,913
- Did you hear any voices?

133
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:07,393
Maybe something out
of the ordinary?

134
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:10,266
- No, no, no.
- No, we had music playing.

135
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:12,921
- Okay.

136
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:14,183
Look, at this point,

137
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:15,836
this is looking like
a crime of opportunity,

138
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,708
but I've gotta ask you,

139
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,623
is there anybody who's wanted
to hurt either of you?

140
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,972
- No.

141
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:22,800
- No disgruntled employees
or unhappy clients?

142
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:24,019
- No, no, no,
nothing like that.

143
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:25,934
We don't have any enemies.
- Yeah, no.

144
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:28,240
- Excuse me.
This your daughter's?

145
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:29,763
- Yes.
- Yeah.

146
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:31,374
Why are they takingher toothbrush?

147
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,071
- Standard procedure.

148
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:35,073
- It's for DNA, right?

149
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:36,988
In case they need
to identify her?

150
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:38,685
Which could mean that she's...

151
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,861
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't go there.

152
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:42,602
- Mrs. Harris, Mr. Harris,

153
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:45,257
we are doing everything we can
to find your daughter.

154
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:46,955
In the meantime,

155
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:50,001
I think it's important that you
guys get settled into a hotel.

156
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:51,785
It's really importantthat we can get a hold of you

157
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:52,917
in case something comes up.

158
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:54,963
both: Yeah.
- Thank you.

159
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:01,099
- So show me exactly whereyou all were sitting.

160
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:02,666
- Nicole and I were here,

161
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,842
and then Ben and Rhonda
were on that bench.

162
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,282
- Facing the cabin?

163
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:12,284
- Rhonda wanted to see the door
just in case Grace got up,

164
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:14,678
but we never thought...

165
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:16,810
- No, of course not.

166
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:18,073
So Rhonda wentto check on Grace,

167
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:19,465
and the three of youstayed out here?

168
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:20,771
- And then about
a minute later,

169
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,860
we heard Rhonda screaming
so we ran inside,

170
00:06:22,903 --> 00:06:24,818
and that's when we realized
what had happened.

171
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:27,734
- And have you seen anyonein this area?

172
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:28,909
- No.

173
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:29,910
We went outlooking for Grace,

174
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:31,477
but we didn't see anyone.

175
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:32,739
- And do you know
if there's anyone else

176
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:34,045
staying out here
anywhere nearby?

177
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:36,308
- There was a man
when we first got here.

178
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:38,049
I saw him when
I was getting the firewood.

179
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:40,138
- Do you remember
what he looked like?

180
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:41,835
- Yeah. Yeah.

181
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,881
- Scola, let's be on
the lookout for a white male,

182
00:06:43,924 --> 00:06:47,015
dark hair, slender, last seen
wearing a red flannel shirt.

183
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:49,278
- One step ahead of you, Tiff.

184
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:52,107
All right, OA, we got
an abandoned campsite out here.

185
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,065
It's about a 1/4 mile east
of the abduction site.

186
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:56,111
Fire's still going,
so it's recent,

187
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:57,721
but no sign
of whoever camped here.

188
00:06:57,764 --> 00:06:59,418
- Okay, so who's taking off
in the middle of the night

189
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,986
with search parties and
helicopters all over the place?

190
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,292
- I hear you, man.

191
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:05,033
You getting anything
from the drone?

192
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:07,035
- No. Nothing near you.

193
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,949
Hold on.

194
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:11,387
I might have something.

195
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:16,827
Hey, Maggie, are you still
at the abduction site?

196
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,263
- Yeah, I'm here.
What's up?

197
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:20,091
- Okay, I have a drone
picking up a heat signature

198
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:21,701
about 1/2 mile north of you,

199
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:23,790
far end of the rock formation.

200
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,879
- Okay, copy.
We're on our way.

201
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,975
- Grace?
- Search team, advance...

202
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,542
- OA, we're getting close.

203
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:39,154
Any eyes on our guy?

204
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:41,634
- He is 30 yards ahead
on your right.

205
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:44,594
- Up ahead!
- Copy that. Stand by.

206
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,949
- FBI!
Don't move!

207
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:53,298
- Tango at six o'clock!
Let's go!

208
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:55,431
- Don't move!
- We got a runner!

209
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:58,086
- Suspect on foot!

210
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:08,661
- Hey!

211
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,883
- We need an ID
on the man in this photo.

212
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,406
Maggie and OA
have him in custody,

213
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,582
but he doesn't have
any identification on him,

214
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,497
and he refuses
to state his name.

215
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,281
- Jub, I'm running
facial rec now.

216
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:21,587
- Thank you.

217
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:22,762
- And we got him.
- Yeah?

218
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:25,896
- Don Kirkpatrick.
47 years old.

219
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,550
- I'm guessing
by all the mugshots,

220
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:28,855
he's got quite a rap sheet.

221
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:31,293
- Public intoxication,
aggravated assault,

222
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:32,468
resisting arrest.

223
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,122
- He's got
an outstanding warrant too.

224
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:36,559
Broke into his ex-wife's house
to see his kid two months ago.

225
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:38,387
Took off
before the cops arrived.

226
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,736
She filed an order
of protection against him

227
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,346
for child abuse.
- Right.

228
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,826
All right, let's get everything
we have over to Maggie and OA,

229
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:46,046
see if they can get
this dirtbag to start talking.

230
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,309
-  Where is she, Don?

231
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:50,312
I cannot help you
unless you cooperate.

232
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:52,357
Where did you take her?

233
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:54,707
- Look, man,
I've seen your rap sheet.

234
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,187
You have
an outstanding warrant.

235
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:58,624
You really wanna tack on
a kidnapping charge?

236
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,017
Huh?

237
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,454
A jury would not blink
to convict a guy like you,

238
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:04,413
someone who abuses his own kid.

239
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:07,720
- I never abused my kid, ever!

240
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:09,722
I never touched
that little girl either.

241
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:15,163
But I may have seen
the guy that did.

242
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:16,947
- Okay.

243
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,905
Would you like to tell us
what happened,

244
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:21,256
what you saw?

245
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:24,128
- Yeah, she was with some man
out in the woods,

246
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,913
and, uh...

247
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:29,394
he was pulling her by her arm.

248
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:31,004
I saw her
with her family earlier.

249
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,180
I knew where she lived,

250
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:35,052
so I went there
to see what was going on,

251
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:36,314
but when I got there,

252
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:39,274
I saw that the parents
were panicking, and...

253
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,319
I knew they were gonna
call the cops, so...

254
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:43,191
I didn't want nothing
to do with it.

255
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:45,236
- Well, that is very noble
of you, sir.

256
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,281
- You said that
you saw the girl

257
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:47,804
outside of the cabin
in the woods?

258
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:49,066
Where?

259
00:09:49,109 --> 00:09:50,763
- Down by the pond.

260
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:53,070
I heard them there...

261
00:09:53,113 --> 00:09:54,202
But I kept back.

262
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:55,855
I stayed out of sight,
and I saw the guy.

263
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,248
He, uh...

264
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:59,250
he was struggling
with the girl,

265
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:00,817
and she didn't want
nothing to do with him.

266
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,122
- Did you get
a good look at him?

267
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,386
- It was too dark.

268
00:10:08,694 --> 00:10:10,130
- According to park maps,

269
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:11,784
there's a utility road
on the north side of the pond.

270
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:13,482
So if Kirkpatrick's
telling the truth,

271
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:17,050
then the kidnapper could've
been taking Grace to a car.

272
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:20,228
- Looks like someone
was headed this way.

273
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:22,621
Can we get a marker over here?

274
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,623
- You got it.

275
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

276
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:37,288
- ...body of water...

277
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:39,551
- Scola?

278
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:40,770
We got blood.

279
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:44,295
- Is this, uh--
first marker here, huh?

280
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,036
- Yeah, we'll start here.

281
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:50,954
- Okay, we should get this
to the lab right away.

282
00:10:52,956 --> 00:10:54,523
- We got a couple
of divers flying in...

283
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:56,351
- Get your placard
in the shot, yeah?

284
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:04,272
- Hey, check it out.

285
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:23,247
- Hey. What's going on?
- Yeah, Jubal, it's Scola.

286
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,554
We're gonna need
a dive team out here.

287
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:33,213
- All right, dive team
has started a grid search

288
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:35,215
on the pond,
but in the meantime,

289
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:37,696
we need to proceed
as if she's still alive.

290
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,656
So in the spirit of optimism,
let's keep working.

291
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,048
What do we have?

292
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:43,833
- Lab says
the shoe print Scola found

293
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:45,530
isn't distinct enough
to run down.

294
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:47,053
It's a size 12.

295
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:49,055
That's three sizes too large
to be Don Kirkpatrick's.

296
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:50,840
- Which means there was
someone else out there.

297
00:11:50,883 --> 00:11:51,841
- Yeah, well,
they're gonna book him

298
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:53,059
on the outstanding warrant,

299
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:55,061
but ERT didn't find
any evidence in his tent

300
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:57,237
or in the area
where Maggie apprehended him.

301
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,978
It doesn't seem like
he was involved.

302
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:00,415
- Mm.

303
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,677
- We can confirm the blood
on the rock is Grace's.

304
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,853
It matched to the DNA
from the toothbrush.

305
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:05,681
-  Right.

306
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,074
Anything from the doll?
- Two latent prints.

307
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:09,641
One of a child's,
presumably Grace's.

308
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:12,122
The other of her father's,
Ben Harris.

309
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,166
- So that's a dead end.

310
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,603
- Not necessarily.

311
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:16,387
Something popped when
we ran her dad's fingerprints.

312
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:19,608
- What do you mean?
- On the surface, Ben is clean.

313
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:22,175
But he changed
his legal name 13 years ago.

314
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:23,960
He has a sealed juvenile record

315
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:26,615
and a past felony conviction.

316
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:28,312
- For what?

317
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:31,446
- Murder.

318
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:34,100
When he was 12, he killed
a ten-year-old girl...

319
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:38,670
In the woods.

320
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:41,064
- Same crime, same location.

321
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,199
Could just be
an ugly coincidence,

322
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:48,593
but let's see what else
you can dig up!

323
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:54,599
We need to know who this
little girl's father really is.

324
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:01,334
- Ben Harris
was born Corbin Howard.

325
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:02,379
He grew up in the Bronx.

326
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:03,989
He was raised
by his grandmother

327
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:06,383
until he was convicted
of murder as a juvenile.

328
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:07,775
He was 12 years old.

329
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:09,342
He spent six years
at the Horizon Juvenile Center

330
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:10,474
in the Bronx.

331
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:12,737
He was released
on his 18th birthday.

332
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,087
- Well, that is
an odd coincidence,

333
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,131
but we really think
it's relevant

334
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:17,655
to his daughter's
disappearance?

335
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:19,526
- Well, there are some
similarities between the cases.

336
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,614
You wanna...

337
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:21,833
- The victim's name
was Lucy Parkin.

338
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:23,487
She and Ben went to
the same summer camp

339
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,793
in the Catskills
in July of 2000,

340
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:27,491
and witnesses said that,
on the day of the murder,

341
00:13:27,534 --> 00:13:30,102
he lured her deep into
the woods, away from the group,

342
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:32,626
shoved her off
the side of a cliff.

343
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,368
She fell 28 feet,
died a few hours later.

344
00:13:35,412 --> 00:13:36,500
- Okay.

345
00:13:36,543 --> 00:13:38,066
Is there any evidence

346
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,025
that actually suggest he's
involved in this current case?

347
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:41,505
- Well, nothing concrete,

348
00:13:41,548 --> 00:13:43,376
but he was the last person
to have contact with Grace

349
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,117
before she went missing.

350
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,814
And he also has a sealed
psychiatric record

351
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:48,338
from his time
at Youth Authority.

352
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:49,774
- Right.

353
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:50,992
HIPAA laws prevent us
from seeing what was in it,

354
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:52,385
but if he was struggling
with mental illness,

355
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:56,128
being in the same environment
as the original trauma,

356
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:58,870
it could've trigged him,
sent him down a dark path.

357
00:13:58,913 --> 00:13:59,914
- All right.

358
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,525
Have Maggie and OA
go question him.

359
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:03,265
- Yeah.

360
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:11,796
- Hi.
Come in.

361
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,971
Did you find something?

362
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:14,320
- Mrs. Harris,
is your husband here?

363
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:16,409
- No, he went out for a drive.

364
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:17,715
He said he needed
to clear his head.

365
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:19,020
- When did he leave?

366
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:21,240
- About 45 minutes ago.
Is everything okay?

367
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:22,981
Do you know who took Grace?

368
00:14:23,024 --> 00:14:24,635
- We don't have any more
information right now,

369
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:26,114
but we have a search team
out there

370
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,899
doing everything that they can.

371
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:31,119
Um, can you call Ben now?

372
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,077
It'd be better
if we could speak

373
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,121
to both of you
at the same time.

374
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,689
- Yeah.

375
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:44,481
It's going straight
to voicemail.

376
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:47,527
His phone must've died.

377
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:56,188
- Jubal, it's OA.
Ben Harris isn't at the hotel.

378
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:57,711
His phone's off.
He went for a drive.

379
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:58,973
I think he went radio silent.

380
00:14:59,017 --> 00:15:01,019
- You think he's running?
- I'm not sure,

381
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:02,499
but I saw some shoes
in his suitcase.

382
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:04,152
He's a size 12.

383
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:05,284
- Okay, listen up, everybody!

384
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:07,199
Ben Harris,
the victim's father,

385
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:08,635
just became a suspect.

386
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:11,116
I need a current location
for him ASAP.

387
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,293
I wanna pull his financials,
his cell records,

388
00:15:14,336 --> 00:15:16,338
and let's put a BOLO out
on the family car.

389
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,818
OA, listen up.
Talk to the wife.

390
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:19,254
See if he said anything to her

391
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:20,952
that can help us figure out
where he might be going.

392
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:22,083
- Copy that.

393
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:24,825
- Before Ben left,
how was he doing?

394
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:26,479
- He's terrified.

395
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:28,350
Our daughter's missing.
Why?

396
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,091
- I just wanted to make sure
he's doing okay.

397
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:32,790
He's been gone a while now.

398
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,792
What about the last two weeks?

399
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:38,926
Has Ben seemed
unusually stressed?

400
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,667
- No.

401
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:42,495
- Did he seem agitated
in the woods?

402
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:43,627
- No.

403
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,367
Why would he be agitated
in the woods?

404
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,499
Wait, you guys don't think

405
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:48,370
that he had something
to do with it...

406
00:15:50,634 --> 00:15:52,070
Do you?

407
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:53,288
- Given his history.

408
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:54,942
- What history?

409
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:56,335
What the hell
are you talking about?

410
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:03,821
- As a defense attorney.

411
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,129
- Oh.

412
00:16:08,173 --> 00:16:11,306
- Just assuming that he's made
some enemies in past cases.

413
00:16:14,832 --> 00:16:16,137
- No.

414
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:17,443
Like I said before,
we don't have any enemies.

415
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:18,879
- Okay, that's fine.

416
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:20,011
Maggie, we gotta go.
I just got a text.

417
00:16:20,054 --> 00:16:21,534
But we will need
to talk to him.

418
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:22,753
Standard procedure.

419
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:23,536
So please give us a call
when he gets here.

420
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,190
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

421
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:27,845
- Mm-hmm.

422
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:29,411
- I can't believe she doesn't
know about the murder.

423
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,109
How do you hide something
like that from your wife?

424
00:16:31,152 --> 00:16:32,545
- I'm guessing
that's a pretty difficult topic

425
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:33,633
to just bring up.

426
00:16:33,677 --> 00:16:35,417
- I get it,
but she deserves to know.

427
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,637
- Well, you're right, but
we're not marriage counselors.

428
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:39,900
We just gotta keep her calm
and focused.

429
00:16:39,944 --> 00:16:41,728
- Unless Ben is involved.

430
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:43,817
- In that case,
it's too late to matter.

431
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:47,952
- Jubal, I just got off the
phone with Ben Harris's bank.

432
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:49,562
- Yeah.
- He withdrew $140,000

433
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:51,912
from a branch two miles away
from the camp ground.

434
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:53,087
- When was this?
- Five minutes ago.

435
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:54,306
Branch manager said
he was in a hurry.

436
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:55,742
- What's the address?

437
00:16:55,786 --> 00:16:57,178
- Bank of America Financial
Center in Haverstraw.

438
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:58,571
232 Liberty Drive.

439
00:16:58,615 --> 00:16:59,877
- All right.
Pull traffic cams.

440
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,531
See if you can figure out
which way he's headed.

441
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:04,403
Maggie, it's Jubal.

442
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:06,274
Are you and OA still
at the Harris's hotel?

443
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,841
- Yeah, we're leaving now.
What's up?

444
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:10,670
- Ben Harris just hit up a
Bank of America in Haverstraw.

445
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:11,802
It's five minutes away
from you.

446
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:14,108
The address is...
- Hey, he's here.

447
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:15,588
- At the hotel?

448
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:16,850
- Yeah. Jubal, he's pulling up.
I'm gonna call you back.

449
00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:18,112
- Yeah.

450
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:20,550
- Hey, Ben.
Talk to you for a sec...

451
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:24,684
Aw, you gotta be kidding me.

452
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,361
- Ben, stop!

453
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:54,148
- Ben Harris,
you're under arrest

454
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:55,410
for resisting federal agents!

455
00:17:55,454 --> 00:17:56,890
- They're gonna kill
my daughter!

456
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:58,762
- What do you mean?
Who's gonna kill your daughter?

457
00:17:58,805 --> 00:18:01,634
- The people who sent me this.

458
00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:06,639
- It's a ransom demand.
"$200K by sundown or she dies."

459
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:09,381
- Please.

460
00:18:09,424 --> 00:18:11,383
- Okay.

461
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:13,472
Come on.
Get up.

462
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:17,607
Okay, let's go.

463
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,339
- All right, everybody,
listen up.

464
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:24,472
We have a ransom demand
and a photo that proves

465
00:18:24,516 --> 00:18:27,519
Grace Harris was alive
when she left the campground.

466
00:18:27,562 --> 00:18:29,608
Looks like she has
a pretty nasty gash on her leg,

467
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,740
which explains the bloody rock
at the crime scene.

468
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:34,395
Otherwise, she appears
to be in good health--

469
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:35,614
based on the photo, at least.

470
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,877
- This is now
a targeted crime scene.

471
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,183
The abductors knew
whose child they have

472
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:41,533
and how much they can ask for.

473
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:43,796
- The kidnapper
texted Ben Harris.

474
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,841
So he has his cell number.

475
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:48,148
- Yeah, but he had him ditch
his personal cell right away

476
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,584
to avoid tracking.

477
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,239
He sent him to park in
Haverstraw to pick up a burner.

478
00:18:52,282 --> 00:18:53,806
- That's the phone
the photo of the girl was on,

479
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:55,329
the one they're using
to communicate with Ben.

480
00:18:55,372 --> 00:18:57,331
- And what about
the money drop?

481
00:18:57,374 --> 00:18:59,507
Timing? Location?
- Nothing yet.

482
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:01,248
- Okay, so you guys'll
head up to Haverstraw

483
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,597
and check the park for cameras,

484
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,946
witnesses who might've seen
our perp

485
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,819
dropping off the burner phone.

486
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:09,125
- How about the burner itself?
Did we run it for prints?

487
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:10,605
- Yeah, it's clean.

488
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,129
- Except for Ben's.
But the messaging is encrypted.

489
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:14,130
Cellular Survey is on-site

490
00:19:14,174 --> 00:19:15,654
downloading everything
they can.

491
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:21,703
- I know this is
a lot to process, Ben,

492
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:23,618
but from
an investigative perspective,

493
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,316
proof of life in
a ransom demand is encouraging.

494
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,883
- The kidnappers
want something, all right?

495
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:29,319
So they're gonna need
to keep Grace safe to get it.

496
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,063
- Why didn't you call us
after you got that text?

497
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,978
- I was just
following instructions.

498
00:19:36,022 --> 00:19:39,112
It said not to tell anyone.

499
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:42,158
You thought it was me,
didn't you?

500
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:44,204
That I'd hurt my daughter?

501
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:47,511
- Yes.

502
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:49,775
But that's only because
most abduction cases

503
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:52,473
are perpetrated by a parent...

504
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:53,996
and, given
your criminal history,

505
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,694
it raised a few red flags.

506
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:59,088
- "Criminal history"?

507
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:03,571
You're talking about
Lucy Parkin.

508
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:05,355
- We had to consider it
a possibility.

509
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:08,010
- Yeah, well,
it was an accident.

510
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:09,795
I didn't mean
to kill that girl.

511
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:11,535
- Mr. Harris, unfortunately,
we don't have time

512
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:12,841
to adjudicate your past.

513
00:20:12,885 --> 00:20:14,669
- No. Please.
I know...

514
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,584
I know what you're thinking.

515
00:20:16,628 --> 00:20:19,413
But I was at that camp
on a scholarship

516
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:21,545
and stuck out
like a sore thumb,

517
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:24,810
and Lucy and her friends,
they made sure I knew it.

518
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:26,855
Then one day I went on a walk,

519
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:28,944
and Lucy followed me,

520
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:30,380
starting taunting me,

521
00:20:30,424 --> 00:20:32,948
told me I didn't really belong
at that camp.

522
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:34,776
And I...

523
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,953
I shoved her...

524
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:39,346
hard.

525
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:43,002
It was just a reflex, and sh...

526
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:45,308
She fell off the ledge.

527
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:53,403
I think about that moment
every day.

528
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:55,275
But I'm no killer,

529
00:20:55,318 --> 00:20:57,886
and I sure as hell
would never do anything

530
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,496
to hurt my daughter.

531
00:21:01,237 --> 00:21:02,761
- Okay, we're not accusing you
of anything,

532
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,501
but we had to follow
the information in front us.

533
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:07,461
- All we care about is getting
your daughter back safely.

534
00:21:07,504 --> 00:21:09,637
So we need to talk
to your wife,

535
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:12,945
get her up to speed,
and we need to make a plan.

536
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:14,468
- Fine.

537
00:21:14,511 --> 00:21:16,688
But you can't tell her.

538
00:21:16,731 --> 00:21:19,603
You can't tell her about this.
She doesn't know.

539
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:25,174
I did six years at juvie.

540
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:27,742
I studied my ass off
to get into college

541
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,136
and start fresh.

542
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:32,442
By the time I met Rhonda,
I just--

543
00:21:32,486 --> 00:21:36,490
I just wanted
to leave all this behind

544
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:38,187
in the past.

545
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:46,630
- Okay, well, unless your past
is relevant to the case,

546
00:21:46,674 --> 00:21:47,762
we won't say a word.

547
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,111
- But we do need
to loop your wife in

548
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:51,374
on the ransom demand--now.

549
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,334
- Okay.

550
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:56,292
- But she's okay?
They haven't hurt her?

551
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,642
- No, as far as we can tell,
she's all right.

552
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:01,645
You should've told me.

553
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:04,300
We need to be a team on this,
okay?

554
00:22:04,344 --> 00:22:06,650
No secrets.
- Yes, absolutely.

555
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:08,087
- Yeah.
- No secrets.

556
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,175
- Yeah.

557
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,875
- Look, Mrs. Harris,
I know this sounds scary,

558
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,443
but the FBI has a lot of
experience doing ransom drops.

559
00:22:16,486 --> 00:22:17,923
We'll make sure
this goes down smoothly.

560
00:22:17,966 --> 00:22:19,751
- The kidnapper said no cops.

561
00:22:19,794 --> 00:22:21,230
- Well, they always do.

562
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:23,798
- Look, maybe we should
just handle this on our own,

563
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,800
do what they say.
- That is not a good idea.

564
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,542
- You took out $140K.

565
00:22:28,585 --> 00:22:30,196
That is $60K short
of the ransom.

566
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:32,764
That's a big risk.

567
00:22:32,807 --> 00:22:34,069
- So is showing up
with the feds

568
00:22:34,113 --> 00:22:35,375
when they told us
to come alone.

569
00:22:35,418 --> 00:22:36,724
- They're never gonna
know we're there.

570
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:38,813
We can put a plane
up 15,000 feet in the air.

571
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,597
We have long-range snipers
on the perimeter.

572
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:41,816
- No.

573
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,600
I appreciate what you guys
are trying to do,

574
00:22:43,644 --> 00:22:44,906
but it is too much of a risk.

575
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,387
This is our daughter.
We wanna handle it our way.

576
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:50,999
- Okay, well,
if that is your decision,

577
00:22:51,043 --> 00:22:52,348
then we can't stop you.

578
00:22:52,392 --> 00:22:54,133
- But we can tell you
that this is a mistake.

579
00:22:54,176 --> 00:22:56,004
In our experience, the people
who have declined our help--

580
00:22:56,048 --> 00:22:58,528
- Listen.

581
00:22:58,572 --> 00:23:00,704
We want to do this on our own.

582
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:13,717
- If you change your mind,
you know where to find us.

583
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:25,904
- The family's elected
to move forward

584
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:28,167
with the ransom negotiations
on their own...

585
00:23:29,995 --> 00:23:31,692
But that does not mean
we stand down.

586
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:33,868
Kelly, get a warrant.

587
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,565
I wanna tracker
on the Harris's car,

588
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:36,610
on their phones.

589
00:23:36,653 --> 00:23:38,394
Let's monitor their movements.

590
00:23:38,438 --> 00:23:40,005
They may not want us
at the drop,

591
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:41,615
but we need to be able to take
this guy down once it's done.

592
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:44,879
The area where Ben got his
burner phone's a dead end.

593
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,228
No cameras or witnesses.

594
00:23:46,272 --> 00:23:47,882
- We get any data
off the phone?

595
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,058
- No, it's one of those
specialized encrypted phones.

596
00:23:50,102 --> 00:23:51,364
No way of tracing the messages.

597
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:52,887
- These babies are
a nightmare to crack.

598
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,629
Good news is, only a few stores
in the state carry them,

599
00:23:55,672 --> 00:23:57,761
and this one
was purchased at...

600
00:23:57,805 --> 00:23:59,981
Privacy First Electronics
in Williamsburg.

601
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:02,157
- Get that store's
sales record.

602
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:04,812
Find out who bought that phone.

603
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,163
- Our analysts tried calling,

604
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:09,730
said you weren't
exactly cooperative.

605
00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:10,992
- Yeah.

606
00:24:11,036 --> 00:24:12,951
And I'll tell you
the same thing I told them:

607
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:15,214
I'm not turning over my
customers' personal information

608
00:24:15,257 --> 00:24:16,432
to Big Brother.

609
00:24:16,476 --> 00:24:17,956
It'd be a major breach
of privacy.

610
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:21,220
- We're not asking, man.
That's a federal subpoena.

611
00:24:21,263 --> 00:24:22,830
- It's an abuse of power

612
00:24:22,874 --> 00:24:23,918
and an infringement

613
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,833
on Americans'
basic rights to privacy.

614
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:27,226
I'm not submitting to that.

615
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:28,401
- It's a subpoena.

616
00:24:28,444 --> 00:24:29,489
You don't turn over
your records,

617
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:30,533
you'll be held in contempt.

618
00:24:30,577 --> 00:24:32,927
- Yeah?
See you in court.

619
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,453
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the hell are you doing?

620
00:24:37,497 --> 00:24:38,933
- We need to know
who bought this phone.

621
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,369
Do you understand me?

622
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:42,284
There's a little girl's lifethat is depending on this,

623
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:43,982
so you got three seconds.
- I don't know.

624
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,287
- All right.

625
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:47,333
- I don't--I don't know!
I don't keep records!

626
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:49,639
My clients all pay in cash!

627
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:52,773
It's the whole point:
anonymity, security.

628
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,603
- Hey, Tiff.

629
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:58,300
- Ow.

630
00:24:58,344 --> 00:25:01,086
- There's a parking lot camera
across the street.

631
00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:02,478
This jackass
may not be keeping track

632
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:04,480
of who comes in to this place.

633
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:06,004
I'll bet you that thing is.

634
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,881
- So camera one
is from the parking lot

635
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:15,274
across from the security store,

636
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:16,971
camera two is outside
the Harris house,

637
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,800
and camera three is just down
the block from Ben's office.

638
00:25:19,843 --> 00:25:21,323
The thing that caught
our attention

639
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:23,369
is that there's
an SNY Energy van

640
00:25:23,412 --> 00:25:24,761
at all three locations.

641
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:27,286
- Seemed normal at first.
Common service vehicle.

642
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:28,461
But the Harris's house

643
00:25:28,504 --> 00:25:30,506
is outside
the company's service area.

644
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,291
- So you think somebody's been
using it as a cover

645
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:34,641
to follow Ben?

646
00:25:34,684 --> 00:25:36,077
Do we have an ID on the driver?

647
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:38,123
- No, but according
to SNY's records,

648
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:39,863
the van wasn't even in use
at those times.

649
00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:42,431
The technician it's assigned
to was out of town on vacation.

650
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:43,998
- Where do they think it was?

651
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,652
- Parked in their lot
in Harlem.

652
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:47,523
- And we had the company send
over a full list of personnel

653
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:48,960
with access to that lot.

654
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:50,309
Scola and Tiffany
are combing through it now.

655
00:25:50,352 --> 00:25:51,701
- I think we got something.

656
00:25:51,745 --> 00:25:53,007
- SNY records show

657
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,617
that the same employee
swiped into the lot

658
00:25:54,661 --> 00:25:55,879
each time the van showed up

659
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:57,881
anywhere near
the Harris family.

660
00:25:57,925 --> 00:26:01,363
- A mechanic named Ray Parkin.

661
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:02,974
- Parkin, as in...

662
00:26:03,017 --> 00:26:05,193
- Lucy Parkin.

663
00:26:05,237 --> 00:26:08,327
His sister was the little girl
Ben killed 20 years ago.

664
00:26:13,582 --> 00:26:15,976
- Ray Parkin's seen a lot
of hard times in his 37 years.

665
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:18,239
After his sister's death, his
family collapsed around him.

666
00:26:18,282 --> 00:26:19,762
His mom committed suicide.

667
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:21,546
A year later,
his dad started drinking,

668
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,808
eventually died
of liver failure,

669
00:26:22,852 --> 00:26:24,332
and Ray ultimately
turned to drugs

670
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,637
and fell into legal troubles.

671
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:27,117
- Bar fights,
aggravated assault,

672
00:26:27,161 --> 00:26:28,684
armed robbery.

673
00:26:28,727 --> 00:26:30,773
- This guy sounds like he has
some serious rage issues.

674
00:26:30,816 --> 00:26:32,209
- Yeah, and it's our job
to find him

675
00:26:32,253 --> 00:26:34,255
before he takes all that anger
out on Grace Harris.

676
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:35,647
Let's make it happen.

677
00:26:35,691 --> 00:26:37,171
- Okay, I think we need
to talk to the parents,

678
00:26:37,214 --> 00:26:38,172
explain the situation.

679
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:39,347
That may get them
to work with us.

680
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,088
- Yeah, I think
it's a good idea.

681
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:42,393
In the meantime,

682
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:43,786
what do we know about
Ray Parkin's whereabouts?

683
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:45,353
Ian, anything?

684
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:46,484
- No; his phone's been powered
off since the kidnapping.

685
00:26:46,528 --> 00:26:47,877
- So we can't track him
that way.

686
00:26:47,921 --> 00:26:49,357
What about the power company?

687
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,141
- Supervisor said that he
didn't show up for work today,

688
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:52,664
and the address
they have is outdated.

689
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:54,144
- But according
to municipal records,

690
00:26:54,188 --> 00:26:56,059
it looks like he has utilities
set up in his name

691
00:26:56,103 --> 00:26:57,278
at another address.

692
00:26:57,321 --> 00:26:58,540
- Okay, that's something.
Check it out.

693
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:07,331
-  Up. Up.

694
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,159
Hold.

695
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:13,076
- FBI!
Get on the ground now!

696
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,643
Oh, come on, man.
Really?

697
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,300
Give me two in the room!

698
00:27:19,343 --> 00:27:22,956
- All right, let's search.
Fan out. Let's go!

699
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:26,698
- Back room's clear.
- Is she secure?

700
00:27:26,742 --> 00:27:29,092
- We're clear.
Nobody else here.

701
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:31,094
- Where's your roommate?
- I don't know.

702
00:27:31,138 --> 00:27:34,184
I swear,
I haven't seen him in two days.

703
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:40,930
- Hey, Scola,

704
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:43,280
check this out.

705
00:27:43,324 --> 00:27:44,847
- Up.

706
00:27:46,718 --> 00:27:48,416
It's Ray's camera.

707
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:56,032
- And they're all
of the Harrises?

708
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:58,034
- He's been stalking them.
- We're good.

709
00:27:58,078 --> 00:27:59,209
- Research.

710
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:00,515
- Okay, there is no way

711
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:01,864
that you didn't know
about all of this.

712
00:28:01,907 --> 00:28:03,431
Where is Grace Harris?
- I don't know. Honest.

713
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,346
I had nothing to do
with taking that kid.

714
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:06,912
- But you do know about it.

715
00:28:06,956 --> 00:28:08,262
- Okay.

716
00:28:08,305 --> 00:28:09,567
You don't wanna get charges
for all of the meth

717
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:11,091
that is in this place,

718
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:13,049
you're gonna tell me everything
that you know right now.

719
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:16,922
- Ray's always been
obsessed with this guy,

720
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:18,576
Corbin Howard,

721
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,100
the one who killed his sister.

722
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:21,579
He talked about him
all the time,

723
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:23,668
how he'd get back at him
if he ever saw him again.

724
00:28:23,712 --> 00:28:25,583
All that.

725
00:28:25,627 --> 00:28:26,758
But it was just a fantasy.

726
00:28:26,802 --> 00:28:29,065
Ray hadn't seen the guy
in 15 years

727
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:30,327
until a few weeks ago.

728
00:28:30,371 --> 00:28:31,850
- What happened
a few weeks ago?

729
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:35,419
- Uh, Ray was at the courthouse
for a parole hearing,

730
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,465
came back saying
he saw the guy.

731
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:38,944
Said he's a hotshot lawyer now

732
00:28:38,988 --> 00:28:41,208
and changed his name
like nothing ever happened.

733
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:43,123
But he makes a lot of money,

734
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:45,299
so Ray had this idea

735
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:47,083
to kidnap his kid,
make him pay,

736
00:28:47,127 --> 00:28:48,302
but then things
got out of control.

737
00:28:48,345 --> 00:28:49,738
He started talking crazy, I--

738
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:52,567
- Hang on, hang on, slow down.
Out of control how?

739
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,786
- He started talking crazy
and took off with my car.

740
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,485
- What kind of car?
- A Subaru Impreza, black.

741
00:28:59,052 --> 00:29:01,532
Look, I thought
it was just a money thing.

742
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:03,708
I swear I didn't know
Ray was gonna kill the guy

743
00:29:03,752 --> 00:29:05,058
after he got paid.

744
00:29:11,455 --> 00:29:12,543
- That's the fourth time
he's called.

745
00:29:12,587 --> 00:29:14,284
Everything okay?
- It's fine.

746
00:29:14,328 --> 00:29:15,590
- I don't believe you.

747
00:29:15,633 --> 00:29:16,721
- Well, we have
more important things

748
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:18,158
to be worried about right now.

749
00:29:18,201 --> 00:29:20,160
- One sec.

750
00:29:21,422 --> 00:29:23,119
- Mr. Harris.

751
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:24,990
- What's going on?
You find something?

752
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:27,036
- We need to talk
to you and your wife.

753
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,298
- Do you know where Grace is?

754
00:29:28,342 --> 00:29:30,866
- No, we don't,
but can we come inside?

755
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:32,650
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

756
00:29:32,694 --> 00:29:34,435
I thought we made this clear.

757
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:36,263
We want to handle this
on our own.

758
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:37,655
- Mr. Harris,

759
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:40,005
we have evidence that
the kidnapper is Ray Parkin.

760
00:29:44,271 --> 00:29:46,664
- Lu--Lucy's brother.

761
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,101
- Yes.

762
00:29:48,144 --> 00:29:49,711
- Mm-hmm.

763
00:29:54,803 --> 00:29:56,370
- That's not possible.

764
00:29:56,413 --> 00:29:57,893
How does he even know who I am?

765
00:29:57,936 --> 00:30:00,069
- Well, he saw you at
the courthouse a few weeks ago,

766
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:01,766
tracked you down;
he's been stalking your family,

767
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,464
and we think he followed you
to the cabin last night.

768
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:05,161
- No, no, no, no.
I can't believe this.

769
00:30:05,205 --> 00:30:06,293
It's been 20 years.

770
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,511
- Mr. Harris,
we'll do everything we can

771
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,773
to protect your family,

772
00:30:08,817 --> 00:30:10,732
but we need you and your wife
to work with us.

773
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,951
- No, no.

774
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:14,866
I can handle it on my own.
Thank you.

775
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,477
- Ben, this guy despises you.

776
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,262
- But if I give him the money
and tell him what happened,

777
00:30:19,306 --> 00:30:20,655
how sorry--

778
00:30:20,698 --> 00:30:22,657
- Then he will probably
kill you and your daughter.

779
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,920
That's the truth.

780
00:30:24,963 --> 00:30:26,356
Either way, we need
to sit down with Rhonda

781
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,401
and explain the risks.
- No! No.

782
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:28,750
She can't know about this.

783
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,317
- That's not our problem.
- You said it earlier.

784
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,101
It's not your decision.
I'm Grace's father.

785
00:30:32,145 --> 00:30:34,669
- And Rhonda is her mother,

786
00:30:34,712 --> 00:30:36,758
and she will get a say
in how this goes down.

787
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,938
We will not let you compromise
your daughter's safety

788
00:30:42,981 --> 00:30:44,766
to protect your secret.
- That's not...

789
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:48,378
That's not what I'm doing.

790
00:30:48,422 --> 00:30:49,814
- Hmm.

791
00:30:51,729 --> 00:30:54,123
- I'm just trying
to get my daughter back.

792
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:55,733
That's all.

793
00:30:55,777 --> 00:30:57,561
- Either you tell her,

794
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,259
or I do.

795
00:31:06,744 --> 00:31:08,746
- Okay, fine.

796
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,313
I'll do it.

797
00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:15,405
- How could you hide this
from me?

798
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:17,407
- Rhonda, it was 20 years ago.
You--

799
00:31:17,451 --> 00:31:19,931
- Is that supposed
to exonerate you?

800
00:31:19,975 --> 00:31:22,369
- No, I just--

801
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:25,415
I wanted to move forward,
to leave it in the past.

802
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:27,243
- It's not in the past, Ben!

803
00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:30,768
That girl's brother
kidnapped our daughter!

804
00:31:30,812 --> 00:31:32,640
- I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.

805
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:33,858
- Sorry?

806
00:31:33,902 --> 00:31:35,469
What the hell good is
that supposed to do?

807
00:31:35,512 --> 00:31:36,905
- Hey.

808
00:31:36,948 --> 00:31:39,255
Mrs. Harris, I know
this is a lot to process,

809
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,170
but right now we need to focus
on getting Grace back.

810
00:31:41,214 --> 00:31:42,258
- He's gonna kill her.
- No.

811
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:43,781
We're not gonna
let that happen.

812
00:31:43,825 --> 00:31:45,479
- But you need to let us
handle the drop.

813
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:46,784
We're gonna have
a team on-site, snipers--

814
00:31:46,828 --> 00:31:48,917
- How could you do this to us?
- Rhonda...

815
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,266
- I need some air.

816
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,354
- This could've waited
until after.

817
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:52,703
- No.
We had no choice.

818
00:31:52,747 --> 00:31:54,618
We had to tell her.

819
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,272
- You don't know that.

820
00:31:56,316 --> 00:31:59,406
- What was that?

821
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:04,976
Damn it.

822
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,239
Rhonda took off.

823
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,155
- She took the phone
and the money.

824
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:11,853
She's gonna do the drop
on her own.

825
00:32:16,982 --> 00:32:18,114
- Rhonda Harris is in the wind.

826
00:32:18,157 --> 00:32:19,680
Left the hotel
with the ransom money

827
00:32:19,724 --> 00:32:20,812
and the phone
they've been using

828
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,161
to communicate with Ray Parkin.

829
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:24,250
He did not relay the location
of the ransom drop

830
00:32:24,294 --> 00:32:25,512
by the time she left,

831
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:26,949
so Ben does not know
where she's going.

832
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:28,254
So what about Ray?

833
00:32:28,298 --> 00:32:29,386
Where are we on the BOLO
with the roommate's car?

834
00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:31,083
- Went out a half hour ago.
No hits yet.

835
00:32:31,127 --> 00:32:33,564
- We cannot let Rhonda
go to a meeting

836
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:34,913
with Ray on her own.

837
00:32:34,957 --> 00:32:36,480
We need a location on her now.

838
00:32:36,523 --> 00:32:38,917
- Hey, OA got a tracker onto
the Harris's car an hour ago.

839
00:32:38,961 --> 00:32:41,528
- Okay, throw it up.

840
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:45,663
- She's heading into the city.

841
00:32:45,706 --> 00:32:48,144
- Hey, Maggie,
Rhonda Harris just crossed

842
00:32:48,187 --> 00:32:49,754
the Cuomo Bridge,
heading south,

843
00:32:49,797 --> 00:32:50,798
Head back toward the city.

844
00:32:50,842 --> 00:32:52,061
We'll keep you updated
as you go.

845
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:09,600
- Hey, Jubal, we're with
Harris's SUV right now.

846
00:33:13,473 --> 00:33:14,997
No sign of Rhonda or the money.

847
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,868
Yeah, we'll call you
when we have something.

848
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,566
- All right, she couldn't
have gotten far on foot.

849
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,481
- We'll take north side.

850
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,280
I just want my baby back.

851
00:33:37,323 --> 00:33:38,629
That's it.

852
00:33:38,672 --> 00:33:40,239
He never told me
about your sister,

853
00:33:40,283 --> 00:33:42,285
and I am so, so sorry.

854
00:33:42,328 --> 00:33:43,764
- I have eyes
on Rhonda and Ray.

855
00:33:43,808 --> 00:33:46,289
Suspect is armed,
corner of Ferris and King.

856
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:47,986
- Okay, stand by.
We're on our way.

857
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,379
- Copy, we're coming
to you now.

858
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:51,468
- I am so, so sorry.

859
00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:54,340
Please, don't punish my baby
for Ben's mistake.

860
00:33:54,384 --> 00:33:56,081
- This isn't how
it was supposed to go down.

861
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,083
Your husband was supposed
to be here, not you.

862
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:00,259
- I thought if you and I
could just talk--

863
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:01,347
- I don't wanna talk to you!

864
00:34:01,391 --> 00:34:03,175
- Okay, I understand
that you're angry,

865
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:04,698
and I don't blame you,

866
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:07,440
but this has nothing to do
with my daughter!

867
00:34:07,484 --> 00:34:09,268
- Shut up!
Just shut up!

868
00:34:09,312 --> 00:34:11,009
- Okay. Okay.
- FBI! Drop your weapon!

869
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,014
- Now.
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

870
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:21,019
No, no!

871
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:22,412
No!
- Hey! Come here.

872
00:34:22,455 --> 00:34:26,155
- No, no, no!
- What did you do?

873
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:28,200
He's the only one who knows
where my daughter is.

874
00:34:28,244 --> 00:34:29,506
- Mrs. Harris,
it's gonna be okay.

875
00:34:29,549 --> 00:34:30,898
We're gonna find her.
I promise.

876
00:34:30,942 --> 00:34:33,162
We are gonna find her.
It's gonna be okay.

877
00:34:48,394 --> 00:34:50,527
- Ray Parkin was killed
at the scene.

878
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,615
Looks like he arrived by foot.

879
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:52,746
No sign of
the roommate's vehicle.

880
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,878
The only lead we have

881
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:55,140
is a key we found
in his pocket.

882
00:34:55,184 --> 00:34:57,229
Number 118.
could be an apartment number,

883
00:34:57,273 --> 00:34:58,578
a hotel room...
- A storage unit?

884
00:34:58,622 --> 00:35:00,189
- Yeah, start digging.

885
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:01,625
See what types of facilities
are within a walking distance

886
00:35:01,668 --> 00:35:02,626
of the meeting spot.

887
00:35:02,669 --> 00:35:04,062
In the meantime,

888
00:35:04,106 --> 00:35:07,283
Scola is sending us data...
from Ray's burner phone.

889
00:35:07,326 --> 00:35:08,719
Here we go.

890
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,070
Uh-huh.

891
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:15,073
- That, I may be able
to work with.

892
00:35:15,117 --> 00:35:17,641
- It's the ransom photo.
- With one key difference:

893
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:20,252
These images aren't cropped
like the one Ray sent Ben.

894
00:35:20,296 --> 00:35:22,428
You can see more
of the background.

895
00:35:22,472 --> 00:35:24,343
- Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

896
00:35:24,387 --> 00:35:25,605
Looks like a hotel room.

897
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:27,129
- Crimes Against Children

898
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:28,869
maintains a database
of hotel rooms.

899
00:35:28,913 --> 00:35:30,480
They use it to
track down sex traffickers.

900
00:35:30,523 --> 00:35:32,003
- Uh-huh, so if we run
the photo of Grace

901
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,439
against that system...

902
00:35:33,483 --> 00:35:34,658
- We might be able to find out
where it was taken.

903
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:36,442
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

904
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:41,186
- We got it.
The Halewood Motel.

905
00:35:55,722 --> 00:35:57,028
- Well,
would you look at that?

906
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:00,379
It's the cutest caterpillar
I ever saw.

907
00:36:00,423 --> 00:36:02,294
- Clear.
- Grace?

908
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:05,819
- Why not?
It's our friend.

909
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,088
Clear.

910
00:36:20,182 --> 00:36:21,792
OA.

911
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:38,591
What the hell
did he do with her?

912
00:36:38,635 --> 00:36:40,202
- He got to the ransom drop
on foot,

913
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:42,552
so he couldn't have
taken her far.

914
00:36:47,644 --> 00:36:49,863
Upstairs is clear.

915
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,432
- Nothing.

916
00:36:55,086 --> 00:36:56,870
- Damn it.

917
00:37:01,484 --> 00:37:03,964
Hey, Tiffany said
Ray's roommate

918
00:37:04,008 --> 00:37:05,270
drives a black Subaru, right?

919
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:06,706
- Yes, she did.

920
00:37:16,238 --> 00:37:18,675
- It's clear.

921
00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:20,590
- No, there's a cover.

922
00:37:23,854 --> 00:37:26,291
I hear something.
Grace?

923
00:37:26,335 --> 00:37:28,250
Grace?

924
00:37:35,605 --> 00:37:37,041
- Grace.

925
00:37:38,608 --> 00:37:41,306
Hi, Grace.
Hi, baby.

926
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,003
You're safe now, okay?

927
00:37:43,047 --> 00:37:44,440
My name is Maggie.

928
00:37:44,483 --> 00:37:47,225
Here, let's sit up.

929
00:37:49,662 --> 00:37:52,361
Oh, your mom and dad are gonna
be so happy to see you.

930
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,406
- She's safe.

931
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,755
We got her.

932
00:37:55,799 --> 00:37:57,104
- We got her.

933
00:37:57,148 --> 00:37:58,410
- Great.

934
00:37:58,454 --> 00:38:00,630
- Oh, beautiful.
- Fantastic.

935
00:38:05,287 --> 00:38:07,463
- Aw, it's okay.

936
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:12,381
- Good stuff, Maggie.

937
00:38:13,643 --> 00:38:15,558
- Oh, thank God.

938
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:23,609
- Oh, my God!
Grace!

939
00:38:23,653 --> 00:38:26,656
Oh, baby.

940
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:30,007
Okay.
You're okay.

941
00:38:33,576 --> 00:38:35,708
Honey.
- You okay?

942
00:38:35,752 --> 00:38:37,057
- Daddy...

943
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:38,842
- Come here.

944
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:02,126
- This is Teresa.
She's nine.

945
00:39:02,169 --> 00:39:05,347
And this little guy is Ernesto,
but we call him Ernie.

946
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,696
He's a character.

947
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:09,089
He's, like, 7 going on 30,
you know what I mean?

948
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:12,136
Beautiful.

949
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:18,055
- I know.

950
00:39:18,098 --> 00:39:20,536
I know that I should've
told you sooner about them,

951
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:23,321
but we were just having
such a good time.

952
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:25,497
I didn't wanna scare you off.

953
00:39:26,455 --> 00:39:28,761
- But they're your kids.

954
00:39:28,805 --> 00:39:30,415
That's such a huge part
of your life.

955
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:31,895
- I know.

956
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:33,288
But you remember
what it was like

957
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:35,028
when we were undercover, right?

958
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,465
It's almost like everything
was heightened,

959
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:38,423
we were living
in this fantasy world,

960
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:39,816
and then the case is over

961
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:43,123
and we're just thrust back
into the real world and...

962
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:44,124
I don't know.

963
00:39:44,168 --> 00:39:45,300
So much time had passed,

964
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:46,518
it just felt weird
to bring it up.

965
00:39:57,181 --> 00:40:00,445
- I've had such a long day.

966
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:03,492
Can we talk about this later?

967
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:05,755
- Yeah, of course.

968
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:09,976
Let's go back to my place.

969
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,849
- Actually...

970
00:40:12,892 --> 00:40:15,939
I think I'm gonna go home
tonight.

971
00:40:18,898 --> 00:40:21,292
- Okay.

972
00:40:22,511 --> 00:40:24,208
I get it.

973
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,346
Mags, I'm sorry.

974
00:40:34,392 --> 00:40:36,829
I know I should've told you.

975
00:40:39,092 --> 00:40:41,660
- See you tomorrow.

975
00:40:42,305 --> 00:41:42,217

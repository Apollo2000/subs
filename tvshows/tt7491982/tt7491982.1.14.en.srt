162
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:35,955
After that, I drove around
looking for him.

163
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,870
I was about to give up when
I saw him walk into the park.

164
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:39,262
And you walked
in right after him.

165
00:07:39,306 --> 00:07:40,655
No.

166
00:07:40,698 --> 00:07:42,352
I drove around
to Central Park West

167
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:44,398
and waited for him
to come out the other side.

168
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:47,096
I just wanted to talk to him,
all right?

169
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,055
But he never showed.
Okay.

170
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:50,578
Then give me a witness
that saw you sitting

171
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:52,188
in your car,
in Central Park West.

172
00:07:52,232 --> 00:07:55,844
I can't.
There was no witness.

173
00:07:55,888 --> 00:07:58,064
First degree murder.
Lying in wait.

174
00:07:58,107 --> 00:08:00,544
Do you have any idea
what's about to happen to you?

175
00:08:00,588 --> 00:08:01,807
Wait.
Wait.

176
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,679
There was somebody.
Who?

177
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:07,856
A jogger.
He came out of the park,

178
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,772
off the path
that I figured McCann was on.

179
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:14,384
- When was that?
- A little after 10:30 maybe.

180
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:15,777
- What did he look like?
- Like a jogger.

181
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:17,997
I don't know.
He was wearing a hoodie.

182
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,651
What color?

183
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:22,740
Dark blue.

184
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:26,962
There's your jogger.

185
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,790
No CCTV footage,
but I did manage

186
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:30,661
to find a restaurant
with security cameras

187
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:33,229
pointed towards the right
stretch of Central Park West.

188
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:35,753
The blue fiber came back
as a cotton-poly blend

189
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:38,713
which is consistent with
the sweatshirt he's wearing,

190
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:42,412
and there's Santos,
from 10:25 to 10:42.

191
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,284
He never left his car.

192
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:45,720
Which alibis him out.

193
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:47,461
I'm starting to wonder.

194
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:49,724
I mean you would expect
a murder like this

195
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,552
to be more rage-filled.

196
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:52,814
You know, with signs
of a beating

197
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:54,642
or gunshot wounds to the face.

198
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:56,209
We have none of that.

199
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:58,080
Maybe the killer
saw Santos' post

200
00:08:58,124 --> 00:09:00,691
and left that message
to throw us off?

201
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:02,258
I was thinking the same thing.

202
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:04,217
In fact, aspects of this
remind me of a case

203
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,871
I was consulting on last year.

204
00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:07,611
What case?

205
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:10,179
The death of a Michigan state
senator, in Lansing.

206
00:09:10,223 --> 00:09:12,181
I read that.
A mugging gone wrong?

207
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:14,140
Well, those were
the official findings,

208
00:09:14,183 --> 00:09:16,794
but this guy had
some really shady dealings,

209
00:09:16,838 --> 00:09:20,276
and I always thought that
the murder was more planned.

210
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,104
Do you think we're dealing
with the same killer?

211
00:09:22,148 --> 00:09:23,714
I don't know,
but the senator died

212
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:25,542
from a single shot to the heart,

213
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:28,632
and a jogger was caught
on video fleeing the scene.

214
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:31,331
Here's the jogger
from the Michigan case.

215
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:36,292
I mean it could be the same guy.

216
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:38,077
Yeah, but he's wearing
a hoodie too.

217
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,687
You can't tell.

218
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,604
Unless we compare the gaits.

219
00:09:43,647 --> 00:09:45,867
We have a software that can
analyze

220
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:47,869
the biomechanics
of how he moves.

221
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:50,350
Your gait can be as unique
as your fingerprint.

222
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:06,279
91% match.

223
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:09,021
The Michigan jogger and
the Central Park West jogger...

224
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:10,848
They're the same person.

225
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:14,417
Looks to me like Rob McCann's
murder was a professional hit.

226
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:23,504
People, please turn your hymnals

227
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:25,811
to section 1958
of the federal code

228
00:10:25,854 --> 00:10:28,378
with the snappy title
"Murder for Hire."

229
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:30,206
We now believe McCann's killer
is a pro

230
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,253
who also took out a state
senator in Lansing last year.

231
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:35,690
Quantico's video analysis
indicates that the suspect

232
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:38,258
is a white male,
30 to 40's, 6" tall.

233
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:39,912
Let's call Lansing area hotels.

234
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:41,391
Get the names of the guests
that checked out

235
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:43,089
right after
the senator's murder.

236
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:44,786
Our guy may be on that list.

237
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,572
I was doing my residency
at St. Luke's

238
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:51,706
when Rob was embedded
with the Marines in Fallujah.

239
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,275
That's when I was terrified
I'd lose him.

240
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:59,453
Not now.
Not here.

241
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:01,237
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

242
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:05,328
We're very sorry for your loss.

243
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:13,815
So someone hired this man to...

244
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:15,469
Why?
Over something Rob wrote?

245
00:11:15,512 --> 00:11:17,036
We're not sure yet.

246
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:18,733
Did he have any issues
with drugs? Gambling?

247
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:20,343
No. Nothing like that.

248
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:23,869
Has he been worried lately
or concerned?

249
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:26,219
If anything, he was excited

250
00:11:26,262 --> 00:11:28,090
about a new story
he was working on.

251
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:29,657
What story?

252
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:32,617
He wasn't ready to talk
about it yet.

253
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,748
He said it was the sort of thing

254
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,794
that could win a Pulitzer.

255
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:38,797
Most reporters keep notebooks.

256
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,189
Did your husband have one?

257
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,844
- Yes.
- Is it here?

258
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:45,804
- He carried it with him.
- It wasn't found on his body.

259
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:47,457
Are you sure?

260
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:49,634
Rob never went anywhere
without his notebook.

261
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,248
That's significant, isn't it?

262
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:57,903
It might be.

263
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:00,035
Do you have any idea why he was
in the park last night?

264
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,472
I don't know exactly.

265
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:04,083
When we talked on the phone,
he did say

266
00:12:04,126 --> 00:12:06,302
he was planning
to meet with a source.

267
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:08,435
A source on this news story?

268
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,177
Yes, I think so.

269
00:12:13,962 --> 00:12:15,921
I talked to Rob's editor
and his colleagues.

270
00:12:15,964 --> 00:12:17,705
He didn't tell them
about the story either.

271
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:19,707
Well, whatever it is,
I think it's the key to this.

272
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:21,578
What does his browser
history show?

273
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:23,929
Mostly stuff for articles
he had in the pipeline,

274
00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:27,062
except for some searches
on pediatric oncology.

275
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:29,717
Does Rob have a kid
in his circle who has cancer?

276
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:31,023
Not that we can find.

277
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,851
Okay.
What about this source?

278
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:35,201
Any phone calls that point
to who that might be?

279
00:12:35,244 --> 00:12:37,290
Rob did get some calls
from a burner phone,

280
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,161
but we're still trying to trace
who it belongs to.

281
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:41,207
And Rob McCann's autopsy
report just dropped.

282
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,731
Looks like he had
a 0.07 blood alcohol level.

283
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:45,646
Okay, so he met
his source for drinks.

284
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,343
That is my takeaway.

285
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:49,519
Could you put any
of those drinks on a card?

286
00:12:49,563 --> 00:12:51,260
No.
It looks like he paid cash.

287
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:55,134
He withdrew $100 from an ATM
on 67th and Columbus.

288
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:56,744
Can you shoot us over a list

289
00:12:56,788 --> 00:12:58,180
of all the bars
and restaurants in the area?

290
00:12:58,224 --> 00:12:59,747
Hold on. I might not need to.

291
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,662
Checking past credit
card charges.

292
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:05,535
I see two visits to a bar
a block away from that ATM.

293
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:10,105
Yeah, I remember him.
He sat right over there.

294
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:12,194
Ordered two glasses of pinot.

295
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:16,285
Hey, my shift just ended.
Is this gonna take long?

296
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,070
It will with that attitude.

297
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:20,681
Who was he with?
He was alone.

298
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:23,075
It seemed like he was waiting
for someone, but nobody showed,

299
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:24,729
so he paid up and split.

300
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:26,339
Anybody come in after he left?

301
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:29,037
Maybe looking for him?
Nope.

302
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:30,647
There was a guy.

303
00:13:30,691 --> 00:13:32,388
- What guy?
- He was at the bar.

304
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:34,782
When pinot left,
he left right after him.

305
00:13:34,826 --> 00:13:36,828
Do you have security cameras?

306
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:40,614
Just the one pointed
at the till to keep us honest.

307
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:42,050
The guy at the bar.

308
00:13:42,094 --> 00:13:44,487
Have you seen him before?
Maybe a regular?

309
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:46,620
Definitely not a regular.

310
00:13:46,663 --> 00:13:49,014
Why are you so sure?

311
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:51,712
He tried to play a song
on the jukebox.

312
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:53,845
The regulars know
it hasn't worked in months.

313
00:13:55,498 --> 00:13:57,849
The bad news is there's
no cameras outside the bar,

314
00:13:57,892 --> 00:13:59,807
so we couldn't get eyes
on whoever followed McCann,

315
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:02,418
but here's the good news:
ERT lifted a primo print

316
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:04,638
off the jukebox's coin
return button

317
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:06,858
belonging to one

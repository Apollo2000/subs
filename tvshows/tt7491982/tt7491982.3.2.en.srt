I, um...

I got, uh...

1133
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,382
I got wasted that night.

1134
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:58,145
And--and, um, blacked out
and woke up the next morning

1135
00:40:58,179 --> 00:41:00,181
in my driveway

And now, there was a, uh,

a big dent in the front end

1139

with--with blood.

- Geez, I...

1141
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:14,264
- Lots of blood.

No...

1144
00:41:19,753 --> 00:41:21,996
It was probably an animal.

1145
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,172
You know?

1146
00:41:27,174 --> 00:41:30,039
Had to be an animal.

Anyway, that is
when I first went to AA.

really went to pieces.

I'm okay now.

I'm sober.

Good with the ex,
good with the kids, so...

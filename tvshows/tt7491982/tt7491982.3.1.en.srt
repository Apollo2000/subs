2
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:29,464
- Allie, please, I'm not
saying you're a bad person.

3
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:31,901
- Oh, but I'm a racist?
How can you say that?

4
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:33,076
- Because you're white.

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,730
- So you're a racist too?

6
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:35,731
- Of course.

7
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:37,124
So is every otherwell-intentioned

8
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:38,473
"woke" millennial in Brooklyn.

9
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:40,562
- Okay, I know I'm new and all,
Spencer, but I--

10
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:42,694
- No, it's not an accusationor an insult.

11
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:43,913
It's just a fact.

12
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:46,785
- Okay, so, let's pretend
for the moment

13
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,571
anyway that I agree
with your premise.

14
00:00:49,614 --> 00:00:51,312
Hey, Vicky.
- Hey.

15
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:53,270
- That all white people
are racist.

16
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:56,143
Now what?
What's the next step?

17
00:00:56,186 --> 00:01:00,103
What do we, the decent, kind,
unintentional racists,

18
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:01,626
actually do about it?

19
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,803
- We should discussthis more in depth tonight.

20
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:07,067
Over dinner.
- Are you asking me on a date?

21
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,285
- Yeah, if that's okay.

22
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:09,504
I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

23
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:11,984
- No, dinner sounds fun.

24
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:13,986
Still think your theory
is ridiculous.

25
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,858
Okay.

26
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:17,033
- Oh, my God.

27
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:19,688
What the hell's--
oh, my God!

28
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:20,863
- Run!

29
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:36,008
- Well, we're glad
you're here, Tiffany.

30
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:37,532
- I'm glad to be here.

31
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:38,837
White Collar was fun and all,

32
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:41,101
but I didn't join the FBIto arrest accountants.

33
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:42,537
Right.

34
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,713
- By the way, what kind of nameis "Jubal"?

35
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:47,455
- "Jubal," it is--
well, it's, I guess a tribute

36
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:50,458
to my grandfather, theHonorable Jubal N. Valentine.

37
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:53,156
- Oh, it's like that.

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,462
Yeah, I guess.

39
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:56,551
Ah, so here, Stuart Scola.

40
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:58,335
This is your new partner,Tiffany Wallace.

41
00:01:58,379 --> 00:01:59,858
- Oh.Nice to meet you.

42
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,338
I thought you were startingnext week.

43
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:02,992
- I got settled in a little
earlier than I thought.

44
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:05,560
- Great, well, looking forward
to working with you.

45
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,083
- Yeah, Tiffany spenttwo years in Atlanta

46
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,781
working white-collar, but she
grew up here in Brooklyn.

47
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:11,914
- Bed Stuy.
Thrilled to be back.

48
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:14,090
- Oh, Tiffany, this is--
- Hey, I'm Omar.

49
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,310
These guys call me "OA."

50
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:18,399
- Okay, listen up.
I just got a call.

51
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:20,096
There's been a mass shooting
in Greenpoint.

52
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,489
I want all hands on deck.

53
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:23,665
- Just like that.

54
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:34,154
- Maggie Bell.

55
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:35,198
Hey.

56
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:37,766
- You're back?
- Yeah, I am.

57
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:40,421
We bump elbows or something?What are we doing?

58
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:43,119
- No, I think we can hug.
- Right.

59
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:49,386
Come on!

60
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:52,650
- So how did the undercover
gig go?

61
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:54,348
- Fine.

62
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:57,133
- Did you close the case?
- I made 16 arrests.

63
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,439
- Sounds like a home run.

64
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:01,268
- Look, I'm just happy
to be back here with you.

65
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:02,965
Playing "Maggie Bell" again.

66
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:06,621
I mean, it's not as glamorous
pretending to be somebody 24/7.

67
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:08,100
- But everything went well?

68
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:10,407
- Got the job done.
- What does that mean?

69
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,540
- It means that I'm ready
to move forward

70
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,324
and start a new chapter.

71
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:18,328
- Still need to be in control.
Copy that.

72
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,510
- So, how'd you like
"Hotlanta"?

73
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,470
- It was okay.

74
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:33,952
A little too Southern for me,but I had fun.

75
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:37,391
And just so you know, nobodycalls it "Hotlanta" anymore.

76
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:39,044
- Oh.

77
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:40,524
Got it.

78
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:42,483
It's the first time
I ever said it, too.

79
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,661
So why'd you leave NYPD?

80
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:49,098
- Man, I feel like I'm
on a bad first date!

81
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,753
- Oh.
Okay, I'm sorry.

82
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,322
Didn't mean to...

83
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:57,411
I thought "Hotlanta" would be
the most awkward moment

84
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:58,586
of the morning.

85
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:01,502
- Sorry, I'm just...

86
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:04,809
sometimes I'm justa little bit too blunt.

87
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:09,292
I left the NYPD
because I needed a change.

88
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:12,339
I got tired of talkingabout the Yankees,

89
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:15,298
the blue wall and hanging outat dive bars

90
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,648
called O'Sullivan'sand Murphy's.

91
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:21,913
- For the record,

92
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:24,916
I'm half Irish.

93
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,664
- Get a uniform to escort you.

94
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,579
- Right over here.

95
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,761
- Maggie Bell.
- Tiffany Wallace.

96
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:45,720
- Good to meet you.
- So what do we know?

97
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:47,548
- We've got four dead,
all in their 20s.

98
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:49,419
We've got two men, both white.

99
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:51,334
Two women.
One white, one Asian.

100
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:52,379
- Any witnesses?

101
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,337
- A few, but theydidn't see much.

102
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:55,338
The shooters
were wearing masks.

103
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:56,731
- We recover the casings?

104
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:58,385
- Yeah, we know the shooters
were using Krinkovs.

105
00:04:58,428 --> 00:04:59,603
- Have you found
the shooters yet?

106
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:00,996
- Excuse me, sir,
can you back up?

107
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,302
- This is my company.

108
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:03,912
Those four people in body bagsare my employees.

109
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,261
I have a right to knowwhat's going on.

110
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,742
- You're absolutely right.
Let's take a walk.

111
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:10,266
We'll find a quiet place
we can talk.

112
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,748
- All right, come on in!
Just talked to Maggie.

113
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,010
Here's what we know so far.

114
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:17,273
We got two shooters,
both firing Krinkovs.

115
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,668
Four victims, all journalists
at Echt Media.

116
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:23,148
- Known for its progressive
political commentary

117
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:25,107
and disruptive social ideas.

118
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,717
- Right.
They're liberal--most likely

119
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:28,589
extremely liberal, which means
we need to start digging

120
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:30,025
into right-wing hate groups.

121
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:32,332
Pull security cam footage
within a two-block radius.

122
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,812
Get to work, let's talk
to each other, people!

123
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:35,813
- Hey.

124
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:37,119
So Maggie and OAare on the scene.

125
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:38,860
Scola and Tiffanyare canvassing for witnesses,

126
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:41,297
but so far no actionable leads.

127
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,603
But dock is hot, so...

128
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:45,170
- Great, thanks.
- Yeah.

129
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:46,955
Oh, hey, uh...

130
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,915
Got a text from Kristen.She's moving to Dallas, huh?

131
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,003
- Yeah.

132
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:54,354
Yeah, she wanted
a change of scenery.

133
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,007
It's her decision.

134
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:57,879
- Right.

135
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:00,621
Okay, well... as long
as she's happy, I guess.

136
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:03,275
- She is.

137
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:07,018
- I wasn't awareof any specific threats,

138
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:09,412
but we do get hundreds ofnon-specific threats every day.

139
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:10,761
- Well, what do you mean
by that?

140
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,633
- Well, there's so much hatein the air.

141
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:14,069
No matter what you say,the other side is constantly

142
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:16,158
on the attack,
and it's personal.

143
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:18,639
You know, it used to be all
this political and social

144
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:20,336
vitriol was just rhetoric.

145
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,730
Now it's like we are actually
on the verge of a civil war.

146
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:24,253
- Well, have you posted
anything controversial

147
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,646
the past few days?

148
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:27,822
Anything that would agitate
a certain political

149
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:29,693
or ethnic group?
- It's our goal to publish

150
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:31,391
something controversial
every day.

151
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:32,914
It's our business model.

152
00:06:32,957 --> 00:06:35,177
I'm happy to answerany other questions you have,

153
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,526
but I should go.

154
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,832
I need to talk
to the employees.

155
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,487
- Okay, sir, that's not how--
- Hey.

156
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,488
Just got a textfrom my informant.

157
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:42,706
He may have a lead.

158
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,974
- You guys out here
when the shooting went down?

159
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:51,411
Excuse me.

160
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:53,891
I asked you a question.
- Yeah, I ain't answering.

161
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:56,198
- Did you hear
any gunshots, sir?

162
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:58,896
- Man, you deaf?
I just said I ain't talking!

163
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,551
- You ain't talking, why?
'Cause you're a tough guy?

164
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,118
- 'Cause you're the police.

165
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:05,294
- No, we're the FBI.

166
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:06,687
So let me ask you again.

167
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,862
Were you out here
when the shooting went down?

168
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:10,299
Yes or no?
- No.

169
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:12,040
- Aw, look at you.

170
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,824
Trying to be all hard
and make a statement.

171
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:15,783
- You don't know a damn
thing about me, lady.

172
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:18,307
- One, don't call me "lady."

173
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,918
Two, I know a lot about you.

174
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:24,226
Like that tattoo on your arm?
"BMW"?

175
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:26,446
Means you roll
with Brooklyn's Most Wanted,

176
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:28,317
which means you're connected
to the Trey-Nine Crips,

177
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,798
which means you probably
grew up in Brownsville.

178
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:34,192
I'm guessing the Tilden Street
Housing Projects.

179
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:39,415
Another thing you should know,
Jalen,

180
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,244
is that lying to me ain't like
lying to some fat dude

181
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:44,289
in a blue uniform.

182
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,900
It's a felony.

183
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:48,293
You do time behind that crap.

184
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:51,862
So the second
I walk away from here,

185
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,255
I'ma pull every piece
of surveillance footage

186
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:54,691
I can find.

187
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:57,477
And if I see your sorry butt
out here at 8:27 a.m.,

188
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,130
I'ma charge you with perjury.

189
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:01,785
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.

190
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:03,570
Look, I was here.

191
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:06,224
I--I heard the gunshots.
- Then what?

192
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:10,098
- I saw two dudes wearing masks
jump into a blue car.

193
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:12,317
- What kind of car?
- I'm not sure.

194
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:15,799
A sedan?
Kia, maybe?

195
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:20,151
- It was nice doing business
with you, Jalen.

196
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:28,420
- Nice work back there.

197
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:30,118
But you didn't need
to jump in like that.

198
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:32,512
I had everything under control.

199
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,209
- Oh, my bad.

200
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:36,037
I just reacted.

201
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,780
I knew who that dude was, what
buttons to press, so I did it.

202
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,259
But I'm sorry
if I offended you.

203
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:42,478
- No big deal.

204
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,959
Just thought I'd, you know...say something.

205
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:46,613
- I'm glad you did.

206
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:48,745
But for the record, Scola...

207
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:50,747
if you got a problem
with people speaking up,

208
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,575
if you got a lot of rules
about when and how

209
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:55,926
I'm supposed to talk to people,
you should let me know.

210
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,843
Now.
'Cause I don't roll like that.

211
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:01,758
- Well, neither do I.

212
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:04,369
So you got nothing
to worry about.

213
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,157
And I'd preferif you call me "Stuart."

214
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:12,987
- I'll let Jubal know
about the blue Kia.

215
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,774
- Hey.

216
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:19,384
- I'm sorry to bother you, man.

217
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:23,911
But I'm just--
I'm sorta freaking.

218
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:25,913
I was working last nightat that biker bar.

219
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:27,305
I was talking to these twodudes I know.

220
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:30,308
I've been working real hardthe past few weeks!

221
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:33,660
Anyway, they start talkingabout doing some crazy stuff.

222
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:35,009
Okay?Um...

223
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:36,271
"Making noise."They kept saying that.

224
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:38,316
"We're gonna makesome noise, bro."

225
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,796
I tried to find out what theywere talking about, but--

226
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,842
- You know these guys' names?

227
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:43,278
- Tyler and Eddie.

228
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:44,714
I don't know their last names.Didn't ask.

229
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:46,673
You told me, "Never askfor last names.

230
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:49,371
They'll think you're a cop."

231
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:52,809
I think it's possible thoseguys might have been involved

232
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:54,245
in that shooting this morning.

233
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:55,856
- What do you mean, "involved"?

234
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,641
- The guy who drove the car...

235
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,904
he was at the bar this morning.

236
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,734
- What the hell
are you talking about?

237
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,344
- He came by the bar
an hour ago.

238
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:07,955
He was real nervous.

239
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,783
He said he was driving a stolen
car with these two idiots,

240
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,132
Tyler and Eddie,

241
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:12,916
and then they jumped out
and started shooting.

242
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,222
- Who's this guy?

243
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:17,268
- He goes by Big Mike.
That's all I know.

244
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:18,879
- Big Mike, okay.

245
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:20,576
So I'm a little confused.

246
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,708
Bike Mike, he just came in

247
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,318
and volunteered
this info to you?

248
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:26,538
- I'm just telling youwhat happened, Omar.

249
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:27,801
But Big Mike's a good dude;

250
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:30,325
he didn't know they were
gonna start shooting.

251
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:34,851
- He didn't know?

252
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:36,592
Those guys
were carrying Krinkovs.

253
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,985
- He was scared.

254
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:39,377
- I would be, too,
but it doesn't matter

255
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,466
that he was scared.
He was involved.

256
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,555
So you need to go
find this guy now.

257
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,427
- Okay, I'll try, but--

258
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,951
he said he was going to Floridaor maybe Georgia?

259
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:53,609
Ugh!
- If you're really this upset,

260
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,394
why don't you go track down Big
Mike and get me a last name?

261
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:02,270
- You got it, Omar.

262
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:06,883
- Okay.

263
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,106
By the way,
talked to my buddy in D.C.

264
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,282
He might be able
to find you a job.

265
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:16,066
A real one.

266
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,460
- Appreciate you
looking out.

267
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:23,030
- Okay, Zayne.

268
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:25,946
- Where are we on the names?
Tyler? Eddie? Big Mike?

269
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:27,817
Ring any bells with you guys?Narcotics, prison gangs?

270
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,297
- Still running screens,

271
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,951
but there are lots
of Eddies and Tylers out there.

272
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:32,169
Only a few "Big Mikes."

273
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:33,780
but nine match
the physical description.

274
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:35,129
- All right.What about the shooters' car,

275
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,783
the blue Kia?We have any video yet?

276
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:38,741
- Just pulled some footage
from a camera two blocks away.

277
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,656
- Okay, throw it up.

278
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,704
Hey.
- Yeah, running the plate now.

279
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:50,622
Okay, car is registered
to Nancy Moore, 53.

280
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:55,453
Address is 234 87th Street
in Williamsburg.

281
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:58,152
Car was reported stolen
at 7:47 this morning.

282
00:11:58,195 --> 00:11:59,283
- There you go.
Reach out to Nancy,

283
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:00,415
find out where the car
was stolen,

284
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,808
pull any security footage
in the area,

285
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:02,809
you know the drill.
- Yeah, on it.

286
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:04,724
- All right, roll it.

287
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:09,685
- The crime scene is two
blocks east of this.

288
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,688
- Yeah, can you push in
on the driver's face?

289
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:39,759
- The driver
is your informant?

290
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:40,934
- Yes, I just met with him.

291
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:42,326
He thought he might know
who was involved.

292
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,719
- But he never mentioned
that he was at the scene.

293
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,721
Or the fact that he
was driving the getaway car.

294
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,853
Correct.

295
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:48,289
- All right,so what was he doing?

296
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:50,857
He was playing.
Fishing for information, right?

297
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,120
- No, maybe fishing
for absolution?

298
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:54,382
- How do you mean?

299
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:56,036
- He was nervous,
talking in circles.

300
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,212
He made up a story
about a guy named "Big Mike"

301
00:12:58,255 --> 00:13:00,040
that was stealing a car
and driving around

302
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,389
with two other guys.

303
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:03,043
He didn't know
they were gonna start shooting.

304
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:05,001
He was probably just trying to
get close to the two shooters,

305
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:06,046
prove that he wasn't a cop.

306
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:07,047
- It doesn't matter.

307
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,527
Just get him in here.
Now.

308
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:11,051
- All right.

309
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:18,101
- Zayne, it's me, Omar.

310
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:19,624
Again, listen, man.
You gotta give me a call back.

311
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,757
I just got a call
from my buddy in D.C.

312
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,020
He said that there may be
an opening here in New York

313
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:25,674
for a surveillance specialist.

314
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:27,241
He wants to know if he
can meet with you today,

315
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:28,895
so just get back to me,
let me know.

316
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,505
All right.

317
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:31,723
His phone's off.

318
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,508
The calls keep going
straight to voicemail.

319
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:36,337
- Well, of course his
phone's off; he's on the run.

320
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,644
- Yeah, maybe.
But he's not a killer, Maggie.

321
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:45,215
I know what it looks like,
but he's a decent human being.

322
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,261
I mean, I met himat an anti-Muslim rally,

323
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:49,045
but he was just theremarching with a bunch of Arabs.

324
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:50,655
He wants to help.

325
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:52,614
He doesn't even care about,
getting paid, like, for real.

326
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:54,572
There is no way that he
would willingly participate

327
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:57,140
in a mass shooting.
- Okay.

328
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:02,363
- Maggie.
- Hey.

329
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:04,800
I thought you were
taking the week off.

330
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,628
- I thought you were too.

331
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:08,282
- This is Omar Zidan.

332
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,414
This is Nestor, who I workedthe undercover case with.

333
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,852
- Oh.
Nice to meet you.

334
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,375
Congratulations, I heard you
guys had some good results.

335
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:16,290
- We did well.
I had a lot of fun, too.

336
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,900
- I don't know if "fun"is the word I would use.

337
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:19,336
- She tends
to overthink things.

338
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,903
- Do I?

339
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,601
- Good to meet you, Omar.
Talk soon.

340
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:30,260
- Is he a good guy?
- He's a good agent.

341
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:32,741
Lead hostage negotiator.Runs Gang Unit.

342
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:35,744
- I asked if he was a good guy.
- He's all right.

343
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,702
A little too cocky for me.

344
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,618
- Zayne, it's me, Omar.
Open up!

345
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:43,404
Zayne!
Anybody home?

346
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:44,971
- Okay, we needto get a warrant.

347
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:46,798
- No, we don't

348
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:50,324
because there is
a spare key.

349
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,761
Right here, see?
Told you he was a good kid.

350
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:54,371
He trusts me.

351
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,941
Zayne, you home?

352
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,990
- Clear.

353
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,958
- OA?

354
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:20,571
- Oh, my God.

355
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,974
- Either Zayne's a really
diligent informant,

356
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:33,715
or he's involved.

357
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:37,893
Hey, Jubal?
I just sent you some photos.

358
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,417
Can you put them through
facial rec right away?

359
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:43,551
- I got two names:
Tyler Haddock and Eddie White.

360
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:44,813
- Somebody tell me about 'em.

361
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:46,206
- Haddock has three priors

362
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:47,642
originating from Plainfield,
New Jersey.

363
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:49,687
And the other guy, White,
has five priors

364
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:50,993
born and raised
in Staten Island.

365
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:52,038
- Gang affiliations?

366
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,300
- Looks like they're affiliated

367
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,518
with a group called
"Freedom Fighters."

368
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:55,824
- Okay, let's get
an address for these two.

369
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:57,086
Kelly, can you run
the surveillance video

370
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,783
from the warehouse back again?

371
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,263
Let's confirm
that Tyler and Haddock

372
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:03,092
are the two guys
leaving the scene.

373
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:05,442
- Okay, Haddock is 6'2",
White is 5'9".

374
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:08,228
Ford Fusion is...
- Is 57.7 inches.

375
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:10,795
That's four feet 10 inches?

376
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,276
- Okay, so, using the car
as a reference point,

377
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,713
that means the scale
is 11.9 inches.

378
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:19,587
Which means, Man 1,
White, is about 5'9".

379
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,591
And Man 2,
Haddock, is about 6'1".

380
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:25,506
- All right, that's close
enough, but we need more.

381
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:28,248
Can we zoom in?
See if we can find something.

382
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,119
What do we got?

383
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:32,339
What is that?
I think we got a tattoo.

384
00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:34,080
Yeah, let's see
if he's got this tattoo.

385
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:36,125
"488."
Does that mean anything?

386
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:37,953
- No, but "1488" does.

387
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,955
Maybe there's a "1" under
the sleeve we can't see?

388
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,913
- Okay, let's assume there is.
What's it mean?

389
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:45,482
- The "14" stands for a 14-word
white supremacy slogan.

390
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,441
"We must secure
the existence of our people

391
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:49,443
and a future
for white children."

392
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:51,097
The "88" is code
for "Heil Hitler."

393
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,143
Eight equals "H," eighth letter
of the alphabet, so...

394
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:56,363
- Yeah, it's a match.
"1488."

395
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:57,625
It's among the listed tattoos

396
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:59,148
documented in Haddock's
last arrest.

397
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:00,193
- Get SWAT over there
right away.

398
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:02,978
I'll call Maggie and OA.
Good work.

399
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,073
- On you. Ready?

400
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:13,206
FBI!

401
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,645
- High-tech, 12:00!

402
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:21,605
- Come on, Scotty!

403
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:23,303
- Let's go!

404
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:24,826
- Zayne's going out the back!

405
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,567
We got two on the run!

406
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,221
- Zayne!
- Don't move!

407
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:34,879
- FBI!
Stop, stop!

408
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:36,142
Stop!

409
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:44,324
- OA, over there.
- Go, go, go!

410
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:45,803
I got him!

411
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:48,763
Scola, he's gone.

412
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:52,114
- Zayne!

413
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,637
Zayne, ugh!

414
00:17:57,641 --> 00:18:00,427
Zayne!
What are you doing?

415
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:05,736
Who the hell are you?

416
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,782
- Connor Lang.

417
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:17,835
- I told you, I had nothing
to do with that shooting.

418
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,533
- So why were youwith the two idiots who did?

419
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,100
- I stopped over
to have a beer.

420
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,623
- Why, to celebrate?

421
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,885
- It says here
that you're an associate

422
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:25,626
of the "Freedom Fighters,"
is that true?

423
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:28,150
- Yeah, but that don't mean
I shoot people.

424
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,413
I was at home in bed
when that shooting happened.

425
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:32,111
I didn't leave my apartment
till noon.

426
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,548
I drove over to Gino's Pizza.
Go check for yourself.

427
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:36,027
There's a lot of cameras
in my building.

428
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:37,420
- Okay, we will.So...

429
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:39,335
You want us to believethat you just so happened

430
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:40,597
to go over to those guys' house

431
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:42,425
the same day they killedfour innocent people?

432
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,166
- You really want to know?
- Yeah, I do.

433
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,734
- I stopped over to see if
Eddie could fix my oil pump.

434
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:48,518
He's real good with engines.
- I feel like you

435
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,564
can do better than that, man.
- It's the truth!

436
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,174
- Look, I had no idea they went
over to Echt's

437
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:54,568
and started shooting people.
None.

438
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,137
Did what they had to do,
I guess.

439
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,573
- Sir, what did you just say?

440
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,272
"They did what they had to do"?

441
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:07,102
They killed fourinnocent people.

442
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,409
- If you work at Echt Media,
you ain't innocent.

443
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:10,888
They're the cause
for all this nonsense.

444
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:13,239
All they do is celebrate
the gays and the Blacks.

445
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:14,718
Talking about
how great they are

446
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,068
and how evil and stupid we are.

447
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:21,464
- You know who this guy is?
- Yeah, it's Zayne.

448
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:22,857
- He in your little club too?

449
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,988
"Freedom Fighters"?

450
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:27,253
- Yeah, I don't know.
I never asked.

451
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:28,558
But that dude's crazy.

452
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,125
Works over at this biker bar.

453
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,694
He's always talking trash
about Blacks, Puerto Ricans...

454
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:35,696
Arabs.

455
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,786
- Is that it?
- Mm.

456
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:46,533
So, what, can I go now?

457
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,933
- OA?

458
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:58,327
- He still won't return
my calls or my texts.

459
00:19:58,371 --> 00:19:59,937
- He's not going to respond.

460
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,636
Why are you asking
so surprised?

461
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,029
- Because I've known this kid
for two years.

462
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:06,683
He's a great informant.

463
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:08,598
And yeah, he's a little crazy
and he takes risks

464
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,209
but he gets results
and until this morning,

465
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:13,429
he has never lied to me.
Ever.

466
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:15,083
So forgive me
for being surprised

467
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:16,650
that he keeps blowing me off.

468
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:21,350
- Look, OA, I knowthat this has been hard, but...

469
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:22,830
obviously Zaynehas been hanging out

470
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:24,658
with these white supremacists,listening to their gripes,

471
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,616
their speeches.
- Yeah, so?

472
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,052
- Yeah, well,maybe their way of thinking

473
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:29,663
is starting to rub off.

474
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:32,927
Look, it is not easy lyingall day every day

475
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,277
pretending to be somebodythat you're not.

476
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,018
- I don't know who you think
you're talking to, Maggie.

477
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:39,803
I've been undercover.
Zayne did not flip.

478
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:40,978
No way.

479
00:20:41,022 --> 00:20:43,938
- Okay, let me try thisanother way then.

480
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:47,420
I think you needto sit this one out.

481
00:20:47,463 --> 00:20:48,943
- What the hell
are you talking about?

482
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:51,467
- You're too investedin Zayne's innocence.

483
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:52,729
It's blocking your judgement.

484
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:55,776
- Mm, no.
I'm good.

485
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:57,995
- Hey.

486
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,519
Did you guys getany useful information

487
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:00,694
about this Connor guy?

488
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:03,000
- Yeah.
We know he's a lunatic racist

489
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:05,525
who needs a new oil pump.
That's about it.

490
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,048
- And your informant?
Did you locate him?

491
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:08,876
- No.

492
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:10,878
- Wrong answer.
I just talked to DHS.

493
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:12,575
There's a lot of chatter
about a second attack

494
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:15,404
and it is coming
from the Freedom Fighters.

495
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:18,581
We need to find
your informant fast.

496
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:31,942
- Mr. Wells, we're looking
for your son, Zayne.

497
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:33,248
It's important.

498
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,902
- What's going on?
Did he do something wrong?

499
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:36,860
- We think he may have
inadvertently gotten himself

500
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:39,863
mixed up with some
dangerous people.

501
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:42,170
- Well, Zayne was here
about an hour ago.

502
00:21:42,213 --> 00:21:43,389
He was all over the place.

503
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:44,564
Pacing, talkinga mile a minute.

504
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:45,826
He wanted money.

505
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:47,958
Said he needed to move,buy a new phone.

506
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:49,090
- A new phone?

507
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:50,352
Has he called you
from that phone yet?

508
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:51,614
Yeah, like five minutes ago.

509
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:53,877
- Okay, could you give him
a call back?

510
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:55,792
Actually, could you
video chat him?

511
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:00,275
I just need you to say hello.

512
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,757
- Zayne?
- Hey, Dad.

513
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,672
- Hey, Zayne.
- Omar?

514
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:07,238
- What is going on?
- Hey, man.

515
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:08,675
- We know that you
were driving the car.

516
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:10,067
- I had no idea
those two dudes

517
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:11,242
were gonna
start shooting, man.

518
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:13,157
I swear to God!
- Okay, I believe you,

519
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:14,985
but you need to tell me
what is happening.

520
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:18,337
- I stole the car to try to
get in tight with those guys.

521
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,599
You know, I was trying
to sell my cover.

522
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:20,948
They were getting suspicious!

523
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:23,385
So I did what you told me
to do, you know?

524
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:25,692
Prove them wrong.
Act like a criminal, so I did.

525
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:27,433
And then...

526
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:30,349
and then they had me drive
to that warehouse in Brooklyn.

527
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:33,482
- Okay, I get it.
You were just doing your job.

528
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:35,528
But, look, stuff like this
is gonna happen.

529
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:37,443
- Are you gonna arrest me?

530
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:38,966
- Zayne, I didn't say that.

531
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:41,229
- A few hours ago, you said
the driver was involved.

532
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:42,970
And that he might as well
have pulled the trigger!

533
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:44,624
- Zayne, I am going
to help you,

534
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:47,061
but we need to meet up now.

535
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:51,239
- Meet me at the corner of,
uh... of Noble and West.

536
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:53,067
I'll be there in, like,
10 minutes, okay?

537
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,024
- Okay.

538
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:55,678
Thank you so much.
- Look!

539
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:57,288
I don't know what the hell
he got himself into,

540
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:58,725
but he's a good kid.

541
00:22:58,768 --> 00:23:00,596
He was so excited when he knew

542
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,033
you were trying to get him
a legitimate job.

543
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,341
Please?

544
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,561
Don't hurt my son.

545
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:17,308
- Oh, I got him.

546
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:20,094
He's two blocks east of here
heading east on Milton.

547
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,141
Zayne!

548
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,948
- FBI, do not move!

549
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:49,732
- Why are you running, Zayne?
Huh?

550
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:52,387
- Hey, hey, let her go!
- Hey!

551
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,910
- Nobody come inside.

552
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:55,912
- Don't do this, Zayne!
Do not do this!

553
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:58,480
- I'll shoot everyone in here!
I swear to God!

554
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,833
- What do we got?

555
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:06,401
- Seven hostages in total.
All appear to be adults.

556
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,663
Four women, three men.

557
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:09,535
- Is Vertiz on site yet?

558
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:10,971
- Yeah, he just landed.

559
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:13,539
I'll call Maggie and OA,
tell them he's in charge.

560
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:14,844
- Set up across the street.

561
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:17,412
Give me a clear shot, Kyle.
Now, go!

562
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,935
Open a line of communication.

563
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:20,807
See if we can hijack
the video feed.

564
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,722
- Agent Vertiz,I know the hostage taker.

565
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:23,897
He's my informant.
- Okay.

566
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,159
Anything I need to know?

567
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:26,552
- Despite what just happened,
yeah.

568
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:28,423
He's just scared, okay?

569
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,424
He got caught upin the shooting

570
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,599
this morning by accident.

571
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:31,992
- Okay, but that
doesn't really matter.

572
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:35,082
Not now--he's taken seven
innocent people hostage.

573
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,649
- I am aware of what it lookslike, but--

574
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:38,738
- I'll take it from here.

575
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:39,869
- Okay, but let me help.

576
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:41,871
- I said I'll take it
from here.

577
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:44,744
Good, good.
You're good--okay.

578
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,310
Open an angle
.

579
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:47,834
We'll start on the left side,
and we'll move to the right.

580
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:56,059
- Find anything interesting?
- Not yet.

581
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,626
Tyler and Eddiehad lots of devices,

582
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,062
so we still havelots of scrolling to do.

583
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:01,587
- Hey, I got something.
- Tell me.

584
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,154
- Incoming textto Tyler Haddock.

585
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:09,116
"Nice work on Echt.More fun coming soon."

586
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:13,381
- Run the phone.

587
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:17,559
- Can't locate it.
Must be a burner.

588
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:19,561
- OA.

589
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:23,739
The chatter is real.
A second attack is imminent.

590
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:27,177
- Please confirm,
do you have eyes on the target?

591
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:28,962
- Yes, sir, I have a clear shot
through the window

592
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:30,790
on the southwest corner.

593
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:32,792
- Okay, on my command.

594
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:35,664
- Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

595
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:36,796
- What the hell are you doing?

596
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,927
We have intel
on a second attack.

597
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:39,059
- So?
- So Zayne is our best lead.

598
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:40,843
He might be able to help.

599
00:25:43,063 --> 00:25:44,630
- Sir, I still have
a clean shot.

600
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:47,241
Please confirm, green light.

601
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:48,764
- Nestor, just let me
talk to him.

602
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:51,201
See what he knows, please.
- Sir, do I have the green?

603
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:52,725
- Stand down.Repeat, stand down.

604
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:54,204
- Thank you.

605
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:06,695
- Zayne?
It's me, Omar.

606
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,829
Listen, I am gonna help you
and everything is gonna be okay

607
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:11,526
but you need to let
those people go now.

608
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,703
- You think I'm stupid?
Four people are dead.

609
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:17,053
- Okay, listen to me, Zayne.
Let me rephrase myself.

610
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:18,315
I am only here to help you,

611
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,708
but the longer
you stay in there,

612
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:21,014
the worse this is gonna get,
so you need to come

613
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:22,537
to your senses now.

614
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,365
- I gotta get
out of the country.

615
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:26,628
Go someplace safe where
there's no extradition.

616
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,587
- Okay, okay.
We can do that.

617
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,153
We can look into someplace
with no extradition,

618
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:33,026
but you are gonna need to give
us something in exchange.

619
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:34,636
- Like what?
- Like the hostages.

620
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,769
- I already said no to that!

621
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:38,597
- Fine.

622
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,555
Then tell us what you know
about the second attack.

623
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,165
- Second attack?
Man.

624
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:43,602
How many times
do I have to tell you?

625
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,995
I didn't know anything
about the first attack!

626
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,128
- Did Tyler and Eddie
mention any other names?

627
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,869
Did they mention anything
about a second attack?

628
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:52,088
Did you meet any other
Freedom Fighters?

629
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:56,397
- I met a guy named William
at the bar, like...

630
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,399
three or four days ago.

631
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:01,445
- Okay, that's good.
Did you get a last name?

632
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:02,708
What's he look like?

633
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:06,233
- About--he's, like, mid-30s?
Had a beard.

634
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:08,452
The number 13 was tattooed
on his arm.

635
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:12,239
Tyler and Eddie, they were
in awe of this guy, okay?

636
00:27:12,282 --> 00:27:16,591
They said he was...
a "true believer."

637
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,984
- Okay, okay, amazing.

638
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:21,727
You're helping us.
Now we can help you.

639
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,554
- All right, listen up--I need
the full name and address

640
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:24,773
of a man named William.

641
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:26,557
Male, white,
approximately 30 years old.

642
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:28,385
Has the number 13 tattooed
on his arm,

643
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:30,170
so he's either
a huge James Harden fan

644
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:32,085
or a member
of the Aryan Circle.

645
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:33,695
My money's on the latter,
so let's find this guy,

646
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:35,088
shall we?
- I have seven Williams

647
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:36,742
with ties
to white nationalist groups.

648
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:39,658
Four are under the age of 40
and only one lives in New York.

649
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,920
William Ellis, long rap sheet.

650
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:42,922
- William Ellis, check him out.

651
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:44,227
- Yep, looks like
he's a suspect

652
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:46,708
in a recent arson case as well.

653
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:49,189
- That's enough for now.
Find me the last known address.

654
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,193
Federal agents.

655
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,022
- Clear immediate.

656
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:05,292
- Front's clear!

657
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:07,860
- Clear.
- Check the basement!

658
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:21,308
- Jubal, it's me.

659
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:25,791
Looks like Ellis is on the move
with a bomb.

660
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,488
- That's Ellis's car,
right there.

661
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:30,665
The black SUV, heading east on
123rd Street and Brooklyn.

662
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,972
- All right, all right.
Put out a BOLO right away

663
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:34,321
and let's get up on his phone

664
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:36,279
and into that vehicle's
LoJack system.

665
00:28:36,323 --> 00:28:37,759
We need to find out
where he's going

666
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:39,500
and get there before he does.

667
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:41,545
Let's go, let's go!

668
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:47,638
- Hey!
You did really good, Zayne.

669
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:49,336
Okay, remembering the name
William was huge.

670
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:51,730
Everyone at the FBI
is very grateful.

671
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,993
But more importantly, they
believe you now, all right?

672
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:56,125
They know that you were just
trying to be a good informant.

673
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:57,518
But you're gonna need
to keep helping us,

674
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:59,085
so I need you
to let those hostages go

675
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:00,477
before anyone gets hurt.

676
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:02,262
And if you do that,
I can get you a good deal.

677
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:03,698
- Don't play me, Omar!

678
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,006
I want a--a car.
No, an SUV!

679
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,268
And I want a jet.

680
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:09,965
- No, no.

681
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:11,967
That is a bad idea, Zayne.
Okay? Enough.

682
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:13,186
- I don't care!

683
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:15,536
Do it, or I'll shoot
everyone in here.

684
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:18,582
I swear to God!
- Zayne, Zayne, don't--

685
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:23,152
- Jubal?
We're tracking Ellis's SUV.

686
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:25,981
- All right, eyes up.

687
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:28,375
- He's crossed the Triborough.

688
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:31,030
- Where's he going?
Where's he going?

689
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:34,685
- Heading west.
To Washington Heights!

690
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:36,122
We just got up on his phone.

691
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:37,645
His internet, there are
lots of searches

692
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:40,387
relating to Trans For Life,
a nonprofit.

693
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,085
Address is... 14 165th Street.

694
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:44,652
- That's the target.
Throw it up!

695
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:46,349
Get a team of agents
over there right away

696
00:29:46,393 --> 00:29:48,569
and pull up any
and all live video feeds

697
00:29:48,612 --> 00:29:51,354
in and around the target.

698
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:54,488
Scola, head over
to 14 165th Street now.

699
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:57,970
Ellis is gonna attack
Trans For Life.

700
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:00,015
- Trans For Life office
is over there.

701
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,800
SWAT's clearing the building
as we speak.

702
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:03,802
- Are we sure Ellis is actuallyhere in the vicinity?

703
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:05,673
- According to Jubal,
the last visual contact

704
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:08,067
was at 163rd and Riverside.

705
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,459
- Probably found
a place to park,

706
00:30:09,503 --> 00:30:10,939
which means he's on foot
walking north

707
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:12,201
towards the office building.

708
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:15,291
I'll go east, you go west.

709
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:32,918
- I got eyes
on Ellis's vehicle.

710
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:35,659
It's parked on the south side
of 162nd.

711
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:41,056
Exact address is 122 162nd.

712
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:48,411
Car's empty, and I want a bomb
team out here right away.

713
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:51,023
This thing could be rigged.

714
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:55,288
- Hey, what's going on?
- Any sign of William?

715
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,812
- No, I haven't seen him.
But what's up with that SUV?

716
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,770
- It's clean, but the dogs
detected chemicals,

717
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:01,337
so it's likely a bomb
was in the vehicle

718
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:04,079
within the past hour or so,
meaning...

719
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:05,472
- Ellis is carrying it.

720
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:07,648
- We also found a pamphlet
for another charity.

721
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:10,651
It's "Black and Proud NYC"
on Broadway.

722
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:12,479
Could be we're chasing
the wrong target.

723
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:15,003
- Okay, I'm heading west now.
- Okay, good.

724
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,831
I'm sending the SWAT team
there now to evacuate.

725
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,354
- Hold up.

726
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:21,531
I see him.

727
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:23,229
He's wearing blue jeans,
a tan jacket,

728
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:24,883
and he's carrying
a blue backpack.

729
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:26,362
- Okay, wait for backup.

730
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:28,147
- He's headed towards
the building, the target.

731
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,627
- Okay, okay.
I'm sending a team to you now.

732
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:35,502
- William Ellis!
FBI.

733
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:38,374
Stop walking.
I said stop walking!

734
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:39,898
Are you sure there's a bomb
in that backpack?

735
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,247
'Cause this dude
is not complying.

736
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,510
- Yes, I told you,
the dog got a chemical hit.

737
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:45,642
- I've had dogs alert
to bubble gum, bruh.

738
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:47,122
What I'm asking is,
is the dog good?

739
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,515
Can I trust him?
- Yes.

740
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:50,212
- Are you sure?
- Trust me.

741
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:54,173
- William Ellis!

742
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:55,914
Put your hands up
and stop walking!

743
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:58,090
I will not ask again!

744
00:32:30,383 --> 00:32:31,862
- Backpack is hot.

745
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:33,212
Going to try and defuse it.

746
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:35,954
- I told you that dog was good.

747
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:38,869
- I know.

748
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:40,741
Thanks.

749
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:44,092
- Good news--
we just took Ellis down.

750
00:32:44,136 --> 00:32:45,485
He was pronounced dead
at the scene.

751
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:47,443
He had a pipe bomb
in his backpack.

752
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:48,836
- Okay.

753
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:51,273
It means our friend Zayne
is no longer an asset.

754
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:53,449
Keep talking to him.
Make him comfortable.

755
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:54,755
And then lure him to the window

756
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:57,105
on the southwest side
of the café.

757
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:58,802
Tell him there's an SUVthere waiting for him.

758
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:01,153
- No, I can't do that.
- I'm not asking.

759
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:02,981
- He's my informant,
my friend.

760
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:05,635
- Yeah, but how he's taken
seven people hostage.

761
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,602
- I'll go inside.

762
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:17,691
If I talk to him in person,
I can get him to surrender.

763
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:19,258
- That's a really dumb idea.
- Yeah, well,

764
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:20,520
it's a hell of a lot better
than trying to take him out

765
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:22,348
with a sniper rifle
from 50 yards.

766
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:23,958
What if you miss, huh?

767
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,179
He'll snap and light up every
single person in that café.

768
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:30,443
- Stand down, Zidan.

769
00:33:30,486 --> 00:33:32,488
Hey, you going in there
elevates the risk!

770
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:35,100
- Yeah, for me.
Not the hostages.

771
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:36,971
- You're too close
to this guy.

772
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,277
- No.

773
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,889
I can do this,
and I know what's at stake.

774
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:48,765
And, if necessary, I will take
him out in a heartbeat.

775
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:52,813
- Nestor?

776
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,079
Give him a shot.Let him do his thing.

777
00:33:58,123 --> 00:34:01,082
If OA says he can do it,he can do it.

778
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:03,258
You can trust me.

779
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:09,482
- You have five minutes,
then I'm doing it my way.

780
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:12,746
Anyone dies, anyone gets hurt,
it's on you.

781
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:24,975
- Zayne,
I'm coming in!

782
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:26,803
- That's not a good idea.

783
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:28,153
- Yeah, I know.

784
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:30,546
A lot people seem to feel
that way, too.

785
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,983
But I'm gonna go ahead
and come in anyway, all right?

786
00:34:33,027 --> 00:34:35,769
- No, Omar.
Don't!

787
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:38,250
- It's just me.

788
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:39,599
- Okay?
It's just me.

789
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:43,559
- So calm down.
We're gonna figure this out.

790
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:45,822
- Put your gun down.

791
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:47,389
- Okay, okay.

792
00:34:55,789 --> 00:34:59,009
Now you put yours down--
it's only fair.

793
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:02,187
- No.
It doesn't work that way.

794
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,710
- Okay, fine.

795
00:35:03,753 --> 00:35:05,712
I know you're not
gonna hurt me.

796
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:07,279
And I know you're not gonna
hurt those people,

797
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:08,802
because you are a good kid,
Zayne.

798
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:10,543
- Quit playing me, Omar!

799
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:11,892
- Why do you keep saying that?

800
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:14,721
Zayne, I have never
lied to you ever.

801
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:16,157
- Really?

802
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:18,028
You lied to me earlier today.

803
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,336
- What are you talking about?

804
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,338
- You never texted your friend
at the FBI.

805
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:25,166
That was just a bunch of crap

806
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,168
to get me investedin the mission!

807
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:29,736
You're just using me!

808
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,305
Yeah.

809
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:35,524
Show me your phone.

810
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:38,310
Yeah, I want to see the text.

811
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:40,877
Come on.

812
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:42,314
Or, you know what?

813
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:44,403
You, big guy.
Get up.

814
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:47,145
Come right over here.

815
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:50,060
And get on your knees.

816
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:52,106
Omar, I swear to God,

817
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,630
show me your phone
or I'm gonna shoot this guy.

818
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:56,806
- Prepare to engage.
- Yes. sir.

819
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:57,807
He's on me.

820
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:02,072
- Come on!

821
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:06,251
- Okay, okay.

822
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:08,383
You wanna do this your way?

823
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:17,914
Okay.
It's there, take it.

824
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:22,963
You're gonna have to scroll.
The name is "Robert Harper."

825
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:30,013
Keep going.

826
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,975
- I, uh...

827
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:40,415
You really texted him?

828
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:49,511
- Yeah, man.
Come on.

829
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:53,123
- I'm sorry.
Uh...

830
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,997
I'm not--I'm not thinking
so good.

831
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,259
- I know.

832
00:36:58,303 --> 00:37:01,828
So put the gun down
and let these people go,

833
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:03,525
and you and me
are gonna figure this out.

834
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:06,528
You have my word, Zayne.

835
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:10,140
Come on, Zayne.
Put it down.

836
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:11,446
Please, put it down.

837
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:20,150
- Go, go.

838
00:37:20,194 --> 00:37:21,587
Guys!

839
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:39,213
What the hell, Zayne?

840
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,142
- Told you he'd get it done.

841
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:56,535
- Yeah, he did.

842
00:37:56,578 --> 00:37:58,058
But you put mein a bad position.

843
00:37:58,101 --> 00:37:59,233
- Oh, how's that?

844
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,235
- I didn't needanother opinion to process

845
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,019
at that particularmoment in time.

846
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:05,544
- I know, it was a very
stressful situation.

847
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:08,198
But you know that I'm only ever
trying to get the best result.

848
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:10,853
- I know.

849
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:12,899
I know, okay.I'll see you in a few?

850
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:16,424
- Yeah, right.
The medal ceremony.

851
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:18,426
- It's gonna be great,
come on.

852
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,863
- It's not funny!
- Don't beat yourself up.

853
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:23,605
Things happen.
Things out of our control.

854
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:25,215
It's part of the job.
- Yeah, I know that.

855
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:27,217
- Okay, so when
the ADIC calls your name,

856
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:30,569
walk up there
with a proud smile on your face

857
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:33,485
and grab that damn medal.

858
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:35,530
Okay?

859
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:37,793
'Cause you deserve it.

860
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:43,930
Without you, we never would
have made that case.

861
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:49,196
- Thank you.

862
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:06,039
Okay.

863
00:39:09,956 --> 00:39:12,959
See you later.
- Bye.

864
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:14,700
- Do you need any help
with the paperwork?

865
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:16,310
No, I got it.

866
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,964
New guy does the paperwork.

867
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:20,227
Don't worry, I know the rules.

868
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:24,710
I punched my lieutenant
in the face.

869
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:32,674
That's the reason
I left the NYPD.

870
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:38,419
- Oh.

871
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:41,161
- He was drunk and he said
something pretty disgusting,

872
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:43,424
so I hit him.

873
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,861
I got him good, too.

874
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:48,429
A couple months later,
an ASAC I know

875
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:49,648
asked me
if I would be interested

876
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:52,564
in working with the FBI,
so I jumped.

877
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,271
See you tomorrow.

878
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,844
- Well, look at you.

879
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:14,107
- Hey.
Uh, yeah.

880
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,239
I'm, uh, gussied up.

881
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:19,068
- I don't know what that means.
- It just means I'm dressed up.

882
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:22,202
I'm, um, getting
a gold medal tonight

883
00:40:22,245 --> 00:40:25,553
for my extraordinary
and courageous efforts

884
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:28,948
in connection
with Operation Powder, so...

885
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:31,124
- Well, congratulations.That's amazing.

886
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:32,517
- Thanks, yeah.

887
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,432
- Before you go, though, um...

888
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:38,261
I wanted to thank you forstanding up for me with Nestor.

889
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:41,569
It really meant a lot.
- Of course.

890
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:44,006
I'm just really glad
that it worked out.

891
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,835
You know, I could see that
it was hard for you.

892
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:49,229
You clearly care about Zayne.

893
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:52,101
Probably tough to watch him
blow up his life like that.

894
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,801
- It is what it is.

895
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:02,242
- I don't want to be late.
- Go, go, I'll see you there!

896
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:07,247
- You're coming?
- Oh, yeah.

897
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,771
It's not every day that my
partner gets a gold medal.

898
00:41:12,295 --> 00:41:14,036
- Okay.

899
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,082
- Okay, what's going on
with you?

900
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:18,737
- What?
- Why are you so unexcited?

901
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,825
The operation
was a huge success.

902
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:22,436
You arrested 16 people.

903
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,526
- Yeah, that's true.

904
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,615
We also killed someone.

905
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:31,445
Her name was Anna.Um...

906
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:34,448
She was married
to one of the targets.

907
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,059
She had just turned 22.

908
00:41:37,103 --> 00:41:38,713
You know, I'd spent a lot
of time with her

909
00:41:38,757 --> 00:41:40,628
and I considered her a friend.

910
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:47,287
The day of the arrest,
she panicked.

911
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,506
And she grabbed a knife

912
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:51,683
and she ran
towards one of the officers.

913
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,340
I shot her.

914
00:41:57,384 --> 00:42:00,213
I didn't have a choice.

915
00:42:02,258 --> 00:42:07,176
But we made 16 arrests, right?
So that's what matters.

916
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:13,095
I really should go.
I don't want to be late.

917
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:16,316
Like you said, not every day
you get a gold medal, right?

917
00:42:17,305 --> 00:43:17,415

1
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:26,765
Please stop.

2
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:31,335
Oh, oh...

3
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:40,127
- It stops when you tell me
what I need to know.

4
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:42,868
No...

5
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:47,090
- Where is he?

6
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,744
Where is he?!

7
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:52,008
- I don't know.Please, please.

8
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,402
Please.

9
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:57,274
This is all a mistake.

10
00:00:57,318 --> 00:01:01,539
I didn't have anything to do
with that man's death.

11
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:07,154
- You really didn't do it,
did you?

12
00:01:07,197 --> 00:01:12,289
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah?

13
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,117
- I promise.I swear.

14
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:15,423
Please, please.

15
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:18,078
- I can't do that.

16
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,079
- No, no, no.No, no, no.

17
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,254
No, no, no, no!

18
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:34,485
- This is not the kind of stuff
we want hitting the streets.

19
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:37,445
The person we're looking for
had access to...

20
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,022
- Need some help?

21
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,851
- Hey, yeah, I'm looking
for the SAC.

22
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:55,245
Isobel Castille.

23
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:58,074
Hi, uh, I'm Hailey.
- Detective Upton.

24
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,858
I've heard a lotof good things about you.

25
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,947
I'm Special Agent in ChargeIsobel Castille.

26
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:03,862
We just caught a pretty
gruesome murder,

27
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:05,125
so you might as well
hit the ground running.

28
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:06,561
- Sounds good to me.

29
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:08,824
- You will be partnered
with Agent Zidan.

30
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,173
- Hi, I'm OA.
- Hi.

31
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:11,435
Hailey.
- Nice to meet you.

32
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,480
- You too.

33
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:14,177
- Listen up, everyone.

34
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:17,049
This is Detective Hailey Upton
from Chicago PD.

35
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:18,616
She will be with us
for the next few weeks

36
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,575
as part of our interagency
training program.

37
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:21,706
- All right, so let's, uh,

38
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,491
direct our attention
to the screens here.

39
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:27,103
Found the body of a young John
Doe in St. Nicholas Park.

40
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,105
A hundred yards from
Alexander Hamilton's house.

41
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,498
Federal land, federal case--

42
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,240
and no, it is not
where Aaron Burr shot him.

43
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:35,416
The famed duel took place in--
anyone, anyone?

44
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,766
Weehawken, New Jersey.
Kristen knew.

45
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:40,072
Unfortunately,there's far less clarity

46
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:41,117
in the present homicide case.

47
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,206
Evidence of torture and abuse,

48
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,642
the victim was brown-skinned,

49
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:46,253
but there was no other evidenceof a hate crime.

50
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:48,298
So let's dig in, get to work,
start filling in the blanks.

51
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:50,170
Yeah?Go.

52
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:53,173
- You ready?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,700
- So, Chicago PD?Should I be nervous?

54
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:00,180
- Nervous?

55
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,659
- You guys have been
in the news a lot

56
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:03,705
and not for good reasons.

57
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:06,098
- Uh, yeah,
we've had some issues,

58
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:07,839
but they're being addressed.

59
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:09,667
It's a great place.
I'm proud to be a part of it.

60
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:11,321
Listen, in the future,
if you want to insult me,

61
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:12,801
you can just go ahead
and do it.

62
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:14,585
You don't have to disguise
the putdown with humor.

63
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,065
Which car?
This one?

64
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:18,198
- Yeah, sorry.I didn't mean it like that.

65
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,287
I guess that's justmy way of saying

66
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,766
we do things different here.

67
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,811
- Mm.

68
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,380
- Just trying to keep it real.

69
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:30,079
So you spend much time
in New York?

70
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:32,212
- Nah, first time here.

71
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,648
- Any early observations?

72
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:35,258
- Pizza's too thin.

73
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:38,043
It's like a cracker
with sauce on it.

74
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:39,436
Just trying to keep it real.

75
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,924
- Yo!

76
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,014
You two taking the handle
on this?

77
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:53,145
- Yes, sir.

78
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:54,451
I'm Agent Zidan,
this is Detective Upton.

79
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:56,236
Can you bring us up to speed?

80
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:00,152
- Jogger called it in.

81
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:02,416
No blood pooled on the ground.
No shell casings.

82
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,723
So it looked like the guy was
killed at another location

83
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,159
and dropped off here.

84
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:08,944
- Did the jogger see
the body being dropped?

85
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:11,512
- If she did,I would've said so.

86
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:13,340
- It's a New York thing.

87
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:15,298
- It felt like
a cop versus fed thing.

88
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,169
- What's that supposed to mean?

89
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:18,867
- You think you're betterthan us.

90
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,311
No phone, no wallet?
- No nothing.

91
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,531
Don't even know
what the kid's ethnicity is.

92
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:33,011
Could be Hispanic,
Middle Eastern...

93
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:36,624
His face is so torn up,
I can't tell which.

94
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,800
- That's a Kada,so he's probably Indian.

95
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:40,410
- Sikh.

96
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:45,763
Could still be a hate crime,though.

97
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,156
Most of the people around here

98
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,984
don't really carewhich shade of brown you are.

99
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:55,382
We have a university bookstorereceipt dated yesterday.

100
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:57,297
- Thanks.

101
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,216
- Got a hit on facial rec.

102
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,957
Victim's name is Aman Patel.

103
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:08,438
25.
Indian national.

104
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:09,918
- All right, notify
the Indian Consulate

105
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:11,398
so they can make
the appropriate notifications.

106
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:14,052
He's a registered student
at Paul Revere University?

107
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,272
- Yes, here on
an F-1 student visa.

108
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,926
Before that,
he graduated top of his class

109
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:19,406
out of a university in India.

110
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:21,582
Then he came here to pursue
a masters in engineering.

111
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,367
- Any priors or run-ins
with the campus cops?

112
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:27,370
- No, looks like he was
too busy getting a 4.0 GPA.

113
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:28,719
- Right.

114
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,112
- M.E. just confirmed
that he was tortured.

115
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:31,679
Nails were torn off one by one,

116
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:34,377
fingers pulled back
and individually broken.

117
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,074
- Kay, so someone wanted
Aman to suffer

118
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,468
or needed answers.
The question is, which one?

119
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,078
- Do we have a home address?
- Not yet.

120
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:42,080
We do have a PO box
over at the university.

121
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:43,691
- All right, head over there
and see what you can learn.

122
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:53,353
- He was a great kid.
Every professor's dream.

123
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:57,661
- Did Aman ever mentionany issues?

124
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:01,099
Threats, fears, anythingout of the ordinary?

125
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:05,930
- I'm not sure
if this is related, but...

126
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,802
something happened
a few days ago.

127
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:10,413
He was being harassedwalking to class.

128
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:12,415
Some racist guywas taunting him.

129
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:13,938
Calling him a terrorist.

130
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:16,027
- Mm-kay.
One last thing:

131
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,029
Do you have any idea
where Aman was living?

132
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:21,859
- No, but I knowhe walked to school.

133
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:24,253
And he didn't likehis roommate.

134
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:26,211
Said he partied too much.

135
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:28,126
- Can you think
of anything else?

136
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,651
- No, sorry.

137
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:32,435
- It's okay.
Thank you.

138
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:37,484
- Actually, there's
a laundromat near the house.

139
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:39,311
Aman thought it was
the greatest thing ever.

140
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:41,792
Clean clothes
for 20 bucks a week.

141
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,881
I get it.
This is New York.

142
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:46,928
There are dry cleaners
on every block.

143
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:49,409
I'm just trying to tell you
what I know.

144
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:56,154
- The home address he used
to secure the PO box

145
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:57,460
was from Albany.

146
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:59,549
Apparently, he has an uncle
who lives there.

147
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:00,855
- But he wasn't living there.

148
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,552
You can't walk to campusfrom Albany.

149
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,336
- I'm sorry, that's the only
address I've got.

150
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,816
Anything else?

151
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,950
- Yes, uh, Professor Banks saidAman was on the wrong end

152
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:10,691
of some racial tauntingrecently.

153
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:12,127
Did he file a report?

154
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,564
- Yes, the man's name
is Frank Prichard,

155
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:15,957
comes around here
about once a week,

156
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,915
always spewing racial nonsense.

157
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,961
- Campus securityever detain him?

158
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:22,354
- Yep.
Several times.

159
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:25,140
- Okay, I'll need to seethose reports right away.

160
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,147
- Free country.

161
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,105
I got a right to speak my mind.

162
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:37,500
- Is this how
you speak your mind?

163
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:39,023
- What?No.

164
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:42,157
Oh, no, I don't kill people.I'm a patriot!

165
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,725
I'm just--I'm trying to keepthe neighborhood safe.

166
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:46,161
- Safe from what?

167
00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:47,815
- Arabs.

168
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:51,514
- Excuse me.
- Not the good ones, like you.

169
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:54,169
I'm talking about the oneswith bombs.

170
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:59,174
I'm just doing whatthe government wants me to do.

171
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:01,219
- "See something,
say something," huh?

172
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:04,614
- No.
See something, do something.

173
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:08,749
See, I get pictures of the onesI think are suspicious.

174
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,543
- You see this guy, Frank?

175
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:23,067
He's an Indian.
Not an Arab.

176
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:25,069
- It's kind of
the same thing, right?

177
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:26,462
- Before he died,

178
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,290
he told his professor
that you were harassing him,

179
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,205
calling him all sorts
of colorful names.

180
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:32,294
- It's possible.

181
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:39,344
- Gonna need an alibi, Frank.

182
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:41,346
Where were you last night?

183
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:44,349
- New York Hospital.

184
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,571
Had a gallstone.

185
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:50,617
Just got out this morning.

186
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:54,708
- Gonna need copies
of those photos too.

187
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:57,362
Now.

188
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:01,715
I had a thumb drive.

189
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:05,980
Here.

190
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:07,764
Saves me a stamp.

191
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:10,114
Was gonna mail themto Homeland Security anyway.

192
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:18,383
- If I hear you're harassing
any more immigrants,

193
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:21,604
I'm gonna come back here,
and I'm gonna break your arm.

194
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,655
- Do you understand?

195
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:30,744
- Yeah.

196
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,310
- Good.

197
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:41,102
- I forwarded Kristenthe pictures of Aman.

198
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:43,060
She'll get usa street block number

199
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:45,106
based on the license platesin the background.

200
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:47,195
- Just like that, huh?
- The FBI, Upton.

201
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:50,415
Our tech resourcesare pretty sick.

202
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,547
Look, it's not a big deal,

203
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,679
but now that you're workingwith us,

204
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:54,245
just try and be a little bitmore careful.

205
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:55,507
If that guy Prichardcalls the Bureau

206
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,118
complaining that youthreatened to use force...

207
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:58,336
- Look, man,
I don't need a lesson

208
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,686
on how to talk to people,
all right?

209
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:02,297
- Hey, hey, hey.

210
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,864
Don't get me wrong.

211
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:05,300
I have no problem with someone
breaking that idiot's arm,

212
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:07,258
it's just...

213
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:09,086
It's just that the Bureau
is hardcore,

214
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,088
and they take that stuff
really seriously.

215
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,310
- You're right.

216
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:17,094
I'm sorry.

217
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:19,227
If he files a beef, I'll eat itand make sure you're clear.

218
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,098
All right?
- Appreciate that.

219
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:24,928
But what the hell's a beef?

220
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,322
- It's an expression.
- I'm kidding.

221
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:32,327
Kristen said Aman's house
is around this area.

222
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:39,421
- Emily said there'sa laundromat at the corner.

223
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:41,292
- Okay, there's one
right there.

224
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:46,384
And the house has a blue door.

225
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:49,910
- Blue door.

226
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:51,520
- All right.

227
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:55,176
- Door's open.

228
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:04,141
FBI!
Anybody home?

229
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:10,060
I'll go up.
- Copy.

230
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:15,805
Living room's clear.

231
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:19,461
Nice placefor a college student.

232
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,880
- OA!

233
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,675
Place has been tossed.

234
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:06,116
- Must be Aman's room.

235
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,337
- There's another bedroom.Emily mentioned a roommate.

236
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:30,314
Okay.

237
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:32,012
Based on the clothes
and the photos,

238
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:34,623
Aman's roommate is around30 years old, male,

239
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,451
and likes to party.

240
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:40,020
All of this searching

241
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,196
has to be connected
to the murder somehow.

242
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,807
Like the killer didn't getwhat he wanted from Aman,

243
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:47,810
so he came back hereand started searching.

244
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:49,246
- Question is, for what?

245
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,248
Gun!

246
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:00,127
- Drop your weapon now!

247
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,565
- He's bailing out the back!
I'm on him!

248
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:07,221
- Shots fired, in foot pursuit.
Requesting backup.

249
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:15,925
On your six!

250
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:26,631
- Stop!

251
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:29,069
Get out of the way!

252
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,077
- Where is he?

253
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,861
- I lost him.

254
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,038
Responding units, be advised,

255
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:43,953
the suspect was last seen
running south,

256
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,563
described as male--
- Damn it.

257
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,478
- Hispanic, early 40s,
black jacket.

258
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:49,132
By the way, thank you.

259
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:51,352
- Huh?
For what?

260
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:55,399
- For saving my ass back there.
In the house.

261
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:57,097
- Oh.

262
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,620
Okay.

263
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:00,578
Cool.
You're welcome.

264
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:09,892
- Kelly, you guys start working
on the surveillance video.

265
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:11,024
Pull camera footage
from every camera

266
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,416
within a mile radius
of that house.

267
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,331
I want a name and face
of the upstanding citizen

268
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,420
that just opened up on OA
and Upton, yeah?

269
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:19,119
- Jubal?
- Yep.

270
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:21,338
- I just spoke to the owner of
the house Aman was living in,

271
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,297
he signed a lease with someone
named Lucas Reed

272
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,298
seven months ago.

273
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:26,039
- Nice.Throw it up.

274
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:29,042
Check it out, we have the name
of Aman's roommate, Lucas Reed.

275
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:30,391
23, unemployed,

276
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:32,480
did three semestersat the University of Miami.

277
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:35,396
He's got one misdemeanor priorfor marijuana possession.

278
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:36,701
The question is,

279
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,529
what is his relationshipwith our murder victim?

280
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:39,791
Are they just roomies,

281
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:41,141
or is there something else
going on here?

282
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:43,273
You guys grab a scuba tank.
Do a deep dive.

283
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:44,666
Don't come up for air
until you got something.

284
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,102
- Uh, canvassed the area,

285
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:47,321
talked to a lot
of the neighbors.

286
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:48,888
Sounds like
this Lucas Reed guy's

287
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,672
one flashy man about town.

288
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:52,326
Threw a lot of parties,
played loud music...

289
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:53,980
- Yeah.
- So the neighbors loved him.

290
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:56,286
- Exactly.
- Anybody seen him recently?

291
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,940
- A woman named Denise Walters
saw him take off

292
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,986
yesterday afternoon
in a silver Range Rover.

293
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:01,988
- Right--oh, oh, uh,ping Reed's phone,

294
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:03,250
see if we can get a location.

295
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:04,686
- Yeah, I've been trying
to do just that.

296
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:06,427
I haven't found a phone
registered to him as of yet.

297
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,385
- Uh-huh, well,let's put out a BOLO

298
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:09,952
on this silver Range Rover.

299
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,084
Sooner we talk to this guy,the better.

300
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:12,520
- Just got ballistics back

301
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:14,739
on the slugs
fired at OA and Upton.

302
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:17,481
They match the bullets that
killed Aman, but get this:

303
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:18,961
They also match the bullets

304
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:21,311
pulled from a drive by
murder victim two months ago.

305
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:22,399
- Could they ID a suspect yet?

306
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,532
- Yeah, arrested him too.

307
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:27,535
Name is Santiago Gonzalez,

308
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:29,319
known associate
of the Latin Players.

309
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:31,626
He's being held at MDC
pending trial.

310
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:33,628
- Latin Players.
That's a Chicago gang.

311
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:35,673
- Hmm, looks likethey're expanding.

312
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:39,460
- So the Latin Players killed
someone, they get arrested,

313
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:42,289
go to jail, and the gun
stays on the street.

314
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:44,639
- And the new owner uses
said gun to kill Aman,

315
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:47,120
a studious Indian
engineering student?

316
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:49,122
- Right.
What are we missing?

317
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:50,906
How are these two murdersconnected?

318
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,865
- Have OA and Upton pay a visit
to Inmate Gonzalez.

319
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:55,650
Maybe he can help us answer
that question.

320
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:56,738
- Right.

321
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:02,700
- So this guy, Gonzalez,
is originally from Chicago.

322
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:04,006
Runs with the Latin Players,

323
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,747
so maybe you should take
the lead on this one.

324
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,140
But go hard on him.

325
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:08,663
- You want a reaction?
- A big one.

326
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:10,665
Big enough to force him
to call his people.

327
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,406
- I think I can do that.

328
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:25,027
Where's the gun you used
in the drive-by?

329
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:26,811
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

330
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:29,336
- One of your friends used it
to kill a civilian last night.

331
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:30,815
- Used it again this
afternoon on us.

332
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:32,600
Fired off ten rounds.

333
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:34,428
- Like I said, I don't knowwhat you're talking about.

334
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:37,039
- You're staring 20 to life
on the case you're riding.

335
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,216
Give us the name of the person
you gave the gun to,

336
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,610
and maybe I'll be able
to get you a reduced sentence.

337
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,655
- Get my ass, blondie.

338
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:53,577
- I'm not a fed like him.
I'm Chicago police.

339
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:54,665
- So what?

340
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,624
- Means I play
by different rules.

341
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,278
Also means I know the names

342
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:00,454
of all the shot callers
in the Latin Players.

343
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:03,065
Tomorrow morning,
we're gonna do a warrant sweep.

344
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:05,937
Means a lot of people you know
are gonna get arrested.

345
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:08,549
- That's not my problem.
- But it is.

346
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:11,204
Because I'm gonna make sure
that they know

347
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,510
you are the snitch
who gave them up.

348
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:19,516
- Now, you knownobody's gonna believe that.

349
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,606
- Really?
Because in my experience,

350
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,695
pissed-off bangers
don't do their homework,

351
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:27,655
and if they think you're
a snitch, you're a snitch.

352
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:31,180
In the street,
rumors become facts like that.

353
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,532
- I'm done talking.

354
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,494
- All right.

355
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,200
- So you think he believed us?

356
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:54,334
- I don't know.What?

357
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:56,031
- Nothing, you just reminded me
of my partner, Maggie,

358
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,467
in there.
- Oh.

359
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,339
- How are you, sir?

360
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:01,558
- In a good way.

361
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,125
- Then thank you.

362
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,561
- Can you cue up
the audio feed?

363
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:08,957
- So where is your partner?

364
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,655
- Uh, she is on
an undercover assignment.

365
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:13,266
That I know
absolutely nothing about

366
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,572
besides the fact that
she is gone and unreachable.

367
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:18,532
- That's gotta be pretty tough.

368
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:21,143
- Yeah, but she's really good,

369
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:24,494
so she'll be fine.

370
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:25,495
- We're up.

371
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,107
- Yo, just say the word, man.

372
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,499
Chicago about to throw
that heat.

373
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,284
What are you talking about?

374
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,634
Police and FBI
here sweating me, man.

375
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:35,070
- About what?

376
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,246
- That piece
that I left behind.

377
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,161
I'm guess it's all connected
to what happened

378
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:41,946
on the night
at Highbridge Park.

379
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,339
- All right,
thanks for looking out.

380
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:44,775
- No doubt.

381
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,649
- Can you trace the number
that he called?

382
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:50,651
- Pay phone
up in Washington Heights.

383
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,174
- Okay.
Thank you.

384
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:56,222
- Any idea
what we're looking for?

385
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:57,484
- Not really.

386
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:59,050
All we know is something
happened here

387
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:01,792
three nights ago that might
be linked to Aman's murder.

388
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:06,623
- Okay, let's lookfor video cameras.

389
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,364
Canvass for witnesses.

390
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:23,074
- Excuse me.

391
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:25,120
Do you walk through here often?

392
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,384
- Uh, yeah.I live close by.

393
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:30,517
- Were you here
three nights ago?

394
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,649
- I don't think so.I'm not really sure.

395
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:34,695
- Do you remember seeing
anything unusual?

396
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:36,784
People arguing?
Gunshots?

397
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:39,961
- No.Sorry.

398
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:43,269
Can I go now?
- Yeah.

399
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:51,668
- Hey!

400
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:54,062
Got a glove for whatever
that's worth.

401
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,631
Runner!

402
00:19:57,674 --> 00:20:00,286
- Hey!

403
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:02,505
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Slow down, amigo.

404
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:04,681
- Don't shoot!
- Relax, we're not gonna shoot.

405
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:06,683
Just take a deep breath.

406
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:08,250
Why you running?

407
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:09,773
- Because I just saw that guy,

408
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:11,732
and I didn't want to get blamedfor it.

409
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:13,429
- Blamed for what?

410
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:15,910
- The dead body.
- What dead body?

411
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:18,086
- Over there.

412
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:19,609
I just wanted to see it,I swear.

413
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,568
I've never seen a dead guybefore.

414
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:24,135
- Just watch him.

415
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:31,795
- Hey, guys!

416
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,627
- I'm guessing this is whathappened in Highbridge Park

417
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:38,846
a few nights ago.

418
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:46,201
- So the kid heard
there was a body in the park

419
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,811
and wanted to see it.
He know anything else?

420
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:49,378
- No, he overheard some kids
in the park talking about it.

421
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:50,684
Doesn't even
know their names.

422
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:51,946
- He has an alibi
for the time of death too,

423
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:53,730
so we released him
to his parents.

424
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:55,297
- What else do we knowabout the dead guy?

425
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:56,951
- Well, Ernesto Garcia,

426
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:59,562
known member
of the Latin Players,

427
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:01,825
three priors,
all narcotics-related, right?

428
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:03,436
Anything else?

429
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:05,089
- Word in Chicago is he's the
number two here in New York.

430
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,874
- All right.

431
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,789
- So how's his death connected
to the engineering students?

432
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:10,530
- No idea.
- But it is connected.

433
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:12,183
We heard Santiago
talking to his buddies,

434
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:14,055
saying that it's related
to something that went down

435
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:17,145
in Highbridge Park,
which we now know is Ernesto.

436
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:18,538
- Hey, guys.

437
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:19,887
Here's the footage we recovered
from the park.

438
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,975
- Great.

439
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:22,672
- Camera angle's
about 20 yards east

440
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:24,979
of the location
of Ernesto's body.

441
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:33,335
- That's Lucas Reed,
Aman's roommate,

442
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:34,554
walking away from the body.

443
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:35,859
- He's only wearingone glove too.

444
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:40,690
- Okay, so,
Lucas kills Ernesto,

445
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,649
takes the backpack
full of product,

446
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:44,259
and goes into hiding.

447
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,000
- The Latin Players find out
what happened, go after Lucas,

448
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:47,697
but take Aman instead.

449
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:50,961
- And they beat and torture him
hoping to get intel on Lucas.

450
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:52,354
- Makes perfect sense.

451
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:54,269
The problem is,
we don't have enough evidence.

452
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,750
There is no video,
no prints, no DNA,

453
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:58,969
nothing connecting
anyone to Aman's murder.

454
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:01,668
Which is why we need to find
Lucas Reed.

455
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:03,060
He is the missing link.

456
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:04,888
We arrest him
for killing Ernesto

457
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:06,760
and then leverage his
ass to take down the banger

458
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:09,023
responsible for torturing
and killing Aman.

459
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,503
- I don't know where Lucas is,

460
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:12,940
but I found some recent photos
off of his social media.

461
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:18,032
- I'm guessing
that's his girlfriend.

462
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:19,990
- Hold on.
I talked to her at the park,

463
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:22,341
right before we foundErnesto's body.

464
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:25,126
- Ah, and we have a hit
off of social rec.

465
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:27,824
Her name is Harper Quinlan,
23 years old,

466
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:32,046
last known address is 84 Groton
Street, Queens, New York.

467
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:33,352
- Go.

468
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,269
- She hasn't lived here
for a while.

469
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:39,967
About two years.

470
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,056
- Do you know a guynamed Lucas Reed?

471
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:44,188
- No, never heard of him.
Why?

472
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:46,234
- When was the last time
you talked to your daughter?

473
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:49,803
- Hold on.
What's this all about?

474
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:51,108
- We believe thatyour daughter's boyfriend

475
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:52,980
might be involved in a murder.

476
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:55,809
- Oh.

477
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:08,996
I haven't talked to Harper
in five or six months.

478
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,911
She just...

479
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,740
We lost touch.

480
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:16,656
She dropped out of college,
started partying...

481
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:17,918
- What about her friends?

482
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:20,573
- Stopped talking to them too.
It's like...

483
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:21,965
it's like she just
cut herself off

484
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,054
from everybody
she knew and loved.

485
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:27,231
You said that her boyfriend
might be involved.

486
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,364
What about Harper?
She's not part of this, is she?

487
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,235
- We don't know.
We're still investigating.

488
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:35,805
You know whereshe's living now?

489
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:37,590
- Some crappy apartment
over in Brooklyn.

490
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:40,593
I, uh, followed her one day
to this building in Red Hook.

491
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,943
- But you didn't talk to her.
- I tried to.

492
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:48,383
She...she asked me to leave.

493
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:56,043
- Uh, if she happensto reach out, give us a call.

494
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:58,437
- I will.
The odds ain't great.

495
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,873
Trust me.

496
00:24:01,135 --> 00:24:03,050
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

497
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:07,054
- OA and Upton got an address
for the girlfriend.

498
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:08,142
They're headed there now.

499
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:09,535
- Kristen.
- Yeah?

500
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:11,450
- Forwarded you some new videofrom Highbridge Park,

501
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,973
different angles,wider coverage.

502
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:16,280
Uh, 5:54 p.m., that's thetimestamp on the last video

503
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:18,674
when we saw Lucas leaving themurder scene with the backpack.

504
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,154
- Okay.
All right, got something.

505
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:21,329
Check this out.

506
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:24,506
- That's Lucas' Range Rover,

507
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,334
but he got intothe passenger's side.

508
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:28,684
Zoom in.Who's driving?

509
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:36,170
- Son of a bitch.

510
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:39,173
OA, you're no longergoing over to the apartment

511
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:40,522
to talk to Harper.

512
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,829
You're going over thereto arrest her.

513
00:24:45,614 --> 00:24:49,183
- Why were you at the park?
- I told you before.

514
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:50,576
I was walking.

515
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:52,316
- Or was it to recover
the glove that Lucas dropped

516
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,753
after he killed
his drug supplier?

517
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:55,972
- I don't know anythingabout that.

518
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,109
- We have video of you
in the driver's seat

519
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:04,720
of Lucas' Range Rover
at Highbridge Park

520
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:07,375
the night that Lucas killed
Ernesto Garcia,

521
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:09,029
so you are now
an official suspect

522
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:10,770
in a murder investigation.

523
00:25:10,813 --> 00:25:12,162
That means no more lying,

524
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:13,903
no more protecting
your boyfriend.

525
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:16,471
You either cooperate with us
here and now,

526
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,081
or you go to prison.

527
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,301
- I'm not gonna help youruin Lucas' life.

528
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:23,086
I just won't.He's a good person.

529
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:27,177
- Harper, good people don't
sell drugs or kill people.

530
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:28,831
- Yeah, you don't know himlike I do.

531
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:32,139
He's so nice, and...

532
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:34,968
he's sweet...
- In love.

533
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:36,622
- More like dumb love.

534
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:38,058
What's the difference?

535
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:39,668
- He really loves me.

536
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:42,671
- Lucas isn't who you think
he is, Harper.

537
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:46,675
Protecting him
will only get you

538
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,242
and more innocent people hurt.

539
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:51,854
Tell me why you think he was
in the park that night.

540
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:54,553
- I'm not gonna help you.

541
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:57,251
- Are you listening
to what I'm saying to you?

542
00:25:57,294 --> 00:26:00,863
You're a suspect in a murder
investigation here.

543
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:07,130
Lying to protect him
makes this worse.

544
00:26:07,174 --> 00:26:08,436
You're putting more lives
at risk.

545
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:10,046
Be smart.

546
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,135
Tell me why you were there
that night.

547
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:15,269
Harper, you don't need
to go to prison for him.

548
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:18,620
- Unlock it.

549
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:20,100
- What's going on?

550
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:21,231
- Do it.

551
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:23,625
Pull up your texts.

552
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:31,851
- Oh, my God.

553
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:33,766
- What does it say?

554
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:36,029
- "Return the product,or he's dead.

555
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:37,900
"You have four hours.

556
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:39,293
"Tell your man
to meet us at the place

557
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:41,208
we did our first deal."

558
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:45,342
Oh, my--
oh, my God.

559
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:52,480
- Kay, Tom Quinlan, father
of Lucas Reed's girlfriend,

560
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:54,351
has been abducted
by the Latin Players.

561
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:57,398
His home address
is 84 Groton Street.

562
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:59,443
His work address
is 29 Parsons Boulevard.

563
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:01,358
Let's get boots on the ground
in both neighborhoods,

564
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:02,490
canvass for witnesses,

565
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:04,318
pull traffic PODS,
surveillance cams.

566
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:05,580
- Hey, Jubal?
- Yeah?

567
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,016
- We ran Tom's phone.

568
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,322
It was shut off three seconds
after the text was sent,

569
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:09,758
but it pinged a tower
in Washington Heights.

570
00:27:09,802 --> 00:27:10,977
- Good, good, good.

571
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,282
There's another neighborhoodto dig into.

572
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:14,371
Witnesses, video.

573
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:16,069
Emily, you wanna grab Scola
and head down there?

574
00:27:16,112 --> 00:27:18,724
We're on a clock, people!
We got four hours.

575
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,161
Correction, three hours
and 49 minutes.

576
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:22,249
Let's get moving.

577
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:24,468
Harper's our best play.

578
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:27,036
We get her to cooperate,
we got a chance.

579
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,125
- Well, I agree, but so farshe's been a brick wall.

580
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:30,344
- Mm.

581
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:33,303
- Let me take a run at her.

582
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:38,178
I might have an angle to play.

583
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:56,370
You're in a tough placeright now, Harper.

584
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:59,155
We have video of youat the scene of a murder,

585
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:01,505
which makes you an accessory.

586
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,594
You're lookingat 15 to 20 years in prison.

587
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:12,299
But if you cooperate,we can help you.

588
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:15,563
We'll talk to the prosecutor,explain why you were there,

589
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:17,739
help him understand the nature

590
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:19,654
of your relationshipwith Lucas.

591
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,438
- What are you talking about?

592
00:28:21,482 --> 00:28:23,658
- I know what's going on.

593
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,486
He hurts you, doesn't he?

594
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:28,707
- No.
That's not true.

595
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:31,971
He's a good guy--
- No, he's not.

596
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:33,450
What are those bruiseson your neck?

597
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:36,410
You tried to cover them up,but I can see them.

598
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:43,417
When you first met,I bet he was great.

599
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,811
You guys hit it off,
you had fun.

600
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:48,683
He was everything you wanted.

601
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,077
But then he started chipping
away at your friends

602
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,774
and your family.

603
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:56,038
So you pop a pillto numb the pain

604
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:58,171
and tell yourselfeverything's okay,

605
00:28:58,214 --> 00:29:01,304
just hoping that the abuseis gonna stop.

606
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,483
Harper.

607
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:08,572
It won't.

608
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:16,755
- I talked to your dad.

609
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,412
He loves you very much.

610
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,894
- And he needs you right now.

611
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:27,983
He's in a lot of danger.

612
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:30,116
If these guys don'tget their drugs back,

613
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,509
they will kill him.

614
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:34,337
The only thing that matters now

615
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:36,644
is you helping usto find Lucas,

616
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:39,647
so we can recover the drugsand find your dad.

617
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:06,805
- So how do you know
so much about abuse?

618
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:12,419
I am sorry, I did not mean
anything by that.

619
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:13,986
- No, it's fine.It's all good.

620
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:15,770
Everyone becomes a copfor a reason.

621
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,424
I guess that's mine.

622
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:22,385
- Uh, yeah.

623
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:29,740
- Don't forget, Harper.

624
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:31,394
He wants the cash
to get out of town,

625
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:33,832
but we need the location
where he first met his dealer.

626
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,008
That's where your dad is.

627
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:52,111
- Got eyes on Lucas.

628
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:54,200
Just got out
of the Range Rover.

629
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:56,158
- Here we go.

630
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,557
- Sup, baby.
- Hey.

631
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:08,344
- How much you get?
- 2,400.

632
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:12,958
- Nice work.
Nice work.

633
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,568
I really appreciate it.

634
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:18,050
- Babe.

635
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:20,269
They took my father.

636
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:21,749
- What are you talking about?

637
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,403
- That guy that you deal with,
they grabbed my father

638
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:24,883
and texted me
that they're gonna kill him

639
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:26,623
unless we return the drugs
that you took.

640
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:27,929
- Oh, no, no.

641
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:29,626
I can't--
I can't do that.

642
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,628
- They took my father!

643
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:35,415
- Look, I feel bad,
but they will kill me.

644
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,547
Oh, Jesus, don't--
- Lucas.

645
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:38,940
- Don't give me
the sad eyes look.

646
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:40,028
- Lucas.

647
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:41,595
- I'm screwed.

648
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:45,033
Look, I gotta look out for me--
for us, you understand?

649
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:46,687
- Look, I need to knowwhere you and Ernesto

650
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,731
did your first deal

651
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:49,516
'cause that's wherethey wanna meet.

652
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,821
- I just told you,
I'm not going--

653
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:52,606
- I will go!

654
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:54,260
I'll call my uncle.He has a lot of money.

655
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:57,872
Maybe I can negotiatea deal or something.

656
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,396
- I gotta get moving, all
right, so give me the money.

657
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,182
- Where did you meet him?
- Stay strong.

658
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:05,227
Location first,
then give him the money.

659
00:32:05,271 --> 00:32:07,490
- Lucas.

660
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:09,275
Lucas.Lucas!

661
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:10,711
- I'll call you later on,
all right?

662
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:12,060
- Damn it.
Move in now!

663
00:32:13,714 --> 00:32:15,281
- Lucas!

664
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,723
- You lying sack of...

665
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:24,507
Get down!

666
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:26,509
Get down!
- Move, move!

667
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,730
Oh!

668
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:31,123
Get down!

669
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,341
- Move!
- Get down!

670
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:34,517
- Drop it!
- Get down!

671
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:36,911
Ooh!

672
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:41,089
- Lucas!
Lucas!

673
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:43,352
Lucas!
Lucas...

674
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:49,402
- It's okay.

675
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:55,582
It's okay.

676
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:58,802
- No, no, no!

677
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,545
- It's okay.

678
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:03,590
It's gonna be okay.

679
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,121
- I turned the corner...

680
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:16,385
This is my fault.

681
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:18,648
I screwed up.
- No, you did great.

682
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:20,346
- I shouldn't have given him
the money.

683
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:21,782
I didn't even get the location.

684
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:23,566
- Listen, we'll findthe location.

685
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,655
We'll find the drugs.Don't worry about that.

686
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:28,136
- Sounded like he was ready
to hit the road,

687
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,095
so I'm guessing his dope
is close by.

688
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:44,413
Nothing back here.
- Yeah.

689
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:47,547
There's nothing here either.

690
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,505
- Any luck?

691
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:51,420
- Nope.
Nothing.

692
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:53,509
- You have the keys on you?
- Yeah.

693
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:54,641
Here, let me try something.

694
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:56,947
Hop in.Shut the trunk.

695
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:11,788
- I already pushed it.
Nothing happened.

696
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:22,712
- Okay, Chicago.

697
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:26,412
- I have a CI
who installs these things.

698
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:29,415
Engine has to be on and doors
closed in order for it to open.

699
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:33,549
- Okay, we got the dope.

700
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:36,465
Now we just gotta figure outwhere to deliver it to.

701
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:37,901
- Yep.

702
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:40,774
- We have Lucas' texts fromthe phone he was carrying.

703
00:34:40,817 --> 00:34:42,254
Since Harper said he started
doing business

704
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:43,429
with the Latin Players
about a month ago--

705
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:44,517
- Yeah.

706
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,909
- We need to scrub
that time period.

707
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:47,781
- There, on the 28th.
There's a text that says,

708
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:50,349
"Meeting's at 2.
Let's do 9 instead of 8."

709
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:51,741
- "Let's do 9 instead of 8"?

710
00:34:51,785 --> 00:34:54,831
But the meeting's at 2:00.Is that some sort of code?

711
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:58,879
- Well, here's Lucas' GPS data
from that day around that time.

712
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:00,576
- All right,
- so from 1:37 to 3:12,

713
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,274
he was in Brooklyn
down by the river.

714
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:04,406
Kristen, can you zoom in?
- Mm-hmm.

715
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,929
- Get a more specific look
at this.

716
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:08,541
Yeah, over here.
Can you drill down right there?

717
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:09,977
- Okay.

718
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:14,460
They met at 2:00 at a dock.

719
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:17,550
Pier nine instead
of pier eight.

720
00:35:17,593 --> 00:35:20,161
That's the meeting place.
- There it is.

721
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:27,908
- We've got 67 minutes to get
the drugs down to pier nine.

722
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:30,258
Unfortunately, the guy
we need to deliver the drugs

723
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:32,565
is at the city morgue.

724
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:38,397
- I'll go underas Lucas' friend.

725
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,616
I'll give him the cokein exchange for Harper's dad.

726
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,791
- No. These guys have done
their homework.

727
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:43,141
They're not gonna buy that.

728
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:45,012
- I get it, but I think
I can pull it off.

729
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:48,276
- No, I agree with OA.
It's too risky.

730
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,973
- So we need a plan C.

731
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,325
- Let me do it.

732
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:55,457
He's my father.

733
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:58,852
I'm the one who got himinto this awful situation.

734
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:00,680
So let me do it.

735
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:02,769
Let me do something meaningful.

736
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:05,424
Something that will make mefeel good about myself...

737
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:08,209
Please.

738
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,128
Gotta let me do it.

739
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:24,617
- You're gonna do great.

740
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,619
Just follow the plan
we laid out.

741
00:36:26,662 --> 00:36:29,404
- He doesn't get the secondbag until you see your father.

742
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:31,319
- Right.
Got it.

743
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:33,626
- And if your dad's notat the meeting place,

744
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:35,802
you tell the manto bring him there.

745
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:37,847
He'll say no.You stand your ground.

746
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:40,241
- You have more leverage
than you think.

747
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:41,634
This dope is worth
a lot of money,

748
00:36:41,677 --> 00:36:43,462
and that's all
they really care about.

749
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,291
- It's okay to be nervous.

750
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:47,509
They'd be suspiciousif you weren't.

751
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,473
You good?

752
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:56,562
- I'm good.

753
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:57,606
- Okay.

754
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,009
- Okay.

755
00:37:09,052 --> 00:37:10,706
Here we go.

756
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,795
- Alpha team in position.

757
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:04,369
- Where's Lucas?

758
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:05,674
- He sent me instead.

759
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:09,461
- And my product?

760
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:22,517
There's only one kilo here.

761
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,258
- The other four are close by.

762
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,912
- Close by doesn'tdo me no good.

763
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:27,566
- Show me where my father is,

764
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:30,133
and I'll get you
the other four.

765
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,700
- Don't get cute with me, mama.

766
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:34,660
I'll cut your throat.

767
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:36,923
Go get my dope.

768
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:38,446
- Let's get ready to move in.

769
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,579
- No, no.Give her a chance.

770
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:42,842
- You trying to get
your dad killed?

771
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:46,149
'Cause that's what's happen
if you keep playing.

772
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:49,631
- I need to see him.
- He's alive.

773
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:51,894
I promise.

774
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:54,549
- I need proof.

775
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:04,516
Right over there, chica.

776
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:08,955
- Okay, we got eyes on the dad.
We're good to go.

777
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:10,435
- Wait, wait, wait.

778
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:12,567
Let's see if we can get him
talking about Aman's murder.

779
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:14,874
As soon as we see a weapon,
we roll.

780
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:16,266
- Okay.

781
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,618
- Be a good girl,
go get my dope.

782
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:21,750
Do that,

783
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:23,665
Big Papa walks.

784
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:29,628
I'll go with you.

785
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:41,640
- So...

786
00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:43,642
So...

787
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:46,471
How do I know you're not gonna
kill me and my father

788
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:48,516
once I give you the dope?

789
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,825
- I don't kill civilians.Bad for business.

790
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:55,001
- You kill that Indian guy?

791
00:39:55,044 --> 00:39:56,742
He was a civilian.

792
00:39:56,785 --> 00:40:00,920
- I try my best,but I'm not perfect, mama.

793
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,608
You did good, Harper.

794
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:42,091
- FBI!
Don't move!

795
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:44,137
Drop your weapon now!

796
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,095
- Let me see your hands now!

797
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,622
- Hands up!
- Put the gun on the ground!

798
00:40:50,665 --> 00:40:53,625
Step away!
Put it down now!

799
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:57,367
- Get on the ground!
Get on the ground, now!

800
00:40:59,805 --> 00:41:00,632
Dad!

801
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:02,634
- Oh!

802
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:04,418
- Let me go!

803
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,028
Dad!

804
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:07,813
Dad!

805
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:10,424
Dad!

806
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:28,964
- Hey.
- Hey.

807
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:31,053
- I just filed my 302.
Do you need help with yours?

808
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:33,665
- Nah, I just finished.

809
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:38,452
- So, I have to admit,
I wasn't so sure about you.

810
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,585
- Yeah, well, I wasn't sure
about you either.

811
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:43,501
But you're all right.
For a fed.

812
00:41:45,677 --> 00:41:47,940
- You wanna grab a beer?

813
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:50,682
- I'm okay.

814
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:52,510
You don't have to look
after the new kid.

815
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:56,818
- I am pretty sure
you don't need looking after.

816
00:41:56,862 --> 00:41:58,690
Come on, you saved my life.

817
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:00,735
The least you can do
is let me buy you a drink.

818
00:42:00,779 --> 00:42:03,521
- For the tenth time,
I didn't save your life.

819
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:08,308
All right, let's grab a beer,

820
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:10,702
but only if you tell me
why you became a fed.

821
00:42:10,745 --> 00:42:11,790
I told you my reason.

822
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,356
It's only fair
you tell me yours.

823
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,010
- Deal.

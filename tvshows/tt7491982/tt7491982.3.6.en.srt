1
00:00:02,567 --> 00:00:04,482
- Come on, big man.

2
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:07,485
Take a deep breath,
and then knock it down.

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:10,271
Come on, man!
It's a free throw!

4
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:12,403
That means it's free!
No one's guarding you!

5
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:14,057
How do you miss that?

6
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:17,278
- Damn, Serg.

7
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:19,584
Looks like your boy
just shot a brick.

8
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:23,066
Hey, careful, those tears may
freeze to your face out there.

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,894
- You don't even
like basketball, Benny.

10
00:00:24,937 --> 00:00:27,897
- Nope, but I do like
watching your team lose.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,420
<i>Hey, that's fun as hell, man.</i>

12
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:30,465
- Aah!

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,599
- Keep your mouth shut
and open the gate.

14
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:36,862
Open the gate.

15
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:46,350
Everything's gonna be okay.

16
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:48,657
We're gonna take
a little walk.

You call out for help

19

or try to slip
out of these ties

20
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:04,499
and I'm gonna
put a bullet in you.

21
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:06,631
Are we clear?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:09,373
- Hey!

23
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:11,114
What the hell is going on?

24
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:14,117
Oh--

25
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:17,555
Get down, Sergio!

26
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:22,299
Serge--move!

27
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:23,996
- Let's go!

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,302

29
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:27,348
Run!

30
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:29,132
Come on!

I got you!

36
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:44,843
Get outta here.

Benny!

No, no!

No, Benny, no...

- Excuse me,
could I get the check please?

45
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,198
- I'll take care of that.
Thank you very much.

46
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:37,461
Excuse me, could you add a
blueberry scone to go, please?

47
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:38,941
- Hi.
- Hi.

48
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:41,552
- Everything okay?
I tried calling you.

49
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:42,814
Everything went to voicemail.

50
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:45,469
- Something came up,
a last-minute thing.

51
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:46,949
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm sorry.

52
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:48,733
You know that I would never
miss a breakfast with you

53
00:02:48,777 --> 00:02:51,258
unless it was important.
- Right. A work thing?

54
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:53,216
- No.
More, like, personal.

55
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,957
It's probably better
if I show you.

56
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:59,396
Only time I could get in
to see it was this morning.

57
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,920
Two bedrooms, walk in closets,

58
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:03,226
jetliner views.

59
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,097
Best part: smack dab
in the middle of Tribeca.

60
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,099
Seven-minute walk to work.
- This is gorgeous.

61
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:08,753
- Mm-hmm.

62
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:10,712
- This has to be so expensive.

63
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:12,583
But why are you even moving?

64
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:14,455
- Because I want you
to move in with me,

65
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:16,457
so that means
I need a bigger place.

67
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,470
- Wow.

68
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:37,129
- I know, I know.
I know it seems fast, okay?

69
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:40,045
But I've been thinking
about things, and Maggie,

70
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:41,743
you're really important to me.

71
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:43,658
- And you're important
to me, but--

72
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:46,269
- I thought that we should
just do it, you know?

73
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:47,836
See what happens.

74
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:51,143
- I mean, I like the idea.
- Uh-huh.

75
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:53,276
- But we've only been together
for a few months.

76
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,712
- Six.
- Fine, six.

77
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:56,497
- I think we'd have
a lot of fun in there.

78
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,978
Look at this big, beautiful
bathtub in the master.

79
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:01,066
Look at that.

80
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,285
- Yeah, like I said,
it's gorgeous.

81
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:05,897
Double homicide.

82
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:08,857
Two Customs Agents.
Um...

83
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,687
Can we talk about this later?
I need to think about it.

84
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,036
Bye.

85
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,604
<i></i>

86
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:18,649
- We got two dead and one
with a serious headwound.

87
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:19,998
- Possible concussion,

88
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,478
but I told them
that we need to talk to him

89
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:23,088
before they roll him
to the hospital.

90
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:24,742
- Okay, I'll go see what I can
find out about the witness.

91
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:26,527
-  All right,
can you coordinate with ERT

92
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,485
and then make sure
we get a rush on ballistics?

93
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:29,791
- Copy that.

94
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,358
- Any idea
what they were after?

95
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:33,011
- Took a look
at the security footage.

96
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:34,317
Shows them making off

97
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,231
with one of those metal tankers
over there.

98
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,624
Video quality's not too good,

99
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,278
so I can't tell which one yet.

100
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,801
I'll get it forwarded
to the JOC.

101
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:42,760
- They're ready to roll
the witness to the hospital.

102
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,721
- I mean,
job's always been low-key.

103
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:49,332
I just got Benny hired
four months ago.

104
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:51,508
We were friends
from high school.

105
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:53,467
It was supposed to be cushy.
I told him

106
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,207
the only sure thing's
a government job, you know?

107
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:56,383
- Yeah.

108
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:58,646
I'm really sorry
about your friend.

109
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:00,517
Can you tell us anything
about his killer?

110
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:02,606
- It was two guys,
black ski masks,

111
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,348
gloves, but I could
see their wrists.

112
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:06,784
I'm pretty sure
they were white.

113
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:09,047
Maybe 30s, 40s, if I had
to guess from their voices.

114
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:11,180
- Did you notice any scars
or tattoos on those wrists?

115
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:12,486
- No.

116
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:14,401
Once that gun was on my face,
I froze up.

117
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,446
Hard to think straight
when that happens,

118
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,188
but one of them
had a gold watch on.

119
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,104
I do remember that.
I'm not sure what kind though.

120
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:24,454
- They took a tanker.
Do you have any idea why?

121
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:26,326
- Not really.

122
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,980
It was anhydrous ammonia,
for farming, right?

123
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:31,592
- Yeah, bomb makers
and meth dealers like it too.

124
00:05:31,635 --> 00:05:33,245
- Hey, sorry, I'm gonna
have to cut this short.

125
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:34,377
He's got a possible
brain bleed,

126
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:35,509
so if you guys need
to talk more,

127
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,249
it's gonna have to be
at the hospital.

128
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:40,078
- Thank you.
Take care.

129
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:41,906
- Check it out.

130
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,081
- What you got?

131
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,605
- Blood.

132
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:49,349
- And since our dead agents
are over there...

133
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:54,005
- One of our suspects
is wounded.

134
00:05:57,008 --> 00:05:59,924
- Hey, morning, guys.
So listen up.

135
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:02,449
Benjamin Crawford, Michael
Sanders, two federal officers,

136
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:03,928
were both murdered last night.

137
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:06,061
Lucky for us, they managed
to tag one of our suspects

138
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,193
with a bullet,
so let's check all hospitals

139
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:10,500
for white males in their 30s
with gunshot wounds.

140
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,110
And somebody work the phones.

141
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,373
Call local drugstores,

142
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,331
check for any suspicious
first-aid purchases

143
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,593
near the warehouse, yeah?
Good.

144
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:19,030
- Hey, where are we
with surveillance video?

145
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:20,641
- Putting it up now.

146
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:22,556
Can't get a visual
on the suspect,

147
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,427
but I got a make and model
of the getaway truck.

148
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:27,909
It's green 2002 Ford F350,
diesel.

149
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:29,824
- Okay, let me guess, stolen?

150
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,435
- Probably. The plate belongs
to a blue Toyota Camry.

151
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,351
- All right, let's put
a BOLO out on the F350.

152
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,571
Not every day you see truck
pulling a 1,000 gallon tanker

153
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:39,007
around New York.

154
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,401
Hey, Elise, what do we know
about the suspect's DNA?

155
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:42,880
- No hits in CODIS,

156
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:44,491
but ballistics recovered
from the scene

157
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:45,927
is a match
from an unsolved gang murder

158
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,145
in Brooklyn two months back.

159
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:48,712
No arrests were made,

160
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:50,235
but notes suggest involvement

161
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,933
by a gang
called the 3-4-7 Knights,

162
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:53,369
a white meth gang
based in Queens.

163
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,153
- It makes sense.
There's been a rise

164
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:56,807
in ammonia thefts
the last nine months or so.

165
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:59,636
COVID has broken down the usual
chemical supply chain.

166
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,247
- Right, so the Knights
were desperate for ammonia,

167
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:05,381
couldn't find any to buy,
so they stole it instead.

168
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,165
- Let's get
the gang unit involved.

169
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:08,340
- Yeah.

170
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:13,476
- Knights are fairly new,
but their roots aren't.

171
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,783
Small white gang,
they got their start in prison,

172
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:19,047
made their money on the streets
cooking and selling meth.

173
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,136
Meth prices
have skyrocketed lately

174
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:22,529
due to the shortage
of chemicals.

175
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:24,269
- Explains the timing
of the heist.

176
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:26,010
- Exactly.
The Knights are smart.

177
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:28,143
They think more like
businessmen than tweakers.

178
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:29,536
- Unless you try
to prevent them

179
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:30,841
from stealing, I don't know,
a bunch of ammonia,

180
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:32,408
and then they'll pump you
full of bullets.

181
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,280
- Here's our current list
of known member and associates.

182
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:36,978
Their gang leader
was murdered a month ago,

183
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:38,980
so that left a power vacuum.

184
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:40,329
- Do we know
who took his place?

185
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:42,723
- No, gang's pretty tight-knit.

186
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:45,247
- NYPD just found
the getaway truck

187
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,336
abandoned in Long Island City.
They're holding it for us now.

188
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,946
- All right,
send Tiffany and Scola.

189
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,209
- Yep.

190
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:53,385
- Not a lot of trucks
in this area.

191
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:55,779
Lady walking her dog
noticed the busted windshield,

192
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:58,303
peaked inside, saw all
the blood, gave us a call.

193
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,358
- This guy's not getting far
losing this much blood.

194
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:12,535
He's gonna need
medical attention ASAP.

195
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:16,017
- Hey, Tiff, we got
a drip pattern over here.

196
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:21,370
Based on the distance
between the droplets,

197
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,154
it looks like
he moved pretty quickly

198
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:24,547
through here heading east

199
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,810
based on the direction
of the trail.

200
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:30,292
All right, no hospitals, urgent
cares, or clinics in the area.

201
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:32,642
Not a great place
to be bleeding to death.

202
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:35,079
- So the question is,
why jump out here?

203
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:38,692
When I was still NYPD,

204
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:41,259
I arrested this undertaker.

205
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:44,088
The guy's side gig was patching
up gangbangers for cash.

206
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:46,656
- Mmm, sounds like
quite the undertaking.

207
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:49,790
- There are no morticians
around here,

208
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,400
but there's a vet clinic
up the block.

209
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,452
There's a light on
in the back.

210
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:13,117
- Sorry, we're closed.

211
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:14,336
- FBI.

212
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,164
We're looking for a suspect
in the area.

213
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:18,688
White male, 30s, 40s?
- Gunshot wound?

214
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,211
- I'm sorry,
I haven't seen anyone.

215
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:22,213
I mean, why would someone
like that come here?

216
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:23,954
- You mind
if we check your cameras

217
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:25,173
to see if he came through here?

218
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:26,696
- I, uh, don't know how to.

219
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,219
I'd have to call
the building owner--

220
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:30,395
- We're coming in.
Step back, on the ground.

221
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:40,841
- All clear back there.

222
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:42,930
- All right, ma'am,
up in the chair.

223
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,549
Start talking,

224
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,812
and you better make it count,
because if you lie to us again,

225
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:57,597
you're going to jail
for harboring a murderer.

226
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,033
- Murderer?

227
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:01,426
He never said he did
something like that, I swear.

228
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,777
- Who never said?
You know his name?

229
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,344
- Damon.
He's my cousin.

230
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:09,217
He called a couple hours ago,
forced me to help him.

231
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,784
I just sewed up his shoulder

232
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:12,089
and dropped him off
at the subway.

233
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,004
I don't even know
where he stay right now.

234
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,745
- All right, anyone with Damon
when he arrived?

235
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,225
Another white guy
around the same age?

236
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:19,793
- No.
But you can check the cameras.

237
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:21,795
I swear I've told you
everything I know.

238
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,449
- We're gonna need
Damon's full name

239
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:26,451
and the cell number
that he called you from.

240
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:30,673
- We've just identified
our wounded suspect.

241
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:33,458
Damon Marshall appears to be
a foot soldier for the Knights.

242
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:35,243
He was convicted
of aggravated assault

243
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:37,245
in New Hampshire,
one of the only states

244
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:40,248
to not require a DNA sample
for misdemeanors

245
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,598
or waylaying your coworker

246
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,295
with a pipe wrench, apparently.

247
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,341
- Work history shows Damon
used to drive a truck

248
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:48,082
for CPE Logistics.

249
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,823
Picked up shipments
from the Queens CFS warehouse

250
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:50,998
at least a dozen times,

251
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,129
according to the company
driver logs.

252
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:53,435
- Which how he and his friend

253
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:55,045
likely knew about
the ammonia tankers.

254
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:56,699
One mystery solved,
two shooters still at large.

255
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:59,310
Any updates on
our mysterious second shooter?

256
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:00,964
- We checked the cameras
around the vet.

257
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:02,487
Damon arrived solo.

258
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:04,315
- Which means the other shooter
must've been dropped off

259
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,361
with the tanker
before Damon went to get help.

260
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:08,276
- Looks like the cell phone
that Damon used to call the vet

261
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:09,756
was shut off two hours ago,

262
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,801
but before that, pinged off
a tower in East Flatbush.

263
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:13,629
- Okay, East Flatbush.

264
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,805
Does Damon have
a registered address there?

265
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,024
Relatives, friends?

266
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,939
- Probation records show
he has an aunt

267
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:21,681
at 289 East 92nd Street,
apartment 3C.

268
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,813
- Boom.
- We're on it.

269
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:25,902
- Mind a third wheel
on this one?

270
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,602
- Yeah, sure, we could use the
extra body, but you're driving.

271
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:37,131
- Mrs. Clay, FBI!
We need to speak with you!

272
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,614
- About what?

273
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:44,051
- We're looking for
your nephew, Damon.

274
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,443
- Damon?
Is everything okay?

275
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:46,836
- Anyone else in the apartment
with you?

276
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,795
- No, no, I live alone.

277
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,710
- Mrs. Clay, if we could
just come in and have a chat,

278
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:52,146
that would really help us out.

279
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,671
He's running!

280
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,847
- Aah! What are you doing?
- Up against the wall!

281
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,806
Don't move.
- You can't come in here!

282
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:02,983
<i></i>

283
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:11,252
- Clear.

284
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:13,254
- Fire escape.
There's a courtyard below.

285
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,430
We need a cutoff at the street.

286
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:18,563
- Damon's armed.

287
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:21,392
We should probably
stick together.

288
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:22,742
Nestor!

289
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:24,482
- Apartment's clear,
no sign of second suspect.

290
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:26,920
In foot pursuit of Damon.
Roll backup, ASAP.

291
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:43,240
- Lost visual of the suspect.

292
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:46,113
Clearing the rear
courtyard area now.

293
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:49,899
<i></i>

294
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:58,473
- 93rd and Clarkson are clear.
I'm headed your way.

295
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,091
Vertiz!

296
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,496
Aah!

297
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,869
<i>- All units are on scene.</i>

298
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,915
<i>We need help freshening up
that perimeter.</i>

299
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:57,401
- Any chance that phone pin
is 5568?

300
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:59,012
- Oh, we're gonna need
more than a pin

301
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:00,840
to get anything off of this.
His phone's pretty banged up.

302
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,537
- Hopefully the JOC
can still pull something.

303
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,365
- Yeah, units still got
the aunt upstairs,

304
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,497
so I'll see if she knows
what this number is.

305
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,759
- I'll meet you there.

306
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:09,283
- Is everything okay?

307
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:10,893
- Okay?

308
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:12,764
Do you know how close
you just came?

309
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:14,244
- Hey, I'm fine.

310
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:17,465
We had this dude in the pocket
the whole time.

311
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:22,600
Hell of a shot though.

312
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:24,515
Really was.

313
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:28,911
- You didn't have to shoot him!

314
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:31,174
He would've surrendered
if you just asked.

315
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:32,523
- He didn't give us a chance.

316
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:34,917
Ma'am, your nephew killed
two federal officers.

317
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:38,007
So you were harboring a federal
fugitive, and that is a felony.

318
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:41,489
- I-I had no idea.

319
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:44,492
- Okay, did he mention anything
about a robbery or a shooting?

320
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:46,015
- No.

321
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,278
Every time I asked him
what happened,

322
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:51,020
he would just shut me down.

323
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:54,197
- He had the numbers "5568"
written on his hand.

324
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:56,025
That mean anything to you?

325
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:57,548
- No.

326
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,641
- All right, Damon Marshall,
our first suspect,

327
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:05,121
is no longer with us.

328
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:08,081
So our focus is now
on shooter number two.

329
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:10,431
What we know so far is
he's a white male in his 30s,

330
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:11,954
affiliated with the Knights,

331
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:14,391
and he has
an expensive gold watch.

332
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:16,306
Ian, anything
from Damon's phone?

333
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,742
- No, nothing.
It was scrubbed.

334
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,222
- Right.

335
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:21,007
Kelly, tell me something good.

336
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,531
- Aw, sorry, boss, I'm
striking out more than uh...

337
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:25,533
- Reggie Jackson.
- Who?

338
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:27,056
- Career strikeout leader,

339
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,232
but he's also in the
Hall of Fame, which means...

340
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:32,496
- He was really good?
- It means he kept swinging.

341
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:34,759
What about you?

342
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:36,196
I do not need a home run here.

343
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,807
Broken-bat, opposite-field
single would suffice.

344
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,417
- Yeah, I have no idea what
you're talking about, sorry.

345
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:42,854
But I do know that ERT

346
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,465
didn't recover
any usable prints.

347
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:45,596
The perps
must've been gloved up

348
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,902
while they were inside
the truck.

349
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,208
- Right.

350
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:49,644
- Okay, let's take another look
at the data.

351
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,472
Surveillance video,
cell phone records...

352
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:55,606
- I just had a meet with a
known associate of the Knights.

353
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,218
A low level street dealer
named Lyle Porter.

354
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:00,698
I figure that's our best way
of gathering intel.

355
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:02,091
- Okay, I know where
you're going with this,

356
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:04,093
but it takes a long time
to flip up to a shot caller.

357
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,399
- That's why
I'm coming out hot.

358
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:06,661
I'm gonna ask for enough weight

359
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:08,271
that I know this guy, Lyle,
can't handle.

360
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:09,446
It means he's gotta loop in

361
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,144
one of the senior members
of the gang.

362
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:12,449
I make one buy,

363
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:14,277
bust him for meth distribution,

364
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:17,237
then leverage our boy for some
information on these homicides.

365
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:21,154
- It's worth a shot.

366
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,028
- All right, if it brings us
to the murderers

367
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:28,204
and keeps the meth
off the streets.

368
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:30,380
But I want Maggie and OA
in on that operation.

369
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,295
- Hey.

370
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,037
<i></i>

371
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:46,092
- Heads up.

372
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,007
I got Lyle walking through
the south end of the park.

373
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:52,620
- He's alone.

374
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:56,841
- No sign
of countersurveillance

375
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:59,279
by foot or vehicle.

376
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:03,892
- It's good to see you,
brother.

377
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:06,025
- The last time we talked,
you was just kinda nibbling,

378
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,852
but look at you now, bro.
Buying big bulk.

379
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:09,637
- Well, like I told you,

380
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,074
my boy Mosi's got
a couple spots in Miami,

381
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:14,076
a spot in Lauderdale,
good clientele.

382
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,339
A lot of money to burn, not too
much to burn it on right now,

383
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:18,776
you know?

384
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,604
- So you talk to your people?

385
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:22,302
- Yeah, man, we're good, man.

386
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:24,260
I mean, they're on board.

387
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:26,958
- Where they at?

388
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:29,918
- They're in the car waiting.

389
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:32,181
- What are they waiting for?
- It's a lot a crystal, bro,

390
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:33,835
so they just wanna make sure
the money's here.

391
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:35,141
- But you know me, Lyle.
What, all of a sudden

392
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:36,707
I'm some clown's gonna
show up without paper?

393
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:38,405
- No, I know your legit.
That's why I'm here.

394
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:39,928
Just let me see the paper--

395
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:42,887
- Ain't nobody seeing the money
until I see the product.

396
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:46,587
- A'right.

397
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,980
Well, their product,
their rules.

398
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:55,291
But if your boy
doesn't want to cooperate...

399
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:01,297
- Yo, hold up.

400
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,995
Hold up.

401
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:13,440
- Hey.

402
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,398
Money's all there, all right?

403
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:17,139
Call your people now
or we walk.

404
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:19,533
- All right,
just chill a sec, man.

405
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,842
- Gun. <i>
- Copy that.</i>

406
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:26,366
- Give me the damn money.

407
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:30,631
- We moving in?

408
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:32,807
- No, no, no.
Wait for the signal.

409
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,722
- Give me the damn money.

410
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,376
Yo, you deaf!?

411
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,509
Give me the money,
or I blow your brains out, huh?

412
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:41,337
- Lyle, why are you
doing this, man?

413
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:42,773
- I ain't asking you again.

414
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,819
<i>- Nestor,
just give him the money.</i>

415
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:46,603
Let him walk.

416
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:49,737
- Give him the money, Nick.
It's not a big deal.

417
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,869
- Yeah, Nick.

418
00:18:51,913 --> 00:18:54,002
- Nestor!

419
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:56,309
<i></i>

420
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,888
- FBI!
You're under arrest!

421
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:14,196
- Yo, you're FBI, bro?

422
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,763
Oh-ho-ho, that's cold, bro.

423
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:17,199
That's real cold.

424
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,029
- I love this job.

425
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,170
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.

426
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,476
- Assaulting a federal officer,
that's 20 years, right, OA?

427
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,999
- That's correct, Vertiz.

428
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:37,306
- That's not fair, man.
I don't know you were Feds!

429
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,178
- Obviously, Lyle.
That's the point.

430
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,658
- Good at your jobs, bro.

431
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:45,967
Look, man, I'm starving 'cause
of this supply shortage.

432
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,839
There ain't nobody
in pocket right now.

433
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:52,278
- We know that the Knights
stole chemicals to cook.

434
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:54,018
They murdered two
federal officers for it, Lyle.

435
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:56,325
- I don't know nothing
about--about no robberies

436
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:57,848
or no murders.

437
00:19:57,892 --> 00:19:59,328
- Okay, so what do you know,
Lyle?

438
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,504
What can you tell us
about the Knights?

439
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:03,245
Who's calling the shots?

440
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:09,686
Uh, his name is Clint.

441
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,471
Clint Helms.

442
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:13,342
He used to cook,
but now he's the boss.

443
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:15,431
- Clint?
- Yeah, yeah.

444
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:17,390
- Clint the type of guy
to get his hands dirty?

445
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:20,219
- Yeah, man, yeah,
if he needs to,

446
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:23,047
but he's all about money
these days.

447
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,440
I don't think he's your man.

448
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:26,050
It don't make any sense

449
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:28,792
'cause he just told me that
his meth business was on ice.

450
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:30,881
He said--he said
they couldn't get no ammonia

451
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:32,622
so they couldn't cook
no product.

452
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,885
- Clint said that?
- Yeah.

453
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:36,931
- He said he couldn't cook
because he needs ammonia?

454
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:39,063
- Yeah, that's why I tried
to jack you.

455
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:42,589
Yeah, I couldn't get
no product to sell, man.

456
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:45,896
So I couldn't walk away
from a pay day like that.

457
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,985
- Ah, okay, hey, wait, so
tell me something real quick.

458
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,509
Where's Clint hang out?

459
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:51,554
- Aw...
- Where's he at?

460
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:54,383
- He, uh, he hangs out
at this place in Queens

461
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,255
we call "Ivory,"

462
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:59,083
and they have kind of a
off the radar sort of thing.

463
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:00,433
- Yes.
- Yeah.

464
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:02,609
- Okay, that's good, Lyle.
That is very helpful.

465
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:04,393
Hey, so listen to me
real quick.

466
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:05,742
Listen to me real quick.
- Yeah.

467
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,353
- So if you wanna avoid
doing time...

468
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:11,748
- This is what you're gonna do.

469
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:19,321
- 'Sup, man?

470
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,758
- What's this all about?
- Well, it's just--

471
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:25,806
there's just some people
that wanna meet you.

472
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:33,727
All right, so this is Clint,

473
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,121
and these are my friends
from Miami.

474
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:39,646
Nick, Mosi,

475
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:41,038
they're in town
to make some moves.

476
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:43,737
- Ladies, why don't you
give us a second?

477
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,042
- 'Course.

478
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:50,352
- It's nice to meet you, man.

479
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:52,572
That's a nice watch, man.

480
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:57,185
I hear you're the man to be
talking to about some business.

481
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:58,795
- Is that what you hear?

482
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:01,624
- They're good, man.
You got my word on that.

483
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:06,673
- You guys seem all right,

484
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:08,979
but no business to talk about.

485
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:10,633
We're in a drought.

486
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,113
The town's bone dry.

487
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:17,205
- That's okay.
Enough business talk.

488
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:19,381
Clint, please sit.
Lyle, pour your friend a drink.

489
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:21,035
- Yeah, bro.

490
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:25,387
- So where you from, man?
New York?

491
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,693
- Stanton Island.

492
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:29,609
- Yeah, cheers.

493
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,262
- Cheers, boys.
Yes, cheers, man.

494
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:33,439
Good to meet you, Clint.

495
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:35,832
- Thanks for drink, fellas.

496
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:38,313
- Where you going?
- Meeting a friend.

497
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,751
- Tell him to come over, man.
We'll order another bottle.

498
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:44,537
- He's old-school, he don't
trip with people like you.

499
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:46,800
- Come on, man.

500
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:47,931
Clint, I ain't
letting you leave

501
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,237
without another drink,
my brother.

502
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,457
Oh, oh, oh--

503
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,024
- Sorry.
- Yo, you, what're you doin'?

504
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:55,809
- Hey, hey, hey!
- What're you doin'?

505
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:57,071
- Sorry, man, sorry.
- Dude!

506
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:59,160
- My bad, bro, my bad.
- Get some napkins.

507
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:00,291
- I'm gettin' napkins.

508
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:01,684
- That's his bad.
He's wasted.

509
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:03,599
He's been here all night.

510
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:05,775
- Pop the SIM card.
Get his phone number.

511
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,734
- What?

512
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:10,345
Cover me.

513
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,879
- Where's my phone?
- Your phone?

514
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:32,454
- Ah, it's not--no.

515
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,456
I got you right here, brother.

516
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,197
Phone's all safe.

517
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,591
Just dried it off
like nothing ever happened.

518
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:41,420
You know, my bad.

519
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,509
Damn.

520
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:46,555
- Thanks for the drink.

521
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,427
- Cheers, brother.
Be good.

522
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,127
- Hey, I'm sorry, man.

523
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,434
- It's all good, man.
- Let's go upstairs.

524
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:59,220
- Oh, sorry about that.

525
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,185
- What the hell was that?

526
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,579
You cannot take someone's
SIM card without a warrant.

527
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,189
- He's using a burner phone,
Mags.

528
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:13,974
What good is a warrant
if we don't know his digits?

529
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:16,237
- That could've gone wrong
a hundred different ways.

530
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,718
- But it didn't.

531
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:21,721
- You got lucky.
Again.

532
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,637
- Or maybe I'm just good.

533
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,553
Think about it.

534
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:29,250
Somebody gets lucky
all the time,

535
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:30,338
maybe it's not just luck.

536
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:32,427
Maybe it's something else.

537
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,124
Yeah.

538
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:42,350
I know what I'm doing.

539
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,483
I promise.

540
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:47,442
Hey.

541
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,098
<i></i>

542
00:25:04,372 --> 00:25:05,765
- Clint Helms could be
our second shooter.

543
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:07,070
The problem is,
he's not the only white guy

544
00:25:07,114 --> 00:25:08,463
who wears a gold watch,
so we need evidence.

545
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,334
Ian, where are we
with Clint's burner?

546
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:12,641
- Uh, pulling what I have now.

547
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:14,121
At the time of the robbery,

548
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:15,992
it looks like Clint's burner
pinged off a cell tower

549
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:18,168
within a mile
of the CFS warehouse.

550
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:19,822
- Can we narrow it down
any more than that?

551
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:21,171
- No, his GPS was
turned off manually,

552
00:25:21,215 --> 00:25:23,609
so I can't pin him
directly to the warehouse,

553
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:25,480
but like I said,
we know he was close by.

554
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,874
- What about after the robbery?

555
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,963
- Cell towers put him

556
00:25:30,006 --> 00:25:32,792
on the eastern side
of Stanton Island.

557
00:25:32,835 --> 00:25:34,358
He was stationary
at that location

558
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:35,838
for over an hour that morning.

559
00:25:35,882 --> 00:25:37,840
Huh.

560
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:38,885
He spent a lot of time there

561
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:40,277
over the last three days
as well.

562
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:41,975
- We know that they had
to unload the tanker

563
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:43,672
somewhere between
the CFS Warehouse

564
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:45,413
and the location
of the abandoned pickup truck,

565
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:47,546
which was discovered
two hours later, right?

566
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,112
- Right, what are you
getting at?

567
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,724
- So maybe this area, the
eastern part of Stanton Island,

568
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:53,552
maybe that's where
Clint cooks his meth.

569
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,815
- Right, so they dropped
the tanker off

570
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:58,905
there at his lab.
That makes sense.

571
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:00,471
That part of the island's
all abandoned warehouses

572
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:01,647
and industrial parks.

573
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,083
It's a great place
to hide a meth lab.

574
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:05,564
- Have Tiffany and Scola
coordinate with air units.

575
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:06,869
Grid search the entire radius.

576
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:08,871
If we connect Clint
to that tanker,

577
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:11,265
we can connect him
to the two murders.

578
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:20,491
- Well, this is the end
of the grid for this road.

579
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:22,493
- Okay, keep driving.

580
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:25,409
There's lots of good places
to hide around here.

581
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,891
Airship, this is ground unit.
Any luck up there?

582
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:30,589
<i>- No tanker sightings.</i>

583
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,069
<i>We're gonna circle around
and try a different approach.</i>

584
00:26:33,113 --> 00:26:35,637
- Copy that.

585
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:37,813
- Maybe Clint just emptied
the tanker here,

586
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:39,423
ditched it somewhere else.

587
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:43,689
- Maybe, but he was still here
doing something for an hour.

588
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:48,650
Hold on.
Look at that warehouse.

589
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:51,131
You notice anything?
- 5568.

590
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:04,492
<i></i>

591
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:19,333
- Oh, yeah.
You smell that?

592
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:20,943
- Yeah, that's a biohazard.

593
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:22,989
Exigent circumstances.

594
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,616
It's empty.

595
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:56,283
I see someone.
A white male.

596
00:27:58,851 --> 00:28:00,330
- Oh, yeah.

597
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:03,682
FBI, do not move.

598
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,118
Set it down

599
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:09,296
and raise your hands
where I can see them.

600
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:11,167
What is that, acid?

601
00:28:11,211 --> 00:28:13,517
- You come any closer,
you just might find out.

602
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:16,172
- Set it down now!

603
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:19,001
- And if I don't?

604
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:21,438
- I shoot you in your head.

605
00:28:37,193 --> 00:28:38,717
- Step away from the table.

606
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,414
Face away from me.

607
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:51,251
- So the guy we arrested
just lawyered up.

608
00:28:51,294 --> 00:28:52,861
The good news is,
he left behind some evidence.

609
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:54,297
ERT's combing
the warehouse now.

610
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:55,777
- Any chance
he's our second shooter?

611
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,257
- No, he's too short.
5'9".

612
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,259
Surveillance photos put
the shooter at 6 foot plus.

613
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:00,434
- Hey, good news.

614
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:01,783
ERT pulled prints
off the empty tanker.

615
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,045
They're a match for Clint's.

616
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:05,613
- Bring him in now.
- Yeah.

617
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,528
- FBI, don't move!

618
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:09,138
- Let's see your hands, now!

619
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:12,098
- Hands up!
- Show me your hands!

620
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:13,795
- What about a warrant?

621
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,319
- Show me your hands!
back up!

622
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:19,105
Now!

623
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:35,208
- Hey! Hey!

624
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:45,958
Clint Helms,
you're under arrest

625
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:48,743
for the murder
of two federal officers.

<i></i>

627
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,098
- Hey.

628
00:29:56,142 --> 00:29:58,100
Preliminary tests show
that Clint's gun is a match

629
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,667
to three slugs pulled
from the crime scene.

630
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,669
- We also have agents executing
warrants on the apartment

and his car.

632

- Great.
All right, use what we have,

and what we don't have,
for that matter,

00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:06,935
to obtain a confession.

635
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:08,154
We also need to find out
where all the meth is.

636
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:09,459
Who is he working with?

637
00:30:09,503 --> 00:30:10,765
Who would he sell it to?

638
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,636
- Yeah, hey, it's Scola.
You got all of us, go.

639
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,726
- ERT found trace amounts
of nitric acid concentrate.

640
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,945
They also found ice packs

641
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:19,382
and several empty
fuel cannisters.

642
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:24,126
<i>Look, I don't want to jump
to conclusions here, but...</i>

643
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,390
- He's not making meth.
He's making a bomb.

644
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:38,401
- Where's the bomb, Clint?

645
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:40,099
- Don't know what
you're talking about.

646
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:42,536
- We're talking death penalty
if that thing goes off.

647
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,843
- I'm already there, bro.

648
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,670
Two federal murders?

649
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:49,499
Can't kill me twice,
you know what I mean?

650
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:51,675
- You used the chemicals
to make ammonia nitrate,

651
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:54,243
supplemented it with the AN
found in ice packs.

652
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:56,071
- Nitromethane.
- Burns hotter than diesel.

653
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:57,856
- You know, it'd almost
be impressive

654
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,292
if you didn't copy
the whole thing.

655
00:30:59,335 --> 00:31:00,554
- Yeah?

656
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:02,512
Don't know
what you're talking about.

657
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:04,993
- Listen, man, you help us out,

658
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:06,560
we'll take the death penalty
off the table.

659
00:31:06,603 --> 00:31:07,996
We'll tell prosecutors that
you're willing to cooperate.

660
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,911
- I'd rather die

661
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:12,044
than cooperate with you.

662
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:15,830
<i></i>

663
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,182
- We found $100,000 in cash

664
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:22,010
in a gym bag
in Clint's apartment.

665
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:24,752
Big bills, so it's likely
not drug money.

666
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:26,014
- No, that sounds
like bomb money.

667
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:28,669
- Yeah.
ERT's processing it for prints.

668
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:30,105
- Okay, good.

669
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:32,673
So the JOC is digging through
Clint's recent contacts.

670
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:34,109
NSA and Homeland Security

671
00:31:34,153 --> 00:31:35,545
are working
the domestic terror angle.

672
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:37,243
- And according
to our bomb techs,

673
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:39,636
we're looking at about 3,000
pounds of explosive material.

674
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,464
We're talking Oklahoma City.

675
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:49,168
- Excuse me, but I just--

676
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:51,126
I was digging back
through Clint's prison records,

677
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,693
and they show
when he was in Greenville,

678
00:31:52,736 --> 00:31:53,999
he was aligned with
an anti-government group

679
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:55,478
called The Army of Rebels.

680
00:31:55,522 --> 00:31:57,524
- Yeah, I know them.
They're a hardcore prison gang.

681
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:58,917
All white.

682
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,961
He probably joined
for protection.

683
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:01,310
- Yeah.

684
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:04,444
- Wait.

685
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:06,968
That's the guy
that Clint met at the club.

686
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:20,939
- Hey, fingerprints from
the money at Clint's residence,

687
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,853
are matched to Robby Wilkerson.

688
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:25,987
He's a 44-year-old Army vet,
discharged as an E4

689
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:27,554
after a training exercise
injury.

690
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:30,252
Most recently he served
four years in Greenville,

691
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:32,298
and he shared a cell
with our friend, Clint Helms.

692
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:33,995
- And we have located him yet?
- Uh, we got units

693
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,779
checking in
on his last known address.

694
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:37,172
We're into friends and family,

695
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:38,652
seeing if anyone's seen him
in the past 24 hours.

696
00:32:38,695 --> 00:32:41,220
- Where are we with his phone
and his social media?

697
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:43,004
- Phone is a dead end.
It's been off all day.

698
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:44,179
- I was able to look into

699
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:45,833
Wilkerson's
social media usernames

700
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:48,792
and cross-reference them
on unregulated message boards.

701
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:52,100
I found dozens of posts
with the same online handle.

702
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:53,623
Most of them from the past year

703
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,974
are--surprise, surprise--
anti-government screeds.

704
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,105
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

705
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:58,280
"Government is trampling
on the rights

706
00:32:58,324 --> 00:32:59,629
"of God-fearing
American people,

707
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:01,805
restricting personal freedoms
and liberties."

708
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:04,504
- He also has a serious
man-crush on Timothy McVeigh.

709
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:06,506
- Any indicators
or specific targets mentioned?

710
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:08,987
- Possibly.
There's lots of recent tirades

711
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,206
about the removal
of Confederate monuments.

712
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,469
"When all of the federal
buildings in New York

713
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:15,689
"are named after radical
left-wing politicians

714
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:17,647
and judges."
- I think I have a location.

715
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:19,606
I checked the CCTV cameras
outside the Ivory Club.

716
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,303
- Pull it up.
- Camera shows Clint

717
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:24,176
and Wilkerson driving away
in gray Ford van.

718
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:26,439
Perfect fit for the size bomb
we're talking about.

719
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:28,006
Plates came back
to a rental company

720
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:29,137
called Venture Rentals.

721
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:30,356
They didn't even know
it was gone.

722
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,053
They said someone
must've stolen it.

723
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:34,490
- Tell me they have anti-theft
tracking on all their vehicles.

724
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:37,145
- They're tracking it now.
Yes, I'm still here.

725
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:39,539
North on Broadway,
crossing Chambers.

726
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:41,584
- Alert all units in the area
to the suspect's vehicle.

727
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:42,716
- Yeah.

728
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,022
- The van just turned
east on Worth,

729
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,546
but the signal just died.
- Wait it died how?

730
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:48,113
- The Ted Weiss
Federal Building

731
00:33:48,156 --> 00:33:49,505
is on the corner of Worth.

732
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:51,551
The underground garage
would block the signal.

733
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:53,118
- Go now.

734
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:11,788
- First up, we need
to evacuate the building.

735
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:13,486
- Let's split up.
Take it floor by floor.

736
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:16,271
That gray van's here somewhere.
- All right.

737
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:18,882
- All right, let's move.
Main lobby!

738
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:20,449
We gotta get everyone out now.

739
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:30,677
- Please step this way, sir.

740
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,895
Keep moving.
- All the way down--

741
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:34,420
- Hey, FBI!
Don't move!

742
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:35,725
- Suspect's on the run,

743
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:37,814
back of the building
towards the intersection.

744
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:52,568
- Where's the bomb, huh?
Where is it!?

745
00:34:52,612 --> 00:34:53,961
- You'll find out soon enough.

746
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:55,789
- Where is it!?

747
00:34:55,832 --> 00:34:57,095
- We got him.

748
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:58,444
- All right,
the response truck is en route,

749
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:00,228
but bomb squad's
still four minutes out.

750
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:03,101
- Okay.
Everybody clear this block now.

751
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,408
- Wait, where are you going?
- To find the bomb.

752
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:08,454
Maggie, we don't have a choice.

753
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:10,847
- Okay, go, go.

754
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,156
- This is Special Agent
Maggie Bell.

755
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,462
I need to speak
with Carla Flores

756
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:19,160
from the Bomb Squad
immediately.

757
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:22,120
Well, find her,
we have a live bomb.

758
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:24,252
- I located
the suspect's vehicle.

759
00:35:24,296 --> 00:35:25,775
It is in B2,

760
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:27,777
west-facing towards
the front of the building.

761
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:44,707
Okay.

762
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:48,233
Looks like we have
seven barrels of ANFO...

763
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:53,238
Closed circuit loop...

764
00:35:57,894 --> 00:35:59,896
Feeding into...

765
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:04,292
A...

766
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,560
Central timer power unit.

767
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,478
- Okay, Flores is saying
that you need to find a way

768
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:19,046
to separate and open up
the circuit.

769
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:22,919
<i></i>

770
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:33,582
Okay.

771
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:36,150
The bad news: the blasting caps
have redundancies,

772
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,762
so if I pull a wire, it could
trigger a switch and detonate.

773
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:49,990
And some more bad news.

774
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:53,341
This is bomb is on a timer.
2 minutes and 40 seconds.

775
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,300
<i>I repeat,
2 minutes and 40 seconds.</i>

776
00:36:57,476 --> 00:36:59,739
- Is there a safe arm switch?

777
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:07,007
- Maggie, okay.

778
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,574
Oh, Maggie.

779
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:11,316
Carla, where would
the switch be?

780
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,534
<i>- It's typically
hidden somewhere</i>

781
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:13,970
<i>in the front of the vehicle.</i>

782
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:15,276
<i>It can be as small
as a mike switch.</i>

783
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,278
- Okay.

784
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:18,975
- How's it going over there,
Maggie?

785
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:25,373
- Uh, we've got
a minute, 50 on the timer.

786
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,983
OA's looking
for the safety now.

787
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:29,203
<i>- That's barely enough time
to clear the blast radius.</i>

788
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,597
<i>This is bomb
is sophisticated and powerful.</i>

789
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,208
<i>You need to get
the hell out of there now.</i>

790
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,558
- All right,
everybody back now!

791
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:39,126
- You heard him.
Everybody fall back!

792
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:41,824
- Come with me, man.

793
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:45,828
Come on!

794
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:58,754
- Okay, there's no way
that they evacuated

795
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:01,366
this entire building.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

796
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:05,979
- Come on!

797
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:08,329
You built it, now defuse it.

798
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:17,599
- Maggie,
you gotta get outta here.

799
00:38:17,643 --> 00:38:19,471
- I'm not leaving. No.
- Maggie, please.

800
00:38:20,994 --> 00:38:23,518
There's 61 seconds
left on the timer.

801
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:25,999
- I can't find the switch.

802
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,783
- Up to you, Wilkerson.

803
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:35,617
- Where's the switch, man!?

804
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:38,141
- Go to hell!

805
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:40,492
- It's okay, it's okay.
Just keep looking.

806
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:47,890
- 45 seconds.

807
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:57,509
Aw, 38 seconds,
and we go together.

808
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:07,345
- There's 30 seconds left.

809
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:11,000
- Where is it!?

810
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:15,353
It's behind the radio.

811
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:19,357
- Hold this.
- I got it.

812
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:24,840
Careful, careful, careful.
- Okay...

813
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:27,190
- You see that?
- Yeah.

814
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:32,457
<i></i>

815
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,154
- Go slow, go slow.
There you go.

816
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:43,032
<i></i>

817
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,129
- We got it.
- We got it. We're good.

818
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:07,317
Okay.

819
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:09,363
Okay...

820
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,801
Okay.

821
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:18,677
So remind me to never invite
your boyfriend to poker night.

822
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,941
- Naw, I'm not that brave
or ballsy, trust me.

823
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:24,247
I just knew our guy
didn't have the guts to do it.

824
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:26,380
When I told him
we were going to the garage,

825
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,992
I felt him resist a little,
digging his heels in.

826
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:31,559
If he actually wanted
to be a martyr,

827
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:33,126
he would've been thrilled.

828
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:34,736
I knew he was fronting.

829
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,086
- That's impressive.

830
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,175
- Yeah, it is,
but uh, I gotta go, guys.

831
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:40,481
I got dinner with Mona.
I don't wanna be late.

832
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:41,961
- All right, see you later.

833
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:43,658
- Dinner--that actually doesn't
sound like a bad idea.

834
00:40:43,702 --> 00:40:46,226
I know a perfect place.
- Yeah, great.

835
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:48,968
- Come on.

836
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:53,451
This place better be great.

837
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:55,801
I am starving.
- It is, I promise.

838
00:40:55,844 --> 00:40:57,716
- Okay.

839
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:04,200
- What? What's up?

840
00:41:04,244 --> 00:41:06,507
- This is the apartment.

841
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:07,856
- Oh, yeah?

842
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,772
- It's ours.
Signed the lease.

843
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:14,123
I put the deposit down
and everything.

844
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,995
- What?

845
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:19,825
You signed the lease?

846
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:22,523
- Mm-hmm.

847
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:24,612
- I said that I needed
to think about that.

848
00:41:24,656 --> 00:41:26,701
- Oh, come on, Maggie,
don't overthink this.

849
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:29,487
- You keep saying that to me,
that I overthink,

850
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,881
but you tell me
that I have room

851
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:36,581
to say how this goes down
in our relationship.

852
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:38,974
That I have all the time
that I need.

853
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:42,543
That's not
what's happening here.

854
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:44,110
- Look, I didn't mean it
like that.

855
00:41:44,153 --> 00:41:45,546
What I'm saying is I think
this is the right--

856
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,592
- Nestor, Nestor, listen to me.

857
00:41:49,463 --> 00:41:52,205
I'm not moving in with you.

858
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:03,433
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

859
00:42:03,477 --> 00:42:05,479
I didn't mean to push things.

860
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,263
- But you did.

861
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:10,484
Here's the thing--

862
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,182
that's what makes you
really great at your job.

863
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:21,756
It's not gonna work for me.

864
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:38,468

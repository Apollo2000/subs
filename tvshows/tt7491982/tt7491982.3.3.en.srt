1
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:13,491
- The place has changed a lot
since we were here last.

2
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:17,669
- I don't really pay attention.

3
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:19,497
I hate this city.

4
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,022
- So why are we back?

5
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:23,588
- Because we're making a deal,

6
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:27,723
and we have to find a fool.

7
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:29,855
And this city's full of them.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,991
- It shouldn't be
much longer now.

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,688
We're about five minutes away.

10
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:43,086
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

11

12
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:05,456
What'd I do?
- I'll explain in a second.

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,110
But for my safety and yours,

14
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:09,547
do you mind rolling that window
all the way down, please?

15
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,639
Appreciate it.

16
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:16,424
I pulled you over because
your taillight's out.

17
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:18,034
Let me see your license
and registration.

18
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:22,169
- A taillight?
Seriously?

19
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:24,345
This is a rental.
Take it up with them.

20
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:27,391
- You're driving it,
so it's your responsibility.

21
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:29,872
- Unbelievable.
This right here?

22
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:31,439
This is why
no one like you guys.

23
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:41,057
- Let me see your hands!
Now!

24
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:51,807
- Good to see you.

25
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,548
We appreciate the Bureau's
offer help on this.

26
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,506
- It's not a problem.
I'm Special Agent Maggie Bell.

27
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,073
This is Zidan.
That's Wallace and Scola.

28
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,161
- Any witnesses?

29
00:01:58,205 --> 00:01:59,641
- The guy over there
just waved us down.

30
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:01,295
Said he saw a car pull away.

31
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:05,386
- Tiff and I will get
his statement.

32
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:06,778
- So what do we know?

33
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:08,215
- He was dead on arrival.

34
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,347
Last radio transmission
was about a traffic stop.

35
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:13,481
Did he give Dispatch a plate?
- No.

36
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:14,656
It's not uncommon,

37
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,266
not if it was
for a minor offense.

38
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,225
- Was he wearing a body cam?
- Yeah.

39
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:20,314
Techs are downloading
the footage as we speak.

40
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:21,967
His name is Tony Sanchez.

41
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:23,621
Survived two toursin Afghanistan

42
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:25,667
and gets killed writing
a stupid traffic ticket.

43
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:31,151
- I work the night shift.

44
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,718
My desk is next
to the window over there.

45
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:35,155
I heard the shot,

46
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:37,200
and then I saw the cop
lying in the street.

47
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:38,897
- Did you see
the actual shooting?

48
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:42,379
- No, just the car peeling away
when I ran outside.

49
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:44,816
The cop was on the ground.
He was holding his throat.

50
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,601
Trying to stop the bleeding,
I guess.

51
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:48,124
- Tell us about the car.
- Yeah.

52
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,952
It was a black sedan
with tinted windows.

53
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:51,823
You know, like,
from a car service.

54
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,825
- You happen
to catch the plate?

55
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:55,653
- The suspect is driving
a black sedan.

56
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:59,222
We have a partial plate.
KFC, just like the restaurant.

57
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,484
Let's get moving
on that body cam.

58
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:01,920
The secondyou're done scrubbing it,

59
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:04,140
I want a photo of the shooter
blasted wide.

60
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,708
I'm talking about airports,
trains, buses, you name it.

61
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:08,971
If it's a carrier capable
of transporting our suspect

62
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:10,886
out the city,
I want law enforcement

63
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:12,409
sweeping through it first,
yeah?

64
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:14,629
- Transfer is complete.
Putting it up now.

65
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:16,152
He didn't activate his body cam

66
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,415
till he was directly opposite
the driver's side door,

67
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,200
so we don't have any footage
tagging the plate.

68
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:21,940
- Okay, any hits on facial rec?

69
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,248
- No, nothing, but watch
as our victim leans over.

70
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:27,250
I think the police officer
drew his gun

71
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:29,034
because he recognizes the guy
in the back seat,

72
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:30,253
and that's why
the driver shot him.

73
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:33,735
- Whoa.
Is that who I think it is?

74
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:40,829
- Antonio Vargas.

75
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:42,787
Head of the Durango
drug cartel.

76
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,311
And believed responsible
for the murder

77
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:46,704
of an FBI agent
seven years ago.

78
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:48,228
- Yeah.
Kyle Miller.

79
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:51,666
Hey, get Isobel
and ADIC Reynolds in here ASAP.

80
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,625
Hey, for those of you
who are new to the job

81
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:59,195
or who don't watch the news,take a long, hard look.

82
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,546
Vargas is the number one
cocaine dealer in the universe.

83
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,809
And a cold-blooded killer.
He likes explosives

84
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:07,638
and torturing victims
before killing them.

85
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:11,512
Hey.

86
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:13,209
- We got a sighting on Vargas?
- Yeah.

87
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,126
He was in the back of the car
driven by the cop killer.

88
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,302
Can you take that down, please?

89
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:21,783
- Yeah, yeah.
Ian, can you--please.

90
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:22,958
- I got something.

91
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:24,481
I've been scanning
through traffic cams

92
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:27,658
within a three-mile radius
of the crime scene.

93
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:30,879
That black Town Car has
the same license plate letters

94
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,272
given to us by the witness.

95
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,403
Passed through the intersection

96
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:34,665
just five minutes
after the shooting.

97
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,450
- Okay, any sightings
after that, or no?

98
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:39,061
- No, but the road is
a mile-long cul-de-sac.

99
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:42,151
It leads to a group
of commercial warehouses.

100
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:43,718
I think he's gone to ground.

101
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,894
- Get Maggie and the restof them down there ASAP.

102
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:47,330
- I'll roll a SWAT team
as backup.

103
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,245
Nice work.

104
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:56,252
- Hey, the car's parked

105
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,819
on the side
of the middle warehouse.

106
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:58,820
- Mark my sightline clear.

107
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:01,039
- Do you see anything?

108
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,390
- No sign of movement.

109
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,653
Maybe they ditched the car
and split.

110
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:07,089
- Or maybe not.

111
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:09,265
I have four heat signatures
moving around inside.

112
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,660
Are we waiting for a warrant?
- No, exigent circumstances.

113
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,705
But if Vargas isn't oneof those heat signatures,

114
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:17,578
I need to know thatimmediately.

115
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:18,970
Let's hit it.
- Go, go.

116
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:20,363
- Let's move.
- Team hot. Let's go.

117
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,326
- Stack.

118
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:29,633
Breach.
Go.

119
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:30,982
- Let's go!

120
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:32,984
Trooper One, through the door.
- Move.

121
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:34,986
- Flow this way.
Flow.

122
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,249
About entry, on me.

123
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:39,295
- Blue team high.
Clear left.

124
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:03,275
- FBI!
Don't move!

125
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,714
- Federal agents!
Let me see your hands!

126
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,193
- Do it, Vargas.

127
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:15,462
Give me an excuse.

128
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:17,725
- Okay.

129
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:21,337
Don't shoot.
My hands are up.

130
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,385
- Turn around and face forward.
Keep your hands up.

131
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:27,299
- Support up.
Secondary start.

132
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:28,866
We'll head back from here.

133
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,086
- Secure the scene.
- Upper two advancing.

134
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,217
- Let's get a medic up.

135
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:34,002
- We heard shots.
- We're good.

136
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:35,438
One down.
Primary in custody.

137
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:36,787
No eyes on the other two.

138
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:38,354
They must be
on your side of the building.

139
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,487
- Copy that.
We'll continue our sweep.

140
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:46,144
- Confirm that's Vargas
you have in custody.

141
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:48,669
Affirmative.

142
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:50,366
- I want himextracted immediately.

143
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,629
- Yeah, roll him to MDC?
- No.

144
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:54,762
Bring him here.

145
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:57,460
- Yeah, bring his ass
to 26 FED.

146
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,599
- Yellow Six coming out.

147
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:07,339
Clear a lane.
SRF.

148
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:10,560
Moving out.

149
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:14,477
Men are en route, 26 Fed.
Let's go.

150
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:21,615
- Eyes on.

151
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:23,878
- I'm open channel.
TRT, in position.

152
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:26,010
Oh.

153
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:28,665
- Well, we have some drugs.

154
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:31,189
- Up, up.

155
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:34,845
- I got a short room here.

156
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,501
- We got this guy.
- Yup.

157
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:41,548
- Wait, is this
what I think it is?

158
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:44,681
- Yes, C4 and blasting caps.

159
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,553
Heads on a swivel.
We have explosives.

160
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:48,511
- Copy that.
- Hey.

161
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:51,558
These palettes have been moved.
Somebody got behind this door.

162
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:55,300
- Okay, that could explain
where the suspects just went.

163
00:07:55,344 --> 00:07:57,477
- Hey!
Don't move.

164
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,261
We have a tripwire.

165
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:09,140
- Maggie, what's the move?
- Don't touch anything.

166
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:10,838
Am I clear?
- Yes, ma'am.

167
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,361
- Landslide,
landslide, landslide.

168
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:14,494
Okay, Jubal, we've got
explosives on the scene.

169
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:15,756
We're gonna back away slowly

170
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,497
until the bomb techs
sweep this place.

171
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,586
Two suspects got away.
- Copy that!

172
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,152
Rolling a bomb team
as we speak.

173
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:23,546
Just contain it from a safe
distance until they arrive.

174
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,982
- Will do.

175
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,467
- Say again.
Last transmission.

176
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,991
- Coming out.
- Tango One, at the door.

177
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:36,167
We green or what?

178
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:37,778
- Green.
Set...

179
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:39,040
- No!

180
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,837
- We got operators inside.

181
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,840
I got you!

182
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:58,189
- Man down.

183
00:08:58,233 --> 00:08:59,669
Roll an ambo
to our location now!

184
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:02,063
- Sector five, IED.

185
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:03,325
- Get this contained!

186
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:05,196
Inside!

187
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,721
Let's go. Move!
- Move. Move.

188
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,776
- Is everybody okay?
I heard there was an explosion.

189
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,996
- Yeah, a SWAT member
was wounded.

190
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,475
The doctors think
he's gonna survive.

191
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,868
Thank God.
- Well, Vargas is inside.

192
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:27,218
A little calmer and shorter
than I anticipated.

193
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:29,177
- I'm hearing there was product
in the warehouse.

194
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,788
- Yes, sir.
About two tons of pure cocaine.

195
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,575
Once the bomb techs
clear the warehouse, seize it.

196
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:38,012
It'll make the press conference
even more interesting.

197
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:41,232
- Listen, word's gonna travel
fast that Vargas is in custody,

198
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:43,278
so warn the front desk
to expect media inquiries.

199
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:45,323
- And tell 'em to set up
a press stage outside.

200
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,804
I'll field questions
once he's processed.

201
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,898
- Who are you?

202
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:57,161
- I'm Special Agent in Charge
Isobel Castille.

203
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:59,642
This is Assistant Director
in Charge Reynolds.

204
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:01,644
- Impressive titles.

205
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:04,516
But can you two make decisions?
- Excuse me?

206
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,867
- I need to be
with decision makers.

207
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,260
Not puppets with fancy titles.

208
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:11,436
- Uh, well, you're in
our house now, Vargas.

209
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,047
You don't get to make demands.

210
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,615
And I can assure you
neither one of us is a puppet.

211
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,704
- We're here to advise you
that you are being charged

212
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:20,315
with the murder
of an NYPD police officer.

213
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:26,887
- You're wasting your time.

214
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,671
I didn't shoot anyone.

215
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:30,151
- Oh, I know.

216
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:32,936
You like to send other people
to do your dirty work.

217
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,199
Like when you ordered
one of your thugs

218
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:39,508
to torture and kill
Agent Miller seven years ago.

219
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:41,292
- It sounds like
I'll need a good lawyer.

220
00:10:41,336 --> 00:10:43,338
- More like
divine intervention.

221
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:45,035
It's over.

222
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,864
- How many times
have you used that line?

223
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:51,041
50?
100?

224
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:56,351
- You're going down, Vargas.

225
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:58,527
There's nothing
you can do about it.

226
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,843
- Help!
- On the ground, now!

227
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:12,454
- Somebody help me!
- Let me see your hands!

228
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:14,586
- Scola, help!
There's a bomb on me!

229
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,285
- Don't shoot!
Put the guns down!

230
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:18,721
She's one of us.

231
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:20,767
- I need to get some backup
here in the lobby now.

232
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,985
- Don't move!

233
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:36,130
- Okay, okay.
Just calm down.

234
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:38,045
We've got an explosive expert
coming from the third floor.

235
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:39,568
They're gonna get this thing
off your neck.

236
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:41,091
You're gonna be fine.
- No, you can't do that.

237
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:43,398
He said if anyone were to come
in or out of this building,

238
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,356
especially the bomb tech,
he'd detonate this thing.

239
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,967
- But who said that?
- The man who put this on me!

240
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,534
- Okay, okay. Just relax, okay?
Nobody's going in or out.

241
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:51,275
The bomb techs are coming
from the third floor.

242
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:53,321
- Well, tell them to hurry.
They have to get this off me.

243
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:54,670
- Okay, they will.
They will.

244
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,891
It's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

245
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:00,415
It's gonna be okay.

246
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,332
- Okay?

247
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,160
It's gonna be okay.

248
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:09,641
Tell me what happened.

249
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:12,166
- I--I got off the subway
at Chamber Street.

250
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:13,907
Cleared the stairs,
started walking.

251
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,560
Was about to put my ID on.

252
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:18,433
Then, someone came up behind me
and stuck a gun in my back.

253
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:21,392
- What did he look like?
- I don't know.

254
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:22,959
I was scared.

255
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:25,527
He said to keep
looking straight ahead,

256
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,833
or he'd kill me,

257
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,617
and then he made me
get into a black SUV.

258
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,272
Told me to close my eyes,
or he'd shoot.

259
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:33,840
I know I should've looked,
but I was too scared--

260
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:36,799
- You're alive,
so you did the right thing.

261
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:38,061
What happened next?

262
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:39,410
- Said there was a bomb
around my neck,

263
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:40,716
that I was to walk
into the lobby

264
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,762
and demand that a man
named Vargas be released.

265
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:44,981
And if that didn't happen
within the next 30 minutes,

266
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,201
it would explode.

267
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:49,116
All right.

268
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,466
Hey, you look at me.

269
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:53,511
You are gonna be okay.

270
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:56,340
I promise.

271
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:58,168
Okay?

272
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,782
I'm gonna get the JOC
working on this.

273
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:05,045
Are you okay to stay here
and keep me updated?

274
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:07,395
- Yes, ma'am.
- Are you sure?

275
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:09,136
I cannot order you
to stay here.

276
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:11,312
- You don't have to.

277
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:13,270
She's scared.
She's one of us.

278
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:16,056
So I got this.

279
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:24,891
- Our friend and colleague,
Elise Taylor,

280
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:27,110
is in the lobby
with a bomb around her neck.

281
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:29,460
And the timer on the device
says we have 27 minutes

282
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:31,245
to solve this issue,
so let's get to work.

283
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:32,768
- If the man threatened
to detonate it,

284
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,422
he must have
a portable activation device.

285
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:37,468
- Exactly, and if we cannot
get the bomb off of Elise,

286
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:40,210
we need to find and neutralize
the man holding the detonator.

287
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:41,690
- Vargas and his cronies

288
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,170
have used this type
of device before.

289
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:44,954
What have we learned
from the past?

290
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:47,130
- Prior collar bomb cases show
they typically pack

291
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:48,828
about five pounds of C4.

292
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,046
- It's enough to kill Elise

293
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,482
and anyone else
within 50 feet of her.

294
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:53,006
- Also enough
to cause structural damage

295
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,312
to the building if she's
standing in the wrong place.

296
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,055
- All right, listen up.

297
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,492
The lobby is located
directly below us.

298
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:03,712
I need a few volunteers
to stay.

299
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:04,974
Other than that,
the rest of you need

300
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:06,106
to leave immediately.

301
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:12,460
- I'm sure as hell
not going anywhere.

302
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:15,245
- I'll stay.

303
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,030
- Me too.

304
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:19,859
- Thank you.
Rest of you need to go now.

305
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:20,990
- All right,
you heard the boss.

306
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:22,165
No more volunteers needed.

307
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:23,775
Head down
to the east conference room

308
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:24,994
on the fifth floor.

309
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:27,344
Orderly fashion, please.
Thank you.

310
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:29,607
All right, Ian, Kelly,
we need to start scrubbing

311
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:31,914
the exterior security footage
from 26 FED.

312
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,916
Find Elise's approach,
work backwards from there,

313
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,006
and let's locate the suspect
or the SUV he dragged her into.

314
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,921
- On it.
- Will do.

315
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,923
- Maggie, OA, and Tiffany
are still out in the field.

316
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,359
Update them on the situation,

317
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:44,231
and then order them
to head back to 26 FED.

318
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:45,754
- Copy that.
They can strip down

319
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:47,843
to their civilian clothes
and be our eyes on the street.

320
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,935
- It's a sophisticated device.
- But you can disarm it, right?

321
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,545
- Negative.
Once activated,

322
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,765
it's designed to go off
if it's tampered with.

323
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:58,419
To neutralize it on-site,
we would need

324
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:00,856
to punch in the correct codes
on the timer's keypad.

325
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,163
- Well, is it worth trying
variations of what it could be?

326
00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:05,339
- No, it'll be triggered
if the wrong one's entered.

327
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:07,036
What about the remote?

328
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,256
If we get our hands on that,
can we neutralize it?

329
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,387
- It's possible.

330
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:11,780
I would need to see it
to know for sure.

331
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:13,434
If it helps, a detonator
like that would only

332
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:15,915
have a maximum signal range
of about 400 yards,

333
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,612
so the suspect
would need to stay close.

334
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:19,048
- All right.
That's good to know.

335
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:20,180
I'll relay that to the JOC.

336
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:21,616
- Whatever they can do
to resolve this,

337
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:22,834
they need to do it fast.

338
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:25,011
The timer's at 26 minutes
and counting down.

339
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:26,534
We're moving.
- Yes, ma'am.

340
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:27,839
- Thanks for that.

341
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:30,494
- We should all clear out,
yourself included.

342
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:33,410
- I'm staying.
- Then take this, at least.

343
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,415
It won't save your life,

344
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,417
but at least there'll be
enough of you to bury.

345
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:47,033
- Why are they leaving?

346
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:49,296
- They're just running
some specs on the device.

347
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:52,690
They'll get back to us
with a solution.

348
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:56,259
- You're lying.

349
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:58,435
If they could've done
something, they would've.

350
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:06,226
- It's gonna be okay.

351
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,532
All right?
We're gonna fix this.

352
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,195
- We have
a situation downstairs,

353
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,502
and you are gonna fix it.

354
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,112
- Let me guess.

355
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:26,202
Someone you care about
has a new necklace.

356
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:28,596
I've spent the last decade
being hunted

357
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,687
by every law enforcement agency
in America.

358
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,776
Of course I had
a backup plan in place.

359
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:36,908
- We don't respond
to threats like this.

360
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,388
There's no way
you're walking out of here.

361
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:40,477
- Then her death is on you.

362
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:42,131
- She doesn't have to die.

363
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:43,915
You help us
deactivate that bomb,

364
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,308
we'll speak
to the U.S. Attorney

365
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:47,963
about a sentence reduction.

366
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,791
- A sentence reduction?

367
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:53,316
I run the largest drug cartel
in the world.

368
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,755
Two life sentences versus four
doesn't help me too much.

369
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,411
I either walk out of here,
or your girl dies.

370
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:04,414
- Call your people.
Have them deactivate that bomb.

371
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,286
Now.

372
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,896
Or we will place you
right next to her

373
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,376
when that timer hits zero.

374
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,517
- 9-1-1.
What's your emergency, please?

375
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:21,692
- I'm dealing with an idiot.

376
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,564
Could you send in
someone smarter?

377
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:26,088
- You think I'm joking?
I promise you I am not.

378
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,090
I will you sit your ass down
right next to her.

379
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:30,179
She dies, you die.

380
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:32,573
- Everyone likes
to talk like a gangster,

381
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:36,359
but when it's time to be one,
it's a whole different story.

382
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:39,797
You're the boss.
It means you love politics.

383
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,843
Kissing ass.

384
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:44,411
Yeah.
It means you lack courage.

385
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:45,977
- No, it means
I'm good at my job.

386
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:48,980
- Exactly.

387
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,765
Ain't no way in hell
you have the guts

388
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:52,984
to put me next to that bomb.

389
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,134
- Never should've
brought him here.

390
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,353
We should've brought him

391
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:14,876
straight to Metropolitan
Detention Center.

392
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,660
- We had no way to anticipate
that he was gonna--

393
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,271
- Well, you knew
his history, Isobel.

394
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:19,446
His tactics.

395
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:22,188
It was a mistake.
Just own it.

396
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:23,798
- It's not over.

397
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:27,106
- There's a woman downstairs
with a bomb around her neck.

398
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:30,152
- Elise.
- What?

399
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:32,894
- Her name is Elise.

400
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:34,896
And she's gonna be okay.

401
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:36,637
I looked her in the eye

402
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,553
and I promised her we were
gonna find a way out of this.

403
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:40,684
- Well, she was scared,

404
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,556
and you told her
what she needed to hear.

405
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:45,689
I get it, but we both know
it's not gonna be that simple.

406
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:49,345
- All I care about is getting
that bomb off Elise's neck.

407
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:50,825
That's it.

408
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:52,653
So you can either
help me do that,

409
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:55,569
or get the hell out of my way.

410
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,318
- So I was expecting
three gangbangers with AK-47s,

411
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:08,190
but instead, what I saw was

412
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:11,454
two sixteen-year-old stoners
just playing "Fortnite."

413
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:13,108
- You kicked in the wrong door?
- Correct.

414
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,023
- They must've been surprised.

415
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:17,330
- Right, you would think,
but they didn't even look over.

416
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,288
I mean, they had
their headphones on.

417
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,855
They were just too wrapped up
in the game.

418
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:23,162
Plus, they were
really, really high,

419
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:28,079
so we just backed out of there
like it never happened.

420
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,517
- Maggie and the rest
of the team are gonna be

421
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,736
outside real soon.

422
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,608
Hey.

423
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,131
We're gonna get you
out of this.

424
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,002
Now, can you remember
anything else

425
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:39,308
about the man
who approached you?

426
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,571
Anything at all?
No detail is too small.

427
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,226
- All I can remember is
that when I was in the SUV,

428
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,576
he yanked my hands
behind my back

429
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,362
and held them really tight.

430
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:50,798
He was really rough

431
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:52,365
when he forced the collar
around my neck.

432
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:53,931
- Wait.

433
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:56,369
He held your hands--
both of them--

434
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:58,240
while he applied the collar?

435
00:19:58,284 --> 00:20:01,939
- Yes, so there
must've been a second guy.

436
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:04,899
- Jubal, we're positioned
a short distance

437
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:06,379
outside the plaza.
Any update?

438
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:08,337
- Yes, before that timer
hits zero,

439
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:10,557
you now have to find
two needles in a haystack.

440
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,254
- So wait, if they just
evade us long enough,

441
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:13,995
then it'll explode on its own?

442
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:16,345
- And if they see you coming,
they can trigger it.

443
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:18,478
But only one of them
has a detonator.

444
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:20,480
- How do we know that?

445
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:21,872
- Bomb techs say
it's highly unlikely

446
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,265
there'd be
two triggering devices.

447
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,006
Something about signal clarity.

448
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,356
- And we're looking for
a late model black SUV, right?

449
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,358
- Yeah, Elise said it was
parked on Worth Street,

450
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:30,881
just south of 26 FED.

451
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:32,666
- Yeah, we're there now.

452
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:34,058
There's no sign
of that vehicle.

453
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:36,147
- Okay, but the detonator's
signal range is only

454
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:39,107
about 400 yards, so I'm sure
they're still close by.

455
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,717
- Okay, if they're
watching the exits,

456
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:42,676
that means we have to canvass
both sides of the building.

457
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:44,155
- Okay, we're gonna split up
on foot

458
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,287
and start a grid search.
- Yeah.

459
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:46,593
All right,
let's not take any chances

460
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:47,898
getting burned, okay?

461
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:49,552
Park on a side street.
Ditch the comms.

462
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:51,119
Cell phone only
for communication.

463
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:53,817
- Got it.
We'll give you an update.

464
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,518
- If you help us
deactivate that bomb,

465
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:00,346
I'll do everything in my power

466
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:02,435
to convince the people above me
to release you.

467
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:06,569
- Help you before I'm let out?
Do you think I'm stupid?

468
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:09,920
And let's face it, the people
above you aren't gonna budge.

469
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:14,055
There is no upside.
No skin in the game.

470
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:18,320
But you, you know that woman.

471
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,801
You care, don't you?
- I do.

472
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:22,237
But I don't have the authority

473
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,239
to make a unilateral decision
like that.

474
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,285
- Of course you do.

475
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,504
You just
don't wanna pay the price.

476
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:32,116
Ask yourself this--

477
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,424
is putting me in prison

478
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:37,644
worth more
than that woman's life?

479
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:38,906
- If I were to release you,

480
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:40,473
how could I be sure
you'd keep your word?

481
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:43,214
- Because my word is gold.

482
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:46,130
It's more valuable
than my cocaine.

483
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:49,438
And when I say something,
I mean it.

484
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:51,135
- You sell poison.

485
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,616
You torture
and kill innocent people.

486
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,488
You plant bombs, so forgive me

487
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:58,491
if your word doesn't quite have
the currency you think it does.

488
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:00,362
- To get where I'm at,

489
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:03,322
to have the kind of business
I have,

490
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:04,671
you need credibility.

491
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:08,718
- You killed an NYPD officer.
An FBI agent.

492
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:10,981
You almost killed another agent
last night at the warehouse.

493
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:12,679
- Because no one
listened to me.

494
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:14,071
- Excuse me?

495
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:16,639
- I told your people
that the warehouse was rigged,

496
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:18,728
that there were bombs,

497
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:22,776
not to chase my men.

498
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:26,693
But they didn't believe me.

499
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:29,652
- If you are such
a polished businessman,

500
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:31,785
why did you kill Agent Miller?

501
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:33,656
He wasn't even
investigating you.

502
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,398
- Agent Miller?

503
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:39,793
And that's the second time
you brought him up.

504
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,969
Why?

505
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:45,364
Were you two...close?

506
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,191
- He was a good man.

507
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:49,977
- No, he was dirty as hell.

508
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,632
He was on my payroll for years.

509
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:55,635
- You're lying.
- I'm not.

510
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:59,029
Nah.
He would give me intel.

511
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:01,902
And then one day,
he found Jesus or something,

512
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:04,774
and he tried
to end our arrangement.

513
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:08,865
I said no,
and he tried to kill me.

514
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:10,824
If I hadn't put my hand up,

515
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:14,567
Miller's bullet would've hit me
in the side of the head.

516
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:21,269
Miller died because of that.

517
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:27,101
- Come on, talk to me, Elise.
Come on.

518
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:29,146
Let's get your mind off this
while the others are working

519
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,452
on a solution.
Come on.

520
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:33,586
First thing
that pops in your head, what?

521
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:36,719
- That I'm gonna die and leave
my daughter without a mother?

522
00:23:36,763 --> 00:23:38,678
She's only seven.

523
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,686
- You want me to get a message
to your husband, maybe?

524
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:49,079
- No, I'm single.

525
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,128
I just need to talk to her,
hear her voice.

526
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:55,738
- Okay.

527
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:06,053
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, baby.

528
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:09,796
I--I just wanted to say hi.

529
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,320
Hear your voice.

530
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:15,279
No, nothing's wrong.

531
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:17,847
Yeah, sure.
Finish the movie.

532
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:23,940
- I...I hope they find
Nemo too.

533
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:30,120
- Mommy loves you

534
00:24:30,164 --> 00:24:32,296
more than anything
in the world.

535
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,560
But I have to go now, okay?

536
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:37,954
- Okay.
Mom, bye!

537
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:57,626
- I know this is hard.

538
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:03,589
We're doing everything we can.

539
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:06,026
And I promise you that.

540
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:12,946
- Got 17 minutes left
on the clock.

541
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:15,514
- Any sightings of the black
SUV in the security cameras?

542
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,037
- Negative.
We scoped around the plaza.

543
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,255
There's no sign of it.

544
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:19,735
- I'm betting those
are the two suspects

545
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:20,997
that got away
from the warehouse.

546
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,521
They probably followed Scola
to 26 FED.

547
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,653
- If they ditched the SUV,
they're probably on foot.

548
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:25,828
- Then focus your search

549
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:27,482
within the detonator's
400-yard radius.

550
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,354
- Okay, 17 minutes.
Let's go.

551
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:32,966
16 minutes now.

552
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,620
No pressure,

553
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:37,361
but you three are
the only chance she's got.

554
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:38,449
- We got this.

555
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:57,991
- Keep going.
Keep going.

556
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:03,474
- Hey, I got
a black SUV tucked away

557
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:04,911
in a underground parking lot.

558
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:07,087
The plate is Sam-43-

559
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,871
Nora-kilo-baker-ocean.

560
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:11,134
- Yeah, we're running it now.
Is anyone inside?

561
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:12,614
- Negative.

562
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,964
- Plate comes back
to a silver Toyota sedan.

563
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,618
- Okay, Tiffany,
it's cold-plated.

564
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,315
- It's their ride.

565
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,143
Elise's ID is
in the passenger seat.

566
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:21,275
- All right, it's their car.

567
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:22,668
Ian, you find footage
of that area?

568
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:24,321
- Yeah, scrubbing through
the old footage right now.

569
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:25,627
- Which one?
- Right there.

570
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:27,542
- Yeah.

571
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:31,633
Can you scrub this one?

572
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:34,636
Bet it.

573
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,030
What's going on?
- We are really good.

574
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:38,640
But I'm not loving the odds
on this one.

575
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:40,729
- We're doing
everything we can.

576
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:43,950
- That's not true.
- What do you mean?

577
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:45,516
- I could let Vargas go

578
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,998
in exchange
for deactivating the bomb.

579
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:50,826
- He's one of the most
wanted criminals in the world.

580
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,306
We can't just let him go,
can we?

581
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:53,873
- Sure we can.

582
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,962
Saving Elise is more important
than punishing Vargas.

583
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:58,007
- No, of course,
but, I mean, history shows

584
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:59,966
this guy kills cops for sport.

585
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:03,360
We let him go, he'll detonate
the bomb anyway, right?

586
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:06,929
- He said that Agent Miller
was on his payroll,

587
00:27:06,973 --> 00:27:08,365
that he was dirty.

588
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:10,716
- You think that's true?
- No.

589
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:14,328
I...I think
we should have Forensics

590
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:16,939
take a quick dive
into Miller's finances.

591
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:19,028
And--and talk to the SWAT agent

592
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:20,682
who walked Vargas
out of that warehouse.

593
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:23,163
Ask him if Vargas warned him
about the explosives.

594
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:25,469
Okay, we only got 14 minutes.

595
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:28,168
If I know that he's lying
about the explosives

596
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:32,607
or Miller, I know he's lying
about saving Elise.

597
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,044
- All right.
I'm on it.

598
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:39,483
- If we don't get
that detonator,

599
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:42,573
we need to consider
letting Vargas walk.

600
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:44,314
- Are you crazy?

601
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:46,403
His driver just killed
an NYPD cop.

602
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,710
He's the biggest coke dealer
in the world.

603
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:52,279
The press would eat us alive.
- Elise will die if we don't.

604
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:53,367
- He's bluffing.

605
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,935
He's not gonna
detonate that bomb.

606
00:27:55,978 --> 00:27:58,372
Even Vargas
isn't that reckless.

607
00:27:58,415 --> 00:27:59,678
- What if he is?

608
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:02,202
You're willing
to take that chance?

609
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:03,507
- Yes.

610
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:11,428
This woman--Elise...

611
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:13,735
she's one person.

612
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:17,565
If Vargas is released
and the cartel continues,

613
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,262
thousands will die

614
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:22,265
from the violence
and the drugs.

615
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:24,485
I hate to say it,
but the math is on my side.

616
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:28,228
- I don't care
about the damn numbers.

617
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:31,927
- Vargas stays in custody.

618
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:34,756
Am I clear?

619
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,845
- Yes, sir.
You are.

620
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:42,633
- I just thought
he was running his mouth.

621
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:44,418
I didn't really
take it seriously.

622
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:45,898
- So Vargas did warn you?

623
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:47,987
He told you there were
explosives in that warehouse?

624
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,380
- Yes, ma'am.

625
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:51,860
- Thank you.

626
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:54,515
- The agent who got injured,
he's a good friend of mine.

627
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:55,951
If I thought
he was telling the truth--

628
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:57,257
- I know.
Thank you.

629
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,521
- I have intel
on Agent Miller as well.

630
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:03,132
According to the report,
when the police found the body,

631
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:05,004
his Bureau-issued Glock
was next to him

632
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:06,962
and the magazine
was short a round.

633
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:08,398
- Finances?
- Yeah.

634
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:09,748
He had an accountant
in the Caymans

635
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,010
under his passport number.

636
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:13,664
Don't know how much money
was in there, but...

637
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,536
- So Vargas tells the truth.

638
00:29:21,107 --> 00:29:23,587
- Wait, what does it say?
How much time do I have left?

639
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:25,807
- There's plenty of time.

640
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:27,896
We're gonna get you
out of this collar.

641
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,855
I promise.
Okay?

642
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:37,601
Scola, you need to find a way
to keep her distracted.

643
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:40,604
If she touches that device,
it will go off.

644
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:41,736
We also need to find a way

645
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,478
to move her
towards the front entrance.

646
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:46,959
If we fail to fix this
and that thing goes off,

647
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:48,830
we have to protect
the integrity of the building.

648
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:50,789
Protect the people
on the floors above.

649
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:58,927
- You ready to hear a few more
embarrassing anecdotes?

650
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:03,323
Okay, first stand up
and stretch those legs.

651
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:07,240
Okay.

652
00:30:07,283 --> 00:30:09,329
You ever hear other agents
talk about the idiot

653
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:10,852
who forgot
to pat down the suspect

654
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:12,680
before putting him
in the back seat?

655
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:15,204
- Yeah, in class at Quantico.
That was you?

656
00:30:15,248 --> 00:30:16,379
- Wait, what?

657
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:17,990
They use that story
at Quantico?

658
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:20,122
- As an example
of what not to do.

659
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,081
- Well, look, I was
a Wall Street banker.

660
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:23,560
The whole thing was
foreign to me.

661
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:25,649
- Well, banker or not,
that's gotta be embarrassing.

662
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:27,390
- Well, it was.

663
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,784
It still is.

664
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,221
I like the view here better.

665
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:34,615
I'll get you a seat.

666
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:43,363
- I know what you're doing,

667
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:45,104
moving me like this.

668
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:52,502
I don't want anyone else
in the building

669
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:54,417
to get hurt either.

670
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:02,251
- Where are we on the video?

671
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:04,384
- We've got footage of the SUV
entering the parking garage,

672
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:06,516
but because of the angle,
we can't see the driver's face.

673
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,562
- So there's only one person
in the SUV?

674
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:10,781
- Looks like it.
Interesting thing is,

675
00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:12,914
no one has exited the garage
on foot since the SUV entered.

676
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,134
- So I theorize the driver used
an interior elevator

677
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:17,527
and he's watching 26 FED
from the building itself.

678
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:19,660
Now, everyone I've seen
is either at a window

679
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:20,835
or they're sitting at a desk,

680
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,706
but I keep coming back
to this guy.

681
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,665
He's moved around a little bit,
but wherever he lands,

682
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:27,581
he's always looking
in the direction of 26 FED.

683
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:33,587
- Okay, they've got
a possible suspect.

684
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,197
Is there anything else
that you can think of

685
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:36,895
that might help identify
the guy who grabbed you?

686
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:39,462
- Nothing--I've told you
everything I can remember.

687
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:41,638
I...I don't have
much time left, do I?

688
00:31:41,682 --> 00:31:44,728
- Look at me.
Do I look nervous to you?

689
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:46,643
- No.
- Exactly.

690
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:49,516
Because I have faith
in the people out there

691
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,736
that they're gonna catch
these guys.

692
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,217
Your wrist is cut.
How'd that happen?

693
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:56,958
- Probably when the guy
was holding my arms.

694
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:59,569
I told you he was rough.

695
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:02,311
He was wearing a ring.
It felt like a big one.

696
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:03,660
- Jubal...

697
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:07,490
- Ian, does the man
at the window have a ring on?

698
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:09,231
- Yes, a big, gold one.
- Go.

699
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:10,972
- Affirmative.
Take him down.

700
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:13,061
He's on the second floor.
West side of the building.

701
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:14,802
Third window.

702
00:32:19,676 --> 00:32:21,983
- Wait, wait, hold up.
He got a call.

703
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:25,160
It might be the other suspect.
- Okay, hey, hey.

704
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:28,772
We need to track that call.
- Come on. Come on.

705
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:32,385
- He just hung up his phone.

706
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:34,213
- You're clear--go!
Take him down!

707
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:42,003
- Hey, I'm looking for 346.
Do you know where that is?

708
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:45,137
- No.

709
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:49,924
- FBI.
Don't move or you're dead!

710
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,795
- Check him.

711
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:57,758
- Hands on your head.
Lock your fingers.

712
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:02,154
- Where's your friend
with the detonator?

713
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:03,633
- Don't know
what you're talking about.

714
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:05,200
- You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

715
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:06,506
- Do not underestimate
what we will do to you

716
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:07,811
if our friends are killed,
okay?

717
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:09,422
- I got no choice!

718
00:33:09,465 --> 00:33:11,163
If Vargas isn't released
and people don't die,

719
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:14,383
my family will be killed,
so do what you want to me.

720
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,646
I'm not gonna help.

721
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:22,391
- If his partner's
still watching

722
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:26,178
the other side of 26 FED,
he's using this to communicate.

723
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:27,701
- Okay, this plaza's
the only place

724
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:29,790
with a clear view of the lobby
within 400 yards.

725
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,357
- Are you sure
your math is right?

726
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,055
- Yeah.
Make the call.

727
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:37,711
- It's ringing.

728
00:33:47,677 --> 00:33:49,114
OA, OA.

729
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:54,380
- Hello?

730
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:56,382
- FBI.
Don't move.

731
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:03,606
Don't move!
- Don't even think about it.

732
00:34:30,372 --> 00:34:33,114
- Are we good?

733
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:35,508
- Uh...

734
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:36,987
- What?
What is going on?

735
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:38,337
- There's only
a detonation button.

736
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,426
They can't stop the timer.

737
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:51,219
- We found the woman
with the detonator,

738
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:52,481
but it cannot disarm the bomb.

739
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:54,135
- Does she know
the deactivation code?

740
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,702
- If she does,
she's not sharing it.

741
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:58,313
She's too scared of what
Vargas will do to her family.

742
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:03,362
I've already ordered
the building be evacuated

743
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:04,537
through the fire exits.
- Yes.

744
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,149
We should get the hell
out of here.

745
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:10,934
- No.
I am not letting her die.

746
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:19,204
You win.

747
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:20,988
I'm letting you go,
but I want that code.

748
00:35:21,031 --> 00:35:22,903
Stand up.

749
00:35:22,946 --> 00:35:25,253
- As soon as I know
I'm not being followed,

750
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:27,995
I'll text it.

751
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:29,692
- My number's on here.

752
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:31,999
You told me
your word was your bond.

753
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:33,261
I want you
to look me in the eye

754
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:35,089
and promise me
you're gonna text me that code

755
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,786
before the bomb goes off.

756
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,702
- If my people and I
are let go,

757
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:43,010
I give you my word
that I will text you the code

758
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:45,143
before the timer hits zero.

759
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:49,669
- Follow me.

760
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:01,507
- Hey, so it's too late to have
a surveillance team in place,

761
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,031
but Maggie and OA are ready
to follow as best they can.

762
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:08,383
- No.
I gave him my word.

763
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:10,559
- I think we need
to at least try to follow him.

764
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:12,213
- I said no.

765
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:18,350
I am aware
of the consequences, Jubal,

766
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:22,745
and none of them outweigh
the need to keep Elise alive.

767
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:25,226
We are not following Vargas,

768
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,099
and that is an order.

769
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:30,231
- Yeah.

770
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:03,743
- I'm keeping up
my side of the deal.

771
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:06,572
You keep yours.

772
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:09,401
- Keep your phone close.

773
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:32,075
- All right, guys.
Right out the front door.

774
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,120
Thank you.

775
00:37:33,163 --> 00:37:34,295
You're all clear
back there, right?

776
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:36,602
- There are ferries
across the street.

777
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:37,994
- Let's go.
- All right.

778
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:39,996
- Thank you,
but you guys should go as well.

779
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,044
- It's not over.
He's gonna text the code.

780
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:46,699
All of you need to get outside
with the rest of them.

781
00:37:46,742 --> 00:37:47,961
- If you're staying,
I'm staying.

782
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:49,789
- Me too.
- All of us are.

783
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:52,661
- No, no, you're not,
and that's an order.

784
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:54,315
Evacuate now.

785
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:57,187
- You're not following orders
right now, and neither are we.

786
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:58,885
- I need to be here.

787
00:37:58,928 --> 00:38:02,889
If that code comes in, Elise
cannot enter it by herself.

788
00:38:02,932 --> 00:38:06,066
But if Vargas doesn't send
that code,

789
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:08,503
I need all of you alive

790
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:12,159
so that you can hunt
that son of a bitch down.

791
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:13,987
Go now!

792
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:19,688
Jubal--
- All right, guys.

793
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:21,168
You heard her.
Let's go.

794
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:28,349
- It's gonna be okay.
I got more stories.

795
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:30,786
When this is over, I'm gonna
take you out for a drink,

796
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,789
and I'm gonna make you
listen to 'em.

797
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,748
- I'd like that.

798
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:39,229
Promise one thing--
if this goes bad,

799
00:38:39,273 --> 00:38:41,580
tell my daughter that I...

800
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:44,104
- I will.

801
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:45,540
I promise.

802
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:53,940
Okay.

803
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:56,551
It's okay.
Hey.

804
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:59,206
I am right here with you, okay?

805
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:22,272
Your phone, your phone!

806
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:26,364
It's the code.

807
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:27,539
- Okay.
- It's the code.

808
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:28,888
- Okay.

809
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:39,028
Did it stop?

810
00:39:39,072 --> 00:39:40,290
- No.

811
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:45,295
No.

812
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:26,598
Are we okay?

813
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:31,646
We're okay.
We're okay.

814
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:37,435
We're okay.

815
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:48,141
- Hey.
- Hey.

816
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:53,320
- Nicely done.
- Get toasted.

817
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:56,889
Thank you.

818
00:40:56,932 --> 00:40:58,586
- Welcome back, Elise.

819
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:07,682
- NYPD found the SUV abandoned

820
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:09,510
on the other side
of the Holland Tunnel.

821
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:12,774
There's no sign of Vargas.

822
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:16,256
- Well, I'm glad she's alive,
but we need to talk.

823
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:18,258
You didn't have the authority
to go release Vargas--

824
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:20,869
Then fire me.

825
00:41:20,913 --> 00:41:22,828
- I stand by my decision.

826
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:25,744
- I understand.

827
00:41:25,787 --> 00:41:29,051
- Look, no matter
how fast Vargas runs

828
00:41:29,095 --> 00:41:31,793
or where he hides,
we'll find him.

829
00:41:31,837 --> 00:41:33,882
- I hope so.

830
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:35,884
For your sake.
It was your call, Isobel.

831
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:39,018
If things break the wrong way,
you're gonna take the hit.

832
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:40,802
It's the cost of being a hero.

833
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:44,240
- I understand.

834
00:41:44,284 --> 00:41:47,592
- You just saved
that woman's life.

835
00:41:47,635 --> 00:41:49,115
That's something
to be proud of,

836
00:41:49,158 --> 00:41:50,769
something to hold onto.

837
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:53,293
The press is waiting for you
out front.

838
00:41:53,336 --> 00:41:55,077
Probably best
that you to find a way

839
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:57,079
to put a positive spin
on all this.

840
00:42:00,343 --> 00:42:03,259
- Okay.

841
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:06,306
Today, we confronted and killed
the man responsible

842
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:08,961
for last night's murder
of an NYPD officer,

843
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:10,571
Tony Sanchez.

844
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:14,706
Incidental to that shooting,
we apprehended Antonio Vargas,

845
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:19,362
a man long rumored to be
the head of the Durango cartel.

846
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:21,016
We interrogated Mr. Vargas,

847
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,496
but did not have
enough evidence

848
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,063
to charge him with a crime.

849
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:25,412
- You didn't have
enough evidence.

850
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:26,848
How is that possible?

851
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:28,197
Wasn't he connected
to the shooting

852
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:29,982
of Officer Sanchez?

853
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:34,856
- Holding him was problematic,

854
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:39,208
but Mr. Vargas is now
squarely in the FBI's sights.

855
00:42:39,252 --> 00:42:41,515
An active investigation
is underway,

856
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,563
and we are confident
he will be brought to justice

857
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:46,999
very soon.

857
00:42:47,305 --> 00:43:47,378

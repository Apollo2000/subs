3
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:20,228
<i>This is a 2018 Lamborghini</i>
<i>Huracán Performante.</i>

4
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,564
<i>We don't do a lot of new cars</i>
<i>on the show.</i>

5
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,649
<i>We feel that new cars lack personality.</i>

6
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,193
<i>This car does not lack personality.</i>

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,404
<i>With 631 horsepower</i>

8
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,781
<i>from a 5.2 liter V10,</i>

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,909
<i>the Huracán does zero to 60</i>
<i>in 2.9 seconds.</i>

10
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,287
<i>-Do you have that kind of time?</i>

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,790
<i>Lamborghini likes to name their cars</i>
<i>after famous fighting bulls.</i>

12
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,085
<i>The Huracán was a bull</i>
<i>that fought in the 1870s.</i>

13
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,546
<i>Imagine if that bull could see this car.</i>

14
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,674
<i>I don't think it would react.</i>
<i>I have never seen a bull react.</i>

15
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,301
<i>To anything.</i>

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,387
<i>They just keep staring,</i>
<i>like people do with this car.</i>

17
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,891
<i>A Lamborghini is for a certain kind</i>
<i>of person that wants to make an entrance,</i>

18
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,309
<i>who wants to make a statement,</i>

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,978
<i>does not want to slip by unnoticed.</i>

20
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,022
<i>This is a car for people</i>
<i>whose attitude is...</i>

21
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,732
I'm not gonna be ignored!

22
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:09,527
<i>What I like about Lamborghinis</i>
<i>is they don't care too much about reality.</i>

23
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,530
<i>They're fantasy cars for people</i>
<i>who are living in fantasy worlds.</i>

24
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:16,117
<i>So today, I'm gonna act out a fantasy</i>
<i>with a very close friend of mine,</i>

25
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:20,497
<i>the incredibly funny, talented,</i>
<i>irresistible Matthew Broderick</i>

26
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,165
Where are we, Matthew?

27
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,543
<i>Matthew and I love to talk</i>
<i>about classic comedy and baseball.</i>

28
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,588
<i>That is our relationship,</i>
<i>and I'll bet you we do it again today.</i>

29
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,924
We really got lucky with the weather.

30
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,302
Yes, we would've had to just talk
in a nice, comfortable coffee shop.

31
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,554
<i>Which is why I am Jerry Seinfeld,</i>

32
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,808
<i>and this is</i>
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.

33
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,605
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Matthew!</i>

34
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,817
- <i>How are you?</i>
- <i>I'm so excited.</i>

35
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,902
- <i>Me too. Me too.</i>
- <i>Really?</i>

36
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,029
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>We just get to be together</i>

37
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,989
<i>and that's just always fun.</i>

38
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,699
<i>Yeah. I'm stoked.</i>

39
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,868
<i>Oh, that's a great word...</i>

40
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,995
- <i>...if you're an idiot!</i>

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,248
<i>I'm pulling up to your house right now,</i>

42
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,958
<i>-and we're gonna start off...</i>
-<i>Okay.</i>

43
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,001
<i>...with a fantasy.</i>
<i>Be there in a couple of minutes.</i>

44
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,128
<i>I'm very curious.</i>

45
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,881
- Hi, Matthew.
-Hello.

46
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,716
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you, too.

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,427
Okay, my idea for this day...

48
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,429
Yeah.

49
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,849
...is you and I

50
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,602
have had these careers
in the entertainment industry,

51
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,188
which was our dream.
That's what we wanted to do.

52
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,274
-We wanted to be entertainers.
-We wanted to be that.

53
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,192
-Yeah.
-And then we got to do that.

54
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,986
-It really worked out well.
-Yeah.

55
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,822
But we had another dream.

56
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,157
And that dream...

57
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,243
was to be baseball players.

58
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,703
- Uh-huh.

59
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:45,248
Which did not work out.
But if we did become baseball players,

60
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,542
this is the kind of car we would buy.

61
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,877
Right.

62
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,337
Young baseball players
drive cars like this.

63
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,548
-Yeah.
-They want to get attention.

64
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,924
-Of course.
-They want the world--

65
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,218
-Their dream has come true.
-"Yeah. I made it!

66
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,720
I made it to the bigs."

67
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,765
-Wow.
-Yeah.

68
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,350
It also has this mode.

69
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,063
Irritate the neighbor mo--
What is that mode called?

70
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,565
Neighbor Irritablé.

71
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,281
And what's your coffee, um, routine?

72
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,869
Like, two double espressos
in the morning.

73
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,078
Wow.

74
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,371
Do you make them yourself?

75
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,497
I make them myself.

76
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,208
But you push one button,

77
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,375
you put a pod in.

78
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,711
-Oh. Oh, that's awful.
-So, not really "making."

79
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,254
Thank you.

80
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,551
-Pretty good coffee, though.
-I know, it is. You're right.

81
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,055
-I've had it and it is pretty good.
-I know, but it takes all the, uh...

82
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,515
the connection to the bean.

83
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,351
-The connection to the bean.
-Yeah.

84
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,268
-Yes.
-I like that.

85
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,811
-I miss that.
-I like that.

86
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,858
- Village Cigars is still here.
-Still here since I was a little kid,

87
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,152
where I grew up three blocks from here.

88
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:01,157
What is it like to have spent
your entire life in one place?

89
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,451
-You've been here your entire life.
-It's really strange.

90
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,704
-Yeah, my first play was there even.
-Yeah.

91
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,248
-Uh...
-You're like Jesus.

92
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,583
I am a little like Jesus.

93
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,336
Sometimes I think it's really cool
that I, um...

94
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,171
that I've always been in the same place,

95
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,007
and sometimes I think,
"Well, it's... it's tragic actually."

96
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,135
I just never, uh... I never saw anything.
Nothing happened.

97
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,638
The name of the book
is <i>Nothing Happened.</i>

98
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,014
<i>-</i>Yeah.
<i>-</i>

99
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,225
This is the building I grew up in.

100
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,227
This gray one right here.

101
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,937
I used to<i> </i>swim back there.

102
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,648
That's the, uh, Leroy Street pool.

103
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,485
At night...
There was a big hole in the fence,

104
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,823
and neighborhood youth
would go through it and swim at night

105
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,992
with no adults or anything.

106
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,410
Did you feel very, uh,

107
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,662
-Bowery Boys when you did that?
-I did.

108
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,163
I felt like a Dead End Kid.

109
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,164
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

110
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,083
"Ah, gee," you know?

111
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,504
All right, so...

112
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:57,964
So...

113
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,842
Oh, I thought... I thought you were
ejecting me for a second.

114
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,138
Doesn't it look like one of those?
You flip it up, boom!

115
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,765
That's so that you don't
accidentally eject anybody.

116
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,184
- It's a little chilly.
- It's a lot chilly.

117
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,936
I thought maybe we should get some

118
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,646
-things to stay warm.
- Yeah.

119
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,149
- I'm sorry, guys. I apologize.
- We can't go in.

120
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,484
I might lose my job
if you guys coming in here, so...

121
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,320
-Oh, so we're not coming in?
-Oh.

122
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,237
Oh, okay.

123
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,697
- Sorry about that.
-All right.

124
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,574
- Big fan of the show....
-Oh.

125
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,868
-Gee, you were almost on it.

126
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,454
-Is that a first for your show?
-Yeah, that's a first.

127
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,081
It had something to do with me,
do you think? Or...

128
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,626
How about this one
with all the mismatched--

129
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,794
The Jenga.

130
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,713
Oh, the Jenga. Yeah, yeah.

131
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,798
Like they needed to do one more drawing.

132
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,967
-"Oh, I'll get to it later."

133
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,011
"Well, we already... we built it already."

134
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,637
Okay. Well...

135
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,473
I had a bit.

136
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,641
"You don't just talk in marriage.

137
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,685
-It's Jenga.

138
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,730
You have to wiggle that block a little
before you slide it."

139
00:05:56,981 --> 00:06:00,651
Can I... Is this something I could say,
or should I not say it?

140
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,074
- Hi.
- Hi.

141
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,700
- How are you?
-Good. How are you?

142
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,161
- Good.
- Uh, can we get some coffees?

143
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,079
Sure.

144
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,290
I, of course, didn't bring any...
any money.

145
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,958
I didn't either.

146
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,752
I have some in the car,
in the Lamborghini.

147
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,128
Cafe latte?

148
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,173
-That's so obnoxious.
- It's awful.

149
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,801
"I left it in my Lamborghini.
Perhaps I could, uh...

150
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,135
You'd trust me for this?"

151
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,180
-Obviously. I have a Lamborghini, so...

152
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,432
-I'm certainly good for it."

153
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,811
-Can I get you anything else?
- Maybe this, uh, <i>pain au chocolat.</i>

154
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,521
<i>-Pain au chocolat?</i>
-Please.

155
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,815
-Two of those.
-Oh, boy.

156
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,235
Maybe just put it on a little, uh...
Or is that the way you normally do it?

157
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,945
-Normally, I...
-Okay, that's fine.

158
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,031
I don't want to disrupt anything.
We had enough trouble at Patagonia.

159
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,913
I love restaurant bits.

160
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,874
I watch a lot of YouTube.
WC Fields sketch popped up,

161
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,751
and he asks, "Can I get some service?"

162
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,461
So, the menu would be out,

163
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,338
and he would say, "I'll have the eggs,"

164
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,507
and she would take out a pencil and go...

165
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,717
-"We don't have that."

166
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:12,432
And each thing he... he asked for,
she would take the pencil out again...

167
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,433
-Yeah.
-And...

168
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,184
-I love it.

169
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,644
And the timing.

170
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,605
They probably did it around the country,
you know, like...

171
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,316
-Yeah. That's the good stuff, right?
-Yeah.

172
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:28,948
This stinks.

173
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,743
Crazy to say something like that?

174
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,122
Look what happened in Patagonia.

175
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,499
"I could lose my job."

176
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,751
The man almost lost his job.

177
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,090
But he was really pained, wasn't he?

178
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,135
He looked like...
like one of those World War II movies

179
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,846
where you don't know
that the Nazis are in the other room.

180
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,931
"No, no, we're closed."
You know, like,

181
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,476
"Come back tomorrow.
That would be a much better idea."

182
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,606
You sure everything's all right here?
"Everything's just fine, yeah."

183
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,150
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

184
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,985
We're going back there.

185
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,821
-Back to Patagonia?
- Yeah.

186
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,658
- I think this is pretty good.
-It stinks.

187
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,578
All right, on we go.

188
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,207
I don't like to walk
with a coffee. You?

189
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,083
Not really.

190
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,668
I don't like the look.

191
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,796
When you see people in LA,
pictures or...

192
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,466
-you know, paparazzi pictures...
-Yeah.

193
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,010
-...they always have a water, a liquid.
-Always!

194
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,387
-Always a liquid.
-Why did you need to be drinking

195
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,014
-all the time?
-Yes.

196
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,099
The guy on TMZ,

197
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,935
while he's eviscerating people,

198
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,687
-has that little baby bottle with him.
-Always. Yep.

199
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,231
-Yeah.

200
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,108
Let's try this again.

201
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:47,818
Hi.

202
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,403
- How are you?
- Hello.

203
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,239
-Are we okay now?
- Yes.

204
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,240
Okay.

205
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,875
That other guy's okay, right?

206
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,502
Tell him we're sorry.

207
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,671
That guy's in the back tied up.

208
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,635
I really want to watch
that diner scene with you now.

209
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,720
<i>Ah, good morning, beautiful!</i>

210
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,847
<i>Got a menu?</i>

211
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,645
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

212
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,565
<i>Is that steak New York cut?</i>

213
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,574
I mean, that's how you say a set-up line.

214
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,076
-Right?
-Yeah.

215
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,452
Loud and clear.

216
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,915
So much water.

217
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,754
And there's absolutely no way the cubes
could actually have gotten in his pants.

218
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,132
-That's excellent.
-Yeah.

219
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,093
Nothing funnier to me
than something like...

220
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,430
very basic kind of setups like that.

221
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,806
Like the Patagonia guy.

222
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,017
-Well, he wasn't...
-He was not.

223
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,477
He was a modern version of that,
'cause he was...

224
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,480
-Right.
-He was denying us, but in an extremely,

225
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,734
"This is hurting me more
than it hurts you" way. It's...

226
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,278
In the old days, you didn't say that.

227
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,821
-Right.
-"What I just tell ya?!"

228
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,573
You know? It was more like that.

229
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,451
"I can't have you in this store."

230
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:20,995
Keep going.

231
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,955
Ask your man
if he wants to switch keys.

232
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,166
Okay. Do you want to switch keys, Jerry?

233
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,709
People love that joke.

234
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,128
-You've heard that one before?
-Oh, yes, I have.

235
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,051
I love when people answer the question,
"Do you know what I mean?"

236
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,719
"Yes, I do know what you mean."

237
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,139
-"Certainly, I do."
-"Why, certainly."

238
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,558
That's an old movie way
to answer things there.

239
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,226
-Abbott and Costello.
-Oh, yeah.

240
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,646
"Certainly she does. Go ask her!"

241
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,482
-Do you like Abbott and Costello?
-What do you think?

242
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,442
I think you like Abbott and Costello.

243
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:56,572
Know what I watched the other day?
<i>The Producers,</i> the original from 1967.

244
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,742
-Yeah.
-The overhead swastika shot,

245
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,327
is that in... in the movie?

246
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,745
-Yeah.
-When you guys did it?

247
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,456
Yes, it's also...
They did it when we did the play...

248
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,667
- Oh.
-...at great expense.

249
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,043
-Right.
-There's a mirror...

250
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,336
-Right.
-...in back.

251
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,879
-Wow.
-And halfway through it,

252
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,047
it, uh...

253
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,299
-tilts forward...
-Right.

254
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,134
...so that the audience sees the swastika.

255
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,594
How insane is that?

256
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,056
The audience would go mad
when they had opened in Chicago.

257
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,849
-Really?
-'Cause they know that shot,

258
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,142
and they want it, you know.

259
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,394
And it's a play. They're like,

260
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,562
-"Oh, they're not gonna get to do that."
-Right.

261
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,023
And sure enough,
the whole mirror tilts forward.

262
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,567
-And they just went crazy.

263
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,777
It was so exciting.

264
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,197
And, you know, the studio
would not release the movie.

265
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,365
They hated it so much.

266
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,450
And you watch it
and you can easily see that happen.

267
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,203
I mean, when he goes to visit, uh,
Kenneth Mars,

268
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,206
he's got a picture of Hitler on the wall.

269
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,793
<i>It's only a handful of years</i>
<i>after World War II.</i>

270
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,462
-I know.
-It's like a September 11th comedy today.

271
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,840
-Yes.
-That's about the same amount of time.

272
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,468
-That's so crazy.
-And, obviously, a far worse tragedy.

273
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,178
-Right?
-Right. Yeah.

274
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,390
So picture someone
making a funny movie today

275
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,851
-about September 11th.
-I know.

276
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,769
<i>That's how crazy that was.</i>

277
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,104
<i>Yeah.</i>

278
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,357
As long as we're going
to Citi Field...

279
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,317
-Yes.
-...tell your Ralph Kiner story.

280
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,861
Well, Ralph Kiner,

281
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,279
<i>a great player and announcer.</i>

282
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,697
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>You know?</i>

283
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,158
He came backstage
when I was doing <i>The Producers.</i>

284
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,368
-I was so excited to meet him.
-Wow.

285
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:28,497
And I told him a heartwarming story
about... that my father,

286
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,791
when I was little, would say,<i> </i>uh,

287
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,378
"Oh, I don't like when, uh,
Bob Murphy takes over.

288
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,838
I feel like then the Mets lose.

289
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,299
I think they do better
when Kiner is talking."

290
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,216
Yeah.

291
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,342
So...

292
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,887
I told... I got to tell Ralph Kiner that,

293
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,888
and he said,

294
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:48,684
"Well, we didn't really have very much
effect on the, uh, outcome of the games

295
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,644
when we were calling them.

296
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,354
Didn't have much effect on it."

297
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,524
-"Oh, okay. Yeah, I guess...

298
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,735
I guess that's true."

299
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,364
My father was, of course, a mental case...

300
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,950
And how stupid he thinks you are.

301
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,245
How stupid do you think I am?
How stupid do you think my father was?

302
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,208
-Yeah.
-But that... what it tells you is,

303
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,169
-the kind of people that come up to him.
-That's true.

304
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,797
He just feels like he should
take everything seriously.

305
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,382
-Yeah. He's trying to be nice about it.
-Very nice.

306
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,384
"No, I'm sorry to break it to you,

307
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,430
our calling the game didn't have
much effect on the outcome." Yeah.

-Ma, the great opportunity for our family.

336
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,873
I think before we go out
on the field...

337
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,001
-You're gonna do some lifting?
-...we should work out a little bit.

338
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,297
I think one set of one exercise
will be enough.

339
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,465
-That should do it.

340
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,217
We don't want to get too big.

After we asked for this car,

somebody bought it.

When shooting <i>Ferris Bueller,</i>

374
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,127
I remember a few days before,

375
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,587
they were having some trouble
with a Ferrari,

376
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,132
and a car kind of like this came.

377
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,717
-Really?
-Yes.

378
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,428
And the director was trying to decide,
he was asking everybody,

379
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,597
"Should I do the classic one
or the super modern..."

380
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,309
-Well, he made the right decision there.
-I think he did.

381
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,687
We had two fake ones that I drove,

382
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,398
and there was another one to just
throw out the window, basically.

383
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,943
And here's what's interesting also,
that movie,

384
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,780
the other... obviously, the big theme,
was baseball.

385
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,615
-Wrigley Field.
<i>-</i>Yeah.

386
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,659
So, there's quite a similarity

387
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,953
-to, uh, the show you're making today.
-Yep.

388
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,751
A driver once told me
Woody Allen won't go in the tunnels,

389
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,544
you have to go over the bridge.

390
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,755
He's too scared of the tunnels.

391
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,467
That's a good, uh, therapist he's got.

392
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,887
-Made a lot of good progress.

393
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,976
Tell me when the light turns.

394
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,146

I think that's fine.

00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,816
God, I just... I have...

396
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,319
I'm tempted to open this door
and have it get ripped off.

397
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,904
Have another car just rip it right off.

398
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,364
-That'd be hilarious.
-I don't know why I wanna do that.

399
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,076

400
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,786
us talking to him.

401
00:17:58,869 --> 00:17:59,912
I just want to explain---

402
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,747
Take it easy. You're
gonna notice a little...

403
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,540
-Just take it easy.
-Yeah.

404
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,973
Oh, we're really just eating?

405
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,726
-Yeah.
-We're not saying anything entertaining.

406
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,646
It's like therapy.

407
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,190
I don't know anything about therapy.

408
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,860
I don't really like to talk about things
that are bothering me.

409
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,362
I don't either.

410
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,697
When you go there, you enjoy it.

411
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,783
I don't always enjoy it.

412
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,202
Well, nobody always enjoys anything.

413
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,746
I think we're fighting.

414
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:50,504

418
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,722
Well, I think I just cracked a nut there.
I just...

419
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,018
But, yes. You want your father's advice.

420
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,563
Yeah. Or your mom, you know?

421
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,606
Yeah.

422
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,733

423
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,693

424
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,946
-Not the one that's yelling all the time.
-I think I just cracked a nut.

425
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,702
Yeah, sometimes I'll hear
a little bit of another patient.

426
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,997
'Cause he's slow to his answering thing.
And so...

427
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,958
I'll hear, "Hello, Doctor. I...

428
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,751
I can't make Tuesday."

429
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,505
Then he reaches for the thing,
you hear some whining.

430
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,884

and there's just no way we--"

431
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,766

432
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,852

-Yeah, good coffee.

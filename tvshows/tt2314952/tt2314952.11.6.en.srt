3
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:18,768
<i>This is a 1969</i>
<i>Maserati Mistral Spyder.</i>

4
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,731
<i>They only made 125 of them.</i>

5
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,484
<i>It's got a five speed.</i>
<i>It does 158 miles an hour.</i>

6
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,529
<i>The engine is a six cylinder, four liter,</i>

7
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,740
<i>with two spark plugs per cylinder.</i>

8
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,867
<i>-That makes it really come alive.</i>

9
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,994
<i>The thing about this car is the lines.</i>

10
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,871
<i>Sleek, smooth, elegant.</i>

11
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,873
<i>It's just a thin, little blade of a car.</i>

12
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,375
<i>The front wheel cutout</i>
<i>is a certain type of shape</i>

13
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,794
<i>you're only going to see</i>
<i>on an Italian car.</i>

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,256
<i>So many chic, small details</i>
<i>that you don't even really notice,</i>

15
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,759
<i>but when it drives by,</i>
<i>you go, "What was that?"</i>

16
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,387
<i>That is the power of good design.</i>
<i>It elevates us up a little bit.</i>

17
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,973
<i>-Then there's the sound of this car.</i>
<i>-</i>

18
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,851
<i>Makes you feel like you're better looking,</i>
<i>more well mannered,</i>

19
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,020
<i>more accomplished than you actually are.</i>

20
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:07,025
<i>So, it's a very special car,</i>
<i>perfect for a very special person</i>

21
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,944
<i>that I have been a huge fan of</i>
<i>for many, many years,</i>

22
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,696
<i>Mr. Jamie Foxx.</i>

23
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,156
What up, JS?

24
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,493
<i>Who also brings</i>
<i>a beautiful smoothness to all of his work.</i>

25
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,329
<i>His stand-up, his acting,</i>
<i>his talk show appearances.</i>

26
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,998
<i>Everything he does</i>
<i>is full of interesting details.</i>

27
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>So, not just another car,</i>

28
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,460
<i>and not just another guy.</i>

29
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,171
<i>JS, what's poppin'?</i>
<i>It's Foxx, baby.</i>

30
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,339
<i>What's up? What we doin'?</i>

31
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:33,635
<i>I fly down to New Orleans,</i>
<i>have a cup of coffee with you.</i>

32
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,054
<i>-How much do I love you?</i>
- <i>Come on, man.</i>

33
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,223
<i>I'm so excited.</i>
<i>I can't wait to see you.</i>

34
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,141
- <i>I can't wait either.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

35
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,019
<i>And that is why I am Jerry Seinfeld,</i>

36
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,314
<i>and this</i>
<i>is </i>Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.

37
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,568
-Can Jamie come out?

38
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,905
Okay. So, this is you.

39
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,323
-That's crazy.
-Why?

40
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,658
-Why?
-Why is that me?

41
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,867
Yeah, you know why?

42
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,993
-Why?
-Elegance.

43
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,703
Huh. I feel that.

44
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,289
Huh, look at that thing,

45
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,874
and it's <i>rojo!</i>

46
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,088
I'm from Texas,
so I was always like, you know...

47
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,048
-Terrell.
-...sort of speaking. Yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,384
Do you have that Texas attitude?

49
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,010
Like, what do you mean?

50
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,847
-People in Texas, you know...
-What do you mean? Like...

51
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,099
They're a little excited about it.

52
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,184
-A little excited about it.

53
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,271
-Texas is a great place, man. It's...
-Okay. Okay.

54
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,986
Carson was really a window for me
with everything

55
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,155
because it was stand-up comedy,

56
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,489
but it was also music.

57
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,407
Right.

58
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,410
What's my man's name
that I used to watch all the time?

59
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,371
He never got a chance
to sit on the couch with Carson.

60
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,706
It was a singer.

61
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,376
-Oh, yeah. It's Joe Williams.
-Joe Williams!

62
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,462
- Joe Williams. Never sat down.
-Never gets a chance to sit down.

63
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,589
-It was a thing.
-A thing?

64
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,883
So, me and my grandmother
and my grandfather,

65
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,134
every time Joe would get up...

66
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,552
<i>♪ And would I ♪</i>

67
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,221
-And those big  teeth, right?

68
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,473
- Yeah.
- He had the greatest set of teeth.

69
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,017
And my grandmother...

70
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,562
would talk about his teeth.
"Ooh, I love Joe's teeth.

71
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,857
Ooh, I just wish they'd let Joe sit
on the couch with his pretty teeth.

72
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,943
This is just...
He don't ever get to sit on the couch."

73
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,320
Finally, Joe's singing.

74
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,197
Incredible performance.

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,534
<i>♪ And would I be sure</i>
<i>That this would be the one ♪</i>

76
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,786
Johnny goes, "All right, Joe.

77
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,748
Why don't ya come on over
and, uh, sit with us?"

78
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,376
And my family held each other.

79
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,338
Joe was going to go sit on the couch.

80
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,967
And I think he got too excited,
and he starts to run to the couch.

81
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,012
But the microphone cable

82
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,097
is tied around his leg.

83
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,476
And he stumbles.

84
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,479
- Come on over here, Joe. Yeah!

85
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,396
Oh!

86
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,401
So, he finally...
He finally unwinds out of the cable,

87
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,904
gets to the couch,
and they had to go to commercial.

88
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,325
-You're singing so good.
-I better sing, 'cause I'm no acrobat.

89
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,537
We'll see you tomorrow. Good night.

90
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,795
How much do you think...

91
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,880
"I wanna be like you?"

92
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,550
When you do LeBron, from here to here.

93
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,261
-Okay.
-Let's go, Ro.

94
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,220
Let's go, Jerry.

95
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,182
How old were you
when you stepped up there?

96
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,060
-I had to be 18.
- Eighteen.

97
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,021
I was in college
on a classical piano scholarship

98
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,108
-that my grandmother bust her ass to get.
-Right, right.

99
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,526
And here I am,

100
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,279
eighty-one different countries
in my school,

101
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,488
playing music,

102
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,032
the only American in my class.

103
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,118
-Wow!
-So, I couldn't play the black card,

104
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,787
'cause the dude from Nigeria would,
"Please! Please!

105
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,581
You're talking about you're black!
I'm from Nigeria! Please."

106
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,085
As I'm getting ready
to do my new stand-up...

107
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,713
-Yeah.
-...and I know that I've done the...

108
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,215
showy and the energy.

109
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,301
Now, I got to stand flat-footed

110
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,554
-and now box southpaw.
-Right.

111
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,681
You're on your own planet now.

112
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,142
-The approval of the people is great.
-Yeah.

113
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,811
'Cause the people are gonna be,
"I'm here.

114
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,480
I wanna see it.
Go ahead, do the goof goofy."

115
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,776
But it's something about having
the comedian call you and say, "Yo!"

116
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,404
-Am I right?
-Yeah, you're right.

117
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,948
Of course you're right. But remember this.

118
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,118
What we will always respect the most
in the end

119
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,828
is what you did to that crowd.

120
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,581
That's what we respect the most
in the end.

121
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,168
I'll tell you
what's difficult now.

122
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,252
I did Fallon.

123
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,755
I did seven jokes.

124
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,007
All killed. I got seven...

125
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,343
entities...

126
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:44,969
that caused...

127
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,180
-I did a pitbull joke.
-Right.

128
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,265
I said, "Those pitbulls
can be cantankerous."

129
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,436
And the pitbull community
was up in arms.

130
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,939
They said, "Pitbulls are nice animals."
I've been around pitbulls.

131
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,483
I've owned pitbulls.

132
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:02,236
Even my own pitbulls,
every time I go to feed them, "You good?"

133
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,655
-"Yeah, we good, . Just..."

134
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,491
"Put that  down
where you need to put it."

135
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,994
-That's great.
-I'm feeding one, the other...

136
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,121
The other one's behind me
locking the gate, like...

137
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,874
"Hey, did you just lock the gate, nig?"

138
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,502
"Yeah, we just wanna talk about
our surroundings, B. It's all good.

139
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,129
Just gotta talk about this whole thing.
We need bigger..."

140
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,424
So, like, what you all talking about?

141
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,345
Fallon was doing his announcements,

142
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,930
and I was signing.

143
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,892
But I wasn't signing real,
I was just, you know?

144
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,645
I didn't know
that the next guest was deaf.

145
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,064
So...

146
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,109
-That's pretty funny.
-I was like...

147
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,444
And then the next guest was like,
"Come on!"

148
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,696
"Come on!" I was--

149
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,492
"What the  is this?
What the ?"

150
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,952
I was like, "Oh, ."

151
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,621
But then I watched Chappelle.

152
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,915
-And then I'm okay.
-Yeah.

153
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,834
-'Cause Chappelle's like, you know?
-Yeah.

154
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,669
"I was incensed! Bam!

155
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,255
Can't talk about nothing, man.

156
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,675
Somebody walked up and they said,
'There's Dave Chappelle.'

157
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,844
I said, 'Damn! Wutang, nigga."

158
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,472
I love Dave because he always uses
a very intelligent word...

159
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,765
-Yeah.
-...to go with his hood.

160
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,142
"I was beside myself.

161
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,852
I was chartreuse!

162
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,603
Damn, nigga!

163
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,273
-Perspicacity of these people."

164
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,527
When I was young,
my grandma used to say

165
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,280
that one day a fool would be president.

166
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,823
I said, "What do you mean?"

167
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,284
The way we get presidents

168
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,411
you don't have to have...

169
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,955
experience.

170
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,582
-Any other job other than...
-Right.

171
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,750
-Have you ever been president before?
-None of that.

172
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,878
-Have you ever run any other country?
-Nothing.

173
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,338
You've never been a dictator or a...?
Nothing.

174
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,425
The worst thing a comedian can do

175
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,052
is start to think he looks good...

176
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,556
and start dressing a certain way.

177
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,018
Any kind of leather or...

178
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,979
And I had a little bit of that...

179
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,358
coming up, where I thought my
was too good.

180
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,943
And I started making a little money,

181
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,530
and I went on stage, years ago,
and I started doing rich jokes.

182
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,490
Uh-huh.

183
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,741
"I got that Range Rover.

184
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,576
Anybody else?"

185
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,369
"When you get the square footage
of your home

186
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,497
and it's less than 5,000 square feet,

187
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,040
that can be kind of cramped."

188
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,919
And people were looking at me like,
"What the ?"

189
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,795
I get off stage, I'm like,
"I'm Jamie Foxx."

190
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,341
In my mind, they're going...

191
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,092
But they're literally...

192
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,762
And when I get off stage
and I'm walking out,

193
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,222
it was a little club in LA,

194
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,724
as I'm standing outside the club,

195
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,559
somebody opens the door...

196
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,563
"Who the  is that in there?"

197
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,149
And when I opened the door,

198
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,778
it's a skinny black kid

199
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,364
with a little tank top on.

200
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,907
His name was Chris Tucker.

201
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,201
And he was hungry.

202
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,370
And he walked past me like, "."

203
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,329
Ah.

204
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,081
That's... "You think you're rich?"

205
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,040
And I was like...

206
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,877
The next night, I went up somewhere,
I bombed. Bombed again.

207
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,003
'Cause I was...

208
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,756
-I was behind my gate.
-Wow.

209
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,757
And then...

210
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,802
I remember getting, um,
a little embarrassed

211
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,595
'cause I'm thinking
everybody knew who I was,

212
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,597
and I'm at The Comedy Store hanging out.

213
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,433
And this girl walks up to me,
"Oh, my God!

214
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,894
Oh, my God!"
I'm like, "Yo, what's up?

215
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,229
What's up?"

216
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,606
"Do you know where Chris Tucker is?"
"Uh...

217
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,899
-Um, uh..."

218
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,944
And the girl looked and me and said,
"You look so familiar."

219
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,488
I was like, "Oh, ."

220
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,448
So, I was in a funk.

221
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,535
One thing I did have to do, too.
I had gained a little weight.

222
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,497
So, I had a little fame face.

223
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,584
-You know what "fame face" is?
-Like, living well.

224
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,628
At that time, the urban wear was a vest,
for anything.

225
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,964
You always had on your shirt,
and then, a vest.

226
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,467
But I only had two buttons clasped
because this right here...

227
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,136
And I finished a joke,

228
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,597
and while I'm resting
and getting my breath for my next joke,

229
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,641
a black girl goes,
"Why your belly so big?" I said, "Oh."

230
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,856
-And, you know, a black woman's voice...

231
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,234
-A black woman's voice can stamp anything.
-It cuts.

232
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,653
And that same black woman is everywhere.

233
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,530
You ever see a fight out in the street?

234
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,533
You always hear a black woman,
"Oh, my God! They fightin'!"

235
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,535
-It's always that.

236
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,078
It can be in the middle of Indiana

237
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,205
and all white people fighting,
no black people around,

238
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,167
but you will hear a black woman,
 "Oh, my God! They fightin'!"

239
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,631
So, I come back, I lose the weight,
I get back on my .

240
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,884
As a matter of fact,
we win the Oscar for <i>Ray.</i>

241
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,596
But when I win the Oscar,
I don't take the Oscar home.

242
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,556
I give it to my manager. "You take this."

243
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,141
"You want it?" "No."

244
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,518
I said, "Because if I take that...

245
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,730
I'll buy into the Oscar ...

246
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,732
-Ah.
-...and I won't be funny anymore."

247
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,567
'Cause when you hold the Oscar...

248
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,736
For whatever reason,
when I was holding that Oscar,

249
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,781
I automatically started to speak
in an English accent.

250
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,992
"There I was in the jungles of Africa,
knee deep in hyena dung,

251
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,663
when I was approached
by the music of Ray in a spiritual form."

252
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,415
And I, "Get the .
I don't want none of this ."

253
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,127
It was a big argument with me
and my management at the time

254
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,172
on what jokes I should do
after winning the Oscar.

255
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,050
So there was a rumor that me and Oprah
were seeing each other.

256
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,426
I was like, "This is perfect."

257
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,387
So, when I went to Madison Square Garden

258
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,305
-for the first time after the Oscars...
-Right.

259
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,224
...I said, "Yeah, I'm out here dating.

260
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,268
They're out here saying I'm sleeping
with everybody." So, people are yelling.

261
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,396
So, I'm laying in bed with Oprah...

262
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,566
I lean over to Gail and say,
"Man, this  is crazy, huh?"

263
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,820
I don't usually talk like this,

264
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,197
but you are so blessed

265
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,449
-to have that attitude.
-Yeah.

266
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,910
-It's not my kind of of word.
-It's not your kind of word.

267
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:43,911
But I have to use it.

268
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,665
-I know you're always...
- Look at this dish.

269
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,792
-Y'all smother...
-You wanna say that? I don't...

270
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,919
-The Jewish Coonass.
-I'm not saying that.

271
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,921
- I'm not ordering that.

272
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,510
I was gonna ask you about the parties.
I would like to come.

273
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,554
-Any time.
-Is there a... Can I...

274
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,514
Can I be a part of that?

275
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,267
-I've thrown parties for everybody.
-Yeah, I know.

276
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,185
See, I remember having Denzel there.

277
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,063
He just talked to the table.
"Well, you know, um...

278
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,399
All right, okay. So, you know, straight."

279
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,276
So, I'm 22 years old,

280
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,485
I'm doing comedy.

281
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,488
For real, every night, about a year.

282
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,074
This black dude stops me
on Columbus Circle,

283
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:26,328
"Saw your set the other night."
 I'm going on 2:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. only.

284
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,706
-That's the only time I could get on.
-Wow.

285
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,001
Right? So, he was talking to me.
"I saw the bit, I like what you're doing."

286
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,210
And I go, "Thank you very..."

287
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,254
You know, at that age
you remember every person...

288
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,964
-Yeah, yeah.
-...that responds to you.

289
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,591
Twenty-five years later,

290
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:39,967
I'm in LA,

291
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,470
I get invited to this restaurant,
it's a private thing.

292
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,639
And Denzel's there. He's like...
"I'd love... I love this guy."

293
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,516
I meet him, shake his hand and go,

294
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,102
"Thrilled to meet you.
I'm a huge fan of your stuff."

295
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,520
He goes, "We've met."

296
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,523
I go, "Where?" He goes, "Columbus Circle.
You remember?"

297
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,649
"Oh, my God!

298
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,944
-That was you?"
-Ah!

299
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,449
There is something
that God gave us that preserves us.

300
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,743
When they're laughing at your stuff,

301
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,871
-you're being infused with golden light.
- Yeah.

302
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,208
First time you go to Hawaii, remember
how the air smelled? The sweetness of it?

303
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,543
-What is that?
-What is that smell?

304
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,879
We get that anywhere.

305
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,923
-That's crazy.
-It ever bother you when...

306
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:22,426
I used to work... We worked in a club,
people would smoke. All smoke.

307
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,345
-Did that bother you? No!
-No.

308
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,430
The laughter purifies the air.

309
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,723
Ah!

310
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,559
-I just turned 50.
-Yeah.

311
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,394
But my 50...

312
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,314
compared to where I grew up...

313
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,191
-Yeah.
-...is different.

314
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,776
Way different.

315
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,902
My 50 is like...

316
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,571
And their 50 is like,
"Boy, little boy, look at you.

317
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,199
Jamie!"

318
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,288
So, when it comes to you,
a comedy movie...

319
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,915
I just directed my own.

320
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,710
I just packed it with every favor
that I could get.

321
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,254
-Right.
-But what I did was...

322
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,881
we all play different nationalities.

323
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,218
So, I called Robert Downey Jr.,
I said, "Listen,

324
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,095
-I want you to play a Mexican."
- Right.

325
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,807
And he goes, "Dude, here's the deal.

326
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,058
Sure, of course.

327
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,228
Of course, you would say Mexican.
Why wouldn't I think other than..."

328
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,024
-Not too long ago...
- Mm-hmm.

329
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,151
...being black in Hollywood...

330
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,654
We still have our struggles,

331
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,406
but it's different.

332
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:29,535
I was talking to someone about this,
about white, male actors.

333
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,745
-Yeah.
-What I noticed was

334
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,081
-it's a billion of them.
-Yeah.

335
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,960
So the competition is  ridiculous.

336
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,879
There's Channing Tatum,
there's Jake Gyllenhaal.

337
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,590
There's a billion people for a few roles.

338
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,050
This is the Chris Rock, uh, answer.

339
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,343
"There's ten niggas."

340
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,933
How much do you like Rock?

341
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,393
Rock kills me.

342
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,022
His conflictedness of whatever
is going on in the world is always,

343
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,274
"You know..."

344
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,069
And he has a lot of impending doom,
you know.

345
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,363
"I'm just tryin' to stay in.
I'm tryin' to stay..."

346
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,240
You'll be all right. You'll be fine.

347
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,658
Leno's like that, too.

348
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,869
Always telling you some story
about some security guard

349
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,787
that used to have a series, you know.

350
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,331
"Yeah, yeah..."

351
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,124
-"You keep working or..."
-"He was on top."

352
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,083
Yeah.

353
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,460
"He's going the other way."

354
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,756
I think what happens
in New Orleans cuisine,

355
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,342
a lot of times, it's a lot of...

356
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:27,968
uh...

357
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,721
dressings, and étouffée, and...

358
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,139
-Just okay.

359
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,266
Just give me the  chicken.

360
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,560
Fry it.

361
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,103
Don't...

362
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,148
You know, they got the pig étouffée.

363
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,400
You know, just give me
the regular .

364
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,028
Yeah. No, they reach into a swamp here,

365
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,988
-and they just grab anything...
-Yeah.

366
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,073
...and then eat it.

367
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,618
"We got the sweat from the alligator.

368
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,744
Concentrate.

369
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,163
Alligator sweat."

370
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,917
-It's like Quentin.
- Tarantino.

371
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,126
I love <i>Django.</i>

372
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,671
You really got to do
one of his great things.

373
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,838
-Yeah.
-That was so great.

374
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,590
It was crazy.

375
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,134
Damn! What the hell is left for you?

376
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,053
Man, that stand-up.

377
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,639
We got... This whole thing
about stand-up is vast.

378
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,641
Oh, it's like an episode of <i>Star Trek.</i>

379
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,268
-There's always another planet.
-Always another planet.

380
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,603
Always another planet.

381
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,898
We shot <i>Django, </i>my daughter was four.

382
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,192
-She was on the set of that.
-Oh, that's funny.

383
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,987
Watching people get blown away.

384
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,074
"More blood, Daddy."

385
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,787
My 24-year-old, who was 18 at the time,

386
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,914
that's when I learned about millennials.

387
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,002
'Cause we're on the plantation, I took
them. "I want you to see your history.

388
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,671
Where we come from, the black people."
I'm over there singing...

389
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,589
<i>♪ Swing low sweet ch-- ♪</i>

390
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,507
And I'm crying.

391
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,760
And my daughter is like,
"Plantation life."

392
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,433
"Plantation life."
I was like, "What the ?"

393
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,769
"People died!" She's like, "I know, Dad.

394
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,312
I know. It's on my Instagram.

395
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,731
Plantation life."

396
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,611
I love the brotherhood, Jamie. I love it.

397
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,697
Oh, man, if you hang out at our house,

398
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,615
you gotta have thick skin.

399
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,451
-Don't bring a date.

400
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,327
My barber's funny.

401
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,372
My... Everybody's funny.
Everybody cracks jokes.

402
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,666
-That's funny.
-My mom's crazy. Everybody, so...

403
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,671
So, it's our job to keep the population
feeling that same way.

404
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,589
Yeah.

405
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,758
-Keep... It's a joke.
-Yeah.

406
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,885
-It's not real.
-Yeah, you have to.

407
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,803
-Just relax a little bit.
-You have to.

408
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,362
Michael Richards would figure out
how to get in the car

409
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,323
and get hit with it
as he's getting in the car,

410
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,116
and then drop out of frame.

411
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,034
Yeah.

411
00:17:58,305 --> 00:18:58,903

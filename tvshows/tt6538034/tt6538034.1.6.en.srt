00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:21,444
Nelly?

3
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:24,173
Nelly?

4
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:25,874
I don't know what to do here,
Stace.

5
00:01:25,914 --> 00:01:27,442
What's going on, Nelly?

6
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:29,044
If I lay a bare fucking finger
on him,

7
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:32,481
- I'll rip the life out of him.
- I won't let you!

8
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:35,249
So stop me!

9
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:37,085
- Who's next, Daisy?
- It's him!

10
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,494
It's him who got Jody!

11
00:01:41,697 --> 00:01:44,567
Hey! You seemed convinced
it was Gavin.

12
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,862
I'm just...

13
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:50,572
I'm just trying to hear you,
Nelly.

14
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:56,071
The piece of shit
that got at Jody,

15
00:01:56,111 --> 00:02:00,142
he coaxed her out with promises
of my mum's saltfish dumplings.

16
00:02:00,182 --> 00:02:03,911
Did you know that? Cos it's
there in what he wrote to her.

17
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:07,648
I've seen it.
How many of you lot have...

18
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:11,220
seen it anywhere,
heard it on a whisper,

19
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,922
heard it from anybody
at any time?

20
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:16,124
- None of us, Nelly.
- Then how comes he has?

21
00:02:16,164 --> 00:02:19,026
Cos he was just there,
arguing the toss about his mate,

22
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,661
saying that Gavin
wasn't the sort

23
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:22,631
to sit up
until the middle of the night,

24
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:25,833
talking about her grandmother's
saltfish dumplings.

25
00:02:25,873 --> 00:02:27,035
That's what he said.

26
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:30,137
- Is that not what you said?
- He did say that, just now,

27
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:32,508
when Nelly had a go at him
about laughing.

28
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:34,309
- I heard it somewhere.
- No, you didn't.

29
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:37,012
Online somewhere, the police.

30
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:41,015
He's fucking lying, right there!
The filth never let it out.

31
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:43,952
They deliberately held it back,
made a point of it,

32
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:46,829
which is why I know
and none of you lot do.

33
00:02:47,763 --> 00:02:49,258
So how comes he does?

34
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:50,691
Unless it was him

35
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:53,262
who was fucking writing to her,
how come?

36
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:55,564
- Luke?
- I'm calling it a night, Stace.

37
00:02:55,604 --> 00:02:57,533
- No, you're not.
- No, you ain't. No, no.

38
00:02:57,573 --> 00:03:00,535
You're staying put.

39
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:02,703
- Bugger!
- You've got to be sure, Nel.

40
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:04,806
- I want to leave, Stace!
- I can't stand this!

41
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:06,173
Please!

42
00:03:06,213 --> 00:03:08,142
- Nelly! Nelly!
- Nelly!

43
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:10,145
Mum, stay over there!

44
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:12,314
Are you sure about this?

45
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:13,949
Goz, get Daisy out of here.

46
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:16,292
Park yourself!

47
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,828
<i>♪ Hey, this is Jody ♪</i>

48
00:03:27,868 --> 00:03:29,598
<i>♪ Sorry you can't get through ♪</i>

49
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:32,134
<i>♪ Why don't you leave your name
and your number ♪</i>

50
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:34,610
<i>♪ And I'll get back to you ♪</i>

51
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:41,343
How the fuck did you do that?

52
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:45,153
Make it like it was her
calling me. How's that done?

53
00:03:46,153 --> 00:03:48,016
I'm all right.

54
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:51,218
And it was you, right,
calling, right from the off.

55
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:53,921
The messages I left, the two
of you back there, laughing,

56
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:56,357
watching me spin.

57
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:59,260
And for why?
I mean, why did you do it?

58
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,063
I mean, why would you?

59
00:04:01,103 --> 00:04:04,199
I don't know, Nelly, but if I
had to guess, I'd say

60
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,368
maybe it's because you're
such a supreme cunt of a man.

61
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:09,904
- Fucking Ada, Luke.
- What, Goz?

62
00:04:09,944 --> 00:04:12,040
- Bit sociopathic!
- Get back in your box!

63
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,809
You're the worst of them,
making him out as the big 'un,

64
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:17,312
- kissing his ring every chance.
- Nelly has a pop at you,

65
00:04:17,352 --> 00:04:18,914
and you decide to nick his kid?

66
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:21,415
- Does that plan make any sense?
- It wasn't a plan.

67
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:24,653
I just wanted to knock him down.
I've heard him more than once,

68
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:27,154
pissed up, going on about
his kid that he didn't know.

69
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:28,923
Thought we'd use her
to mess him about.

70
00:04:28,963 --> 00:04:30,258
Mess him about?

71
00:04:30,298 --> 00:04:32,260
Weren't hard.
Gavin found her easy as.

72
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,029
- Where is she, Luke?
- She sent herself half-naked.

73
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:36,365
It weren't us.

74
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:39,701
Didn't ask for that. She liked
the way she looked in it, or...

75
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:40,868
Stop it.

76
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:42,671
- It's sick.
- Stop it!

77
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:45,673
Some shit she wanted to share
with him. We weren't asking.

78
00:04:45,713 --> 00:04:48,276
You used it, though, as bait,
didn't you?

79
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:50,312
I mean, once you had it...

80
00:04:50,352 --> 00:04:53,081
once you started grooming...

81
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:55,816
It weren't grooming.

82
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:57,919
Didn't do that.
Didn't groom anyone!

83
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,321
I'm sorry, what the fuck did
you do if you didn't do that?

84
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:02,190
For a laugh.

85
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,392
To fucking see, like...
to see what would happen.

86
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:08,430
Well, you dangled her out there
for the nasties to feed on.

87
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,873
Cos that's what you did, yeah?

88
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:17,879
What happened just...
bloody happened.

89
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:20,375
Police.

90
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:22,443
All he said, call 'em.

91
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:24,712
Yeah, well, fuck this.
I'm not gonna...

92
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:26,447
- Marky, don't!
- Just leave it.

93
00:05:26,487 --> 00:05:28,849
I want to go home now.

94
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,719
Let's go, mate.
Yeah, let's go home.

95
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,089
- Fucking stay there! Hear me?
- Nel, I'm taking Daiz home.

96
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:36,758
- Walk me home now.
- That's enough, yeah? Let's go.

97
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:39,727
Goz, listen to me. I'm staying.

98
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:42,964
I'm not going
until I know Nelly's all right.

99
00:05:43,004 --> 00:05:47,202
Nelly, babes, just... triple 9,
and get Luke out of here.

100
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:49,503
- Marky, please!
- Go sit down!

101
00:05:49,543 --> 00:05:51,947
Claire's gone
to get me 15 grand.

102
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:58,779
15, or as much as she can,
from that Barry she married.

103
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:01,983
- Nelly...
- Cos tomorrow...

104
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:04,318
Tomorrow me and Melon
are meant to walk into a room

105
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:07,455
and it's wall-to-wall nonces.

106
00:06:07,495 --> 00:06:11,726
We're meant to go in there and
bid against all the rest of them

107
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:14,195
to see who gets to
first fuck my kid.

108
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:16,105
Jesus Christ.

109
00:06:17,906 --> 00:06:20,068
That's where I am with this now.

110
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:22,536
Stace will tell you
what I'm saying.

111
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:25,306
That's what he has got me
doing with myself.

112
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:28,342
It's what he's done to Claire
and it's where he's put Jody.

113
00:06:28,382 --> 00:06:30,145
And I know
I've been blind to myself,

114
00:06:30,185 --> 00:06:32,180
stomping around
and throwing my weight.

115
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,849
I know what I've been like.

116
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:37,786
But it's got me this close.

117
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:39,762
It's got me...

118
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:45,401
...this fucking close
to getting to her.

119
00:06:49,004 --> 00:06:54,435
And I need you, you fucker,
I need you to save tomorrow.

120
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:57,005
Just tell me to who and how
you passed her on,

121
00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:58,072
and then I can end this

122
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:00,407
and my Jody don't have to
go through any more,

123
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:03,245
cos I fucking know
you know more. You do.

124
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:06,248
You know who's got her
or you can point me right.

125
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:09,017
And that is all I need you
to do, just point me right.

126
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:10,559
Tell me where she is!

127
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:15,430
Luke... please.

128
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:20,529
Tell Nelly where his kiddie is.

129
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,563
- I won't, Stace.
- Please.

130
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:24,231
We dicked around on YouTube,

131
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:26,467
found out how to make
bogus calls and made them.

132
00:07:26,507 --> 00:07:29,204
Set the police on me for that
and get on with it, please.

133
00:07:29,244 --> 00:07:31,472
And this ape can beat me
till I'm dead.

134
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:34,476
Still, I won't say a thing,
Stace, I won't.

135
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:37,111
Please, Luke, please!

136
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:41,089
Oh, Christ's sake, Stace,
can he not beg for himself?

137
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:09,350
All right, Nelly?

138
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:16,885
- You on your own?
- What's going on, Nelly?

139
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:18,887
I asked for it to be just you.

140
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:20,862
And it is.

141
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,029
What's this about?

142
00:08:31,105 --> 00:08:33,209
Whose phone is this, Nelly?

143
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:37,404
<i>♪ Hey, this is Jody ♪</i>

144
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:41,216
- <i>♪ Sorry you can't get through ♪</i>
- Where'd you get this?

145
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:51,219
It's his phone.

146
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:55,156
And it was him and his mate
that got at Jody.

147
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:57,291
Stay there.
Who's had a go at him?

148
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:59,960
That was me.
I did that. That was all me.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,597
- Tell me why.
- I need a day.

150
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:04,498
Grow up, Nelly!
Doesn't work like that.

151
00:09:04,538 --> 00:09:07,034
I swear down. Just one day.

152
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:09,169
- Nelly?
- Just... Just one.

153
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,145
- Nelly, don't!
- Just...

154
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:29,590
So she's 15?

155
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,326
I'm guessing, yeah, about that.

156
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:35,162
So you were that whole time
with a 15-year-old girl

157
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:38,473
that was... that was put there
for you to have, Melon?

158
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:42,937
What's her name?

159
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:44,571
Cerys.

160
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:47,208
Right.

161
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:50,644
Cerys was there for you
to do with as you pleased,

162
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:54,122
for you to prove yourself to
the men you'd been out with.

163
00:09:57,392 --> 00:10:00,195
Oh, I...
I barely touched her, I swear.

164
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:10,172
Barely? Like you
barely did with me?

165
00:10:14,642 --> 00:10:16,204
No.

166
00:10:16,244 --> 00:10:18,473
No, nothing like that,
nothing like us.

167
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:21,176
I did everything I could
not to touch her.

168
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:23,744
Everything you could?

169
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:26,181
Melon, it sounds like
you were fighting yourself

170
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:27,983
- and had to keep on fighting.
- Myself?

171
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:29,617
Look, I was there for Nelly.

172
00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:33,187
You know, I had to get...
get them to trust me,

173
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:34,756
to tell me what...
what they know.

174
00:10:34,796 --> 00:10:37,691
You could have
grabbed her and ran.

175
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:40,494
I was there for Nelly's kid.

176
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:45,200
You had someone's kid
right there in reach!

177
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,134
Why is Cerys
only worth stepping over

178
00:10:47,174 --> 00:10:48,603
on the way to
Nelly's little 'un?

179
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:50,372
I don't know.

180
00:10:50,412 --> 00:10:53,374
- You don't know.
- No, I don't know.

181
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:56,643
I want what's going round in
my head to stop going round.

182
00:10:56,683 --> 00:11:00,614
I swear. I swear to God,
I didn't touch her.

183
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:03,084
- I didn't go near her.
- What are you shaking for?

184
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:05,286
I'm not. I don't know.

185
00:11:05,326 --> 00:11:06,795
- Why are you?
- I don't know!

186
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,093
You should have seen
the smile on his face,

187
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:15,296
like he was winning.
He wanted me to go too far.

188
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:18,166
I just gave him a dry slap
and I dragged him out. I had to.

189
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:19,700
A dry slap?

190
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,610
It's one of those. It's a blaps.

191
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,416
You think he sold her?

192
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:30,819
Piecing it, yeah.

193
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:35,682
A nonce wants what he sees
in her by the pool,

194
00:11:35,722 --> 00:11:37,719
offers as much
as will get Luke chatting

195
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,028
and then they work out
how to hand her over.

196
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:42,798
What?

197
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:46,527
Tell me.

198
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,096
He probably wouldn't
but he might have told me.

199
00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:50,732
- He wouldn't have.
- Not just because

200
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:52,633
I wouldn't have been
beating it out of him

201
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:54,835
but because I'm not you.

202
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,238
That's what it's all about
for him... you.

203
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:00,340
In his psycho,
nut-job brain, yeah.

204
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,176
Yes, in his psycho,
nut-job brain.

205
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:03,844
You're the last person
he'll tell.

206
00:12:03,884 --> 00:12:05,821
He never will, will he?

207
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:12,427
She wasn't calling you, Nelly.

208
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:16,523
It wasn't her.

209
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:19,860
So whatever you think,
whatever you were so sure about

210
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,896
and what we were...

211
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:23,764
- The call was real.
- It isn't that.

212
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:25,733
That call
she made to the police.

213
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:28,235
- That was her, wasn't it?
- It was.

214
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:30,772
It doesn't matter that they
were pissing around calling me

215
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:33,407
because that was her
crying out for you.

216
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:36,243
That was her.
And she was in that room,

217
00:12:36,283 --> 00:12:40,114
that room that those nasty fucks
Luke used, she was there,

218
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:42,323
so we've still got the same
chance at tomorrow.

219
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:46,427
So there you go.

220
00:12:53,268 --> 00:12:55,629
- How much?
- 12.

221
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:58,633
It's all I could get.

222
00:12:58,673 --> 00:13:02,170
I swear to Christ...

223
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:06,340
I mean, I weren't ever a Scout
but, dib-dib and all that shit,

224
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,916
I swear I'm getting her
back for you.

225
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:46,287
Claire?

226
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:54,395
You've got a visitor.

227
00:14:06,374 --> 00:14:08,343
How does that even work?
I don't understand.

228
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:11,339
- We have to release him.
- It doesn't make any sense.

229
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:13,440
We can't hold him on
the evidence that we have.

230
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,243
We can charge him, maybe,

231
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:17,579
- with malicious communication.
- Maybe? Maybe?

232
00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:18,812
But that's it.

233
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:22,216
Search the flat,
search their parents' houses.

234
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:24,418
Officers are up at the uni
as we speak.

235
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,721
So far we've found nothing
to contradict Luke's account.

236
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:30,858
Their intention simply was
to wind up Nelly.

237
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:32,993
- How'd they get Jody's number?
- Gavin got it.

238
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:35,530
They did more than make
calls pretending to be Jody.

239
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,297
They handed her over
to God knows who.

240
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:39,234
As convinced
as Nelly might be...

241
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:40,536
More than just Nelly!

242
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:43,537
Me and him and more than him
heard Luke admit what he'd done.

243
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:45,006
And it was more than just calls.

244
00:14:45,046 --> 00:14:46,641
Is that when Nelly
had Luke here,

245
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:49,243
surrounded by your regulars,
and Marky Betts beat him

246
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:50,511
every time he tried to leave

247
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:52,546
or said anything
Nelly didn't appreciate?

248
00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:54,382
Was it then
Luke started to confess?

249
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:57,252
- He's pressing charges, Stace.
- You're fucking kidding me.

250
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:58,619
Against Nelly and Marky.

251
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:00,887
We'll see what comes in
from the uni.

252
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:02,857
I wanted to tell you in person.

253
00:15:02,897 --> 00:15:04,791
Luke won't be held
for much longer.

254
00:15:04,831 --> 00:15:07,535
I can't believe that
he can press charges.

255
00:15:15,952 --> 00:15:19,182
And you try and find me!

256
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:21,854
And I speed away.

257
00:15:21,895 --> 00:15:24,037
No, that's wrong.

258
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:27,273
No, you're swimming.
You're swimming.

259
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:31,411
And I can't find you
and I have to dive in.

260
00:15:31,451 --> 00:15:34,321
No, I have to dive in
and save you.

261
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:37,090
Come in.

262
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,276
I'm gonna have to beg
a short one, Stace.

263
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,050
It ain't too late.
It doesn't have to be you.

264
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,317
Please don't start again.

265
00:16:12,357 --> 00:16:14,294
I know they messed up with Luke.

266
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:17,297
Sip it.

267
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,860
You could easily
bell that Shola.

268
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,397
She could send her mob in
and bag the lot of them.

269
00:16:24,437 --> 00:16:26,999
That won't get Jody back.

270
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:29,335
Already said
they'd nick the lot of 'em.

271
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,003
Why would they say
jack about her?

272
00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:34,014
You ain't got a clue
what's waiting for you in there.

273
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:39,452
Bell that Shola.

274
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:44,991
I'm just waiting for Tam to give
me a call and then I'm on it.

275
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,863
- Got the money?
- Yep.

276
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:51,858
I'll call you.

277
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:53,926
I think my head'll explode
if you don't.

278
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:55,268
Every five minutes, if you can.

279
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:08,908
I should probably go and get her
back for you, should I?

280
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:11,451
If you wouldn't mind,
yes, please.

281
00:17:17,155 --> 00:17:18,491
Here.

282
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:35,442
Sips, Stace.

283
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,581
I don't want to go.

284
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:53,018
You've done a lot, Melon,
enough maybe.

285
00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:56,489
I can make him hear that. Just
tell me where Nelly needs to be.

286
00:17:56,529 --> 00:17:58,925
He won't get in without me.

287
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:03,003
Maybe not, but he does keep
finding a way, doesn't he?

288
00:18:09,641 --> 00:18:11,544
I'm shitting myself here, Bern.

289
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:19,411
I'll take back to Nelly
whatever you tell me to,

290
00:18:19,451 --> 00:18:21,613
and I'll make it all right
for you both.

291
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:24,183
I keep asking if she'll be here
when I come back.

292
00:18:24,223 --> 00:18:26,218
She won't answer.

293
00:18:26,258 --> 00:18:28,060
You should go.

294
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:31,397
You should.

295
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:37,871
Only way out, it seems like,
is to keep going through.

296
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:41,640
We'll come out the other side,
Mel, we will.

297
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:46,638
Get this done, come back.

298
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:48,614
I'll be here.

299
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:56,455
I will.

300
00:19:02,961 --> 00:19:05,424
Fucking Nelly Rowe!

301
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:09,462
Oh, I hate him! I do.
Hate his guts!

302
00:19:09,502 --> 00:19:11,062
And I will do forever!

303
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:15,408
I hate you, Nelson Rowe!

304
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:17,904
Really?

305
00:19:17,944 --> 00:19:21,139
Those are her favourites?
Anything else she likes?

306
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,375
Minstrels at the cinema

307
00:19:22,415 --> 00:19:26,512
but Caramel Eggs
every chance she gets. Why?

308
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:30,416
Do you pray, matey?
I mean, are you into that?

309
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:32,952
Not really.

310
00:19:32,992 --> 00:19:36,254
Then good thoughts, yeah?
For Jody.

311
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:40,300
Spit and wish and spin around
and whatever.

312
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,461
Yeah?

313
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:44,504
- OK.
- <i>Good lad.</i>

314
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:47,539
See ya.

315
00:19:49,374 --> 00:19:51,443
- You got your car keys?
- Yeah.

316
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:57,542
You all right?

317
00:19:57,582 --> 00:19:59,712
Not exactly, no.

318
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:01,688
I'm near enough.

319
00:20:39,425 --> 00:20:41,226
- This him?
- Yeah.

320
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:49,527
- All right, Ash? You all right?
- Yeah.

321
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:52,430
Nelly, this is Ash.
Ash is the one who got you in.

322
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,433
You all right?

323
00:20:54,473 --> 00:20:56,409
Down here on your left.

324
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:02,073
All right, Nelly, that's me.

325
00:21:02,113 --> 00:21:03,708
- I've done enough.
- What's going on?

326
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:06,012
I should go and you should
let me. I'm done.

327
00:21:06,052 --> 00:21:08,179
- What are you on about?
- I've done all I can.

328
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:10,549
I can't be in there with them.
I can't and I don't want to.

329
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:13,185
Stop fucking about, Melon,
and just wait.

330
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:15,120
- No. I can't do any more.
- Just... Please.

331
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,289
- Sorry. I've got to go.
- No, no.

332
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:19,824
- Melon? Melon!
- It kills me, and I'm sorry.

333
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:21,800
For fuck's sake!

334
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,075
I've seen that a few times.

335
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:32,778
Want to go without him?

336
00:21:36,614 --> 00:21:38,418
Yeah.

337
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:00,198
Ash?

338
00:22:00,238 --> 00:22:02,400
How much?

339
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,103
- Have I got?
- Mm.

340
00:22:05,143 --> 00:22:07,313
- Erm, 12K.
- Whoa, whoa. Come on.

341
00:22:10,582 --> 00:22:12,518
Let's have a look.

342
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:18,390
Nice. Phones?

343
00:22:19,492 --> 00:22:21,428
- My phone?
- Mm.

344
00:22:24,596 --> 00:22:25,692
Cool. OK.

345
00:22:25,732 --> 00:22:28,360
Don't use your camera
and don't record anything.

346
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,361
Right? One call, one number,

347
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:32,738
that's if the money you got
ain't all yours.

348
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:39,370
Table three.

349
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,541
We're running a little bit late,
so be patient, yeah?

350
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:45,811
You can wait just in here, mate,
all right?

351
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:47,446
Yeah.

352
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:48,822
Sweet.

353
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:01,619
You here to stab me, Mel?

354
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:06,425
I'm not you.

355
00:24:06,465 --> 00:24:08,561
That what you came in to prove?

356
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:13,698
Even if I have to stab you
to make that clear, yeah.

357
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:15,674
I'm not what you are.

358
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:19,938
It's wrong.

359
00:24:19,978 --> 00:24:21,914
However much you want it.

360
00:24:28,286 --> 00:24:32,885
Tell everyone you know.
You make it fucking clear.

361
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:35,328
- I'm not you.
- Mm.

362
00:24:36,361 --> 00:24:38,363
I don't think you are.

363
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:46,606
I'm pretty certain...
I was you once, though.

364
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,643
Pretty fucking certain, I think.

365
00:25:08,893 --> 00:25:10,563
Fuck!

366
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:13,859
Hey, Stace. Anything heard?

367
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:16,002
No, nothing.

368
00:25:18,871 --> 00:25:22,635
- What's happened?
- Just calling to say I'm in.

369
00:25:22,675 --> 00:25:25,504
- Is Jody there?
- You in the pub still?

370
00:25:25,544 --> 00:25:28,806
- <i>Yes. Is Jody there?</i>
- I don't know, Claire.

371
00:25:28,846 --> 00:25:31,542
I'm... in a fucking stinkhole.

372
00:25:31,582 --> 00:25:33,044
Has it started?

373
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:37,015
<i>Listen, tell Stace, and you
an' all, because I ain't sure.</i>

374
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:40,285
A woman's voice on the end of
my call might do my day in.

375
00:25:40,325 --> 00:25:43,522
- <i>I'm just saying.</i>
- He needs us to keep it down.

376
00:25:43,562 --> 00:25:44,956
Guys, guys! Ssh!

377
00:25:44,996 --> 00:25:48,894
He can keep the phone open.
So he needs you to shut up.

378
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:51,530
I can go upstairs.

379
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,533
Claire, Claire!
Stay, stay, stay here.

380
00:25:54,573 --> 00:25:55,975
Hang about.

381
00:26:06,451 --> 00:26:10,783
As I've said before,
we all know what we're here for,

382
00:26:10,823 --> 00:26:15,053
and as this seems to be our
number, I'm going to push on.

383
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:19,558
The item is mine to sell.
Never ridden.

384
00:26:19,598 --> 00:26:21,567
<i>I hereby verify that fact.</i>

385
00:26:22,735 --> 00:26:24,469
<i>100% unused.</i>

386
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:30,601
1300cc caramel ash finish and...

387
00:26:30,641 --> 00:26:32,971
<i>ready for immediate delivery.</i>

388
00:26:33,011 --> 00:26:38,811
The item is a one-off, very much
desired, as advertised on TV.

389
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:43,715
All this to start us off
at £2,000.

390
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:45,858
Who'll start me?

391
00:26:47,426 --> 00:26:49,921
2,000, I have.

392
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:51,924
Is there 2,250 in the room?

393
00:26:51,964 --> 00:26:53,859
2,250.

394
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:56,160
Show me 2,500.

395
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,532
2,500 on black.
Looking for 2,750.

396
00:27:00,572 --> 00:27:02,633
I don't actually fucking know
what I'm doing.

397
00:27:02,673 --> 00:27:04,069
<i>When am I meant to get started?</i>

398
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:05,637
Nelly, I don't...

399
00:27:05,677 --> 00:27:07,106
How much does he have?

400
00:27:07,146 --> 00:27:08,907
- 12.
- <i>Do I have three?</i>

401
00:27:08,947 --> 00:27:11,176
He shouldn't start till five
or six, I don't think.

402
00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:13,411
- Tam?
- <i>You shouldn't start till...</i>

403
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:14,847
- No, I heard.
- <i>...five or six.</i>

404
00:27:14,887 --> 00:27:16,615
Is Melon with you, Nelly?

405
00:27:16,655 --> 00:27:20,119
- One sec.
- £5,500.

406
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,986
Let's make monkey jumps
from here on,

407
00:27:22,026 --> 00:27:23,789
rather than take all night.

408
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:28,101
The bid is £5,500 with pink.

409
00:27:31,637 --> 00:27:34,506
6,000 with blue.

410
00:27:36,475 --> 00:27:38,904
6,500 with pink.

411
00:27:38,944 --> 00:27:43,041
- I can't bear this.
- Shouldn't he be getting in?

412
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:45,577
- Tell him!
- We don't see what he sees.

413
00:27:45,617 --> 00:27:47,420
Seven... with pink.

414
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:52,117
The bid stands at £7,000.

415
00:27:52,157 --> 00:27:54,986
Erm, eight, over here.

416
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:56,687
On me. Erm...

417
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:58,698
<i>Eight, guys.</i>

418
00:28:06,737 --> 00:28:08,106
8,500 with pink.

419
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,671
Nine.

420
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:16,207
9,500 with pink.

421
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:18,016
10?

422
00:28:19,251 --> 00:28:21,179
- 10,500.
- Yeah.

423
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:23,088
11 I have with yellow.

424
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:30,456
£11,500 with pink.

425
00:28:30,496 --> 00:28:32,991
<i>The bid stands at 11,500.</i>

426
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:34,967
<i>Going once.</i>

427
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:39,070
12.

428
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:03,261
£12,500, pink.

429
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:08,292
- Jesus!
- The bid stands at £12,500.

430
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:09,936
CC, I'm so sorry.

431
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:13,238
12,500.

432
00:29:14,672 --> 00:29:16,702
<i>Going once.</i>

433
00:29:16,742 --> 00:29:19,571
£12,500, going twice.

434
00:29:19,611 --> 00:29:20,847
13.

435
00:29:22,613 --> 00:29:24,483
13,000.

436
00:29:25,751 --> 00:29:27,245
13,500.

437
00:29:27,285 --> 00:29:29,121
14.

438
00:29:31,723 --> 00:29:34,151
Listen, I'm gonna get Jody
by hook or fucking crook.

439
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:35,888
You're gonna need the cash.

440
00:29:35,928 --> 00:29:37,222
Cross that bridge halfway over.

441
00:29:37,262 --> 00:29:39,165
- 14,500.
- 15.

442
00:29:49,841 --> 00:29:51,069
You've shown your limit as 12.

443
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:53,871
Piss off back where you were
and don't embarrass yourself.

444
00:29:53,911 --> 00:29:56,308
Only cash in the room counts.
Do you have 15,000?

445
00:29:56,348 --> 00:29:59,343
I've got as much as I need.
Piss off back where you were

446
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,612
- and don't embarrass yourself.
- Al, please.

447
00:30:01,652 --> 00:30:02,714
Oi!

448
00:30:02,754 --> 00:30:04,949
- <i>Get off me!</i>
- What the fuck?

449
00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:07,019
You fucking prick.

450
00:30:08,994 --> 00:30:10,555
You must know where they are!

451
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:12,330
They didn't tell me
where they were going.

452
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,643
Find out where they are!

453
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,175
Oh, my God.

454
00:30:30,215 --> 00:30:33,011
Who knows Luke the best?
Any of you?

455
00:30:33,051 --> 00:30:34,612
Well, what for?

456
00:30:34,652 --> 00:30:37,582
Where do his parents live?
Cos that's where he'll be.

457
00:30:37,622 --> 00:30:41,820
I need to talk to him.
Well? What?

458
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,996
- You sure it was him, Gran?
- Yes, I'm fucking sure!

459
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,033
Where?

460
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,607
For fuck's sake!
Fuck's sake, Melon!

461
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,853
- All right, Goz?
- All right, Dave?

462
00:31:17,728 --> 00:31:20,158
Luke, mate? It's Goz.

463
00:31:20,198 --> 00:31:23,160
I'm, er... I'm here with Claire.

464
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,831
"Luke, mate..." Piss off, Goz.

465
00:31:25,871 --> 00:31:29,735
It's Claire, Luke, just me.
Goz is leaving.

466
00:31:29,775 --> 00:31:32,004
He showed me where you were,
but it's just me.

467
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:33,804
No, thanks.

468
00:31:33,844 --> 00:31:38,877
I'm not here for Nelly.
I want nothing to do with him.

469
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:41,812
He's the cause
of the worst days of my life.

470
00:31:41,852 --> 00:31:44,116
- I'm not here for him.
- What, then?

471
00:31:44,156 --> 00:31:47,092
I'd rather not, Luke, through
the door, for everyone to hear.

472
00:32:01,238 --> 00:32:04,909
I can do you a tea,
coffee or cider.

473
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:11,117
Just kidding.
Don't have any tea.

474
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:14,379
You've won.

475
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:16,915
Go on, then.

476
00:32:16,955 --> 00:32:19,950
Nelly thinks he's something
he's not. He always has.

477
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,455
He's got you so wrong,
thinking that...

478
00:32:23,495 --> 00:32:26,824
But you slapped him down, you
got him, well and truly, had him

479
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:28,760
running around
for God knows how long.

480
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,163
He hasn't got an idea
what he's doing with himself.

481
00:32:31,203 --> 00:32:34,965
Headless, someone said,
and that's exactly it.

482
00:32:35,005 --> 00:32:38,102
You've got him headless...

483
00:32:38,142 --> 00:32:42,047
...with no clue what he's doing,
and he got us all to join in.

484
00:32:44,015 --> 00:32:46,477
- You're here to beg.
- Only if you know where she is,

485
00:32:46,517 --> 00:32:49,347
because otherwise
I'd rather not waste my time.

486
00:32:49,387 --> 00:32:51,791
Do you know where she is, Luke?

487
00:32:53,024 --> 00:32:54,694
Beg.

488
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:58,956
Wow! Bended knees
and everything.

489
00:32:58,996 --> 00:33:00,825
Am I fucking wasting my time?

490
00:33:00,865 --> 00:33:02,494
This is probably
a laugh for you.

491
00:33:02,534 --> 00:33:04,129
Mm.

492
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:07,198
Just be honest,
this isn't gonna help, is it?

493
00:33:07,238 --> 00:33:09,301
Should've given it a go
as you're down there.

494
00:33:09,341 --> 00:33:11,402
I don't have time
to fuck around, Luke.

495
00:33:11,442 --> 00:33:14,406
You did that with Nelly, but I
don't have the fucking time.

496
00:33:14,446 --> 00:33:18,275
Now you've finished with Nelly,
please can I have my daughter?

497
00:33:18,315 --> 00:33:20,111
For what? You're not begging.
So, what?

498
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:24,116
What? You tell me what.
Anything! Fucking tell me what.

499
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:26,118
I don't know.

500
00:33:26,158 --> 00:33:31,089
Try money... or sex.

501
00:33:31,129 --> 00:33:33,291
I'm a little bit old for you,
am I not?

502
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:34,592
Fuck's that supposed to mean?

503
00:33:34,632 --> 00:33:38,229
Look, Luke, I don't have money,
not that I could get you now,

504
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:40,165
but there is someone
on their way to Jody.

505
00:33:40,205 --> 00:33:41,398
Can you go, please?

506
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:43,200
- You've pissed me off.
- Yes, sex.

507
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,772
Right here, right now.
Anywhere you want it.

508
00:33:46,812 --> 00:33:49,774
Just fucking get on with it,
can we?

509
00:33:49,814 --> 00:33:51,248
Oh, my God, you're serious!

510
00:33:54,986 --> 00:33:57,081
Anything.

511
00:33:57,121 --> 00:33:59,050
Then I'll say fucking yes.

512
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,827
- Good.
- If you're pissing about...

513
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:08,333
Where do you want me?

514
00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:30,548
- I don't do this.
- Yes.

515
00:34:46,096 --> 00:34:47,825
No, I'm not doing that.

516
00:34:47,865 --> 00:34:49,867
You said anything.

517
00:34:58,942 --> 00:35:02,005
OK. Come on, we need to...

518
00:35:02,045 --> 00:35:03,440
- Yeah, all right.
- I just...

519
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,475
- I need you to hurry up.
- I said all right.

520
00:35:05,515 --> 00:35:07,351
I'm just saying, hang on.

521
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:11,523
OK, good.

522
00:35:14,592 --> 00:35:17,187
- Take these off.
- Yeah.

523
00:35:17,227 --> 00:35:18,563
Just...

524
00:35:19,963 --> 00:35:21,532
- Hang on.
- OK.

525
00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:33,671
I need you to just do
what we're doing here.

526
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:38,015
I need you to fuck me, then tell
me where my daughter is.

527
00:35:39,182 --> 00:35:40,577
What is this?

528
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:42,479
Just fucking shut up and stop!

529
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:45,249
What is it? Am I too chatty?

530
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:47,651
Do you need me to whimper
or be scared of you,

531
00:35:47,691 --> 00:35:50,454
- stick my finger up your arse?
- Let go of me!

532
00:35:50,494 --> 00:35:52,289
There's some irony here, Luke.

533
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:55,158
Something to do with how long
you've been fucking with me

534
00:35:55,198 --> 00:35:57,501
and then now you can't
actually fuck me.

535
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:06,236
Cos you actually can't, can you?

536
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:09,374
That's why you're still
so floppy in my hand,

537
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:12,276
cos there's something
a little fucking wrong with you.

538
00:36:12,316 --> 00:36:15,345
Just fucking get off me
or I'll fucking kill you!

539
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:17,481
Breathe deep, Luke,
breathe deep.

540
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:20,592
Cos we're gonna do this, OK?

541
00:36:21,992 --> 00:36:23,928
Cos we can.

542
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:28,191
We can, Luke.

543
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:32,204
I just need you to gird yourself
and stop pissing around.

544
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:41,380
Or you could just tell me
where she is.

545
00:36:53,457 --> 00:36:56,320
- Oh, fuck!
- He's gone.

546
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,689
Why the fuck...
Why the fuck has he?

547
00:36:58,729 --> 00:37:01,492
Melon, where have they gone?
Why would he fucking shut it up?

548
00:37:01,532 --> 00:37:04,428
<i>You what, you what?
You what? You what? You what?</i>

549
00:37:04,468 --> 00:37:06,263
Yes?

550
00:37:06,303 --> 00:37:08,432
I'm texting you
where she is now.

551
00:37:08,472 --> 00:37:10,167
How... How have you... What?

552
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:12,303
Where she might be.
Where Luke thinks she is.

553
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:13,771
<i>Where he went
to collect the money.</i>

554
00:37:13,811 --> 00:37:16,506
Luke?
How have you managed that?

555
00:37:16,546 --> 00:37:19,050
What does it matter?
I'm sending it now.

556
00:37:21,552 --> 00:37:22,780
Give me your keys.

557
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,149
<i>Your keys, Melon.
Tell me where you're parked.</i>

558
00:37:25,189 --> 00:37:27,718
- Er, just over there.
- OK.

559
00:37:27,758 --> 00:37:31,189
Sure he's not lying? If this is
some bullshit from him...

560
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:33,224
Well, then,
you bloody go and find out.

561
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:34,392
Give me that.

562
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:36,294
- Where are you going?
- Give me the knife.

563
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:39,062
You get yourself back home
to Bernie. Will you do that?

564
00:37:39,102 --> 00:37:41,365
- Get yourself all the way home.
- Where are you going?

565
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:43,342
Go, go!

566
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:45,576
Nelly!

567
00:38:23,713 --> 00:38:25,683
Come on!

568
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,675
Jody!

569
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:20,371
Jody!

570
00:39:48,932 --> 00:39:50,434
Jody.

571
00:39:53,371 --> 00:39:55,666
It's me. It's...

572
00:39:55,706 --> 00:39:58,142
It's... It's...
It's Nelly. I'm...

573
00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:05,642
Oh, look, I'm sorry.

574
00:40:05,682 --> 00:40:08,445
I'm sorry. I won't...
I'm not here to hurt you.

575
00:40:08,485 --> 00:40:11,649
I won't hurt you.
I won't even touch you, I swear.

576
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:14,318
I swear I won't.

577
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:16,187
Look...

578
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:18,163
Please, look. I...

579
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:28,405
I got you these. Dylan said
they were your fave, so I...

580
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:34,579
I know you don't know me.

581
00:40:54,398 --> 00:40:57,727
I've been looking for you.

582
00:40:57,767 --> 00:41:01,773
I have. I know you don't know
me, but I've been looking...

583
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:05,310
<i>...all over.</i>

584
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:15,546
I've been looking...
since the first minute

585
00:41:15,586 --> 00:41:18,189
I found out what had happened.

586
00:41:21,925 --> 00:41:23,861
<i>And I found you.</i>

587
00:41:26,564 --> 00:41:28,500
I did.

588
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,340
I found you.

589
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:41,412
Oh, God!

590
00:41:56,927 --> 00:41:59,731
Until the Devil turns to dust...

591
00:42:06,037 --> 00:42:08,698
That's how much my mum
would say she loved me

592
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:10,667
and for how long she would.

593
00:42:10,707 --> 00:42:13,345
"Until the Devil
turns to dust."

594
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:20,017
It's how long
I'm gonna keep going...

595
00:42:22,753 --> 00:42:24,756
...because I found you.

596
00:42:26,923 --> 00:42:28,860
I did. <i>I</i> did.

597
00:42:35,332 --> 00:42:37,269
I found you...

598
00:42:38,968 --> 00:42:41,072
...and that means I can find her.

599
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:45,956
I heard you rearrested Luke.

600
00:44:45,996 --> 00:44:48,792
We have.

601
00:44:48,832 --> 00:44:52,762
He was at it with, what's his
name, nonce from the auction.

602
00:44:52,802 --> 00:44:54,832
All connected up,
so Claire reckons.

603
00:44:54,872 --> 00:44:57,809
- I can't discuss the details.
- "Ongoing investi-blah-blah."

604
00:44:59,577 --> 00:45:00,912
Here.

605
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,116
You ready?

606
00:45:06,784 --> 00:45:08,720
As I'll ever be, Shola.

607
00:45:14,925 --> 00:45:16,921
They've got me
with a foster family.

608
00:45:16,961 --> 00:45:19,490
They're nice to you?
I mean, you like 'em?

609
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,992
Yeah, they're all right.

610
00:45:22,032 --> 00:45:25,195
When Shola said that you
wanted to meet up, I was I like,

611
00:45:25,235 --> 00:45:27,731
"What, really?"

612
00:45:27,771 --> 00:45:30,934
I wanted to thank you.
You saved my life.

613
00:45:30,974 --> 00:45:34,070
Yeah, you don't have to do that.

614
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:38,148
I mean, it's accepted and that,
and... but you don't have to.

615
00:45:40,851 --> 00:45:42,787
Well, there you go, then.

616
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:51,088
So, do you live round here?

617
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:53,524
I do, yeah.

618
00:45:53,564 --> 00:45:56,292
I'm kind of different places
around the Towers.

619
00:45:56,332 --> 00:45:58,595
Always have been.

620
00:45:58,635 --> 00:45:59,970
Is it nice?

621
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,040
Is it nice?

622
00:46:06,175 --> 00:46:07,878
It's, erm...

623
00:46:08,979 --> 00:46:10,541
I'm not that fussy, darling,

624
00:46:10,581 --> 00:46:14,117
so I'm probably
the wrong person to ask.

625
00:46:18,222 --> 00:46:20,959
Look, you know when
you were where you were...

626
00:46:22,092 --> 00:46:23,720
...you see other girls there?

627
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,789
- Nelly, don't.
- Girls that looked like you?

628
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:28,291
- They were others, yeah.
- Nelly!

629
00:46:28,331 --> 00:46:30,961
- I don't know who.
- There were others?

630
00:46:31,001 --> 00:46:32,937
Let's get going, Grace.

631
00:46:39,008 --> 00:46:40,945
- Here, come here.
- No.

632
00:46:42,313 --> 00:46:44,249
Oh. OK.

633
00:46:45,715 --> 00:46:47,518
Pleased to meet you.

634
00:47:02,398 --> 00:47:04,595
Don't believe you.
I don't believe a word.

635
00:47:04,635 --> 00:47:06,896
- Why not?
- It don't make any sense.

636
00:47:06,936 --> 00:47:10,834
- Every single one?
- All of them, every single one.

637
00:47:10,874 --> 00:47:13,336
Well, how do they know that?
That's what I'm asking.

638
00:47:13,376 --> 00:47:15,773
I don't know <i>how</i> they know,
but they do!

639
00:47:15,813 --> 00:47:17,341
Who told you?
Who told you that?

640
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:19,843
Don't believe
everything you hear.

641
00:47:19,883 --> 00:47:21,819
How did that go?

642
00:47:23,153 --> 00:47:24,255
Huh.

643
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:29,059
You're all right, though, babes?

644
00:47:31,861 --> 00:47:34,091
You know me all right, Stace.

645
00:47:34,131 --> 00:47:36,059
Daiz, tell 'em.

646
00:47:36,099 --> 00:47:37,995
All polar bears are left-handed.

647
00:47:38,035 --> 00:47:39,696
- Thank you!
- Bollocks.

648
00:47:39,736 --> 00:47:42,099
- But why? Why are they?
- Yeah, did he say that, Goz?

649
00:47:42,139 --> 00:47:43,901
What's wrong
with their right hands?

650
00:47:43,941 --> 00:47:46,970
What is wrong with them?

651
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:49,380
All of them left...
male, female...

652
00:47:54,017 --> 00:47:57,213
And all badgers
are short-sighted.

653
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:03,620
<i>All policemen are cunts.</i>

654
00:48:06,729 --> 00:48:08,791
<i>All hedgehogs have a lisp.</i>

655
00:48:10,808 --> 00:48:15,808

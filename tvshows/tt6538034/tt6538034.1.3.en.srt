I buried it.

And then, out of the blue,
she just came out of nowhere.

two of the courses.

26

I tried not to look at her the way I wanted to.

Once, maybe. I swear to God, no more.

And then... Then she's just
come out of nowhere.

You know, on a hike up a hill, of all places.

She was 15 by then.

31
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:32,712
And she's just stood in front of me

32
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,580
and saying she knows what she wants.

33
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:38,852
I told her till I was blue in
the face that it was wrong.

34

You know, it was just a crush
at best and nothing...

nothing good would come of it.

36
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,859
And I swear, I kept telling her and I told her

37
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:48,218
and I told her, I swear.

38
00:02:48,242 --> 00:02:50,755
I swear to God, Nelly, I told her.

The club on the Streatham High Road,

161
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,042
I would have told you that's where I took Claire.

162
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:45,878
- Can you just go, please?
- So tell me where Jody is.

163
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:47,914
I don't know. I swear, I don't know.

164
00:09:47,938 --> 00:09:51,284
If I fucking stabbed her in
the knee, would you know then?

165
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:52,579
- Let go of me.
- Tell me where she is!

getting me to go on about Claire and Jody.

169
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:03,295
- Don't tell me this wasn't you!
- It wasn't me, Nelly.

170
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:05,906
That's how you did it. Nights like that.

171

and out the other side with Stacey's dad.

173
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:13,272
- I've never met Stacey's dad.
- Don't you try that with me.

174
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:15,142
You were sat across from her.

175

I remember he came from Greece
but we weren't introduced.

177
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,150
I swear to God it wasn't me. Ask Stace!

178
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:25,986
- I'll cut her fucking kneecap!
- Nelly, please!

179
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,088
- Why?
- Please, Nelly. It wasn't me.

180
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:29,890
- Then fucking who?
- It wasn't me!

181
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:31,824
Fucking who if it wasn't you?

182
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,861
You fit! It has to be you! It has to!

183
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,430
Cos if it's not you, then...

184
00:10:37,454 --> 00:10:39,289

185
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:51,835
Fuck.

186
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:07,060
How am I on eight when she's on 13?

187
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,994
- What's it matter?
- When did that happen?

188
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:10,930
- It says it there.
- I'm better than you

189
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:13,934

- They having a go again, babes?

Thanks for printing all them fliers, Linda.

200
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:42,830
It's not for him, Stace.
It's for you, yeah?

- Don't.

Can you ask him, next time you speak to him?

214

- He won't remember.
- Can you ask him anyway?

215

- Please?
- Same again, please, Stace.

- I'm all right.
- Fuck me.

219
00:13:01,131 --> 00:13:03,944
No, thanks, I'm already taken.

00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:09,516
No, one minute. That's what I
mean. That bollocks right there.

222
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,319
- I'll get these drinks.
- Are you all right, babes?

223
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:14,054
He's trying to be funny, Stacey.

224
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:16,208
- I'll bring the drinks.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

225

Trying to get you to make sense
of that shit for me.

- No, Stace, we should go.
- Wait until he's gone!

248
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:18,046
Explain that to me, Gav. What the fuck?

249
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,652
All the way out, Goz.

250

- Luke. Let's go.

- Ah, look, maybe...

Maybe you should talk to Zita.

- Don't say I said anything.

315
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:36,244
I owe 'em whatever they're having.

316
00:18:36,268 --> 00:18:38,567
You ain't backing off me at all, are you, Marky?

317
00:18:38,591 --> 00:18:40,494
You've got Mum's car. I told you...

318
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:44,577
She gave it to me, Marky! Ain't
like I fucking robbed it. Tam.

319
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,698
On your way home tonight,
you leave back Mum's car

320
00:18:46,722 --> 00:18:48,251
where you got it from, simple.

321
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:50,841
Ain't gonna do that, Marky.
I can't do that.

322
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:54,977
Well, then, no, bitch.
I ain't backing off at all.

323
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:57,055
OK.

324
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,757
You're not going? We can't.

325
00:18:58,781 --> 00:19:00,927
- Why? Stace said to come.
- Bern, we can't go.

326
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:04,255
- Everybody's going. We should.
- Doesn't matter. We can't go.

327
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,382
- I am.
- Bernie?

328
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:08,067
We're on the second floor.
Don't be stupid.

329
00:19:08,091 --> 00:19:09,836
Up the bloody chimney, I don't care.

330
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,138
- We haven't got a chimney.
- (LAUGHS) I'm not joking.

331
00:19:13,162 --> 00:19:16,108
Stace invited us, stood there
in front of us, invited us.

332
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:18,205
- She's invited us.
- Bernie, you're not listening.

333
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:20,012
We had a drink in the pub, that's it.

334
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:22,215
And it wasn't as bad as we thought it'd be

335
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,956
because Nelly was looking after us.

336
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,484
But nothing's changed.

337
00:19:25,508 --> 00:19:28,960
It's gonna be exactly the same
here as it is everywhere else.

338
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:33,446
You know, and that Luke...
that's just the start of it.

339
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,962
You said that we were staying!
I like it here!

340
00:19:35,986 --> 00:19:39,189
- So do I!
- You said we could stay.

341
00:19:45,694 --> 00:19:47,830
It's me they take it out on.

342
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:50,968
Every time.

343
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:53,503
You're in my way.

Are you OK?

351
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:08,078
I can't do this.

352
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:53,164
Would you mind taking one of these, please?

353
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,659
The number should be there. All right?

354
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,070
Yeah, thank you.

355
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:01,280
A missing girl. Jody.

356
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:04,623
Here. Have one of these.
See what it can jog.

357
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:06,344
- Give me a minute.
- Yeah.

358
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:09,430
Bernie! Up with me, please.

359
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:11,183
You said get the ones they let go.

360
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:13,952
I did, and now we're heading on
and I'm saying keep up.

361
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:17,113
Mind if I say hello? Stace?

362
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,120
I do, yeah. Bugger off.

363
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:29,291
- You know many of these people?
- No.

364
00:22:32,461 --> 00:22:35,931
- I don't even know what to say.
- I'm all right. I am.

365
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:39,577
Doing the best I can, most days.

366
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:41,078
But...

367
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:43,520
Almost numb, Stace.

368
00:22:44,105 --> 00:22:46,484
- Did you get my card?
- Yeah. You didn't have to.

369
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:47,752
- No.
- And for being out here,

370
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:50,689
all these you've brought,
what you're doing for Jody...

371
00:22:50,713 --> 00:22:52,624
- It means a lot.
- It's the least we can do.

372
00:22:52,648 --> 00:22:54,827
Well, when we catch him,

373
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:57,560
drinks at mine when we set light to the fucker.

374
00:22:58,053 --> 00:23:00,421
Guys? There's a load
of people right up there.

375
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,115
- I'm Bernie.
- Hi.

376
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:04,036
Hi. It's Claire, innit?

377
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,771
Thanks for coming. Are you from The Palm?

378
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:08,313
Are you really not going up there?

379
00:23:08,337 --> 00:23:11,210
No. Stace argued me out.

380
00:23:11,234 --> 00:23:14,400
Said she'd get more done with
them floppy students than me.

381
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:17,849
- Hey, Nelly.
- Hey, Frankie.

382
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:19,241
Thanks, Tam.

383
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,813
You get hold of Zita?

384
00:23:24,546 --> 00:23:26,181
Is she ducking me, Tam?

385
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:30,112
- Feels like she is.
- Why would she?

386
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:33,389
I erm...

387
00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:41,096
I got, like, erm...

388
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:44,801
Like constant butterflies.

389
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:52,108
I can't get hold of myself.

390
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:57,560
I can't fucking name it, Tam.

391
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,350
- Over Zita?
- No. About...

392
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,888
Stace reckons it's what kids...

393
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:11,094
It's what kids do to you.

394
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:16,275
Stace ain't got none, so... (CHUCKLES)

395
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:21,556
- Well, I'm trying to...
- It's all right, don't worry.

396
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,186
And kids do do that to you.

397
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,445
You got kids, Tam?

398
00:24:31,313 --> 00:24:34,158
Look, I don't want to put it about, he wouldn't,

399
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:36,560
but... a son.

400
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:41,633
And he gives you butterflies?

401
00:24:41,657 --> 00:24:44,627
If I say, "Christ, yes,"
can we just leave it at that?

402
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:53,368
You see Zeet, tell her to hail me, yeah?

403
00:24:55,938 --> 00:24:57,507
Yeah.

404
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:25,001

406
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:31,914
I'll clean this for you.
You don't have to.

407
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:34,800
I'm sorry about this.

408
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,446
I'd rather not be involved.

409
00:25:50,126 --> 00:25:52,195
I'll have that back, thank you.

410
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,566
- You all right, Melon?
- (BABY CRYING)

411
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,061

it ain't his business, right?

432
00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:13,440
I told him, it ain't up to him.

433
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,731
- Have a drink, Teens.
- I came to set Marky straight.

434
00:28:18,755 --> 00:28:22,540
- I've had enough by myself.
- Have one. One.

435
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,934
Went out of myself the other day, Teens.

436
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,960
Don't know what I'm doing.

437
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,918
- Well, when have you ever?
- I went after Melon, Teens.

438
00:28:37,942 --> 00:28:40,178
I fucking went after him like...

439
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:46,483
Like I don't know what.

440
00:28:52,436 --> 00:28:54,505
It's cos she's haunting me.

441
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:57,821
- Who is?
- Jody is.

442
00:28:59,262 --> 00:29:02,209
- She's pulling at me.
- What do you mean?

443
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:03,643
She's waking me up.

444
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,778
She's following me all over the place.

445

She's running after me.

is the best I can say. She's...

You're scaring me a little bit here, Nell.

448

Hey, ain't trying to scare you.

449
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,154
Sit down. Go on, sit down. (PATS STOOL)

You are allowed to be fucking
freaked out by this, you know.

453
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:55,352
You are allowed.

454
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:10,794
Thank you very much, Mr McGory.

455
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,020
Why would you ask me about her?

456
00:30:21,044 --> 00:30:24,223
What's the matter with you?
We were having a nice minute.

457
00:30:24,247 --> 00:30:25,792
I'm asking about Marky.

458
00:30:25,816 --> 00:30:27,728
Yeah, and what he might have done to Zita.

459
00:30:27,752 --> 00:30:29,496
So? Scared her off, he might have done.

460
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,298
- Why would I give a shit?
- Something has scared her off.

461
00:30:32,322 --> 00:30:36,202
First round's on me. Only
singles come the spirits, mind.

Ah, all right? How was it?

463
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:42,403
Yeah, it was all right. Yeah.

464
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:47,913
Oh, Christ alive. Where'd you come from?

465
00:30:47,937 --> 00:30:50,283
- We brought Claire with us.
- Yeah, you did.

466
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,352
I was just going.

467
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:56,320

Abracadabra, this is Claire.

469
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:02,229
- Sorry.
- Hello. We met, years back.

- Was it Tam?

573

Yeah? Why's that?

596

You don't know him.

597
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:33,178
You think you do, but you don't.

598
00:39:33,202 --> 00:39:35,171
Why'd he say I should talk to you?

599
00:39:38,134 --> 00:39:40,445
Cos maybe that's what he's around you to do.

600
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:43,916
(LAUGHS) What's that mean?

601
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,280
They come at you like that.
Hunt in packs.

602
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,720
Might be Melon's the one sent to keep you sweet.

603
00:39:53,949 --> 00:39:57,195
While the next one comes in and reaches around.

604
00:39:57,219 --> 00:39:58,989
The next what?

605
00:40:00,957 --> 00:40:02,902
There ain't a pack around Melon.

606
00:40:02,926 --> 00:40:05,971
It's just Bernie for him
and the same way back from her.

607
00:40:05,995 --> 00:40:07,730
(CHUCKLES)

608
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:15,320
Ask me, he lets Bernie linger.

609
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:17,750
Cos, in the right light, she don't look like

610
00:40:17,774 --> 00:40:20,144
she's quite aged out yet.

611

00:41:00,015 --> 00:41:01,350
OK.

617
00:41:04,187 --> 00:41:06,599
OK? OK, like what?
Like you don't believe me?

618
00:41:06,623 --> 00:41:09,288

- I can take you to my ex now.

00:42:07,635 --> 00:42:10,338
Oh, Stace wanted a drink, a catch up.

629
00:42:11,788 --> 00:42:14,091
She makes me laugh. I fancied that.

630
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,393
Just Stace?

631
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,166
You look like you've been out.

632
00:42:24,901 --> 00:42:28,160
Drove around to clear my head.

633
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:30,941
You all right?

634
00:42:32,308 --> 00:42:34,853
Wanted to see what it was
being in here did for you,

635
00:42:34,877 --> 00:42:37,114
see if it'd do the same for me.

636
00:42:38,147 --> 00:42:39,949
(PHONE RINGING)

637
00:42:55,631 --> 00:42:58,800
It won't help... me being there.

638
00:42:59,636 --> 00:43:02,782
I'll poop myself...
or glass him, I dunno.

639
00:43:02,806 --> 00:43:04,116
- All right?
- All right?

640
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,844
Hey. Hey, Zita!

641
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:09,947
Hey, hey, hey.

642
00:43:13,015 --> 00:43:15,160
I can't be anywhere near him.

643
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,880
- Nelly, I'm sorry, I just...
- It's all right.

644
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:24,661
Tell me where I'm going.

645
00:43:26,362 --> 00:43:28,520
And he's "Richard".

646
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:32,101
- Not Ricky, Richie, Rich or...
- Dick?

647
00:43:35,971 --> 00:43:37,916
He's Richard.

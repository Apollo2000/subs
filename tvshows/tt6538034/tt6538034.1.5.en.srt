174
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,400
"Not an insignificant injury."

175
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,390
Couldn't say whether
it was life-threatening,

176
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,240
one way or another.

177
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,410
- Hey.
- Last I saw you...

178
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,340
The day before...

179
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,450
Whenever it was,
you were going off with Bernie.

180
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,580
It looked serious.
Spun you around quick enough.

181
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,580
Listen, yeah. Can we just stop a sec?

182
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,350
(SIGHS)

183
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,320
- Stop what?
- Can we hold up?

184
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,790
(BOTH START TO SPEAK)

185
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,990
Ask me, yeah. You can.

186
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,320
But if you do, I ain't gonna lie.

187
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,500
I'm gonna tell you where I've
taken myself and what I'm on.

188
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,600
Just saying, though...

189
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,280
I don't know how to
make it easy for you to hear.

190
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,920
If you ask me, I'm gonna tell you.

191
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,820
But I ain't gonna coat it and I
ain't gonna make it sweet, so...

192
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,220
...so there you go.

193
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,450
Where have you been, Nelly?

194
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,960
GOZ: Just guess. I don't
want to straight tell you.

195
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,330
LUKE: This bong's... mashed.

196
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,490
You ain't gonna guess,
cos it's brilliant.

197
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,300
The longest word you can come up with

198
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,470
using only the letters of one
row of a typewriter keyboard.

199
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,940
I need, like, a drill or some shit.

200
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,310
The longest word.

201
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,510
Nightmare. Get Gav's, will you?

202
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,380
It's in his desk drawer, I think.

203
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,700
(SQUEAKS)

204
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
You gonna make me beg, Goz? The word?

205
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,730
Er... It's "typewriter".

206
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,430
(SCOFFS) Bollocks.

207
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,600
No, no word of a lie.
The longest word, er...

208
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,400
one row of a typewriter is "typewriter".

209
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,340
- (CLICKS FINGERS)
- That is brilliant.

210
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,870
That's why I love you, Goz.
That's why I like you.

211
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,350
(CHUCKLES)

212
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,840
The police don't even know where she is.

213
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,120
Not enough to say
that's totally who has her.

214
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,790
But you think that's where she is?

215
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,120
It's where I'm looking.

216
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,900
All on the say-so of this... Zita?

217
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,900
Yes, who knows from personal
what they'll be up to

218
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,570
if they ain't already done with... if...

219
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,140
I'm trying to mind myself with you.

220
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,480
I know.

221
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,510
Saying she's already dead.

222
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,080
She ain't. I bet my life she ain't.

223
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,510
Based on what?

224
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,350
- She's dead to Barry, to BJ.
- I don't care.

225
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,780
To the police if you push them.
She's dead to all of them.

226
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,350
Well, she's not to me
and fuck 'em all for giving up.

227
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,730
They're gonna have to show me.

228
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,690
Is she dead, Nelly?

229
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,990
She is not dead.

230
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,430
They've got hold of her
somewhere and they are...

231
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,410
I mean, the chances are...

232
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,410
What they've got her for is to
rent her out amongst them all.

233
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,780
But that's what this Richard
can do for us.

234
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,750
Right, anybody's offering
Jody up like that, he hears.

235
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,150
You don't know that, though.

236
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,050
From what Melon's made of him
and what Zita's said, it's true.

237
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,850
Listen, Richard hears.

238
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:43,020
Even if it's a whisper from
100 miles away, he bloody hears.

239
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,490
Shola says that what you think
you're doing to help

240
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,630
could really end up hurting Jody.

241
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,930
That... you concocted all this,
what you're doing,

242
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,770
just to give yourself a part to play.

243
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,000
Cos without it
you haven't got a connection.

244
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,170
You can't miss her like we do. I mean...

245
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,150
You can't, can you? You don't
know her. You've barely met.

246
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,780
You don't actually know

247
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,920
when your daughter's birthday is, do you?

248
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,870
I think Shola was asking me
to ask you to stop... Nelly.

249
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,140
Then fucking ask me and I will.

250
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,320
Ask me.

251
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,080
You know what?

252
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,840
Shola can kiss my black arse,

253
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,360
and so can any other brat tells
me I ain't got the right...

254
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,960
...to give a shit about
my own flesh and blood.

255
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,120
What am I meant to do, sit in the corner

256
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,630
and not do every last thing
I can for Jody?

257
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,120
I find her and I get her back to you,

258
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,360
who gives a fuck when her
birthday is, or if I know?

259
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
And I ain't stopping shit.

260
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,970
The filth can't go where I'm going.

261
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,500
They can't get to this Richard
like I've got to him.

262
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,840
They can't.

263
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,960
And you...

264
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,800
You're right.

265
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,790
I can't miss her like you
and that Barry can.

266
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,920
But so what?

267
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,230
It still breaks me when I see
claret all over her top.

268
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,730
Yes, I've been shit as...
shit as her dad,

269
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,530
but that don't mean it can't dig me out

270
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,610
when I see what's happening to my kid.

271
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,720
I'm out here chasing the hare,
I know I am.

272
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,160
But so what? So fucking what?

273
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,160
Sometimes the hound catches up.

274
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,700
Sometimes it does.

275
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,800
So, there you go.

276
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Stace has got a top I could do with.

277
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,680
I smell a bit carnal.
You know what I mean? (CHUCKLES)

278
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,680
Don't fret, Claire, make it weird.

279
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,420
Told you, I love doing anything
like that with you.

280
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,280
I will do it any time you let me.

281
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,020
It doesn't even have to be
about anything.

282
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,080
(CHUCKLES)

283
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
You stagger me, Nelson Rowe.

284
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,000
Do I?

285
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,720
Yes.

286
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960

290

What's up?

291
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,130
I don't know what to do, Gav.

292

About what?

293
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,470
I weren't looking for it.
I just found it.

294
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,020
You've done my head in and...

295
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,110
- I don't know what to do.
- About what?

296
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,640
What are you on about?

297
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,490
This, mate.

298
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,180
Bloody this.

299
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,190
How have you got this
in your desk drawer?

300
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,160
- You were in my room?
- Yeah, Luke's bong was...

301
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,370
What were you doing in my room?

302
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,070
It ain't about who's in your room.

303
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,410
It ain't about that. I need you to...

304
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,700
to make sense of this for me, cos...

305
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,840
- ...I've got to tell Nelly.
- Tell him what?

306
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,210
- I've got to.
- Why?

307
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,780
When he puts two and two together...

308
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,380
- No, no, no, no, no.
- You know he's gonna...

309
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,290
He's gonna come roaring after
you, mate, so tell me something.

310
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,120
Tell me how to stop him.

311
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,090
No. Right, you don't know, all right?

312
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,220
- Put some distance, mate. Run.
- No.

313
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,390
- Look, I don't want this on me.
- No.

314
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,130
- I'm scared what he might do.
- Fuck!

315
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,430
I don't want it.

316
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,830
- Oh, fuck! No!
- I can't keep it from him.

All right, down, down.

323
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,520
Still looking after him for me, Nelly?

324
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,440
- I said I would.
- But taking him out again?

325
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,500
Last two nights. Can I not
have him in with me tonight?

326
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,720
He's just being a mate, Bernie.

That's all I'm asking.
That's all we're doing tonight.

being a mate.

on the side I didn't finish.

Can you put it in the fridge for
us, please, when it's cooled?

331

way I can see me getting in.

00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,480
He spent hours, bloody ages,

685
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,610
printing off fucking posters
and... and leaflets for you.

686
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,020
You. Even though you've been
nothing but a shit to him

687
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,850
- and all of us since forever.
- Where's his fucking computer?

688
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:34,650
That's Gavin. That's him. Ask Stace.

689
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,690
He's not up in the night
chatting up some kid

690
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:39,260
about her granny's
bloody saltfish dumplings.

691
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,560
It's ludicrous!

692
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,760
- If you knew him, you'd know.
- I just want his computer!

693
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,700
Go and fucking ask him for it
cos I don't know where it is!

694
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,000
TAM: Where's he got her, hm?

695
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,300
I mean, if Gavin was involved,
then where's he got her hidden?

696
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,840
He, erm...

697
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:55,040
YOUTH: Go on. Where?

698
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,810
More than likely he sold her on.

699
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:57,880
(SCOFFS)

700
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,950
- Can we just go?
- Jesus! Don't laugh at me!

701
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,580
(OTHERS FALL SILENT)

702
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:05,450
Fucking, whatever you do,
don't laugh at me!

703
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,990
STACE: Listen to me now, Nells.

704
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,660
You're gonna have to go and sit down.

705
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,560
- Have a timeout. Two secs.
- All right.

706
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,830
- Yeah, all right.
- TAM: Come on, Nelly. Come on.

707
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,300
Two secs.

708
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:29,540
Erm... I'm sorry that I won't
get to say goodbye to Gavin.

709
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,910
It's OK.

710
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,610
LUKE: You don't have to say sorry.

711
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,480
Yeah, but I am sorry, though.

712
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,890
- YOUTH: Have you got a lighter?
- YOUTH: Yeah, mate.

713
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,760
- Whoa. Er...
- It's all right.

714
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,730
It's all right, man. Back up.

715
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,060
I'm an idiot. I'm a dick.

716
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,040
And I'm sorry.

717
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,540
Please.

718
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,020
Go and sit yourself down.

719
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,950
Now.

720
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,730
What is this?

721
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:26,770
Goz, go next door. Slide the doors shut.

722
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,700
- Lock us in.
- Eh?

723
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,780
Lock us in.

724
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,840
Wha... Nells...

725
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,750
Tell Stace not to worry.
Say we're all right.

726
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,880
We're all right, Stace.

727
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,850
Goz, door, now, please.

728
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,720
Who's in stays in.

729
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,420
(DOOR LOCKS)

730
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,160
- (MUTTERS) Saltfish dumplings.
- Yeah.

731
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,140
Saltfish dumplings.

732
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:05,500

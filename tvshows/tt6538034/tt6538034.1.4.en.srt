00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,528
Have you been selling fucking drugs, Barry?

322
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:43,530
I ran it by Daniel, he said, "Go."

323
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:45,964
The drugs were coming in and out anyway.

324
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:48,435
Either way, it didn't work out,

325
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:51,640
and the long and short of it is, I fucked up...

326
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,731
...and now I owe him close to 100 grand.

327
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:02,448
Has he got Jody until you come up with that?

328
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:04,984
- No, he has not.
- How do you fucking know?

329
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:08,253
He'd have let <i>you</i> know.
He would have bled me using you.

330
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:10,756
- How're you gonna pay him back?
- I've got most of it,

331
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,472
and he's giving me time to get the rest.

332
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:15,019
- Claire!
- Dad.

335
00:22:22,726 --> 00:22:25,605

- What have you done with it?

336
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:27,206
- Get it back!
- I can get it back!

337
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,675
Get it fucking back!

338
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:30,143
We can get whatever we need back!

339
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:32,912
She's dead, Claire! She's dead! J... J...

340
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,580
- All right, BJ.
- Chances are...

341
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:38,150
What's most likely is... I don't
want that to be the case.

342
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:40,653

the police think that.

343
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:44,122
- Shut up. Shut up.
- Dad did what he did...

344
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:45,859
We needed time! He did it for us!

345
00:22:45,883 --> 00:22:47,560
Yeah, enough, BJ. Ssh!

346
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:49,728
Just fucking stop it now, all right?

347
00:22:49,752 --> 00:22:51,598
You were banking on her being dead?

348
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:52,681
No, I was not.

349
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,094
No-one coming after this reward?

350
00:22:54,118 --> 00:22:56,360
That is not what I did.

351
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:59,230
Yes, it was.

352
00:23:02,231 --> 00:23:03,967
Fuck.

353
00:23:06,236 --> 00:23:07,946
Don't, Claire.

354
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,682
Where will you go?

355
00:23:09,706 --> 00:23:11,041
Hm?

356
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,720
Tell me where you're going.

357
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:15,211
Please!

358
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:25,732
I just need him to look out
while I see what's what.

359
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:28,067
And I'm saying I can do that, and want to.

360
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:29,256
People ain't gonna think twice

361
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,070
like they would if you had
Goz out there with you.

362
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:35,274
Thing is, big 'un, I'm good, you know I'm good...

363
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:37,609
job I did finding Gerry, it's clear how good...

364
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:40,604
but... Daiz will be better.

365
00:23:41,805 --> 00:23:44,650
You will, though. Cos of your...

Hers is better, big 'un.

with you. You all right?

371

I'll let you know.

You don't have to baby-sit me

373
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:08,196
if you wanna go back to your mates.

374
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,110
- What's happened, Claire?
- I told you, I don't wanna say.

375
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:15,306
- Won't make a difference.
- Difference to what?

376
00:24:17,807 --> 00:24:21,044
Sorry for the go I had at you about Streatham.

377
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:23,547
I went up there.

378
00:24:25,348 --> 00:24:27,126
The roads you said, I started there.

379
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,128
- For what?
- For what?

380
00:24:29,152 --> 00:24:31,250
If that's where Jody is,
she's gonna need finding.

381
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:33,302
I've seen how the pigs do it and no thank you.

382
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:34,669
They said it had to be done carefully.

383
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:38,003
I was careful. Snuck around
on tiptoes near enough.

384
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:40,663
I was very, very careful.

385
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:44,276
And I'm heading back up there.

386
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,732
Daisy was on about going with me.

387
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:47,347
What are you going back for?

388
00:24:47,371 --> 00:24:48,880
There...

389
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,384
There's a house someone pointed me at

390
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:54,020
and it's got, like, blacked-out windows,

391
00:24:54,044 --> 00:24:56,688
and, I don't know, it just set me tingling and...

392
00:24:56,712 --> 00:24:58,757
- Think you've found the house?
- ...a look-out.

393
00:24:58,781 --> 00:25:00,225
I don't think I've found the house.

394
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:03,354
I'm not saying that.
Fuck knows. I just...

395
00:25:04,354 --> 00:25:06,360
I just wanna have a look.

396
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:09,702
- I'll come, be your lookout.
- Shut up.

397
00:25:09,726 --> 00:25:12,237
You think you should be doing
more for her than I'm doing?

398
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,740
No. That is not what I'm saying.

399
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:16,000
- I wasn't...
- Enough of that.

400
00:25:17,334 --> 00:25:19,078
- Tell me...
- You're gonna take her.

401
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:20,880
So what's the difference?

402
00:25:22,005 --> 00:25:24,040
Please tell me what's happened.

403
00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:28,211
Don't look at me like that, Nelly.

404

thing and what you do with it.

I want you to show me.

...in... in these websites.

- No, I'm not gonna do that.

- It's a really bad idea.
- Show me.

Why hide that computer from the police?

It's the only reason I'm looking.

00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:11,261
I do.

641
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:13,287
How you're holding it together.

642
00:44:14,754 --> 00:44:16,757
It's beyond me how you've done it.

643
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,920
Like dying must be.

644
00:44:23,263 --> 00:44:26,434
- I didn't mean to upset you.
- No, you haven't.

645
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:30,800
It's either that or... labour.

646
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,375
It's unstoppable.

647
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:41,457
I mean, it'll roll on until it's done.

648
00:44:41,481 --> 00:44:44,017
Doesn't matter if it's beyond you.

649
00:44:45,385 --> 00:44:48,080
You're in it until it ends.

650
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:57,272
I was at it three days getting my Marky born.

651

You've seen the size of him,
so you've got some idea.

- Melon, how do I go back?
- Eh?

654
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,136
I need to go back.

655
00:45:37,604 --> 00:45:39,607
This one, here.

656
00:45:44,211 --> 00:45:45,646
She's white, Nelly.

657
00:45:58,057 --> 00:46:00,360
- I need you to come with me.
- What?

658
00:46:01,562 --> 00:46:05,207
Put your shoes on... and come with me.

659
00:46:05,231 --> 00:46:07,442
I need you with me where I'm going.

660
00:46:07,466 --> 00:46:09,444
I'll make this the last favour I'm asking

661
00:46:09,468 --> 00:46:11,147
but I need you to be there with me.

662
00:46:11,171 --> 00:46:12,482
Where are we going?

663
00:46:12,506 --> 00:46:15,250
Nelly, where are you taking me?
What are we doing?

664
00:46:15,274 --> 00:46:17,453
- I need you to get me in there.
- In where?

665
00:46:17,477 --> 00:46:20,089
- Into that bar.
- The one you was on about?

666
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:21,491
Black door.

667
00:46:21,515 --> 00:46:24,093
Based at the bus stop.

668
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:25,895
Is that where you think Jody is, mate?

669
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:27,825
Because if that's
what you're thinking, she's not.

670
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:29,832
Richard, the one I was on about,

671
00:46:29,856 --> 00:46:31,955
Zita reckons he's like a fucking OG to them,

672
00:46:31,979 --> 00:46:34,337
- so he's how.
- How what?

673
00:46:34,361 --> 00:46:36,004
How I get to Jody.

674
00:46:36,028 --> 00:46:37,453
What, because Zita knows some fella,

675
00:46:37,477 --> 00:46:38,499
that's why I'm being dragged out?

676
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:40,442
I need you to get me in there Melon.

677
00:46:40,466 --> 00:46:43,346
However and whatever, make me known to him,

678
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:44,580
then you've done all I can ask.

679
00:46:44,604 --> 00:46:47,482
I don't know him, mate. How
am I supposed to get you in?

680
00:46:47,506 --> 00:46:48,984
You smell like one of 'em!

681
00:46:49,008 --> 00:46:51,386
You've got the stink of 'em on you.

682
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:53,957
That's just what Zita says
and she proper true knows.

683
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:55,625
You've been in with them for 18 months.

684
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:58,361
You know how to get me in there, so let's go.

Even if I could get us in there,

00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:05,602
what makes you so sure he's your path to Jody?

688
00:47:05,626 --> 00:47:08,538
Eh? Some fucking name
a shag pulled out of her arse?

689
00:47:08,562 --> 00:47:10,372
You just do what I need you to do!

690
00:47:10,396 --> 00:47:11,672
Or what?

- Eh, Nelly, or what?
- (HOWLS)

692
00:47:14,066 --> 00:47:16,913
You'll tell the police
what we've been looking at,

693
00:47:16,937 --> 00:47:19,114
tell what I've told you all round the Towers

694
00:47:19,138 --> 00:47:20,450
till me and Bernie get run out?

695
00:47:20,474 --> 00:47:23,886
- Don't make me, please.
- I'm not, Nelly!

696
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:26,321
- I'm fucking not!
- She was in that room!

697
00:47:26,345 --> 00:47:31,660
The one I made you go back to.
Jody was in that room!

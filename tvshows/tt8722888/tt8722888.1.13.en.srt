2
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:49,530
Come on, break it up! Break it up!

3
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:52,856
- Break it up!
- That band geek's a psycho.

4
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,359
He just hit me with his tuba.

5
00:00:54,392 --> 00:00:57,261
Take him to the nurse.

6
00:00:57,295 --> 00:00:59,063
What's gotten into you?

7
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:03,701
He called me Tuba Turd.

8
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:07,138
So you bashed him in the head
like that? Look at him!

9
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:10,174
What's your mom going to say?

10
00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:11,543
She told me to.

11
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:14,278
Sure, she did.
Come on. Let's go find her.

12
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:17,680
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

13
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:22,144
Mr. Levine?

14
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,296
Mr. Levine!

15
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:48,205
What's wrong?

16
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,409
Why aren't you moving?

17
00:02:52,443 --> 00:02:54,992
What's happening?

18
00:02:58,316 --> 00:03:00,265
Dad, wake up.

19
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:07,223
Daddy! Daddy!

20
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:08,992
Daddy?

21
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:12,528
Daddy?

22
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:15,233
Hello.

23
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:17,868
What's happening?

24
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:20,871
Don't worry, child.
He'll be all right.

25
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:22,941
What's wrong with my dad?

26
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:27,945
Well, what's happening right now,
to your father, and to all of them...

27
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:30,991
They're going to think
differently when they wake up.

28
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,925
They're going to believe
in all the right things.

29
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:34,519
All the things they should.

30
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:36,420
They're going to become
better people.

31
00:03:36,454 --> 00:03:38,365
Good people.

32
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,691
My dad's already a good person.

33
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,897
You'll see.

34
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:59,842
Pat?

35
00:03:59,877 --> 00:04:02,576
Pat! Pat, wake up!

36
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,189
Court?

37
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:17,194
Courtney? Your mom's not moving.

38
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:21,531
Oh, don't you worry about
Ms. Barbara.

39
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:23,600
<i>In less than 30 minutes,</i>

40
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:27,204
<i>Brainwave's reprogramming
will be complete...</i>

41
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:30,574
<i>and permanent.</i>

42
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:34,478
<i>Courtney's mother will become
a part of our new society.</i>

43
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:38,615
<i>Our New America.</i>

44
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:43,649
Like everyone under
Brainwave's little spell.

45
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:52,536
Unless of course, Ms. Barbara is
one of those unlucky "one-in-fours" that

46
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,401
pushes back too hard,
or for too long.

47
00:04:57,435 --> 00:05:00,613
<i>While they do that,</i>

48
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:02,615
<i>their entire nervous system
will shut down.</i>

49
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,817
- Mr. Levine?
- Oh, my God!

50
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:06,242
<i>- They'll expire.</i>
- Mr. Levine!

51
00:05:06,276 --> 00:05:09,656
Poor things.

52
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Dad?

53
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:24,995
Here, Pat, it's me!

54
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:27,497
It's Courtney!

55
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:29,632
Your daughter.

56
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,447
Ever since we came to Blue Valley,
you've been there for me...

57
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,194
every time I needed you.

58
00:05:47,218 --> 00:05:50,250
I need you now, Pat.

59
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:57,372
<i>I really, really need you.</i>

60
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:02,867
- What's wrong with him?
- Brainwave's got him.

61
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:06,480
Remember, Justin,
you are the Silent Knight!

62
00:06:06,504 --> 00:06:08,382
The Shining Knight.

63
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:12,076
Well, I don't know.

64
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,413
Chuck. If Brainwave's broadcast
is affecting every adult,

65
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:16,790
why not the bad guys?

66
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:17,992
<i>I'd theorize they're wearing</i>

67
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:19,860
<i>a signal-blocking earpiece
of some kind,</i>

68
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:21,685
<i>protecting them
from the broadcast.</i>

69
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:25,223
Okay. Can we mimic
the blocking signal somehow?

70
00:06:25,257 --> 00:06:29,560
I'm afraid I'd need to examine
<i>one of the earpieces to do that.</i>

71
00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:32,029
Beth, Pat's fighting
Brainwave's control!

72
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:37,000
What? No,
that could kill him, Court!

73
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:42,372
We need help, Beth.

74
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:47,355
I know! I know!
I hear you, guys!

75
00:06:47,444 --> 00:06:49,547
Wait.

76
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,749
I hear them.

77
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:55,187
Chuck! That's it, I hear them.

78
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,889
When I was under Cindy's house,
<i>I couldn't hear anyone.</i>

79
00:06:58,923 --> 00:07:02,560
Can we see if there's
some kind of signal blockers,

80
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:05,062
like those earpieces,
down in the tunnels?

81
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:06,997
<i>Great thinking, Beth.</i>

82
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:10,367
I've located several frequency <i>blocking
systems within the tunnels below.</i>

83
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:11,870
<i>They're currently off.</i>

84
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:15,639
Because they know
we're down there.

85
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:19,276
But, if we can turn
the blockers back on,

86
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,048
we could free Pat and Justin!

87
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:25,916
<i>You think you can break into
my security system that easily?</i>

88
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,653
<i>He's correct,
Beth. It's proving difficult.</i>

89
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:32,122
<i>Every time I break through one of
his firewalls, he puts another one up.</i>

90
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:33,591
<i>It's a stalemate.</i>

91
00:07:33,624 --> 00:07:35,793
If the Gambler's so focused
on keeping us out,

92
00:07:35,826 --> 00:07:38,362
maybe we can divert
his attention elsewhere.

93
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:40,264
What else can we
hack into, Chuck?

94
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:44,435
<i>Hmm. How about we target what the Gambler
cares about more than anything else?</i>

95
00:07:44,468 --> 00:07:45,802
<i>What's that?</i>

96
00:07:45,836 --> 00:07:48,406
<i>His money.</i>

97
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,283
What?

98
00:07:50,307 --> 00:07:54,144
<i>I've accessed his various
bank accounts, both onshore and off.</i>

99
00:07:54,177 --> 00:07:55,747
Hey.

100
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:59,584
<i>- Get out of there!</i>
- I volunteer every Christmas
for the American Red Cross,

101
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:02,452
<i>but there are so many
worthy charities.</i>

102
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:06,389
Why pick one?

103
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:09,293
<i>Stop it!</i>

104
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:12,161
No!

105
00:08:12,196 --> 00:08:13,463
Stop!

106
00:08:13,497 --> 00:08:16,944
Get out of there!

107
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:19,079
<i>With the Gambler
occupied, I've accessed</i>

108
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:21,072
<i>the frequency blockers
in the tunnels.</i>

109
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:22,839
<i>I can't keep them on very long,</i>

110
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:25,110
<i>but even a momentary
interruption in the signal</i>

111
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:28,545
<i>should disconnect</i>
Pat and Justin from Brainwave.

112
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:39,787
Something's wrong.

113
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:54,471
Courtney?

114
00:08:54,504 --> 00:08:58,609
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:58,643 --> 00:09:01,455
It's okay.

116
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:06,479
- Let's get to the machine.
- Court...

117
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:09,486
I heard you.

118
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,724
Every word.

119
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:17,327
I meant every word.

120
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,599
Let's go.

121
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:24,268
Is he back to normal?

122
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:28,500
I'm free to slay the dragon.

123
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,708
His normal.

124
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:34,346
Great job, Beth. Let's go.

125
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:38,015
It wasn't me, Rick.
It was my best pal, Chuck!

126
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:43,048
<i>It was a team effort, best pal.</i>

127
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,125
But we aren't
out of the woods...

128
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:51,595
Courtney, your mom's still
under Brainwave's control.

129
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,831
And if we don't
destroy that machine,

130
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:55,866
your mom could still die.

131
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,671
<i>Millions could.</i>

132
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:03,774
Jordan? The Justice Society,

133
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:06,878
those kids!

134
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,714
I know, Steven. They're here.

135
00:10:09,746 --> 00:10:13,683
But, perhaps it's for the best.

136
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:15,220
Alert the others.

137
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:18,322
We'll take care of them,
once and for all.

138
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:22,192
After we take out this machine,
I'm going after Grundy.

139
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:25,528
I'm going to rip that vault door open,
and I'm going to kill him.

140
00:10:25,562 --> 00:10:27,565
You really think
that's gonna help you?

141
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:29,634
Yeah. I sure as hell do.

142
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,077
Why?

143
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:33,571
Because I'll know that that
thing won't hurt anyone else.

144
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:35,139
It won't make another orphan.

145
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:37,984
- But killing is wrong.
- Says who?

146
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:40,220
God?

147
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:41,188
Yes.

148
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:44,715
Then God shouldn't let
bad things happen.

149
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:49,749
Like my parents
being thrown into a tree.

150
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:56,788
So don't try and stop me,
Yolanda.

151
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:13,711
It's empty.

152
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:17,715
Where has the dragon gone?

153
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:26,456
Court, no one's here.

154
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,158
Yeah. Everyone okay?

155
00:11:28,192 --> 00:11:30,861
- All good.
- Aye.

156
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:32,763
So, where's this machine?

157
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:35,232
Uh...

158
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:38,769
According to the map,
it's through there.

159
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:43,802
Look what we got here.

160
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:52,515
That's as far as you go.

161
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:55,220
No more ice mask, Jordan?

162
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:57,788
I've got nothing
to hide anymore, Courtney.

163
00:11:57,822 --> 00:12:01,091
Anyone else have deja vu?

164
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,328
I do. Wasn't that a fun night?

165
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:09,361
Time to kill the JSA again.

166
00:12:19,476 --> 00:12:22,980
How 'bout some reinforcements?

167
00:12:58,482 --> 00:13:00,985
You only came back
to die, knight.

168
00:13:01,018 --> 00:13:02,686
One of us will today,

169
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,419
there is no doubt!

170
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:33,450
You shouldn't have
locked me up...

171
00:13:33,484 --> 00:13:34,484
Daddy.

172
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,470
Don't.

173
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:06,144
Rick!

174
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:07,711
Get to the machine, Courtney!

175
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:11,249
- But, Pat...
- I've got Grundy! I'll protect Rick!

176
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:13,500
Go do what we came here to do!

177
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:29,332
I got it.

178
00:15:35,706 --> 00:15:37,573
Court!

179
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:38,607
Go!

180
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:56,827
Gambler, loop my signal
for the next five minutes.

181
00:15:56,861 --> 00:16:00,663
It will continue the
reprogramming until I return.

182
00:16:00,697 --> 00:16:02,799
Where are you going?

183
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:07,033
To help kill these children.

184
00:16:09,273 --> 00:16:12,009
<i>Jordan,
Brainwave's left the machine.</i>

185
00:16:12,043 --> 00:16:14,554
You need to find that
horrible little girl

186
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:16,289
<i>and stop her
from using those goggles</i>

187
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:19,116
<i>before she takes control
of our whole damn system!</i>

188
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,187
<i>Jordan! It won't matter what
happens down there if she gets in!</i>

189
00:16:23,221 --> 00:16:25,221
I'm on my way.

190
00:16:32,696 --> 00:16:37,100
Wait, wait! Yolanda!

191
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:39,769
Henry?

192
00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:44,075
Henry!

193
00:16:44,107 --> 00:16:47,945
We need to get out of here.
My dad...

194
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:50,081
- He's coming.
- What?

195
00:16:50,114 --> 00:16:51,649
What, I don't understand.

196
00:16:51,682 --> 00:16:55,153
The cave-in didn't kill me,
my dad didn't either.

197
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:57,455
I've been hiding,
wearing these clothes for days.

198
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:00,491
Pretending to be one of them.

199
00:17:00,524 --> 00:17:05,525
I know where my dad is,
and how we can stop him.

200
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:07,798
You...

201
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:10,367
You remember what I said?

202
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:13,304
How I was sorry for everything?

203
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:16,507
- Yeah.
- You're all I've been
thinking about

204
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:18,940
this whole time.

205
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,782
Okay. What's...

206
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:27,184
What's the plan?

207
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:30,667
Where are your friends?

208
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:41,464
They were Henry's friends, too.

209
00:17:54,979 --> 00:17:59,182
I watched Henry die.

210
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:04,217
And now,
I'm going to watch you die.

211
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:08,296
My turn.

212
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:19,563
I don't have time for this.

213
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:30,772
Yolanda!

214
00:19:36,814 --> 00:19:39,651
Oh, my God.

215
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:43,653
- Yolanda...
- I killed him.

216
00:19:43,686 --> 00:19:46,056
What?

217
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:48,759
I know it's wrong,

218
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,741
but I did it.

219
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,035
I think the machine's over here.

220
00:19:58,068 --> 00:20:01,939
Come on.

221
00:20:10,047 --> 00:20:14,652
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

222
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:19,635
Staff, this is where
you come in.

223
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:23,094
What are you gonna do?

224
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:24,926
What do you think? Blow it off!

225
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:57,925
- Run!
- Go, go, go!

226
00:21:17,848 --> 00:21:22,019
It's okay,
I'm right here. It's okay.

227
00:21:22,051 --> 00:21:25,122
Love you so much.

228
00:21:25,155 --> 00:21:28,259
Are you okay?

229
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:32,829
Mrs. Whitmore? Mrs. Whitmore?

230
00:21:32,863 --> 00:21:35,333
Mmm-hmm?

231
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:38,702
Beth?

232
00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:42,306
You! You have no idea
what you've done.

233
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:43,574
Courtney?

234
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:47,010
<i>- Jordan's here.</i>
- Mom!

235
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:51,048
No more Dr. Mid-Nite.

236
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,652
<i>Beth?
Beth, please help me.</i>

237
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:01,958
Chuck?

238
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:10,535
Beth?

239
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:13,002
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

240
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,107
Are you okay?

241
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:19,210
Barbara...

242
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:21,479
- She's in trouble.
- I heard.

243
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:25,016
Go save your wife.

244
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:30,049
Pat, you don't need
the damn robot! Go!

245
00:22:30,387 --> 00:22:33,057
I've got five minutes left...

246
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:37,327
and it's all for you!

247
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:59,549
Beth.

248
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,983
He killed Chuck.

249
00:23:09,026 --> 00:23:11,425
Where is my mom?

250
00:23:15,032 --> 00:23:17,567
I want to show you
something so you'll understand.

251
00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:20,404
Look! Look at what I made.

252
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:24,041
Do you remember what this town was
like before I came here? It was dying.

253
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:27,144
We brought it back,
better than it ever was.

254
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,579
That's what all of this is,
to help people. I just...

255
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:32,517
I wanna help people.

256
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:35,686
Tell that to Joey Zarick
and his parents.

257
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,457
And to Henry King.

258
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,159
Over half a million Americans die
from cancer every year, Barbara.

259
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:43,561
Every year.

260
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:46,596
What if I told you it would take
a half a million lives right now,

261
00:23:46,631 --> 00:23:49,299
but I could cure cancer?
Forever.

262
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:52,237
What would you do?

263
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:55,339
No one was going to die
because of the way people think.

264
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:58,276
Yeah, but they do. My wife died
because of the way people think.

265
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:00,912
Because of greed and politics,
but I can change that.

266
00:24:00,944 --> 00:24:03,048
And it's not too late. It's not.

267
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,915
I can still save America,
Barbara.

268
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:06,750
It doesn't have to be today,
but I can do it.

269
00:24:06,784 --> 00:24:09,619
And you could help.

270
00:24:09,653 --> 00:24:11,722
And Courtney could.

271
00:24:11,756 --> 00:24:13,967
I can protect her
from the others. I can.

272
00:24:13,991 --> 00:24:16,694
I can keep her safe,
and we could go somewhere.

273
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:21,729
We could go somewhere else,
and we can start again. We can start anew.

274
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,470
You're out of your damn mind.

275
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:29,640
Your wife would be horrified
to see the person you've become.

276
00:24:29,673 --> 00:24:33,273
You didn't know my wife!

277
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,288
I will succeed, Barbara.

278
00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:48,376
Look at me!

279
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,761
I will succeed

280
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:53,097
and I will kill your daughter,

281
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:57,769
and your husband for what
you've all done.

282
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:59,971
I want you to think about that
on the way down.

283
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:03,649
- No! No!
- Hey, Jordan!

284
00:25:03,673 --> 00:25:06,143
You wanna kill me?

285
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:08,576
Well, here I am.

286
00:25:13,785 --> 00:25:16,554
What are you doing up here, Pat?

287
00:25:16,586 --> 00:25:20,857
You got no powers. No STRIPE.

288
00:25:20,892 --> 00:25:23,661
I'm here to protect my wife.

289
00:25:23,693 --> 00:25:26,329
With what exactly?

290
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:28,313
Our daughter.

291
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,596
Damn you! Fight back!

292
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,031
Fight me!

293
00:26:09,673 --> 00:26:14,673
You stupid animal.
You stupid animal!

294
00:26:25,221 --> 00:26:29,192
Go on! Get outta here!

295
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:39,433
And never come back!

296
00:26:50,981 --> 00:26:54,684
You spared the beast.

297
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:58,422
Whatever. My hour was up.

298
00:26:58,455 --> 00:26:59,806
Let's go!

299
00:27:13,237 --> 00:27:15,186
Court!

300
00:27:19,442 --> 00:27:23,042
I won't let you stop me.

301
00:27:25,348 --> 00:27:26,549
Beth?

302
00:27:26,584 --> 00:27:28,352
- Rick, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

303
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,721
Where is Yolanda?

304
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:32,448
Oh, no.

305
00:27:38,496 --> 00:27:39,639
Courtney?

306
00:27:39,663 --> 00:27:41,199
You can never save America.

307
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:42,933
You're filled
with too much hate.

308
00:27:45,702 --> 00:27:50,653
Barb!

309
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:52,424
Gotcha.

310
00:28:11,796 --> 00:28:13,463
You saved my life.

311
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:17,247
Just returning the favor.

312
00:28:25,644 --> 00:28:29,413
Does this mean I get to be
in the JSA?

313
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:31,347
Oh, I like it.

314
00:28:31,382 --> 00:28:35,419
Huh. Huh.

315
00:29:17,994 --> 00:29:19,763
Look at that.

316
00:29:19,797 --> 00:29:21,664
It's like it never
even happened.

317
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:25,116
Not really.

318
00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:31,709
You okay?

319
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:32,741
Yeah.

320
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:45,722
Hey.

321
00:29:45,756 --> 00:29:47,892
We'll fix the goggles, Beth.

322
00:29:47,924 --> 00:29:50,693
Somehow we'll fix them.

323
00:29:50,728 --> 00:29:52,630
It's not them, Courtney.

324
00:29:52,663 --> 00:29:55,532
It's him.

325
00:29:55,566 --> 00:29:58,001
It's Chuck.

326
00:29:58,036 --> 00:30:02,306
Well, then, we'll get him
up and running, Beth.

327
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:03,740
Okay?

328
00:30:03,773 --> 00:30:07,944
Right, Yolanda?

329
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:09,628
Yeah, sure.

330
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:23,260
Why you taking all this junk?

331
00:30:23,294 --> 00:30:27,344
This is all I have for now.

332
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:35,300
I came to Blue Valley
to slay that dragon.

333
00:30:35,471 --> 00:30:38,910
But I didn't do it.

334
00:30:38,942 --> 00:30:41,811
I did nothing.

335
00:30:41,846 --> 00:30:43,146
Hey.

336
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:46,550
You helped us figure out
what was going on here.

337
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:50,922
And you helped us stop
the Injustice Society.

338
00:30:50,954 --> 00:30:52,923
You know that?

339
00:30:52,957 --> 00:30:55,527
Besides...

340
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:00,198
there'll be other dragons
to slay, Justin.

341
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,634
- Other dragons?
- Oh, yeah.

342
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:10,421
There will be, won't there?

343
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:16,846
Starman, he'd be
so proud of you.

344
00:31:16,881 --> 00:31:20,480
Of all of you, he would.

345
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:27,191
Where are you going?

346
00:31:27,224 --> 00:31:31,595
I'm gonna go
and find my horse, dear lady.

347
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:33,897
Any other soldiers, I think.

348
00:31:33,931 --> 00:31:37,301
Hey, let me know
if you find 'em.

349
00:31:37,335 --> 00:31:39,769
I'd like to see 'em again.

350
00:31:39,804 --> 00:31:42,705
Aye.

351
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,875
Thank you.

352
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:50,213
Thank you all.

353
00:31:50,248 --> 00:31:52,115
Until the next battle, Stargirl.

354
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,450
Until the next battle.

355
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:11,568
- Everything okay?
- Seems to be.

356
00:32:11,603 --> 00:32:16,040
At least as far
as anyone can see.

357
00:32:16,074 --> 00:32:21,011
I wonder what the rest of the
world's going to think happened here?

358
00:32:21,045 --> 00:32:25,816
They always come up
with a story.

359
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:29,220
Who does?

360
00:32:29,252 --> 00:32:30,931
<i>The National Weather Service
confirmed</i>

361
00:32:30,955 --> 00:32:34,092
<i>that it was an earthquake</i>
that struck Nebraska yesterday.

362
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:38,063
<i>This tremor ultimately caused a
malfunction in a weather satellite.</i>

363
00:32:38,096 --> 00:32:40,832
<i>Government officials say that
the satellite has been fixed,</i>

364
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:45,865
<i>and an event like that</i>
recurring again is impossible.

365
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:52,675
Oh, Jordan,

366
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,309
I told you it was folly.

367
00:33:54,971 --> 00:33:57,574
I see you in there.

368
00:33:57,607 --> 00:34:00,877
Eclipso.

369
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:19,130
Peanut butter cookies.

370
00:34:19,163 --> 00:34:20,664
Wow! Those look so great.

371
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,233
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

372
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:24,469
And, uh,
I'll be checking in on you.

373
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:27,539
Not too many sprinkles.
Barb will freak out.

374
00:34:27,572 --> 00:34:31,175
Thanks, honey.

375
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,811
- That's a great sweater.
- Thank you.

376
00:34:36,612 --> 00:34:39,250
Oh.

377
00:34:39,282 --> 00:34:42,519
Mike, how you doin'?
You getting enough vegetables?

378
00:34:42,554 --> 00:34:46,657
- Oh, yeah.
- This looks so good.

379
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,827
No! This is the last straw,
damn it!

380
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,496
Mike!
Golly, gee,
Buddy! Stop!

00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,340
He doesn't live here. Moved.

428
00:39:29,373 --> 00:39:31,742
Months ago now.

429
00:39:31,775 --> 00:39:34,545
Any idea where I can find him?

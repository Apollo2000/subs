Now look, we already cut our price.
And we now have seven to step off.

Say, baby, seven don't get you 12.

<i>- Seven get you 10, seem to me.

Hmm, look at it.

21

How much water y'all get up here?

22
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,975
Shit, you see the
line over my head.

23
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,643
Six... six and a half.

24
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:50,380
Look, I feel for y'all.
But less than $200 a man?

That shit ain't right.

26
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,251
Say, baby, if shit was right,

27
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:54,720
You think we'd have to scrape up

28
00:01:54,754 --> 00:01:57,024
A couple dozen of
us to do this here?

29
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:59,191
You think we'd all be
paradin' on the same day?

30

Come on, bro.

Most of us wearin'
last year's suits.

32
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,164
Last few dollars
went to meyer, baby,

33
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:06,101
To pay for the fedoras.

34

My man.

39
00:02:17,683 --> 00:02:20,019
- Ha ha!
- All right, brother.

40
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:24,123
- 12, right?
- Money hard to come by.

41
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:25,792
At least that's what I hear.

42
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:27,728

Man #2: Always for pleasure, baby.

47
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:44,378

Let's do it like we do.

<i>Man: See, I'm short, I know.</i>

57
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,058
But if you had went down city park Avenue
and then esplanade and Saint Claude

58
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:22,926
Instead of all the way on the interstate,
it would've been less.

59
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,062
If you want to take city park
and esplanade, then say so.

60
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:27,731
Man, I thought you knew.

61
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:30,566
You say esplanade, I'll take
you esplanade, no problem.

62
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,334
Look man, when I
catch up with them

63
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:34,369
And play that parade,
I'ma have it, all right?

64
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:36,471
I'm gonna find you.

65
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:38,772
- I will.
- ( laughs )

66
00:04:39,774 --> 00:04:42,375
Thank you, brother, I owe you.

67
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,043
Right. Yeah, you're right.

68
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:49,482
( plays riff loudly )

69
00:04:49,516 --> 00:04:53,319
<i>Man: Oh sit, batiste playin'
"rebirth" now?</i>

70
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:55,521

71
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:02,163
<i>Running late, huh, bro?</i>

00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,483
What's up, bro?

74
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:28,284
<i>Man: What's up?</i>

75
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,486
Aw, shit, look who
the fuck showed up.

76
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:32,721
When the last time you saw this
motherfucker play a second line?

77
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:34,790
First thing to go is
those legs, old man.

78
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:37,125
<i>And he stole that from tyrus.</i>

79
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,593
Man, tyrus used to play
that riff to death.

80
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:41,594
Negro, if you are
referring to Mr. Chapman,

81
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:43,596
The fact is he appropriated
that particular

82
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,664
Musical ornamentation
from my repertoire, bro.

83
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:48,433
( snickers ) - damn!
That how they talk at them gigs uptown?

84
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:51,336
Yeah. - Shorty ain't
gonna make it, huh?

85
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,406
Nah, shorty sent me to show
y'all how to play music.

86
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,407

87
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:57,843
( laughs ) yeah.

88
00:05:57,877 --> 00:05:59,878
That's the sixth ward
in my 'bone, baby.

89
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:01,846
You're in treme, y'all don't
know nothing about that.

90
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:04,915
Oh, let's see how it sounds six or
seven miles from now, motherfucker.

91
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,716
Yeah, blow your horn, fool.
You'll see.

92
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:08,417
- ( chuckles )
- play for the money, boys.

93
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,185

00:09:53,313 --> 00:09:55,481
When I had the chance.

158
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:57,549
Yeah, no cold shower for you, huh?

159
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,450
You are a cold shower.

160
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:02,353
Last night... not so much.

161

Well, what girl wouldn't be

163
00:10:08,593 --> 00:10:10,660
Seduced by all this?

164

Ah!

168

Three of the furious

Oh! You mock me, sir.

If you persist in doing so,
I will have satisfaction.

Be satisfied. It's all good.

You satisfied now? - Aw,
I'm playin' with you, dawg.

175
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:05,570
"I will ha satisfaction" is
like what a gentlemen says

176
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:07,272
When he wishes to duel.

177

Raymond?

us through the night.

I could run out to dorignac's.
They got crawfish.

219
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:09,672
And we could parade naked
down prytania street too,

But I'm not gonna do it.
No fucking frozen

Ramming into the canal wall,
not dynamite.

Drown 80% of the city? Vees.
In whose interest was that?

281
00:16:58,326 --> 00:17:02,128
Why displace so many working
class folks, black and white?

282
00:17:02,162 --> 00:17:04,463
It makes no sense.

a natural disaster,

A hurricane is. - What hit
the Mississippi Gulf coast

286
00:17:11,703 --> 00:17:14,537
Was a natural disaster... a hurricane,
pure and simple.

287
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:16,939
The flooding of new Orleans

288
00:17:16,973 --> 00:17:20,208
Was a man-made catastrophe.

289
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:23,244
A federal fuck-up
of epic proportions.

290
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,214
- And decades in the making.
- Daddy!

291
00:17:25,248 --> 00:17:26,848
We can edit that out, no worries.

292
00:17:26,882 --> 00:17:28,383
The levees were not blown.

293
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:32,219
Not in '65 and not
three months ago.

294
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:34,287
The flood protection system

295
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:36,256
Built by the army
corps of engineers,

296
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,625
A.K.A. The federal
government, failed.

297
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:42,228
And we've been saying for the
last 40 years since Betsy

298
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,631
That it was gonna fail again
unless something was done.

299
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:46,599
And guess what? It was not.

300
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,736
- Seriously, daddy, you'reonna stroke out.
- No worries, sweetheart.

301
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,904
Cool as a cucumber up
an archbishop's ass.

302
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:53,706
The levees weren't blown.

303
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:57,308
The floodgates failed, the canal
walls failed, the pumps failed.

304
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,208
All of which were supposedly built

305
00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:00,709
To withstand a much greater storm.

306
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:02,578
Are you suggesting
criminal liability?

307
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:04,346
Absolutely. Find the
responsible parties

308
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,414
And put them on trial-
corps of engineers;

309
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:08,115
The federal, state,
local government;

310
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,217
The contractors who used
substandard materials

311
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:12,219
And the goddamn
sleazebag politicians

312
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:13,887
That they have in their pockets.

313
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:15,989
So, given that it's
all gone pear-shaped,

314
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:18,124
Why should the American
taxpayer foot the bill

315
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:20,860
To fix new Orleans?

Well, since when don't nations
rebuild their great cities?

For the sake of argument,
let's say new Orleans

318

Was once a great city.

Are you saying that new
Orleans is not a great city...

imagination of the world?

a fan of the music,

Which has rather seen its day,
let's be honest;

323
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:40,442
Or the food, a provincial cuisine

324
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:42,310
Which many would say
is typically American,

325
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:44,679
Too fat, too rich... then yes,
of course.

00:37:31,153 --> 00:37:33,554
- That's good to know.
- Yeah, in heaven,

627
00:37:33,588 --> 00:37:35,255
The horn players don't
make him tune down

628
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:36,789
To e-flat to play "big chief,"

629
00:37:36,823 --> 00:37:38,390
So he's got that workin' for him.

630
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:39,858
But, um, anyway,

631
00:37:39,892 --> 00:37:41,927
So Earl comes at me with
this political relevance,

632
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:43,429
Which is weird because Earl

633
00:37:43,463 --> 00:37:46,199
Wasn't that way in life.
But hey, it's my dream, right?

634
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:48,134
- And Earl brings it.
- Brings what?

635
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:50,237
The mafia.

636
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:51,939
The mafia? That's your theme?

637
00:37:51,974 --> 00:37:53,541
Dude!

638
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:56,376
The mafia is way better
equipped to run new Orleans

639
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,110
Than the United States government,

640
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,111
- The state of louisiana...
- they used to run it.

641
00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:02,046
The marcellos used to run it all.

642
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:05,149
Yeah, and fuck if it isn't
time to bring 'em back!

643
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,119
I mean, hey, do you think the mob

644
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:09,687
Would have dragged
ass the way fema did

645
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:12,256
And left little old
ladies to rot on rooftops?

646
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,757
I mean, look how good
Carlos ran things

647
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,692
When the mayor and the
governor and everybody else

648
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,560
Was in his pockets?
Look at the lafitte.

649
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:19,227
Beautiful sicilian roof slate.

650
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:20,760
Did they fall over?
Did they flood?

651
00:38:20,794 --> 00:38:24,162
- But music... - Louis armstrong-
- managed by Joe glazer

652
00:38:24,196 --> 00:38:26,163
Who had to pair up
with the mob. Feel me?

653
00:38:26,197 --> 00:38:27,862
From there I segue
into Louis prima

654
00:38:27,896 --> 00:38:29,760
Who was managed by
the segreto family.

655
00:38:29,794 --> 00:38:32,160
After which, I'm close
enough to some old-school R&B

656
00:38:32,194 --> 00:38:33,792
To get up into cosimo's shop,

657
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:35,459
Start spinning some Ray Charles,

658
00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:38,728
Some spiders, Lee Allen,

659
00:38:38,762 --> 00:38:40,396
May...

660
00:38:41,965 --> 00:38:44,699
Oh, you have got to
be fucking kidding me!

661
00:38:44,734 --> 00:38:48,536
One in every three songs from
a pledge-drive compilation?

662
00:38:49,605 --> 00:38:51,339
It's that time of year, bro.

663
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:52,840
Well...

664
00:38:52,874 --> 00:38:54,908
Here we are,

665
00:38:54,942 --> 00:38:57,009
Supposedly the greatest
alternative radio station

666
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,611
In the greatest musical city

667
00:38:58,645 --> 00:39:01,380
In this sad, failed
history of the planet

668
00:39:01,414 --> 00:39:03,348
And we're playing the same,
admittedly great,

20 tunes that everyone
hears on every fucking

670

"big easy," "crescent city,
" "care forgot" compilation

671
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:10,219
Ever released!

672

And you gotta plug the
cd at every break.

675

- Darnell said so.
- "iko," "tipitina"...

00:46:23,244 --> 00:46:25,878
Let us... dude. Let us pse, sir,

782
00:46:25,913 --> 00:46:27,746
And define the word "consignment."

783
00:46:27,781 --> 00:46:30,581
Consignment means shit be mine

784
00:46:30,615 --> 00:46:32,182
And if y'all sell it,

785
00:46:32,216 --> 00:46:33,684
Y'all break me off a piece.

786
00:46:33,718 --> 00:46:35,218
And if you don't,
give it the fuck back.

787
00:46:35,253 --> 00:46:36,786
We're out of business.

788
00:46:36,821 --> 00:46:38,388
Okay, are you gonna Jack my shit

789
00:46:38,422 --> 00:46:39,989
Because you can't
handle yours, man?

790
00:46:40,024 --> 00:46:41,458
- Toss him.
- Fuck you, man.

791
00:46:41,492 --> 00:46:42,926
Fuck you, you pussy fucks!

792
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,361
You come down here with
your chain-store shit, huh?!

793
00:46:45,395 --> 00:46:48,997
Fuck you for running away at
the first fucking hurricane!

794
00:46:49,031 --> 00:46:51,899
Louisiana music factory is
gonna make every fucking dollar

795
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,134
That you'll never see,
you pussy fucks!

796
00:46:54,169 --> 00:46:56,003
- Guard: Come on!
- Fuck you.

797
00:46:56,037 --> 00:46:57,804
Fuck!

798
00:46:57,838 --> 00:46:59,505
I'm out!

799
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,240
- ( grunts )
- man: What the fuck?

800
00:47:01,274 --> 00:47:04,209
<i>- ( men snickering )
- ( door slams )</i>

801
00:47:06,844 --> 00:47:08,844
I will have satisfaction.

802
00:47:08,878 --> 00:47:10,412
<i>Man: Get your stupid ass up.</i>

803
00:47:10,446 --> 00:47:13,150
No, you pick up where
we left off yesterday.

804
00:47:13,184 --> 00:47:16,221
You want 4800 America,
and go all the way to pressburg.

805
00:47:16,255 --> 00:47:18,055
- Driver: Yes, sir.
- Go on.

806
00:47:23,326 --> 00:47:25,060
Mmm.

807
00:47:25,094 --> 00:47:27,228
Not so many back over here, huh?

808
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:29,496
Water was up to your waist
in most of these shotguns.

809
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:31,364
People waitin' on insurance-
those that got.

810
00:47:31,399 --> 00:47:34,400
- Well, you got yours squared away.
- Me? I'm making money.

811
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,001
$200 every truckload I clear

812
00:47:37,035 --> 00:47:39,003
Off them new Orleans East streets.

813
00:47:39,037 --> 00:47:40,971
- That's fema contract.
- Fema, huh?

814
00:47:41,005 --> 00:47:42,372
Mm-hmm. It ain't good for most,

815
00:47:42,407 --> 00:47:45,642
But if you got a haulin' business,
's good enough.

816
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:47,812
Speaking of which, I got a ton

817
00:47:47,846 --> 00:47:51,217
Of muddy shit I hauled out of
the bar-room needs to be dumped.

818
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:53,652
Shit. - I'm askin'
as a chief here.

819
00:47:55,055 --> 00:47:57,391
Albert, all due respect...

820
00:47:57,425 --> 00:47:58,860
You ain't my chief.

821
00:47:58,894 --> 00:48:00,231
My chief monk boudreaux.

822
00:48:00,265 --> 00:48:02,734
I been golden eagle all my life.
You know that.

823
00:48:02,769 --> 00:48:06,004
Well, I need the
bar-room for practice.

824
00:48:06,038 --> 00:48:08,673
Ain't none of your
gang even around.

825
00:48:10,075 --> 00:48:13,144
- Practice is Sunday.
- You out your damn mind.

826
00:48:13,179 --> 00:48:15,747
( laughs ) every day I'm
over at new Orleans East

827
00:48:15,781 --> 00:48:17,349
On that government contract.

828
00:48:17,383 --> 00:48:19,517
I'm making $600-800.

829
00:48:19,551 --> 00:48:22,119
( laughs ) no, I'm sorry, homes.

830
00:48:30,861 --> 00:48:32,494
Thanks for the beer.

831
00:48:32,529 --> 00:48:34,863
You welcome.

832
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:40,034
Uh-huh. Yeah.

833
00:48:40,068 --> 00:48:41,936
No no no, I understand.

834
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:45,138
I... no, you're smart to call,

835
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:47,507
But I think your court
date's been postponed.

836
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:48,975
( laughs )

837
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,676
I'll check and call you back.

838
00:48:55,814 --> 00:48:58,949
Woman: Isn't that Toni bernette?

839
00:48:58,984 --> 00:49:01,418
Hey, rich. How's it going?

840
00:49:01,452 --> 00:49:03,520
- We're expecting someone.
- Oh.

841
00:49:03,555 --> 00:49:06,257
Sorry, I didn't realize.

842
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:07,725
Meetin' someone anyway.

843
00:49:07,759 --> 00:49:09,225
Guess I'll just wait for a table.

844
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,060
You're workin' out of your car?

845
00:49:11,094 --> 00:49:13,729
Office took about five
feet of water. - Ours too.

846
00:49:13,763 --> 00:49:15,230
How's your house?

847
00:49:15,264 --> 00:49:16,898
We're up on octavia.

848
00:49:16,933 --> 00:49:18,967
- The isle of denial.
- ( chuckles )

849
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:20,501
We did lose our roof,

850
00:49:20,536 --> 00:49:24,271
- But can't complain.
- No, you can't.

851
00:49:25,973 --> 00:49:28,241
What about you? - Still
livin' on the fucking boat.

852
00:49:28,275 --> 00:49:29,742
Aw, I'm sorry.

853
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:34,679
There's my date.
I'll talk to you soon, rich.

854
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:39,149
- Who's joining us?
- Fuck that cunt.

855
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,918
- It's not personal, Lonnie.
- Fuck it ain't.

856
00:49:41,953 --> 00:49:44,721
- She sues everybody.
- Whatever.

857
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:46,155
What you got?

858
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:48,257
So this boy come into the
bar after the parade...

859
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:50,459
Demetrius bray, sylvie's brother,

860
00:49:50,493 --> 00:49:52,762
- From over on pi...
- excuse me.

861
00:49:54,897 --> 00:49:57,064
Okay, but anyway,

862
00:49:57,099 --> 00:50:00,066
He say he was with daymo at o.P.P.

863
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:02,368
When the jail was flooded.

864
00:50:02,403 --> 00:50:05,137
He says your brother was
locked up during the storm?

865
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:07,673
He said they was
together on the bridge

866
00:50:07,707 --> 00:50:09,508
Before the buses came

867
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:12,111
And took them to Saint Gabriel.

868
00:50:12,145 --> 00:50:13,712
And after that?

869
00:50:13,746 --> 00:50:15,880
He ain't see him again.

870
00:50:16,882 --> 00:50:19,115
Ladonna, I checked with n.O.P.D.,

871
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,017
The sheriff, .P.P.

872
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:22,551
They have no record of David,

873
00:50:22,585 --> 00:50:24,453
No arrest, no report, nothing.

874
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:26,521
Don't mean he wasn't there.

875
00:50:26,555 --> 00:50:28,624
You know that.

876
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:30,426
The way they do up at the parish

877
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,761
Even when there ain't
a hurricane, Toni.

878
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,296
I'll check again.

879
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:36,197
It's a good thing, ladonna.

880
00:50:36,232 --> 00:50:38,699
A place to start.

881
00:50:38,733 --> 00:50:40,734
Ain't gonna tell my
mama about it this time.

882
00:50:40,768 --> 00:50:43,669
Don't want to get her
worked up about it again.

883
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:51,741
I think he dead.

884
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,309
All this time and
that boy ain't call?

885
00:50:53,343 --> 00:50:55,077
Ladonna... mm-mmm.

886
00:50:55,111 --> 00:50:57,044
No. He would have called

887
00:50:57,079 --> 00:50:58,546
- If he could...
- we

888
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,948
No no no no.
We don't know ything yet,

889
00:51:00,982 --> 00:51:02,416
All right?

890
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,818
Give me a day or two
to work it, okay?

891
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,757
Had no idea we'd have
to wait like this.

892
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:11,360
Yeah, well I gotta
get back to the bar.

893
00:51:12,428 --> 00:51:14,429
I'll call you, okay?

894
00:51:26,172 --> 00:51:28,273
I'll get up if your friend shows.

895
00:51:35,213 --> 00:51:36,747
What's wrong with him?

896
00:51:36,781 --> 00:51:39,180
You sued him, remember?

897
00:51:39,215 --> 00:51:41,849
Oh - brutality
complaint last summer?

898
00:51:41,884 --> 00:51:45,386
<i>Woman: All right. Tell your mama
and them I said all right.</i>

899
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,121
- Hey, rich.
- Hmm?

900
00:51:47,155 --> 00:51:50,391
You remember a couple months back
I was asking about a missing kid,

901
00:51:50,425 --> 00:51:51,892
Young man from valence street?

902
00:51:51,927 --> 00:51:53,794
A lot of people still missing...

903
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:55,329
A lot of people
want to be missing.

904
00:51:55,364 --> 00:51:57,465
- You ran his name.
- And got nothing.

905
00:51:57,499 --> 00:52:00,868
But do you think it's possible
he might have been locked up

906
00:52:00,902 --> 00:52:03,204
- Just before the storm...
- sure, it's possible.

907
00:52:03,238 --> 00:52:05,973
Anything's possible, you kidding?

908
00:52:06,008 --> 00:52:07,742
All I know is we don't have him.

909
00:52:08,911 --> 00:52:11,312
Let me ask you something, darlin'.

910
00:52:11,347 --> 00:52:13,281
This kid a fuck-up?

911
00:52:13,315 --> 00:52:14,782
I saw those priors.

912
00:52:14,817 --> 00:52:17,652
Theft, drugs, f.T.A.S.

913
00:52:17,686 --> 00:52:19,752
He was doing better
before the storm.

914
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:21,952
Right.

915
00:52:21,986 --> 00:52:23,718
Humor me.

916
00:52:28,487 --> 00:52:30,921
David Maurice Brooks.

917
00:52:30,955 --> 00:52:33,289
Bread puddin'?

918
00:52:33,323 --> 00:52:34,924
Never mind brutality,

919
00:52:34,958 --> 00:52:37,025
He ought to be sued
over this right here.

920
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,393
( both laughing )

921
00:52:38,427 --> 00:52:40,628
Look, it's $24 right now,
God damn it.

922
00:52:40,663 --> 00:52:42,630
I got you, bro. I got you covered.

923
00:52:42,665 --> 00:52:44,999
I'm leaving my damn 'bone, man.

924
00:52:45,033 --> 00:52:47,201
You know if I'm leavin'
my 'bone in your damn cab,

925
00:52:47,235 --> 00:52:49,569
I ain't runnin' out on you. Shit.

926
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:54,507
24! - Whoa.
Listen, that's another thing.

927
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:57,876
I don't know all about that
$24 from the parish line?

928
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:59,477
If you had listened to
me and taken earhart,

929
00:52:59,511 --> 00:53:01,913
You wouldn't have run into
all that mess on claiborne.

930
00:53:01,947 --> 00:53:03,080
Shit.

931
00:53:04,616 --> 00:53:06,650
It's 24 or I'ma call a cop.

932
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,118
Come on now.

933
00:53:08,152 --> 00:53:09,753
Just calm down.
I'll be right back, bro.

934
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:13,189
Hold on.

935
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:19,261
Be right back.

936
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:21,463
Yeah.

937
00:53:23,565 --> 00:53:25,466
Hey now, batiste baby.

938
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,468
How you doin, darlin'?

939

01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,946
Kermit, you don't
know Elvis costello?

1096

"everyday I write the book"...

1098
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23,884
Come on, you're
kidding right, kermit?

1099
01:04:23,918 --> 01:04:25,852
Jeez, brother, go talk to him.

1100
01:04:28,054 --> 01:04:29,888
- About what?
- Music. Make a friend.

1101
01:04:29,922 --> 01:04:31,789
Make a contact.

1102
01:04:31,823 --> 01:04:34,826
"kermit ruffins opens for Elvis
costello on his American tour."

1103
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,795
Who knows? Go.

1104
01:04:37,997 --> 01:04:39,764
- You know this boy Elvis?
- Mm-hmm.

1105
01:04:39,798 --> 01:04:42,131
God damn, kermit. Go talk...

1106
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:44,267
You deserve... don't you
want to get famous?

1107
01:04:44,301 --> 01:04:45,768
You deserve to be famous.

1108
01:04:45,803 --> 01:04:48,137
America needs it some kermit.

1109
01:04:49,339 --> 01:04:51,539
You're... you're
just standing there

1110

Telling me that all you wanna do

1111
01:04:53,575 --> 01:04:57,178
Is get high,
play... play some trumpet

1112
01:04:57,212 --> 01:04:59,613
And barbecue in new Orleans
your whole damn life?

1113
01:05:01,915 --> 01:05:04,048
( laughs ) that'll work.

1114
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:06,716
( all laughing )

1115
01:05:08,352 --> 01:05:11,519
God, man. I mean,
that's just so sad.

1116
01:05:11,554 --> 01:05:13,954
This is against policy.

1117
01:05:13,989 --> 01:05:15,721
But you said the kid
is still missing?

1118
01:05:15,756 --> 01:05:18,053
- Yeah.
- An exception then.

1119
01:05:19,021 --> 01:05:20,987
Understood. And appreciated.

1121
01:05:23,256 --> 01:05:25,022
We actually didn't get any
photos of the prisoners

1122
01:05:25,057 --> 01:05:27,557
- On the overpass.
- But you can see it from here.

1123
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:29,358
Couldn'tet into our building.

1124
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:30,958
But the wires had some
shots we picked up

1125
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:34,027
And ran on the website
before we were back in print.

How are you talking me into this,
just for the record?

You're striking a
blow for liberty.

Because I dated your

Oh, yeah. I can see why she might.

You know, if the cops come,
we're totally fucked.

1159

This is new Orleans, dawg.
The police never come.

1160
01:07:31,031 --> 01:07:33,066
And if they do,
th'll shove us out of the way

And start looting they own selves.

Hey, darlin'.
Um, celebrating victory

Over the forces of, uh, unfettered

Corporate arrogance.

1190

You opened a conterno?

1191

For a small establishment,
you have an excellent list.

It's a remarkable year.
It's a remarkable wine.

Huge aromas of tar,

- Ma'am, the sheriff is in meetings.

If you're not gonna help us
fill up the goddamn truck,

1249

Make yourself useful and go
down and pay the water bill.

From New York City
to pay the water bill

1256
01:13:09,973 --> 01:13:12,574
On a bar we don't even own?

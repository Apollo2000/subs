Live in the studio on this

W.W.O.Z.

00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:20,225
In the completely soulless
faux french market,

48
00:02:20,293 --> 00:02:23,061
A shameful Shell and shadow
of its former self.

49

<i>What's up
with that, bro?</i>

50

Are they gonna let o.Z.
Go back to Armstrong park?

51
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:30,200
I don't think so, bro.
I don't see it. Not in the cards.

52

You don't get the good

All tourists

Hey, you're preaching
to the choir, man.

You're preaching to the choir.

56

So what are you doing there?

57
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:44,711
Tell the folks at home, Coco,
a little play-by-play.

58
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:49,548
Well, if o.Z. Can't go back
to Congo square,

59
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:51,983
We're gonna bring
Congo square to o.Z.

60
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:54,718
Bringing the mountain
to Mohammed sort of thing.

61
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:57,154
By lighting these
spirit candles,

62
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:59,455
We're gonna summon

Erzulie dantor to us.

64
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:04,893
Cool.

65
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,495
Coco Robicheaux
runs the voodoo down live.

66
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,364
Uh, Coco, this azalea chick
who's gonna drop by--?

67
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:13,633
<i>- Erzulie dantor.
- Uh-huh.</i>

68
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:16,369
<i>- The loa of New Orleans.
- The loa.</i>

69
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:18,837
Yes indeed, a loa,
just what we need.

70
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:21,773
The black Madonna,
the beautiful mulattress

71
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,342
Whose earthly incarnation
was Marie laveau.

72
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:27,177
The voodoo queen
of New Orleans. Cool.

73
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:29,479
And the loa of lesbians
everyere.

74
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:31,914
Lesbians.
Very cool.

75
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:34,549
Uh, Coco,

76
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:36,684
Didn't you burn your
apartment down

77
00:03:36,752 --> 00:03:39,187
Some years ago-- candles,

78
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:40,788
Cafe Brazil?

79
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:42,789
Hopefully that ain't
gonna happen here.

80
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:45,325
Yeah.

81
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,494
- ( chicken clucking )
- whoa! Oh my God. What?

82
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,762
It's a chicken-- a chicken.
It's a live chicken.

83
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,465
Ladies and gentlemen,
a live chicken in the studio.

84
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,134
The loa needs proof
of our devotion.

85
00:03:57,202 --> 00:03:58,969
Yeah, what woman doesn't?

86
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,970
Ah, barbancourt.

Okay, that would be a knife.

89
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:10,544
It's a big one.

90
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:13,847
Are we entering some
sacrificial realm here?

91
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:15,916
Why don't you play
the next cut on that c.D.

92
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:18,050
As I summon the spirits?

93
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:20,953
Okay.

Yeah, and after hunt d.O.C.
Dispersed them. I know that.

All over the great
state of louisian'.

But how can I find him, andi?

That's what I'm asking.
Which parish?

148

Well, it'sot like the state exactly
kept track of who went where.

Didn't even really know
who is who.

stole 'em.

underwater...

00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:18,055
He's doing Katrina time
in East Jesus.

159
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,692
Most likely he'll be released for
time served once you find him.

160
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,728
<i>Family hasn't heard
from him?</i>

161
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,296
Still at the same number?

162
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:27,764
His mom is.

163
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:31,566
We found inmates incarcerated for
months not given a phone call.

164
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:34,733
That's disturbing.

165
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:37,102
( exhales )

166
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,104
Huh-uh. Huh-uh.

167
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:41,906
I'll start on it this week,
miss ladonna, guarantee.

168
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:43,907
I've been hearing that song.

169
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:45,776
You know what else
I've been hearing?

170
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:48,912
That goddamn blue plastic
tarp flapping around my roof.

171
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,179
I hear it in my sleep.

172
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:52,948
When are you gonna
get started for real?

173
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:54,984
I need me money for shingles.

174
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:57,418
Mister, I already gave you
money for shingles.

175
00:08:57,486 --> 00:09:00,587
I had to use that for
something else-- emergency.

176
00:09:00,655 --> 00:09:03,222
Somebody else's roof.

177
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,026
This here is an emergency too,
Mr. Riley, feel me?

178
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:08,194
My roof is the only roof
you need to worry about

179
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:11,130
Today, tomorrow
and the next day.

180
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:13,565
Yes, ma'am.

181
00:09:13,632 --> 00:09:15,066
Understood.

182
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:17,801
I'm going to Baton Rouge

183
00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:19,803
To see my kids and my husband.

184
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,905
I'm back tomorrow.
If that roof ain't right,

185
00:09:21,972 --> 00:09:23,907
I'm going courtside on y'all.

186
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:26,778
Shingles will be here.
I swear.

187
00:09:30,548 --> 00:09:33,449
I've seen worse.
What'd you get up in here--

188
00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:35,284
<i>A foot,
a foot and a half?</i>

189
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:37,619
Bad enough.
No insurance.

190
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:39,221
No insurance?

191
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:42,624
No flood insurance.
The bank said I didn't need it.

192
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:44,592
I'm on piers, me.

193
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,995
Never thought I'd get
water up in here.

194
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:48,530
Ain't like gentilly
where you're at.

195
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:50,799
Yeah, well.

196
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:54,100
You sure you want to
sheetrock over all this?

197
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,568
It gets wet--
you gotta gut it again.

198
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:59,105
In these old houses they
knew what they was doing--

199
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:01,375
Cypress, plaster.

200
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:03,744
Floods-- just air it out.

201
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,980
This plaster's not
in bad shape.

202
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:07,649
Look at it.
It's all cracked and shit.

203
00:10:07,716 --> 00:10:09,951
I can fix that for you.

204
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,620
- Expensive?
- You want it done right?

205
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:15,790
Let me think about it.

206
00:10:15,857 --> 00:10:18,292
I mean, what's the chances
it's gonna flood again?

207
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,562
What's the chances it won't?

208
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:22,363
Might be easier
just to sheetrock it.

209
00:10:22,431 --> 00:10:25,066
Easier-- yeah.
But you'll ruin the profile.

210
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:26,467
Ain't that what people do?

211
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:29,303
Tack sheetrock over
perfectly good plaster?

212
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:30,671
Sure.

213
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:32,908
People do a lot of dumb shit
'cause it's easier.

214
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:35,444
( sighs )

215
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:38,313
- Let me think about it, all right?
- All right.

216
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:40,982
Got errands to run next couple
of days on my lunch break.

217
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,419
- You gonna be here?
- Yeah, not a problem.

- Thanks a lot, guys.
- That was fantastic.

00:12:12,978 --> 00:12:14,412
Where are you from?

241
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,980
- Wisconsin.
- Woman: Yeah, Madison.

242
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:18,614
- Been here before?
- First time in New Orleans.

243
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:20,615
Woman #2:
For me too.

244
00:12:20,683 --> 00:12:23,017
Well, it's different, huh,
from Wisconsin?

245
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:25,252
- Oh, yeah, way different.
- Yeah, definitely.

246
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,354
We came down
with our church group.

247
00:12:27,422 --> 00:12:29,189
To, you know,
gut houses and stuff.

248
00:12:29,257 --> 00:12:30,724
God bless.

What y'all are doing
for New Orleans.

251
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:36,128
- We wanted to help save it.
- Totally, yeah.

252
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:37,896
Good luck with that.

253
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:41,566
We saw everything in the ns, what
was going on in the ninth ward.

<i>- I mean, it's just so awful.
- So heartbreaking.</i>

00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:46,737
Yeah yeah, everybody talking
about the lower ninth.

256
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:49,206
- Sonny.
- Let me ask you something.

257
00:12:49,273 --> 00:12:51,508
Have you even heard of the
ninth ward before the storm?

258
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:54,444
- Well... - So why are you
so fired up about it now?

259
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,482
Anybody have any requests?

260
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:03,084
What about, I don't know,
something authentic?

261
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:05,086
Something authentic.

262
00:13:05,154 --> 00:13:07,522
Real New Orleans music?

263
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:09,924
How about "when the
saints go marching in"?

264
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:12,059
- Oh, yeah, I love that song.
- Yeah, that's real, isn't it?

265
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:15,295
Yeah yeah, "saints" is real all right.
Aints" is as real as it gets.

266
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:18,064
The thing is, traditionally
"saints" is extra.

267
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,632
- How come?
- Well--

268
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,234
Because every cheesehead from
chowderland wants to hear "saints."

269
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,736
He's kidding.
We love to play "saints."

270
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,704
Ye, we do.
It's hip. It sends us.

271
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,539
You know, you don't even
have to play it.

272
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,541
We do.
You requested it.

273
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,544
Actually, you said "saints,"
not us.

The good doctor.

284
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:15,239
Yeah, a little voodoo dirge
to brighten up the day--

285
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:17,907
An homage to you and Coco.

286
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:19,775
That was historic, man.

287
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:21,776
Darnell thought so too,

288
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:24,311
But just not
in a positive sense.

289
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:26,979
- Right.
- I had to remind him it was radio

290
00:14:27,047 --> 00:14:29,648
And that you couldn't
actually see the blood spurt.

291
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:32,283
Yeah, best left
to the imagination.

292
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,284
I did what I could
with soap and water,

293
00:14:34,352 --> 00:14:36,352
But you might want
to paint over.

294
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,688
Oh, hell no, man. I say we leave it up
there for the sheer gris-gris of it.

295
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,455
Don't fuck with it.
That's bad juju.

296
00:14:41,523 --> 00:14:44,557
Darnell doesn't get it, man.
That was some deep New Orleans shit.

297
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,559
You can't plan
that kind of magic.

298
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:48,260

of theater.

00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:50,661

Yeah.

305

till he comes home.

00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:15,683
- You heard from him?
- Nah.

308
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,286
- Any idea where he at?
- My cousin says Oklahoma city.

309
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:22,056
Oklahoma cy? Man.

310
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,726
Yeah, right.

311
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:26,862
He'll be back, though, when he
gets tired eating that food.

( laughs )

313
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:33,368
Where I'm at.
You hear from him,

314
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:35,803
Tell him his chief
is looking for him.

315
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:39,441
Big chief lambeaux, huh?
I heard George talk about you.

316
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:41,444
How can I reach your cousin?

317
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:44,615
Robbie? Man, he's still working
on getting a phone, him.

318
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:47,253
Shit. Where he
staying at?

319
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,757
- The Calliope.
- The Calliope?

320
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:53,195
The Calliope closed.
All the projects closed.

321
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:56,265
Squatting. Man, Robbie
been squatting down there.

322
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,534
All right.

323
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,636
Peace, baby.

324
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,709
"in accordance with
university policy."

325
00:16:05,777 --> 00:16:09,013
I mean, look at this.
It's unbelievable.

326
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,382
Two departments, like that.

327
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:13,884
160 tenured professors.

328
00:16:13,952 --> 00:16:16,621
- How can they do that?
- How can they do that?

329
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:19,524
Well, they can and they have
and they did.

330
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:23,160
It is a done deal.

331
00:16:23,228 --> 00:16:26,130
Gone-- civil engineering,
computer engineering,

332
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:28,599
Electrical engineering,
mechanical engineering,

333
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:32,135
Computer science.
I mean, sure,

334
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:34,170
Why would the university
train people

335
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:37,740
Who know how to build
things like, oh, say,

336
00:16:37,807 --> 00:16:41,142
Computer systems,
power grids, levees?

337
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,144
Hey, who needs them?

338
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:46,180
- Seems kind of crazy.
- Gee, you think?

339
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:48,182
I mean, look what
they're keeping--

340
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,584
Musical theater, digital media,

341
00:16:50,652 --> 00:16:53,019
Medieval studies,
women's studies,

342
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:54,988
Jewish studies,
African studies.

343
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,323
It's all about identity.

344
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,025
Let's not learn how
to actually do anything.

345
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:01,993
Let's just sit and contemplate

346
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:04,428
The glory of me

347
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:07,230
In all my complexities.

348
00:17:07,265 --> 00:17:09,199
Who am I?

349
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:11,935
I am a black Jewish woman.
Hear me roar.

350
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:14,537
Jesus, what else?

351
00:17:14,605 --> 00:17:17,306
Russian-- can't get along
in the world without that.

352
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:20,742
Portuguese-- well, that
actually could come in handy

353
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,444
In case any brazilians come up
here looking for mardi gras work.

354
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:25,947
What about English?

355
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:27,782
We're useless.
We're safe.

356
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,750
I heard they might cut
the grad program.

357
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:31,751
Listen, if you have to
transfer somewhere

358
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:34,720
To finish your dissertation,
I'll keep working with you.

359
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,322
Fuck, I might even go with you.

360
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,424
The thought of teaching intro
lit to a bunch of freshmen

361
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,526
Who haven't read
anything more challenging

362
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:47,096
Than Harry fucking Potter
makes me want to puke.

363
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:49,899
Maybe I'll just Chuck
teaching altogether

364
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:52,602
- And finish my novel.
- The one about the flood?

365
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,305
The 1927 flood, right.

366
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:58,307
You know, what the hell?

367
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,809
I'm alrey 250 pages in.

368
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:05,114
Maybe it's time to tackle
that bad boy again.

369
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:08,285
( chuckles )

370
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:11,054
Couldn't be
more topical, right?

371
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:17,695
Davis, didn't we recently
float you a sizable sum?

372
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,399
Right after Thanksgiving.
$750.

373
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,866
Thank you, melba.

374
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:24,735
Thank you, melba.
$700.

375
00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:27,771
Pop owed me $50
from the l.S.U.-Alabama game.

376
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,307
Would you mind bringing in
the plants from the patio?

377
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,675
What for?

378
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,044
Radio says there's a hard
freeze warning tonight.

379
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,112
<i>That's for
the north shore, sugar.</i>

380
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,116
They'll be all right.
I'll cover 'em.

381
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:44,287
My situation became untenable.

382
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:47,123
Darling, what does that mean?

383
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:49,358
- ( doorbell jingles )
- Davis.

384
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:51,760
- Papa.
- Roger.

385
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:53,262
Davis needs a new job.

386
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:55,163
No, a loan.
I need a loan.

387
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,296
What happened
to w.W.O.Z.?

388
00:18:57,364 --> 00:18:58,796
I'm moving on.

389
00:18:58,863 --> 00:19:00,663
Well, maybe you can
find something

390
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,298
That pays an actual salary.

391
00:19:02,365 --> 00:19:03,899
They paid me.

392
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:06,734
Senior staff.
Fundraising expertise.

393
00:19:06,802 --> 00:19:09,335
Plus, you forget--
I have my gigs.

394
00:19:09,403 --> 00:19:11,704
Everyone's looking
for good help.

395
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:14,368
That's true.
The city is desperate, darling.

396
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:16,868
One of my patients
mentioned something--

397
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:19,134
A hotel in the quarter.

398
00:19:19,202 --> 00:19:21,403
What about the loan?

399
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,671
Contingent upon.

400
00:19:26,242 --> 00:19:28,476
All right.

401
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,478
We got bills to pay.

402
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:32,314
I'm trying, baby.

403
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,282
What can I say, desiree?
I got a job.

404
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,417
Difference between a gig
and a job, Antoine.

405
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:38,418
You gotta get a job.

406
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:40,853
I got a job.
I'm with kermit.

407
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:43,655
That's a gig once a week
and it don't pay enough.

408
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:46,358
And you come home smelling
like cigarettes and pussy.

409
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:50,295
Now see, that ain't true.
That ain't pussy.

410
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:51,796
Well, what is it
if it ain't pussy?

411
00:19:51,864 --> 00:19:53,998
Barbecue.

412
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:56,000
Barbecue?

413
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:57,569
Yeah, kermit's barbecue.

414
00:19:57,636 --> 00:20:00,905
Kermit's barbecue tastes right,
but not that right.

415
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:03,775
Some people swear by it.

416
00:20:03,843 --> 00:20:05,277
<i>Where are you going?</i>

417
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:08,147
I got a gig, all right?
A gig, not a job,

418
00:20:08,215 --> 00:20:10,216
In algiers.
Don't wait up.

419
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:12,052
A gig in algiers?

420
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:14,321
<i>Algiers, all the way
to the West bank.</i>

421
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:18,558

mighty rivers and shit.

422
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:21,195
<i>Get a job job,
God damn it.</i>

423
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,831
<i>- Woman: Tyrell!
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

424

<i>Get your ass
in this house!</i>

425
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:28,903
Toni's working
with these lawyers.

426
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:31,470
They're checking
all the parishes.

427
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:35,172
Alcide, elbows.

428
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,573
You tell your mama?

429
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:39,574
Huh-uh.

430
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:42,242
I don't want to get her hopes
up, not till we know for sure.

431
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,576
- What?
- Where your Uncle David at.

432
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,443
How's the roof?

433
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,511
The contractor'll say for sure
when I get back tomorrow.

434
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:51,880
You're leaving tomorrow?

435
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:53,581
Don't do that, alcide.

436
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:55,783
Don't sulk.
I'll be back next week.

437
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:58,052
<i>I have to check on nanan,
take care of the bar.</i>

438
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:01,922
You know, your mother
could move up here,

439
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:04,691
Be close to the kids.

440
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:08,127
She should move up here.
There's no doctors,

441
00:21:08,194 --> 00:21:10,128
There's no hospitals there.

442
00:21:10,196 --> 00:21:13,197
New Orleans is no place
to be old, not now.

443
00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:16,467
You know why she can't
move up here right now.

444
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:18,502
Besides, it's her home.

445
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,303
She's never been anyplace else.

446
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:22,205
Not even Baton Rouge?

447
00:21:22,273 --> 00:21:25,107
No, baby, not even Baton Rouge.

448
00:21:25,175 --> 00:21:28,576
<i>( radio chatter )</i>

We should talk about putting

<i>Once the roof's fixed.</i>

452
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:40,119
People are looking for houses
to live in right now, not bars.

453
00:21:40,187 --> 00:21:42,822
People always need a drink,

454
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,790
Now more than ever.

455
00:21:44,858 --> 00:21:46,925
Gigi's got a loyal clientele.

456
00:21:46,993 --> 00:21:48,526
Who is gigi anyway?

457
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:50,194
Nobody knows, darling.

458
00:21:50,262 --> 00:21:52,262
That's just the name
it came with.

459
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,230
Been gigi's for as long
as anybody can remember.

460
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:59,634
I grew up in that bar.

461
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:01,602
Daddy left it to me.

00:22:50,138 --> 00:22:53,306
Your sister and I parted
on fractious terms.

476
00:22:53,374 --> 00:22:55,176
<i>She's gonna be more mad
at me than you.</i>

477
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:58,249
I talked to her today.
She's thinking I come all the way down here

478
00:22:58,317 --> 00:22:59,918
To rustle you back to Houston.

479
00:22:59,985 --> 00:23:01,986
You could tell her
I tried harder than I did.

480
00:23:02,053 --> 00:23:04,188
Let me call you out
for stubborn.

481
00:23:04,256 --> 00:23:05,690
( chuckles )

482
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:08,761
Come on, daddy.
You know she wants to see you.

483
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:10,664
<i>Cheri's coming in
from Atlanta with the kids.</i>

484
00:23:10,732 --> 00:23:11,867
And you?

485
00:23:11,935 --> 00:23:14,306
I got gigs.

486
00:23:14,374 --> 00:23:16,579
But I'll definitely be there
Christmas day.

487
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:18,582
In and out like always.

488
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,385
Never could stand to be
around us for too long.

489
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:23,721
Oh, man, come on.
It ain't like that.

490
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:27,659
In fact, I'm gonna stay around
a couple more days.

491
00:23:27,727 --> 00:23:29,494
Got a recording session--

492
00:23:29,562 --> 00:23:31,797
Toussaint.

493
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,936
Toussaint, huh?

494
00:23:36,003 --> 00:23:38,072
You deigning to play local?

495
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,874
Yeah, I'm deigning.

496
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:42,710
You don't think I can play straight-up
New Orleans R&B in my sleep?

497
00:23:42,778 --> 00:23:45,679
( laughs ) but can you swing?

498
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:49,280
Not all you modern jazz cats
can, you know.

499
00:23:49,347 --> 00:23:51,280
You sound like wynton.

500
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,282
I hope so.

501
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,550
So what about Sunday--

502
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:57,385
Indian practice.
You find anybody?

503
00:23:57,452 --> 00:23:59,519
I'm working on it.

504
00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:02,254
Some up in Baton Rouge,
some over in Houston,

505
00:24:02,322 --> 00:24:03,788
Some I don't know where yet.

506
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:07,056
I wish I could stay, daddy.

507
00:24:07,124 --> 00:24:10,992
<i>Got a full plate
up in New York.</i>

508
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:13,794
Lincoln center.

509
00:24:13,862 --> 00:24:16,396
A lot of love for New Orleans
right now.

510
00:24:16,463 --> 00:24:18,831
Mm, I know.

511
00:24:18,898 --> 00:24:21,899
Everybody loves
New Orleans music.

512
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:25,567
New Orleans people...

513
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:32,073
Round the damn clock.

514
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:34,142
Requisitioned a boat
from one of my neighbors.

515
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,911
I hear that.

516
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:38,748
10 days straight.
It was heavy.

517
00:24:38,816 --> 00:24:41,785
I seen stuff
would curl your hair.

518
00:24:41,853 --> 00:24:44,056
Shit, I was in anbar, baby.

519
00:24:44,124 --> 00:24:45,659
You're not curling his hair.

520
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:47,628
I'm sure it don't compare.

521
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,896
How many you rescue, all told?

522
00:24:49,964 --> 00:24:52,332
A couple dozen maybe,

523
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,236
Plucking them off rooftops,
out of the trees.

524
00:24:56,304 --> 00:24:59,005
I thought they made
everyone leave after a week--

525
00:24:59,073 --> 00:25:00,574
Mandatory evac.

526
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:03,275
We said, "fuck that."

527
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,244
Grabbed all the bottled water
and beer we could find,

528
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:09,813
- Borrowed a generator.
- You were digging it, eh?

529
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,315
National guard patrols would
through after curfew--

530
00:25:12,382 --> 00:25:14,583
Annie would go out
and flash 'em.

531
00:25:14,651 --> 00:25:17,353
- Really? - Yeah, like it
was mardi gras come early.

532
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,988
And they'd drive away
happy, man.

533
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:21,490
Yeah, I hear that too.

534
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:22,658
No rules.

535
00:25:22,725 --> 00:25:25,360
Just making it up
as we went along.

536
00:25:25,428 --> 00:25:27,395
We'd go out,
do what had to be done,

537
00:25:27,463 --> 00:25:29,063
Man up, you know?

538
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:31,065
I do.

539
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:33,535
I bet you two
had a lot of sex, eh?

540
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:35,536
( chuckles )

541
00:25:35,604 --> 00:25:37,971
Yeah, it was paradise, man,

542
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,973
The garden of fucking eden.

543
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,974
( belches ) excuse me.

544
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,409
Gotta go see a man
about a horse.

545
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:57,387
Did he really do all that
hero shit during the storm?

546
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,023
He says he did.

547
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,825
You believe him?

548
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,527
I wasn't in the boat.

549
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:09,666
<i>Man: Welcome to the spotted cat.

No, Bobby's back next week.

562
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:08,265
I heard about something
on bourbon street.

563
00:27:08,332 --> 00:27:09,499
Bourbon street?

564
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:11,500
There's pride
on bourbon street--

565
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:13,401
Pete, al, Gary brown.

566
00:27:13,469 --> 00:27:14,902
Back in the day.

567
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,303
There's cats there now
that can hold their heads up.

568
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:18,571
Let me get that number.

569
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,639
All right.

570
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,842
Hey!

571
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,077
Antoine batiste.

572
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,945
Maestro, I didn't see you.

573
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:30,812
Slipped in at the end
of the last set.

574
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,113
What you doing over here?

575
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,781
Living with my daughter--
lost her roof.

576
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:38,351
We all in a fema trailer
parked in her driveway.

577
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:40,353
What about your house?

578
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,787
Like I tell folks,

579
00:27:41,855 --> 00:27:45,424
I had a foot and a half
of water-- on my second floor.

580
00:27:45,492 --> 00:27:48,228
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.

581
00:27:48,296 --> 00:27:51,966
Man, I used to dread going over
to your house after school.

582
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:53,968
I was that hard on you?

583
00:27:54,036 --> 00:27:56,704
No, it was those two buses
going to bayou Saint John--

584
00:27:56,771 --> 00:27:58,973
Fighting them white kids
on esplanade going,

585
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:01,208
Seventh ward kids coming home.
You were easy.

586
00:28:01,276 --> 00:28:02,943
My best student.

587
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:05,480
No I wasn't.
Freddie lonzo was.

588
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:06,715
Yeah, you're right.

589
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:09,652
All right.
You playing?

590
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,487
Don't even have a horn, me.

591
00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:14,357
You lost all your instruments?

592
00:28:14,424 --> 00:28:16,259
Even the 'bone
that kid ory gave you?

593
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,828
Should have put all that stuff
on the second floor,

594
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:20,798
But I didn't.

595
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,134
Oh, man.

596
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,304
That's tragic, really.

597
00:28:27,674 --> 00:28:31,411
- One of the good gigs, huh?
- That's what I hear.

598
00:28:31,478 --> 00:28:34,046
Bourbon street.

599
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:35,714
Nothing to be ashamed of.

600
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:38,048
Pride on bourbon street.

601
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:41,317
Yeah, that's what they say.

602
00:28:43,786 --> 00:28:45,486
<i>Lambreaux:
His cousin says</i>

603
00:28:45,554 --> 00:28:47,822
He's been squatting here
in the Calliope.

604
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,390
We had squatters.
Run them off.

605
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,358
Ain't cheap, all this security.

606
00:28:52,425 --> 00:28:55,226
Spend all this money
just to seal these up?

607
00:28:55,294 --> 00:28:56,794
I know.

608
00:28:56,829 --> 00:28:59,129
People want to come home,
no place to liv

609
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,863
You know they've been wanting

610
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:02,865
To tear the project down
for years.

611
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,934
Yeah, but now when
there's a crying need...

612
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:07,170
Calliope didn't take
much water.

613
00:29:07,237 --> 00:29:08,838
Most of 'em didn't take none.

614
00:29:08,906 --> 00:29:12,942
Stood up to the wind just fine.

615
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:15,778
You know when these houses
were built? 40s.

616
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:19,080
They've been through
some hurricanes.

617
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:20,782
It makes no sense.

618
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:22,383
Nope.

619
00:29:22,451 --> 00:29:26,086
Yeah, what does these days?

620
00:29:26,154 --> 00:29:28,789
<i>- ( baby cooing )

00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:43,894
( chuckles )

637
00:30:43,962 --> 00:30:48,566
I'll tell your sons
they have a new half-sister,

638
00:30:48,633 --> 00:30:51,368
Another one.

639
00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:57,441
Never came up?

640
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:58,642
Come on now, baby.

641
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,247
Don't you "baby" me.

642
00:31:00,314 --> 00:31:02,286
And what does she mean
by "another one"?

643
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:05,322
You know...

644
00:31:10,128 --> 00:31:13,764
So pretty straightforward.
Any questions about the system,

645
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:17,102
Check in, check out,
credit cards, parking?

646
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:19,104
No, like you say,
straightforward.

647
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:21,673
And if guests need dinner
reservations or anything,

648
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:23,675
Just refer them
to the concierge.

649
00:31:23,743 --> 00:31:25,644
Concierge?

650
00:31:25,712 --> 00:31:27,747
Got it.

651
00:31:43,856 --> 00:31:45,890
( sighs )

652
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:57,666
Oh, huh-uh.

653
00:31:57,734 --> 00:32:00,169
I'ma kill that man twice.

654
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:02,170
( door slams )

655
00:32:02,238 --> 00:32:04,172
You seen that
son of a bitch Riley?

656
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,174
Nope.

657
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:09,176
I'ma book his ass.
He been here at all?

658
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:11,245
Nope.

659
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:15,782
Toni, what are you doing here?

660
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,316
We found him, ladonna.

661
00:32:17,384 --> 00:32:18,484
What?

662
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:21,720
David. Daymo.
We know where he is.

663
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:35,470
Where you been?

664
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:37,239
I had to step out.
What's the problem?

665
00:32:37,307 --> 00:32:39,876
Where are my tools?

666
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:43,747
I wasn't gone but 10 minutes.

667
00:32:48,453 --> 00:32:50,722
We still don't know why he was
picked up in the first place?

668
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:52,724
Sheriff won't put me
on a phone list

669
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:55,194
Till there's paperwork
saying I'm David's attorney.

670
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:57,030
How long will that take?

671
00:32:57,097 --> 00:32:59,032
It could take a few days.

672
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,400
Then what?

673
00:33:00,468 --> 00:33:03,136
Well, we gotta get daymo
in front of a judge.

674
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:05,706
We drive up there,
post bond, pay a fine

675
00:33:05,774 --> 00:33:09,610
And assuming they're not holding
him on anything serious...

676
00:33:09,678 --> 00:33:12,147
- They'll let him go?
- Yeah.

677
00:33:12,215 --> 00:33:14,683
It might take a few days.

678
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:16,318
Why?

679
00:33:16,386 --> 00:33:18,587
The parishes get fema money

680
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:20,589
For every o.P.P. Prisoner
they house.

681
00:33:20,657 --> 00:33:22,591
And some of them tend
to drag their feet,

682
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:24,994
Especially the poor ones.

683
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:27,997
I swear.

684
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:31,066
I could front you.

685
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,430
I could ask my son,
come to that.

686
00:33:34,498 --> 00:33:36,229
Ain't the point, eh?

687
00:33:36,297 --> 00:33:39,529
I can get new tools.

688
00:33:39,597 --> 00:33:42,328
I let somebody punk me.

689
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:46,195
I'll ask around.

690
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:58,338
And the elevators are
just across the lobby.

691
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:04,077
I need to step out
for a few minutes.

692
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:06,979
If anybody needs to find anything
on bourbon street, tell them.

693
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:09,182
If they need reservations
or directions anywhere else,

694
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:10,950
Even the quarter,
I'll be right back.

695
00:34:11,017 --> 00:34:12,451
Okay.

696
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:16,188
<i>( men chattering )</i>

697
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:19,257
Hey, which way to bourbon
street, little buddy?

698
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:23,995
Just--

699
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:27,031
Okay, exit the front door...

700
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,099
That's why they call it
the inn on bourbon.

701
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,231
( laughing )

702
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:37,668
Watch ere you step.

703
00:34:37,736 --> 00:34:40,303
We always do.

704
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,273
( quietly ) what the fuck?

705
00:35:04,057 --> 00:35:08,260
- Oh, trombone shorty, my man.
- Antoine batiste.

706
00:35:08,327 --> 00:35:11,763
Hey, do you think the hall
ever coming back?

707
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,097
Man, I don't know.

708
00:35:13,165 --> 00:35:14,932
Thanks for
that second line, bro.

709
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:16,432
Not a problem, man.

710
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,167
Listen, if you ever need
me to fill in for you...

711
00:35:19,234 --> 00:35:22,035
My first call.
You got a gig?

712
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:24,503
Oh, nah nah.

713
00:35:24,571 --> 00:35:26,738
No shame. There's pride
on bourbon street.

714
00:35:26,806 --> 00:35:28,806
No, I'm just cutting
through the quarter,

715
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:30,507
Gonna go han with kermit.

716
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:31,975
I thought kermit had
a gig tonight.

717
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:33,976
Oh, yeah, you're right.

718
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:35,946
But, you know, I'm gonna
catch him before he goes.

719
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:37,685
Uh-huh.

720
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:39,990
- See you, shorty.
- Be good, Antoine.

721
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:42,092
- See you, bro.
- Nice to see you.

Joe foxx, that piece,

726
00:36:24,664 --> 00:36:26,998
That moment that you and Sam
just played--

727
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:28,866
Don't play that.

728
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:30,834
( laughter )

729
00:36:30,902 --> 00:36:33,036
At that spot we need
amadee and breeze

730
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:35,038
To really shine on the reeds,

731
00:36:35,106 --> 00:36:36,339
So you have to be
out of the way.

732
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:39,107
So let's do it again.

- Mm-hmm, yeah.

749
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,145
Maybe you can recommend someplace
where we can hear music?

750
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:32,116
We heard snug harbor.

751

Snug's good. There's
nothing wrong with snug.

Yeah, sure.

- Don't we?
- Absolutely.

756
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:45,512
I could tell.

"here are some intrepid
young folk

is it safe?

762
00:37:55,557 --> 00:37:57,524
Never safer.
All the crime's gone to houst.

763
00:37:57,592 --> 00:38:00,126
Give that to the cab driver.
If he says anything,

764
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,128
You tell him that you're sure.

That's a funk group like the
meters, right, but white guys?

769
00:38:23,482 --> 00:38:26,083
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

770
00:38:26,151 --> 00:38:28,619
It'seen a long day, Sam.
I don't know.

this guy that New Orleans

What else you need
to hear, son?

776

Well, I guess I could go
and get gussied up

777
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,538
And put on a shirt
that doesn't stink

778
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:45,139
And maybe I can
shoot down there later.

<i>Sit in, man,
come on.</i>

796
00:40:17,393 --> 00:40:21,995
Put your hands together.
Get him up here.

797
00:40:22,063 --> 00:40:25,164
<i>Yeah, I got you.
What's happening?</i>

798
00:40:25,232 --> 00:40:29,336
<i>Young man, get up here.
What's up?</i>

799
00:40:29,404 --> 00:40:32,172
- Blackbird special?
- Right behind you.

800
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,342
- Safety meeting after the set?
- Desitively.

801
00:41:53,565 --> 00:41:56,366
I had no idea.

802
00:41:56,434 --> 00:41:58,901
Sorry, chief.

803
00:41:58,969 --> 00:42:01,904
Like you didn't know.

804
00:42:01,972 --> 00:42:03,604
More than $1000
invested in there.

805
00:42:03,672 --> 00:42:05,570
Some of them tools
you can't buy for money.

806
00:42:05,637 --> 00:42:09,070
They don't make 'em anymore.

807
00:42:09,138 --> 00:42:12,606
I just want my $250 back.

808
00:42:12,673 --> 00:42:15,741
I don't owe it to you.
The man you bought it from does.

809
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:19,612
I see him-- I'll be sure
to mention it.

810

<i>( distant dog barking )</i>

Where he stay at?

813
00:42:26,218 --> 00:42:27,418
Gert town.

814
00:42:27,485 --> 00:42:29,385
He around the town
most nights though.

815
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:31,387
Where?

816
00:42:31,455 --> 00:42:34,123
Mid-city, lower garden,
muses.

817
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,458
Copper mining.

818

Mm, this is
the seventh ward, see.

820
00:42:49,338 --> 00:42:51,106
Saint aug's
right up the street.

821
00:42:51,173 --> 00:42:53,876
- Saint aug?
- Saint augustine high sool.

822
00:42:53,943 --> 00:42:56,079
Greatest damn marching band
in the land.

823
00:42:56,147 --> 00:42:58,582
I'm sixth ward, me,
across esplanade.

824
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,351
Why is it called bullet's?

825
00:43:00,418 --> 00:43:02,287
See the proprietor over there?

826
00:43:02,354 --> 00:43:04,288
<i>The guy with
the leather jacket</i>

827

<i>And that thingy
around his neck?</i>

828
00:43:06,524 --> 00:43:09,826
The chicken foot?
No, the dude next to him

829
00:43:09,894 --> 00:43:11,829
- With the baseball cap.
- Oh, yeah.

830
00:43:11,896 --> 00:43:14,199
- He got shot in the head.
- Really?

831
00:43:14,267 --> 00:43:16,535
Yeah, he walked into a store
to buy some cigarettes

832
00:43:16,602 --> 00:43:18,537
Just when it was
being robbed, straight up.

833
00:43:18,604 --> 00:43:20,572
And that's why they
call it bullet's?

834
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,075
Huh-uh, no,
it's called bullet's

835
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,910
'cause after he got shot

836
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,478
The doctors left
the bullet in there.

837
00:43:26,546 --> 00:43:28,514
They didn't want
to take it out.

838
00:43:28,582 --> 00:43:30,115
But he could feel it.

839
00:43:30,183 --> 00:43:32,551
Turned his head to the right,
the bullet slid left.

840
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:34,787
Turned his head to the left,
bullet slid right.

841
00:43:34,854 --> 00:43:37,122
It was driving him crazy,
so he tried to take it out

842
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,525
On his own self
with a straight razor.

843
00:43:39,592 --> 00:43:41,527
- No way.
- No.

844
00:43:41,595 --> 00:43:44,497
Yeah, so once he's done that,

845
00:43:44,565 --> 00:43:46,098
His mother said,
"you're crazy,"

846
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:49,635
Made him go back to the doctor
and get it taken out,

847
00:43:49,702 --> 00:43:51,703
You know, properly.

848
00:43:53,472 --> 00:43:54,972
That's a true story.

849
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,941
You could ask him
if you don't believe me.

850

937
00:47:47,486 --> 00:47:50,321
I had to fix the exhaust system

938
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:53,123
And the roof just to reopen--
that was 50 grand--

939
00:47:53,191 --> 00:47:55,959
Plus the new walk-in--
that was another 20.

940
00:47:56,027 --> 00:47:57,494
You told me you had
insurance for all that.

941
00:47:57,561 --> 00:47:59,796
Insurance hasn't

I'm still waiting
on my s.B.A. Loan.

943
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:04,667
I had to use
the contingency fund.

944
00:48:04,735 --> 00:48:06,702
That's what it's for, right?

945
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:09,205
Thank God.
But now I'm behind.

946
00:48:09,273 --> 00:48:12,175
If I can just--
if I can just hang on

947
00:48:12,242 --> 00:48:14,543
Until I can get staffed up,
be open full-time,

948
00:48:14,611 --> 00:48:17,313
I can catch up a little,
pay my bills.

949
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,581
I meanwe're jammed evernight.

950
00:48:19,649 --> 00:48:23,619

951
00:48:23,686 --> 00:48:25,688
What do you need?

952
00:48:25,755 --> 00:48:28,056
20,

953
00:48:28,124 --> 00:48:31,493
25.

954
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,495
Once the insurance
comes through,

955
00:48:33,563 --> 00:48:35,498
I can pay you back.

956
00:48:35,566 --> 00:48:37,601
I know money's tight.

957
00:48:39,704 --> 00:48:41,805
We can do five.

958
00:48:46,075 --> 00:48:48,243
Or six.

959
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:50,645
Okay, that's good.

960
00:48:50,713 --> 00:48:54,115
That'll help.
I'll find the rest somewhere.

961
00:49:02,156 --> 00:49:04,124
A roach.

962
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,559
I mean, give me a ticket.
But throw me in jail?

963
00:49:06,627 --> 00:49:08,561
Yeah, well, he had no choice.

964
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:10,396
You were up in his face.

965
00:49:10,464 --> 00:49:12,265
What is he supposed to do,
ignore it?

966
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:15,735
Thanks for dropping the car.

967
00:49:15,802 --> 00:49:19,538
It's okay.
I'll take a taxi home.

968
00:49:19,606 --> 00:49:21,974
I'm gonna pay you back,
you know.

969
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,476
For going the bond.

970
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:27,178
I'm sorry I can't
stay for practice.

971
00:49:27,246 --> 00:49:30,014
You ain't never really
cared for it.

972
00:49:30,081 --> 00:49:31,849
That ain't true.

973
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:33,884
I love growing up
with the tradition,

974
00:49:33,952 --> 00:49:37,053
But the indians--
that's your thing,

975
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:39,055
Always was.

976
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:46,295
This city...

977
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:56,973
It's like they breed.

978
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:58,975
Buckhead beef,
Louisiana seafood,

979
00:49:59,043 --> 00:50:01,777
Captain dino-- have to
pay the shrimper, right?

980
00:50:01,845 --> 00:50:03,580
<i>Triage.
Comprends?</i>

981
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:07,619
<i>Oui. Triage--
c'est français.</i>

982
00:50:09,056 --> 00:50:11,424
Cusimano produce,
brown's dairy,

983
00:50:11,492 --> 00:50:12,859
T.L.C. Linens.

984
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,396
Ask them, can we go another 30?

985
00:50:15,464 --> 00:50:17,399
If they say no?

986
00:50:17,466 --> 00:50:19,068
Take whatever they can give us.

987
00:50:19,136 --> 00:50:21,005
If they still say no?

988
00:50:21,073 --> 00:50:24,877
Pay cusimano, buy dairy
at the farmer's market,

989
00:50:24,945 --> 00:50:27,514
And we'll start washing
our own tablecloths.

990
00:50:42,941 --> 00:50:45,411
- You don't want to do that.
- The fuck?

991
00:50:45,478 --> 00:50:48,818
How long you been
standing there?

992
00:50:48,886 --> 00:50:50,191
People just put that in.

993
00:50:50,258 --> 00:50:52,961
Oh, is this your house, man?

994
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:55,367
I'm sorry.
I didn't know, man.

995
00:50:55,434 --> 00:50:58,173
I can build a house
from scratch,

996
00:50:58,241 --> 00:51:00,911
Roof to foundation.
What can you do,

997
00:51:00,979 --> 00:51:02,515
Tear it down?

998
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:04,552
That's easy.

999
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,522
Okay, pops, I'm gone, man.

1000
00:51:06,589 --> 00:51:09,627
- You took my tools.
- I didn't take no tools.

1001
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,062
You did.

1002
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,198
You just didn't know
who you were taking 'em from.

1003
00:51:13,265 --> 00:51:15,867
Okay, you somebody.
Good for you.

1004
00:51:15,935 --> 00:51:17,569
But I didn't take no tools.

1005
00:51:17,636 --> 00:51:21,672
You need to understand
what I'm telling you.

1006
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,841
Fuck you, old man.

1007
00:51:23,909 --> 00:51:26,410
Fuck that.

1008
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:29,747
Motherfucker.

1009
00:51:40,294 --> 00:51:42,295
<i>( wrench clangs )</i>

1010

<i>( tower bells ringing )</i>

1011
00:52:35,681 --> 00:52:38,116
Hey, it's the hotel guy.

1012
00:52:38,183 --> 00:52:40,718
How are you?

1013
00:52:40,786 --> 00:52:43,220
Good.

1014
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:46,489
- ( all laugh )
- you guys okay?

1015
00:52:46,556 --> 00:52:48,490
- The time of our lives.
- Oh, yeah.

1016
00:52:48,557 --> 00:52:50,024
We met the most
interesting man.

1017
00:52:50,091 --> 00:52:52,025
Oh my God, a tall guy.
He had this, like,

1018
00:52:52,092 --> 00:52:54,392
Gold tooth with, like,
a Ruby thing on it.

1019
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,160
- Elmore?
- Yeah, elmore.

1020
00:52:57,228 --> 00:52:58,427
Oh my God.

1021
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:02,295
He showed us the best time.

1022
00:53:02,363 --> 00:53:04,262
The real New Orleans.

1023
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:07,131
Great.
Okay, great.

1024
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,566
Did you guys check in
with anyone?

1025
00:53:11,802 --> 00:53:15,404
You might want to call
the hotel.

1026
00:53:15,472 --> 00:53:16,739
They're a little concerned.

1027
00:53:16,806 --> 00:53:19,107
We need to get
some breakfast first.

1028
00:53:19,175 --> 00:53:21,143
- We're a little hung-over.
- Okay.

1029
00:53:21,211 --> 00:53:24,613
Clover grill,
bourbon and dumaine.

1030
00:53:24,681 --> 00:53:26,582
Thanks.
Thanks again, man.

1031
00:53:26,649 --> 00:53:28,717
Sure.
Whoo!

1032
00:53:28,785 --> 00:53:31,487
Whoo!

1033
00:53:31,555 --> 00:53:33,522
Whoo!

1034
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:35,491
<i>Oh my gosh,
I'm so hungry.</i>

1035
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:37,493
<i>I'm like starving.</i>

1036
00:53:37,561 --> 00:53:40,629
Now where the fuck
am I gonna eat breakfast?

1037
00:53:40,697 --> 00:53:43,665
<i>( quiet jazz playing
on radio )</i>

1038
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,574
I'm going.

1039
00:53:52,642 --> 00:53:54,376
Okay.
Sofia ready?

1040
00:53:54,444 --> 00:53:56,044
Can't you hear her pouting?

1041
00:53:56,112 --> 00:53:58,246
( laughs )
now that you mention it.

1042
00:53:58,314 --> 00:54:00,815
You're working on the novel?

1043
00:54:00,883 --> 00:54:02,483
Thinking about it.

1044
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,484
Timely.

1045
00:54:04,552 --> 00:54:06,486
Which worries me.

1046
00:54:06,554 --> 00:54:08,888
I don't want to be accused
of cashing in on the storm

1047
00:54:08,956 --> 00:54:10,589
Like some other schmucks
I could mention.

1048
00:54:10,657 --> 00:54:11,724
You were there first.

1049
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:13,359
Did you get your haircut?

1050
00:54:13,426 --> 00:54:15,761
Last week.

1051
00:54:15,828 --> 00:54:18,096
Looks good.

1052
00:54:18,164 --> 00:54:20,699
- Drive carefully.
- You too.

1053
00:54:20,767 --> 00:54:22,701
<i>- I'll see you tonight.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

1054
00:54:22,769 --> 00:54:26,571
<i>( door opens and closes )</i>

1055
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:29,006
Ready?

1056
00:54:29,073 --> 00:54:31,004
Come on, let's go.

1057
00:54:31,072 --> 00:54:33,240
I need to get back home
at a reasonable hour.

1058
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:35,074
I hate boarding school.

1059
00:54:35,142 --> 00:54:37,677
( sighs )

1060
00:54:37,745 --> 00:54:40,012
Another week or so--
you're home for the holidays

1061
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,748
And you're back to stay.
It's a sea cruise, honey.

1062
00:54:43,816 --> 00:54:45,749
Where am I gonna go to school?

1063
00:54:45,817 --> 00:54:48,952
Tulane's working on something
for faculty kids-- lusher.

1064
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,987
Lusher's not a High School,
daddy.

1065
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:53,823
They're adding a High School.

1066
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,591
Plus, it's public.

1067
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,592
Not anymore.
It's charter.

1068
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,594
Where are they gonna
put the High School?

1069
00:54:59,662 --> 00:55:02,029
They're taking over fortier.

1070
00:55:02,097 --> 00:55:04,865
What about the fortier kids?

1071
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:07,700
<i>- Where are they gonna go?
- Somewhere else, I guess.</i>

1072
00:55:07,768 --> 00:55:09,135
That's not fair.

1073
00:55:09,202 --> 00:55:11,136
Probably not.

1074
00:55:11,204 --> 00:55:13,138
It's where we're at now.

1075
00:55:13,205 --> 00:55:15,106
Do you want to go to school
in New Orleans?

1076
00:55:17,209 --> 00:55:19,376
<i>So this is how it works.
It's a zero sum world.</i>

1077
00:55:19,444 --> 00:55:21,945
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

1078
00:55:22,013 --> 00:55:23,313
Come on, honey.

1079
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,735
This is not my son.

1080
00:55:50,802 --> 00:55:53,604
- Ma'am?
- There's been a mistake.

1081
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:56,906
- David Brooks.
- No, it's not.

1082
00:55:56,974 --> 00:55:59,008
Tell them your name.

1083
00:55:59,076 --> 00:56:02,010
Like he say, Dave Brooks.

1084
00:56:02,078 --> 00:56:05,480
Not my David.
Not my boy.

1085
00:56:07,383 --> 00:56:09,751
Where's your brother?

1086
00:56:11,421 --> 00:56:13,155
I don't know.

1087
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,529
( plucking strings )

1088
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:28,972
I heard you was looking for me.

00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:31,974
George cotrell.

1090
00:56:32,042 --> 00:56:34,343
Hey hey hey.

1091
00:56:34,411 --> 00:56:36,445
You back?

1092
00:56:38,915 --> 00:56:40,349
Where you staying?

1093
00:56:40,417 --> 00:56:42,718
With you, I guess.

1094
00:56:42,786 --> 00:56:44,720
- You called practice, right?
- Mm-hmm.

1095
00:56:44,788 --> 00:56:46,723
This it?
Just us?

1096
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:49,159
For now.
Most of 'em still gone.

1097
00:56:49,227 --> 00:56:51,329
I spoke to everybody
except Jesse.

1098
00:56:51,396 --> 00:56:52,897
You go by his place?

1099
00:56:52,965 --> 00:56:56,102
Lower ninth still closed.
Open in a couple of weeks maybe.

1100
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:58,239

00:39:30,837 --> 00:39:33,354
Okay, but I have to break
some bad news first.

808
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,540
- [KARA] Russell got away.
- [SIGHS]

809
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:38,209
The same operative
that attacked yesterday

810
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:40,928
came again, they worked
as a team and now he's gone.

811
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,547
I'm so sorry.

812
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:45,883
I was wrong about him all along.

813
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:48,252
No, I don't think you were.

814
00:39:48,254 --> 00:39:51,622
Supergirl told us he's been
working against his will.

815
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:53,674
I don't think he ever
meant to betray you.

816
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:58,329
[ANDREA] I'm sorry,
if it weren't for me,

817
00:39:58,331 --> 00:40:00,347
they never would've come for you.

818
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,336
You saved my life.

819
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:07,521
Even before that,
you made it worth living.

820
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,508
[GUNSHOT]

821
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,744
No. Russ, no, no, Russ.

822
00:40:13,746 --> 00:40:16,413
No, no, no!

823
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:18,015
Somebody help, please.

824
00:40:18,017 --> 00:40:20,000
Russ! Please, somebody help!

825
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,920
You can't escape us,

826
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:26,557
nor the powers we bestowed upon you.

827
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:28,926
I don't even have
the medallion anymore.

828
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,127
What do you want?

829
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:32,563
The powers never came
from the medallion.

830
00:40:32,565 --> 00:40:34,098
It activated them.

831
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,217
But they came from the
darkness within you.

832
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,704
And that is something
you can never escape.

833
00:40:40,706 --> 00:40:42,089
No...

834
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,092
[SOBBING] No.

835
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,381
Not so fast, Lena, I'm gonna get you.

836
00:40:50,383 --> 00:40:52,750
I got you.

837
00:40:52,752 --> 00:40:54,368
[LAUGHING]

838
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:58,789
[BOTH LAUGHING]

839
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:02,426
Oh, no, no. [LAUGHS]

840
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:03,911
I found it, Mother.

841
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:11,151
End simulation.

842
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:16,640
Ms. Luthor, preliminary tests
confirm any properties

843
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:19,243
the medallion may have had are gone.

844
00:41:19,245 --> 00:41:22,296
Doesn't matter, can you
translate these markings?

845
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,891
Now access the memories
of Eve Tessmacher

846
00:41:33,893 --> 00:41:36,907
and tell me everything
she knows about Leviathan.

847
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:40,314

Your wounds could've easily
been much more severe.

140
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,500
Agent scott wasn't as fortunate.

141
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:55,570
While he survived the initial blast,agent scott
was exposed to some synthetic chemical compounds.

142
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,450
Work that was done
in the labs you found.

143
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,590
He's not contagious,but
until we understand more,

144
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,150
it's better not to introduce
any additional contaminants.

145
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,990
We haven't been able to identify
the substance that's affecting him.

146
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,950
The cdc has sent in specialists,but...

147
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,610
well,they've never seen anything
like what's happening here.

148
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,430
We've put agent scott
in a drug-induced coma.

149
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,220
His body temperature has been lowered
significantly to try and slow the progress.

I'm sorry,agent dunham.

153
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:52,780
I found a connection between the hamburg
flight and what's happened to agent scott.

154
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,900
His name's walter bishop.

He's a scientific

00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,180
Look at the experiments
he was doing in the '70s.

159
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,840
I believe dr. Bishop might have
information that might tell us

160
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,240
what happened aboard that plane
and save agent scott's life.

161
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,560
Says the guy's been at
st. Claire's for 17 years.

162
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,550
I saw that. An assistant
was killed in his lab.

163
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,560
Rumors about dr. Bishop
using humans as guinea pigs.

164
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,820
He was charged with manslaughter,but
was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial.

165
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,430
Why are you so sure
bishop's worth our time?

166
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,600
Why are you so sure he's not?

167
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,340
Listen,dunham,you and i
got off on the wrong foot--

168
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,980
if my past job performance as U.S.
Marine special investigator offends you--

169
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,830
well,yeah,it does.

170
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:45,100
A man who serves his country for 30 years
has a few drinks and a small lapse in judgment

171
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,780
- does not deserve five years.
- A small lapse in judgment that

172
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,020
will haunt three young women
for the rest of their lives.

173
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,280
But that's not tonight's business,is it?

174
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:57,590
Look,D.C.Has tasked me to make sure that our
reaction to flight 627 is beyond reproach.

175
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,150
Now it says here,in 1991 the
glorious state of massachusetts

176
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,400
forbade dr. Bishop from having any visitors
with the exception of immediate family.

177
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:13,060
So from where I sit,barging into a
mental institution waving the patriot act,

178
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,110
which is what you'd need,

179
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,640
and demanding face time
with some old lab rat

180
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,460
who you think might be behind some of the most
terrifying terror that I can possibly imagine--

181
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,090
I'm coming to you with a solid lead,

182
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,880
- And your personal resentment is preventing
you-- - and you're wasting your breath and my time.

183
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,860
Do you understand "immediate family?"

184
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,140
You want to question dr. Bishop,you go find
his next of kin and have 'em escort you in.

185
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,930
Talk to bishop,uncover something
substantial,and I will have your back.

186
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,200
Until then,I am not so convinced.

187
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,830
Now can you handle that?

188
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,060
He does have a son.

189
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,370
Is his son local too?

190
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,720
Not exactly.

191
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,110
<i>{\a6}BAGHADAD IRAQ</i>

192
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,920
so this guy's walter bishop's son.

193
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,270
his name's peter bishop.

194
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,750
He's a high school dropout,I.Q.At
190,which is 50 points north of genius.

195
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,410
Misfit,nomad.

196
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,600
Hasn't kept a job
longer than two months.

197
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,920
He's been a wild land
fireman,cargo pilot,

198
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:22,030
and briefly a college
chemistry professor.

199
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,180
He falsified a degree from M.I.T.

200
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,810
And even managed to get a few papers
published before he was found out.

201
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,190
Sounds like a massive pain in the ass.

202
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,640
my resume is hardly traditional.

203
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,130
But around these parts,traditional
increasingly means irrelevant.

204
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,550
$100 billion sunk into infrastructure
and you can barely keep the lights on.

205
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,300
So you need someone to oversee construction
on 600 miles of pipeline to carry crude

206
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,330
between your fields in
kirkuk and the port of ceyhan.

207
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,440
A job well outside the green zone,I
might add while I'm still alive to do so.

208
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,950
You'll need someone who has a handle
on the laws of hydrodynamic resistance.

209
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,790
The heat exchange in oil mixture flows.

210
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,910
You'll also need someone who can
work with mixed integer programs

211
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,220
because you're gonna have to resize the pipes
as you start working across uneven terrain.

212
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,970
That is,if you want to keep
down construction costs.

213
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,520
I also speak farsi.

214
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:24,930
And 600,000 all in sounds fair.

215
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,280
Peter bishop.

216
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,250
Olivia dunham. I'm with the fbi.

217
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,990
Okay.

218
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,780
You've heard of flight 627?

219
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,400
The hamburg flight,of course.

220
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,500
You may be able to help us with that.

221
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,840
No,I think you got the wrong guy.

222
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,680
Your father is walter bishop.

223
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,850
You know,the last time somebody
asked me that it was an accusation.

224
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,960
Well,he's the man we're looking to
speak with,but due to his current status,

225
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,770
you're the only one who
can provide us access.

226
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,980
And what possible help
could that man be to you?

227
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,370
And what is it exactly that
you're expecting me to do?

228
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,690
Hop on a plane with you
back to massachusetts?

229
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,080
I just got here,honey.

230
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,340
I can have you on a return flight
here in four days,but first--

231
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,660
let me save you the time.

232
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,640
I'd rather stay here in iraq.

233
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,800
That's how much I want to see my father.

234
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,110
I'm going to beg you as
one human being to another.

235
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,790
Your father may be able to
save someone who's dying.

236
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,310
Someone I care about very much.

237
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,560
Sweetheart,we all care
about someone who's dying.

238
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,900
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

239
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,260
I know why you're here!

240
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,720
I have your file.

241
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,890
What file?

242
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,230
The one the fbi would say doesn't exist.

243
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,450
And it has everything.

244
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,920
Where you've been,what
you're running from.

245
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,360
And what you need while you're here.

246
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:04,340
So either you come with me,or I let
certain people know your whereabouts.

247
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,760
When do we leave?

248
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,100
did the doctors say anything else?

249
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,920
Yeah.

250
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,110
Thanks,charlie.

251
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,330
Let me ask you something.

252
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,290
My father,not my favorite.

253
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,440
He is without a doubt the
most self-absorbed,twisted,

254
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:41,170
abusive,brilliant,myopic
son of a bitch on the planet.

255
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,600
So he was a chemist.

256
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,490
That much I already know.

257
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,920
He worked out of a basement lab in harvard
doing research for a toothpaste company.

258
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,400
I also know that there was an
accident at the lab one night,

259
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:57,970
that my father was arrested,beginning the
first truly peaceful period in our home.

260
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,060
But here's the thing,olivia.

261
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:06,900
My gut tells me that your friend's
life,the one hanging in the balance,

262
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,960
not gonna be saved by
a tube of toothpaste.

263
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,520
He worked out of harvard,but
not on toothpaste.

264
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:26,460
He was part of a classified U.S.Army
experimental program called kelvin genetics.

265
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,400
They gave him the resources
to do whatever work he wanted,

266
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:35,110
which was primarily in an
area called fringe science.

267
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,310
When you say fringe
science,you mean pseudoscience.

268
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,260
I suppose.

269
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,410
Things like mind
control,teleportation,astral projection,

270
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,420
invisibility,genetic
mutation,reanimation,fertility--

271
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,560
whoa,excuse for a sec.

272
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,260
Reanimation? Really?

273
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:57,240
So you're telling me what?

274
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,190
My father was dr. Frankenstein?

275
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:18,490
<i>{\a6}ESSEXCOUNTY MASSACHUSETTS</i>

276
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,520
You know what?

277
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,430
Why don't you go on ahead.

278
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,250
Dr. Bishop,special
day. You have a visitor.

279
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,030
Hello.

280
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,950
I knew someone would come... eventually.

281
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,330
Dr. Bishop.

282
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,450
Dr. Bishop?

283
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,000
And you said this was--
when did this happen?

284
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,830
The incident on the plane
happened four days ago.

285
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,030
Agent scott was injured the next day.

286
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,220
The dermis already
indurated,translucent.

287
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,740
M-muscular tissue visible.

288
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,060
On scott,you mean,can
you see through skin?

289
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,010
Yes.

290
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,060
Oh,that's not good.

291
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,960
To see through the skin,it's--it's
tricky,it's advanced.

292
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,350
- Like that it's tricky.
- What's happening to him?

293
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,990
Can it be reversed?

294
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,910
What is it?

295
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:26,790
They... they have this horrible...

296
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,760
pudding here.

297
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:33,900
Butterscotch pudding on
mondays. It's dreadful.

298
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,170
It's thursday.

299
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:45,080
Oh,that's fantastic news.

300
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,240
It can be reversed.

301
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,010
What happened to your colleague.

302
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,500
Years ago I worked with
lab animals,and--and ...

303
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,910
some of them were
afflicted,but were saved.

304
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,950
So do you remember what to do?

305
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:30,470
This place,their- their
choice of therapies has c--c--

306
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,510
Dr. Bishop.

307
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,990
You came here today with my son.

308
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,660
I'm not allowed visitors,you
see,except immediate family.

309
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:56,240
And unless the order has been
lifted,then it's a simple if/then formula.

310
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,870
If you are here,then so is he.

311
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:06,000
I would... so much...

312
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,840
so very much like to see him.

313
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,900
So much.

314
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,500
He asked for you.

315
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,260
Thanks,sweetheart.

316
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,470
I really appreciate that.

317
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,690
Hey,I didn't tell him you were here.

318
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,370
And call me "sweetheart" one
more time. I'd really like that.

319
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,800
Hello,walter.

320
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,650
I thought you'd be fatter.

321
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,630
You thought I would be fatter.

322
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,730
Excellent first words,perfect.

323
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,410
No,as a boy,you were rounder.

324
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,920
Yes,I was until the
summer before high school.

325
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,530
Not that I'd expect
you to remember that.

326
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,600
May I see something?

327
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,700
What are you doing? Take
your hands off of me!

328
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:31,670
Pupils are good. They're
good. Thank goodness.

329
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,860
How advanced is your
colleague's condition?

330
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:39,490
Which--which is
something I-I-I--

331
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:44,060
I'm unable to deduce without
a firsthand examination.

332
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,840
I must see mr. Scott myself.

333
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,570
Which I am unable to do.

334
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,890
Well,under present law.

335
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:59,530
Unless--unless signed out by a legal
guardian who must be,once again,a relative.

336
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,010
What are you
asking me to--

337
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,060
no.Guardian? No,forget it.

338
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,840
- He'll do it.
- No,I will not.

339
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,160
One phone call. That's all it
takes. You want me to make it?

340
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,370
'Cause I got my phone in my pocket.

341
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,380
Now it's out of my pocket.

342
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,520
You wanted my father.

343
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,180
Now you've got my father.

344
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,760
Which falls into the category of
be careful what you wish for...

345
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:30,250
sweetheart.

346
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:29,530
every effort is being made to
understand what happened on flight 627...

347
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,990
dr. Bishop,I was curious.

348
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,340
Did anyone else ever
have access to your work?

349
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,960
Well,the assistants had bits and pieces.

350
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,780
And god,I suppose.

351
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,290
I supposed the only one that really
knew what I was doing was belly.

352
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,000
Who?

353
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,460
Belly,william bell. He
and I shared the lab.

354
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,070
William bell?

355
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,100
You shared your lab with the
founder of massive dynamics?

356
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,940
I'm sorry,I don't know what
that is,massive dynamics.

357
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,210
Oh,nothing really. Just
a tiny little company.

358
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,620
That's perfect.

359
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,950
One guys becomes one of the
wealthiest men on the planet.

360
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,260
The other guy becomes an
institutionalized psychopath.

361
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,590
What? What happened?

362
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,960
I just pissed myself.

363
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,790
- Excellent.
- Just a squirt.

364

<i>{\a6}MASSIVE DYNAMICM</i>

365
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,480
I just got your message. How's john?

366
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,510
Worse.

367
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,850
Cdc says the hamburg flight was
caused by a synthetic compound.

368
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,090
Which is like saying rain
is caused by a wet compound.

369
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,070
They've run some tests on john,but
haven't come back with anything.

370
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,040
What about bishop?

371
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:47,320
Left to right,insane and irritating.

372
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,040
And also my only hope.

373
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,910
Listen...

374
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,310
I need to question william bell.

375
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,840
Could you set that up for me?

376
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,510
William bell?

377
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,110
Massive dynamics william bell.

378
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,680
He and bishop used to share a lab.

379
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,160
You're kidding.

380
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,630
Dr. Bishop?

381
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,930
Is there ginger ale? Any ginger ale?

382
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,500
I haven't had some in
a long time. I miss it.

383
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,980
Can we please get some ginger ale
for the doctor,agent farnsworth.

384
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,310
Sure.

385
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,710
Whoa,stop right now! Stop!

386
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,800
Does this not concern you?

387
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,540
Let him go.

388
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,810
Petri dish.

389
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,680
Quick,please.

390
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,580
Good.

391
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,740
- I need to take this to my lab right away.
- Your what?

392
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,520
Kresge building basement,harvard.

393
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,690
We should leave.

394
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,720
I have my sample.

395
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,650
Your lab was shutdown after you left.

396
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,560
I'm sorry?

397
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,210
Wake up. It's gone.

398
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,870
No.

399
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,040
No,no,no.

400
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,270
No,no,no,no,no,no.

401
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,780
Walter,there is no lab.

402
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,790
- It's a perfect
working-- - no!

403
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,460
Damn you,damn you!

404
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:40,870
We need to get him back immediately.

405
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,810
Liaison.

406
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,730
- When did you get back?
- I need your help.

407
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,990
I want you to know I've successfully had
dr. Walter bishop released from st.Claire's,

408
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,880
and he requires the use
of his old laboratory.

409
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,760
I'm sorry,what?

410
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,290
Kresge building. Harvard,basement.

411
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,380
The university's been using it
for storage for the past 17 years.

412
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,960
It would be nice to think
that your tenacity in this case

413
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,350
is a byproduct of a remarkable
and robust professionalism.

414
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,990
But I can't help but wonder

415
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,620
if there wasn't something going
on between you and agent scott.

416
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,990
Get the lab for bishop.

417
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,180
So much.

418
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,050
So much happened here.

419
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,290
And so much is about to.

420
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,210
<i>{\a6}HARVARD UNIVERSITY</i>

421
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,250
Dr. Bishop,I've ordered a
standard forensics work package.

422
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,420
Is there anything else you need?

423
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,740
Um,optical coherence
tomograph for flesh study.

424
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,050
2,000 pounds of silicon.

425
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:26,850
At least five anonymous blood
samples from volunteer donors.

426
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,870
Microorganism detector.

427
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,220
Nasa grade,of course.
There's still nasa,yes?

428
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,230
Yes.

429
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,840
Oh,she's still here!

430
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,000
Oh,this tank was the best.

431
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,170
And a two-year-old
bos taurus.

432
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,420
A what?

433
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,320
A cow.

434
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,570
He wants a cow.

435
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,350
Purebred,not crossbred.
This is important.

436
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,360
Mature weight,850 pounds.

437
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:53,040
Internal fat average of 2.37

438
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,140
Is he joking?

439
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,330
Genetically,humans and cows are
separated by only a couple lines of dna.

440
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,180
So it's an ethical test subject.

441
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,040
Where'd you learn that? M.I.T?

442
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,470
No,actually.

443
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,460
I picked that up reading books.

444
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,960
You should try it sometime. It's fun.

445
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,270
Get him the cow.

446
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,270
Fantastic,thank you.

447
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,840
The only thing better
than a cow is a human.

448
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:22,290
Unless you need milk.
Then you really need a cow.

449
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,880
Coffee?

450
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,600
Thanks.

451
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,440
Tell me.

452
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:18,570
What else did that file say
about yours truly? How bad was it?

453
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,830
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

454
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:25,180
Why don't you go ahead and liberate
yourself,'cause I'm here now,

455
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:29,070
so I kind of feel like I
deserve the truth,don't you?

456
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,590
There was no file.

457
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,660
I needed you back here.

458
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,200
So that was what? You were bluffing?

459
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,340
I-I was desperate.

460
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,240
You know,I'm usually pretty
good at reading people.

461
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,480
That's sort of what I do.

462
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,030
Yeah,well,I could see you were
in trouble. Anyone could see that.

463
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,800
So I could've stayed.

464
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,910
I could've stayed in iraq.

465
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,900
You know,a car bomb went
off this morning in kirkuk.

466
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,410
You might just owe me a thank you.

467
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,540
Yeah,well,I owe a lot.

468
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:03,470
Tsk,yeah,I figured. MafiA.

469
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,650
A guy named big eddie.

470
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,540
You owe money to a guy
nicknamed big eddie?

471
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,620
No,I owe money to a guy named big eddie.

472
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,540
He had it legally changed.

473
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,860
And the thing is,I'm not even
a gambler. I mean,I never was.

474
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:19,790
It just-- a couple years
ago I went a bit crazy.

475
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,000
I thought you were a genius.
You must've had a system.

476
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,830
Of course there was a system.

477
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,300
The house was cheating.

478
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,510
But you try telling 'em that.

479
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:34,140
'72 during vietnam.

480
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:39,130
The D.O.D.'S biochem division had
us working on a leprotic contagion

481
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,760
for possible use against the vietcong.

482
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:48,170
It's possible that whatever affected that
plane may have been derived from that work.

483
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,250
What about john?

484
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:54,580
What's infecting him is merely a chemical
reaction to the raw laboratory ingredients,

485
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,260
not the finished contagion.

486
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,330
Which means we can
synthesize a counteragent.

487
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,890
- So you can help him.
- don't do that.

488
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,250
Don't give her false hope.

489
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,640
There's no false. It's
not false. It's real.

490
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,560
I could help, yes.

491
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:09,730
If I had a precise inventory of what was
in that storage facility when it detonated.

492
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,040
We don't have it.

493
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,500
It all went up, everything.

494
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,550
And the suspect who might
have those answers got away,

495
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,890
and john was the only
one who saw his face.

496
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,060
So how long does he have left?

497
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:23,410
Current rate of crystallization,
cellular degradation--

498
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,420
- how long?
- 24 hours.

499
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:30,070
His brain will no longer
be able to oxygenate itself.

500
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,240
I'm so sorry...

501
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,310
that I can't offer you a
less dangerous solution.

502
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,230
What do you mean?

503
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,260
Didn't I mention it?

504
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,520
Whatever you think you
said, you didn't say.

505
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,060
The synaptic transfer system.

506
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,340
The shared dream state.

507
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,070
What do you mean shared dream state?

508
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,520
The human brain generates a
quantifiable electric field.

509
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,960
I posited in 1976 that it is possible

510
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:03,490
to synchronize the fields
of two distinct minds

511
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,130
to allow the sharing of information
across the unconscious state.

512
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,470
Like a string between two tin cans.

513
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,610
You know what's great about that?

514
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,280
Is that it's completely insane.

515
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,230
You're saying I can
talk to john in a coma

516
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,120
and he can tell me what
the suspect looks like.

517
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:24,410
- It's not an exact science.
- It's not even science.

518
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,550
Have you done this before?

519
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,940
I have used this technique to extract
information from a corpse once.

520
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,880
You can do that if they haven't
been dead for longer than six hours.

521
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,260
Right, 'cause after six hours,
that's when they're really dead.

522
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,480
You could access his memories.

523
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,330
Assuming there's no brain damage.

524
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,480
Of course you'd have to
have an electromagnetic probe

525
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,320
placed in the base of your skull whilst
immersed without clothing in the old tank.

526
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,440
And you'd be heavily drugged.

527
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,170
What sort of drugs?

528
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:03,130
Oh, a mix of ketamine, neurontin,
lysergic acid diethylamide.

529
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,680
That last one is
lsd, by the way--acid.

530
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:06,870
Take at least a few hours.

531
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,380
I'd need your help to synthesize
it if it's not too much trouble.

532
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,590
Yeah, sure, no problem.
That sounds like fun.

533
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,770
The man who was just released
from the mental institution,

534
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,730
he wants to give you a drug overdose,

535
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,820
then sick a metal rod into your head and
put you naked into a rusty tank of water.

536
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,930
No, I don't want to.

537
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,790
No, I'd rather not.
I'm just saying I can.

538
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,580
Okay, olivia, excuse me for sec.

539
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,770
Now you're obviously
under severe duress,

540
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,290
and you haven't slept since iraq,
and the man you care about might die,

541
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,550
but I'm telling you
that man will kill you.

542
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,660
You don't understand the procedure.

543
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:43,080
John would do it for me.

544
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,420
Set it up.

545
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:48,650
I'll get dhs authorization
to bring john here.

546
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:53,410
This is unbelievable. This
is insane! He is insane!

547
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,160
And you're insane for following him.

548
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,500
Excellent.

549
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,210
Let's make some lsd.

550
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,700
put him over here.

551
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,330
Salt'll make you float.

552
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,830
Charlie, did you get me
in to see william bell?

553
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,370
Massive dynamics isn't exactly
being forthcoming or courteous.

554
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,530
And apparently, william bell is out
of the country for the next two weeks.

555
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,430
What's this?

556
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,250
A sweet little memo from
their general counsel.

557
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,540
So bell doesn't want to talk?

558
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,360
Or he's just being the head
of a $50 billion corporation.

559
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:57,390
Oh, screw this.

560
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,620
I want to drive a tank through william
bell's office and find out what he knows.

561
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,510
I know you do, but I'm here
to tell you the bad news.

562
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,530
It's gonna be another 48 hours
till we get a court order.

563
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,340
You should probably
strip to your underwear.

564
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,490
Hello.

565
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:13,780
What the hell was that?

566
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,280
Charlie, we don't have 48 hours.

567
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:17,190
I need you to get to bell.

568
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,290
If walter fails, bell could
be the only one to save us.

569
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,730
Livvy, what's happening here?

570
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,610
You've cleared all this with broyles?

571
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,560
Somewhat.

572
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:29,840
Somewhat doesn't sound good.

573
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,450
Is that a cow?

574
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,670
Yeah, that's gene.

575
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,500
Listen, charlie, I-I need you to
promise me you'll do whatever you can.

576
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:43,840
Of course. You know that.

577
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:48,960
Be careful.

578
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,120
My god.

579
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,140
now where was I?

580
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:27,650
Could you tilt your
head forward, please.

581
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:33,320
I still think that this is deeply
irresponsible, and believe me, I would know.

582
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,800
This is an anesthetic.

583
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:39,120
I feel normal working.

584
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:43,420
Yeah, 'cause bootlegging smack in the
basement is just the picture of normalcy.

585
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,650
I got you. I got you.

586
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:04,600
I hope your guy is worth it.

587
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:20,500
And this...

588
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,630
will rip open your consciousness.

589
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:49,340
Listen, in case, you
don't come back, I just...

590
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:55,670
wanted to say before we do this, how
much I appreciate what you've done.

591
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,850
There are so many things you'll
lose in a place like that.

592
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,900
You lose being trusted.

593
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:06,960
Strange how important
that is once it's gone.

594
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:44,470
If you want to watch,
you can come closer.

595
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,900
Do you work here?

596
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:49,490
Yeah, I'm astrid farnsworth,
assistant to agent dunham.

597
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,360
Who?

598
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,870
Oh, yes. I'm walter...

599
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,170
bishop, walter bishop.

600
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,130
Yes, thank you.

601
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,380
Don't mention it.

602
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,900
These are her brain rhythms.

603
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:05,100
More important than most people know
regarding cerebral regional interaction.

604
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,460
Critical.

605
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,740
And--and
these are his.

606
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:14,220
As the drugs take effect, the probes will
synchronize the electrical signals from both.

607
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:17,840
That's what the brain
is, an electrical router.

608
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,300
Should be able to be
interpreted by the other.

609
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:23,070
Yeah, simple really. Like making taffy.

610
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:29,110
Then when the rhythms are in synch, they
should be in the same place, so to speak.

611
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,150
So what do we do now?

612
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,850
Now we wait.

613
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,060
What was that?

614
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,070
Hello. Hello!

615
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:53,220
I think I'm here. I
think I'm here. I'm here.

616
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,820
John?

617
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,570
That's my uncle's kayak.

618
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:23,570
John? Is that you?

619
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,610
- olivia.
- John.

620
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,270
- What's happening?
- She's fine.

621
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,880
- She's all right?
- She's fine.

622
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,880
- You sure?
- Look.

623
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,760
I was just thinking about you.

624
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,710
What was that?

625
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,860
Oh, nothing.

626
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,370
John... you were hurt.

627
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:32,860
I don't remember.

628
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,420
Think.

629
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:38,740
The storage units.

630
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,520
I feel cold.

631
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:44,140
I need you to remember.

632
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:47,380
Remember what?

633
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,260
What you saw.

634
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:54,610
I need you to show me his face.

635
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:57,330
Why?

636
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:04,760
So I can save you.

637
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,340
Please try.

638
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:12,540
Try and remember.

639
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:29,290
Yes, this is right. This is right.

640
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:49,350
we got a runner in the
back. We need him alive.

641
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,580
I can't see his face.

642
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:09,220
Her leg!

643
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:10,690
Oh, I saw him!

644
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:15,110
I saw john get hurt. I was there.
I was there, I saw--I saw him.

645
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,480
What do you mean you saw him? Where?

646
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:33,200
I told you not to ask me that.

647
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,360
This is him. This is the suspect
we're looking for.He looks like this

648
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:39,160
send me the image. I'll
put it through the database.

649
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:41,950
Have you slept? You look like crap.

650
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,090
No primary matches for criminal record.

651
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,190
Well, cross-check all state driver license
files and send this image to all local hospitals.

652
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:51,350
Agent dunham, take a look at this.

653
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,400
Oh, my god. This is him.

654
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,210
He was a passenger on flight 627.

655
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,770
- I don't-- I don't
understand. - Wait, wait, wait.

656
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,180
He couldn't have been
at the storage place.

657
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:06,400
- Charlie, I saw him there.
- hold on, guys.

658
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:09,220
Morgan steig was passenger number 108.

659
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:13,080
His emergency contact, richard steig.

660
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:14,530
You're telling me he has a twin?

661
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,890
Yeah, no home address, only
a history of employment.

662
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,360
What?

663
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:22,150
Richard steig's last employer.

664
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,170
I was hoping to speak with william bell.

665
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:32,720
<i>{\a6}MASSIVE DYNAMIC NEW YORK</i>

666
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,760
I'm nina sharp, executive director.

667
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:34,370
I only have a few minutes.

668
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:38,740
our primary suspect is a former
employee of yours, richard steig,

669
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:43,870
who may have used research from your company
to develop a self-eradicating airborne toxin.

670
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,630
We don't know why or for whom, but it appears
he was willing to sacrifice his own brother.

671
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:53,540
Whatever killed those people on that
plane got onboard through his insulin pen.

672
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,660
So do you want to talk to me?

673
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,460
Danielle...

674
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:10,910
please assemble everything we have on
richard steig for agent dunham here.

675
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,080
I remember richard steig.

676
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:18,000
He worked in our weapons
systems research lab.

677
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:22,740
He was caught three months ago trying to
leave the premises with classified information.

678
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,610
He was terminated immediately.

679
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,730
We referred his name to
the justice department.

680
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,700
We have done our due
diligence, agent dunham.

681
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:35,160
And if you choose to drag our company
and dr. Bell's name into this matter,

682
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:37,270
you will be hearing from our attorneys.

683
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,960
How long have you worked for dr. Bell?

684
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:40,840
16 years.

685
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:44,770
I owe massive dynamics my life,
and that is not an exaggeratioN.

686
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,200
I s a runner most of my life.

687
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:51,560
In the '97 boston marathon,
I felt strangely tired.

688
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:57,090
One day at the office, dr. Bell noticed my
discomfort and insisted I go for a cat scan.

689
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,410
Cancer.

690
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:05,980
Spread so severely I had to
have my arm amputated that week.

691
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:10,890
That first scanner that found my
cancer was built by this company.

692
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:15,340
The robotic assist tools there were used in
my surgery, the drugs I took afterwards...

693
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:19,120
were developed and manufactured
by massive dynamics.

694
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:24,700
And my replacement limb was
designed by bell himself.

695
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:31,390
Everything we have on richard steig.

696
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:36,320
Do you believe that steig
may be part of the pattern?

697
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:39,200
I'm sorry, part of the...

698
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:41,260
part of the pattern?

699
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:44,440
Oh, I assumed you had clearance.

700
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:48,420
Well, I'm cleared to know whatever
you're cleared to know, ms. Sharp.

701
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:51,210
Apparently not.

702
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:55,000
But suffice to say that we've reached
a point where science and technology

703
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:58,480
have advanced at such an
exponential rate for so long,

704
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:03,320
it may be way beyond our ability
to regulate and control them.

705
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:08,690
You should know what you're
getting into, agent dunham.

706
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,750
I would say this to my own daughter.

707
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,620
Be careful.

708
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:18,220
And good luck.

709
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:26,970
Keep the tree warm, sandy!
We're on our way to your house!

710
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:32,090
And this is a show for children?

711
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,160
Yeah, it's huge.

712
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:38,670
Surprisingly profound for
a narrative about a sponge.

713
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,060
Crazy house.

714
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:41,980
I just landed at logan.
I'm on my way to you.

715
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,920
I think we've located our suspect.

716
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:45,910
Hold on a second. You found the guy?

717
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,270
You found the guy from your dream.

718
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,340
I'm picking you both up.

719
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:49,840
I need your father
there to question him,

720
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:52,070
get whatever information he needs
so he can make the cure for john.

721
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,280
And I need you there too
in case your father's--

722
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:56,550
say no more. We'll meet you out front.

723
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,690
stay eyes on south side.

724
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,790
red, stand by.

725
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,550
rooftop, confirm your position.

726
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,540
<i>{\a6}S*** BOSTON</i>

727
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:17,010
Got one coming out.

728
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:19,300
This way, ma'am.

729
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:34,470
Clear! Clear! Clear!

730
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,160
In the back!

731
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:12,240
I'd like to... check
your blood pressure.

732
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:15,500
Why don't you check your own blood
pressure? Mine's fine, thanks.

733
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,520
Your skin tone suggests you might be
suffering from arterial hypertension.

734
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:22,370
Don't tell me what I'm suffering from.

735
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,850
And there are no visible
signs of hypertension.

736
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:32,550
When this over, please
don't send me back.

737
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,770
I don't want to go back.

738
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:34,760
Look,
walter--

739
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:40,280
this experience...You
woke me up again, and...

740
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,590
you can't put me back to sleep.

741
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,550
It was hardly my idea, any of it.

742
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:51,520
Whatever punishment you think I deserve,

743
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:55,880
I swear I have already endured it.

744
01:00:56,870 --> 01:01:01,340
17 years. Please...

745
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:03,740
son.

746
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,140
What?

747
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:16,080
He's in the alley!

748
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,150
Can I get out of the car?

749
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,400
Stay right there, walter!

750
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:34,590
We've got some questions for you.

751
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:38,010
U.S.Code 1111.

752
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,740
The murder of 147 passengers.

753
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,380
U.S.Code 2332-A.

754
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:46,060
Use of weapons of mass destruction.

755
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:48,310
U.S.Code 2332-B.

756
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:51,640
An act of terrorism
transcending national borders.

757
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:53,590
U.S.Code 1132-A.

758
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,570
Attempted murder of a federal agent.

759
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:58,920
You want immunity.

760
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:04,540
I want a detailed account of all the synthetic
chemicals you had in that storage facility.

761
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,660
Write them down.

762
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:09,370
And then we can talk about an agreement.

763
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,780
I... have nothing... to say.

764
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,100
Walter, stay here.

765
01:03:50,340 --> 01:04:06,000
Where
are you--

766
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,940
the compound affecting agent scott.

767
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:10,420
It's water soluble, right?

768
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:14,570
We might not know what it
is, but we know what it does.

769
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:19,800
So if I wanted to, I could extract the
contagious fluids from his body and...

770
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:23,460
that would allow me to slip
it to you whenever I wanted to.

771
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,860
In your food.

772
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,660
A cup of coffee.

773
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:31,800
The toilet.

774
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:34,750
Nobody would ever know how it happened.

775
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,490
The only problem is...

776
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,890
the woman who was just in here,
that's her friend who's dying.

777
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,930
So I just don't have that kind of time.

778
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:45,400
No!

779
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,830
Tell me the chemicals!

780
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,210
Hey, stop, stop! You
can't! You can't do that.

781
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,010
No, you can't do that.

782
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,570
I want the names of the chemicals.

783
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,770
I'm gonna count to one.

784
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,780
One!

785
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:02,030
The active toxin was a
magnesium based ethylene glycol.

786
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,580
No, I understand that, but
you're not listening to me.

787
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:06,170
Magnesium ethylene glycol
with an organophosphate trig--

788
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:07,610
walter, just stop for a second.

789
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:09,930
His blood won't be able to absorb
it before the side-effects kill him.

790
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:10,830
So you're saying what?

791
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,930
We synthesize a calcium
gluconate in a thiamine base?

792
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:15,860
Yes, exactly.

793
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,200
We can'T. We'd need more
of his blood. We have none.

794
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:18,960
That's
not true--

795
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:23,440
all agents are required to set up a
backup blood supply in case we're wounded.

796
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:25,550
autologous transfusion.
That's brilliant.

797
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,960
We can create the antidote and then just
dissolve it into scott's stored blood.

798
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:32,100
If we transfuse him intravenously,
his body won't be overwhelmed.

799
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:35,480
A+, boY. Well done. Let's begin.

800
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:00,810
So I got the lab.

801
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:04,080
Yeah, I know you did.

802
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,810
Thanks.

803
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:12,380
How's it goin' downstairs?

804
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:20,920
bishop says it'll be awhile,
but that it's looking auspicious.

805
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:23,730
That was his word.

806
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,400
What?

807
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:28,250
You've done some solid work here.

808
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:32,930
Locating bishop. Getting him out.
Finding a way to get him to work with you.

809
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:35,260
We're impressed.

810
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:37,820
Who's "we"?

811
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:42,140
What happened on that plane might be part of
something more dangerous than just simple terrorism.

812
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:44,780
Simple terrorism?

813
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:52,120
In the past nine months, there have been three dozen
authenticated incidents like the hamburg flight.

814
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:56,040
John thompson, normal kid,
went missing back in '98.

815
01:06:56,050 --> 01:07:00,390
Reappeared last month halfway
around the world. Hadn't aged a day.

816
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:05,230
In the past few months, 46 other children
who went missing that same year turn up.

817
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,740
Same story.

818
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:12,770
Local fisherman off the coast of sri lanka reports
a low-flying plane emitting a high-pitch frequency

819
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,060
that blows out all their windows.

820
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:17,040
An hour later, same spot,

821
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:23,070
an 8.7 sub-surface earthquake creates
a tsunami that kills 83,000 people.

822
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,280
- So why are you
telling me-- - this man.

823
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:30,450
A patient in lisbon who woke up after
years in a coma began writing just numbers.

824
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:35,620
They turn out to be exact real-time coordinates
of our carrier battle groups in the pacific.

825
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,400
Intel that's classified
above top-secret.

826
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:40,020
So how is that even possible?

827
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,410
Come work for me, and I'll
get you the clearance--

828
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:43,860
oh, stop.

829
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:44,780
Dunham, there's more you need to hear.

830
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,700
You must not have heard me. I said stop.

831
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:48,430
They're calling these
events "the pattern."

832
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:51,370
As if someone out there is experimenting,
only the whole world is their lab.

833
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:52,690
You've seen it, now you know.

834
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,350
I don't wanna know. I have a job.

835
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,040
This is a more important job.

836
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:59,010
Anything, anybody you
need, you can have.

837
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,990
I like the job I've got.

838
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,450
And the man I do it with. Which you
seem to have deduced on your own.

839
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,320
Look around.

840
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:08,310
You see all these people
going about their lives.

841
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:12,210
No idea what's happening around
them, what they're in the middle of.

842
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,090
I just wanna go back to before.

843
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:22,050
Dunham. I don't think you can.

844
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:21,480
He's up. He's awake.

845
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,170
Olivia, olivia, he's
awake! He's conscious.

846
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,830
John?

847
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:32,170
John, can you hear me, baby? Baby?

848
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,760
I had a dream about you.

849
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,640
Uh, a change of clothes for agent scott.

850
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:09,300
His vitals are surprisingly strong.

851
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,540
So, um, how long does he have to stay?

852
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:16,430
Until the melanocytes in his skin have
regenerated, but that shouldn't be more than a week.

853
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:19,340
He owes you his life.

854
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:22,200
We owe each other.

855
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:30,360
What room is steig in?

856
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,750
I told you everything I know. Didn't I?

857
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,970
I gave you the names of all the
synthetics I used in the compound.

858
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:40,970
Don't worry, our
immunity agreement holds.

859
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,170
But there's still a whole lot
more we have to talk about.

860
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:45,080
Like, why you killed your own brother?

861
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:46,570
And who you're selling your work to?

862
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:48,340
Who says I was selling it?

863
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:51,710
I was threatened by a
guy from your office.

864
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,190
You think I'm lying?

865
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,530
I swear to god.

866
01:10:56,540 --> 01:11:00,380
I can prove it.

867
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:03,680
- Where's the recording?
- I buried it.

868
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,720
Who is this?

869
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:49,230
we had an exchange agreement.

870
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:51,400
hmm, there have been other bidders.

871
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:54,390
Today, the airplane was a demonstration.

872
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,280
you've drawn unwarranted attention.

873
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:59,090
Something we can't afford
to be connected with.

874
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:01,260
I'll make this simple. You're
not selling to anyone else.

875
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:02,880
You do that, we will come after you.

876
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:04,880
I will come after you.

877
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:08,660
you're threatening me after seeing what
I'm willing to do to my own brother?

878
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:11,920
well, let me assure you, we'd be
happy to treat you as family too.

879
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:15,650
Well, let me assure you. We'd be
happy to treat you as family too.

880
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:29,940
Special agent scott.

881
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:34,920
Yes, sir, go right ahead.

882
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:01,650
charlie, I need two agents posted
outside agent scott's room now.

883
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:02,910
Check on steig.

884
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,200
I'm on it.

885
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:06,280
I'm five minutes away.

886
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:12,370
We need this place locked down!

887
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:28,260
This is dunham, agent I.D.52776 In pursuit
of blue suv heading south on fenway.

888
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,430
Need immediate assist.

889
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:27,090
Ask yourself why...

890
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:37,900
why broyles sent you
to the storage facility.

891
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,700
Why you?

892
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:45,660
Why? I don't understand.

893
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:50,640
Who are you working for?

894
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:54,600
John, tell me.

895
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:57,670
Tell me more, john.

896
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:54,290
I knew him just as long as you did.

897
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,580
I'm sorry.

898
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:06,370
Job isn't what it was ten years ago.

899
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:10,480
We're supposed to protect a world

900
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:15,150
where one breath of the wrong air can
incinerate you from the inside out.

901
01:17:16,990 --> 01:17:19,890
I mean, how do we protect people

902
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:25,100
when corporations have higher
security clearances than we do?

903
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:30,230
When we're not fully briefed on half
the things that we're investigating?

904
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:33,360
You know, when the truth...

905
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:42,270
the truth is we're obsolete.

906
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:49,040
Take me back to the lab.

907
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:09,890
Can I talk to you please?

908
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,810
Yeah. I'll be back in a second.

909
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:16,370
Though I'm sure you're anxious to
get as far away from here as possible.

910
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:19,950
To iraq or afghanistan or
countless other out of reach places,

911
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:22,300
but I'm here to tell you that
your father needs to stay.

912
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,900
Which means that you need to too.

913
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:26,970
Are you okay?

914
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:32,820
No, I-I-I-I know that you have countless
reasons as to why this is a non-starter for you.

915
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:35,960
But, I mean, your father is a good man.

916
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:38,050
He's not the monster you think he is.

917
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:40,260
And you're good with him,
despite what you think.

918
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:42,710
And you're the only
one who speaks walter.

919
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:45,320
We take him back to st.
Claire's and it's all over.

920
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:47,230
Where's john?

921
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:49,490
I can talk to the agency and get
them to clear your gambling debts.

922
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:54,330
I can take care of my own debts,
okay? What just happened? Where's john?

923
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:56,710
I'm not gonna use false
threats with you anymore.

924
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,500
I don't need to.

925
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:02,830
The threats are real.

926
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:10,500
After you left, my father sat down and started
talking to me and he was remarkably lucid.

927
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:14,580
He told me about the work. That he and
william bell had done their experiments.

928
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:19,660
And that incident-- what happened
on the plane is just the beginning.

929
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:25,990
Which makes every part of me feel
like I gotta get the hell outta boston.

930
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,240
are we leaving?

931
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,600
Are we leaving?

932
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:15,600
How long has he been dead?

933
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:18,040
five hours.

934
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,570
Question him.

1
00:00:02,888 --> 00:00:05,632
Read the prepared statement
and then ask for questions.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,192
And expect Hanratty to ask
about the Wilkey Gardens bust.

3
00:00:08,232 --> 00:00:09,536
Reflect, but don't deny.

4
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,332
Right. You got your notes?

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,644
Don't need 'em.

6
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,336
Thanks for making the trip.

7
00:00:14,376 --> 00:00:16,818
And now here's Captain David Aceveda.

8
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:18,954
Thank you, Wanda.

9
00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:21,344
The Farmington district of Los Angeles…

10
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:24,128
which I've been commanding
for the last four months…

11
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:28,064
has traditionally been one of the most
dangerous, crime-ridden areas of the city.

12
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:32,460
Some reporters have gone
so far as to label Farmington a war zone.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,505
Yeah, it's over at the corner!

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,976
I'm proud to announce
that murders, rapes, armed robberies…

15
00:00:55,016 --> 00:00:58,144
and many other violent crimes
have decreased dramatically here…

16
00:00:58,184 --> 00:00:59,702
in the last six months.

17
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:05,920
Under my direction,
law enforcement officers…

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,260
now participate
in neighborhood outreach programs.

19
00:01:19,816 --> 00:01:22,272
Already, the effect
is being felt by local families.

20
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:25,348
Mothers feel safer
as they shop for groceries.

21
00:01:29,896 --> 00:01:31,423
Too late, G-man.

22
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:36,640
With the continued support of community
leaders and ordinary citizens…

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,941
we can make the Farmington district
a safer home…

24
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:41,022
for all of us.

25
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:43,647
Mother…

26
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:47,712
That's for running, asshole.

27
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:49,601
Get up.

28
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:53,666
What the hell, man?

29
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,371
Look at that, Booty.

30
00:01:58,288 --> 00:02:01,160
Looks like you got
some kind of third nad going down there.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,589
Let me get that for ya.
No, wait!

32
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:04,711
Shit!

33
00:02:05,744 --> 00:02:07,560
I got an evidence bag
somewhere.

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,042
No, that's okay. I got it.
All right.

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,280
Come on.

36
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:17,518
Buenos dias.

37
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:20,133
Any questions?

38
00:02:30,808 --> 00:02:31,888
Christ!

39
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,192
You do not see a pair like that every day.

40
00:02:34,232 --> 00:02:35,508
It's called rigor.

41
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:38,192
Rigor or no rigor, that's a serious rack.

42
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:39,792
You wanna give 'em a squeeze?

43
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:42,064
How much time we got
before the ME shows up?

44
00:02:42,104 --> 00:02:44,752
Victim's sister is outside.
Wants to know what happened.

45
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:47,247
Dutch is in charge
of all potential criers.

46
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:48,269
Thanks.

47
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:49,968
Are you the first one here?

48
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:51,599
Yeah. Me and Julien got the call.

49
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,544
Last few weeks,
dead bodies seem to follow you around.

50
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:56,591
Yeah, I'm a real fun-time gal.

51
00:02:56,664 --> 00:02:57,711
Any notions on this one?

52
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,472
Nature of the wounds, we're looking at…

53
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,232
an inexperienced under-achiever type.

54
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:03,344
Covered genitals,
feels shame for what he did.

55
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,776
Family member, boyfriend.
This one will break easy.

56
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:07,921
Don't! Let me go!

57
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:09,906
Goddamn it! Get outta my way!

58
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:12,082
Miss, I need you to calm down.

59
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,968
–Who are you?
–Detective Wagenbach.

60
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:15,186
Is she dead?

61
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:16,463
There's a young woman inside.

62
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:17,744
We haven't identified her yet.

63
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:19,248
This is my sister's place.

64
00:03:19,288 --> 00:03:21,232
Like I said, we don't know who she is yet.

65
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:22,922
Long blonde hair, pretty.

66
00:03:24,023 --> 00:03:26,292
That sounds like her. I'm sorry.

67
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:36,658
Ma'am.

68
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:41,616
Ma'am.

69
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:47,277
Where's Jenny?

70
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:49,104
Jenny?

71
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:51,451
Nancy's little girl. Where is she?

72
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,974
Come with me.

73
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:03,315
Guess what's missing?

74
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:09,174
Shit, son.
I know.

75
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:11,319
It just got interesting.

76
00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:20,855
Hey, Sarge.

77
00:04:21,976 --> 00:04:23,121
Thanks.

78
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,488
I gotta hit the head.
I'll see you in the clubhouse.

79
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,320
Hey, doll.
Just in time.

80
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,592
I've got some reporters here.
You feel like talking?

81
00:04:32,632 --> 00:04:33,526
Nah.

82
00:04:33,592 --> 00:04:36,143
You sure? Gilroy and the chief
will push this story hard.

83
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:38,352
Your team deserves a lot of credit.

84
00:04:38,392 --> 00:04:40,304
Let the poster boy do his thing.

85
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:42,067
Talk to you.

86
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:45,456
Peterson, the John's still not working?

87
00:04:45,496 --> 00:04:46,736
Plumber must have gotten lost.

88
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:48,144
If this city wants to thank us…

89
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:50,480
for a job well done,
how's about making sure…

90
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,348
we don't all have to all cram
into the same goddamn stall?

91
00:04:57,592 --> 00:04:58,704
Vic, can I see you?

92
00:04:58,744 --> 00:05:00,724
Give me a sec.
I need you now.

93
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,220
I'm taking a piss.

94
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:04,591
Provided a spot
in the ladies' room opens up.

95
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:06,289
I got my fingers crossed.

96
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,374
Now.

97
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:12,912
Aye, aye, Captain.

98
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:14,736
Great.

99
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:16,819
Have fun in here, bro.

100
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:19,790
You remember Miguel Esteana.

101
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:21,071
Sure.

102
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:24,559
Miguel's a piece-of-shit drug dealer
with the 25th Street Coronas.

103
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:27,504
This is the kind of attitude you foster
under your command?

104
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:30,063
–Mr Esteana's attorney, José Garcia…
–I know José.

105
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:32,368
He represents a bunch
of piece-of-shit drug dealers.

106
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:35,119
What I do is ensure my clients' rights
aren't violated…

107
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,347
by thugs like you.

108
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:39,856
Mr Esteana claims
you used excessive force during his arrest.

109
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:41,041
Really?

110
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:43,762
Is that what you claim, Miguel?

111
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:47,280
Yeah, that's some hickey.
Boyfriend give you that?

112
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,190
No, you did it with some pliers.

113
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:52,813
I don't recall any pliers.

114
00:05:53,432 --> 00:05:56,431
I remember the eight dime bags
of pure H we nabbed you with.

115
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:59,248
The search, we'll be contesting
with Judge McAllister.

116
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:03,024
I'm sorry. I'm drawing a blank
on this whole pliers thing.

117
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:06,287
Feel free to ask my guys, but I doubt
they remember it that way either.

118
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:08,176
You're a disgrace.
That's funny.

119
00:06:08,216 --> 00:06:12,836
I don't recall signing up for ethics class
from a scumbag drug lawyer.

120
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:14,770
Is that all…

121
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,782
or can I go take that piss?

122
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:19,119
So Miguel is lying?

123
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:20,528
Anything to stay out of jail.

124
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:22,703
Fourth complaint since I came here.

125
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:25,078
Lucky for me you don't believe 'em.

126
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,666
Keep smiling for the cameras.

127
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:31,333
See what you can do
about getting the men's John fixed.

128
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,904
I stopped listening to you five minutes ago.

129
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:39,983
I'm just saying our un-sub's disorganized…

130
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:41,936
probably a record and no violent history.

131
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:44,154
–“Un-sub”?
–Unidentified subject.

132
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:45,719
You mean the killer.

133
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:46,988
Yeah.

134
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:49,006
Then just say that! Christ!

135
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:52,656
You think Danny would go out with me?

136
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:53,711
Danny?

137
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:58,223
A study says over 40 percent of female
police meet their spouses on the job.

138
00:06:58,263 --> 00:06:59,984
You wanna date again, fine.

139
00:07:00,024 --> 00:07:02,127
But why chase after a uni-cop
in our own station?

140
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,376
That's just lazy, son.

141
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,648
Get her out of uniform,
I'll bet she's a knockout.

142
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:07,056
Sign up for dance classes.

143
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:09,274
Take out an ad. Join a book club.

144
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:11,280
For God's sake, show some imagination.

145
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,234
No wonder your wife left you.

146
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:17,104
–Lucy had intimacy issues unrelated to me.
–Right, unrelated to you.

147
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:19,533
Buzzer, Sarge!
Yeah!

148
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:23,152
You're such an expert,
how come both your husbands left you?

149
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,936
It sure as hell
wasn't for a lack of imagination.

150
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:27,376
You got a missing kid?

151
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,415
Jenny Reeborg, 8 years old.
We found her mother stabbed to death.

152
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:31,383
Any leads?

153
00:07:31,448 --> 00:07:33,232
We're following some things up.

154
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:34,922
What have you got so far?

155
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:36,560
Her father's a crackhead.

156
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,111
Personal nature of the crime, his daughter
missing, he's gonna be our guy.

157
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:43,888
Also, a neighbor saw Ponyboy Harris
banging on the dead lady's door yesterday.

158
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:44,944
Who's Ponyboy Harris?

159
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:47,120
He's a local fence. Bit of a fancy.

160
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,776
Collared him three or four times personally.

161
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:52,528
You guys need anything run down, just ask.

162
00:07:52,568 --> 00:07:53,648
I wanna help.

163
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,407
Thanks, Captain.

164
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,054
Since when does he get his hands dirty?

165
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:00,689
Can't blame a guy for trying.

166
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:03,506
Danny, hey!

167
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,956
How's the coffee?

168
00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:09,170
Usual police issue?

169
00:08:09,624 --> 00:08:12,341
Pretty much.
There's a shock.

170
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,278
Listen, I don't…

171
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:18,063
I don't know what your plans are…

172
00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:20,591
Lookie here, Shane, it's the ladykiller!

173
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:21,936
Dutch boy, what's this I hear…

174
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:24,912
about some dead girl's sister
blowing you at the crime scene?

175
00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:26,602
Dutch man! Going to town!

176
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,331
You guys are sick.
Us?

177
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,936
You're the one getting your pipe smoked
by a grieving relative right by the body.

178
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:36,016
She was upset. I was comforting her.

179
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:38,960
You don't have to tell me
about the different stages of grief.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,574
There's denial, anger, sucking you off.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,148
If you can think of anything else,
you just call 911 and ask for Det. Blow Me.

182
00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:51,991
Excuse me.
“Detective Blow Me.”

183
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:54,864
Dutch, what?
Come on, don't be so sensitive.

184
00:08:54,904 --> 00:08:56,176
That was real classy.

185
00:08:56,216 --> 00:08:58,864
Come on. Dutch thinks he's
a notch above the rest of us.

186
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:00,592
I'm bringing him back down to earth.

187
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:02,225
That's big of you.

188
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:06,288
I gotta go run an errand,
but I was thinking…

189
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:08,048
you and I should get a drink tonight.

190
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:09,408
Is your wife coming?

191
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:12,752
Damn, she can't make it.
Damn, neither can I.

192
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,772
Since when did you get morals?

193
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,487
Always had them.
Sometimes I just lose track.

194
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:18,673
Really?

195
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,254
How's about you
lose track of them tonight?

196
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:24,582
Yeah, I don't think so.

197
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,016
You want me to back off?

198
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:30,383
All you gotta do is tell me it wasn't great.

199
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:33,204
You ready?

200
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:37,519
Yeah.

201
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:09,712
–Back to the barn.
–Who was that?

202
00:10:09,752 --> 00:10:10,798
–Back to the barn.
–Who was that?

203
00:10:10,838 --> 00:10:12,147
Guy I know.

204
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,806
I went through the books.

205
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,302
The guy I saw Mackey talking to
is a drug dealer named…

206
00:10:40,342 --> 00:10:42,000
Named Rondell Robinson.

207
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,150
Right.

208
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:45,102
You suggesting
Mackey's working for a dealer?

209
00:10:45,142 --> 00:10:47,022
I'm suggesting
he's working for Mackey.

210
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:49,070
What?
Robinson's main competition…

211
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,694
is a guy named Two-Time.

212
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,558
Mackey's been taking out all his dealers…

213
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:54,420
giving Robinson a monopoly.

214
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:57,198
A monopoly means
profits go up for Robinson…

215
00:10:57,238 --> 00:10:59,502
street violence goes down for Mackey.

216
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:01,876
And I want you to help me prove it.

217
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,132
Okay.

218
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:16,685
–Who's he?
–Moses Hernandez.

219
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,350
We went to SC together.

220
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,884
He's in Justice.

221
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,714
Moses, this is Terry.

222
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,182
It's good to meet you.

223
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:25,454
I didn't agree to be a witness
in a federal case.

224
00:11:25,494 --> 00:11:28,494
The friends Mackey has,
federal's the only way we'll nail him.

225
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:33,550
I go outside the department and rat out
another cop, my life's not worth crap in LA.

226
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,834
He's right.

227
00:11:35,414 --> 00:11:36,590
It's too dangerous.

228
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,838
He can't pull it off.

229
00:11:37,878 --> 00:11:39,198
I didn't say I that.

230
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:40,236
I know.

231
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,054
I just meant you need assurances
of an upside to all this.

232
00:11:43,094 --> 00:11:45,265
Such as?
Such as…

233
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:48,206
a guarantee of a job in Justice
when it's all over.

234
00:11:48,246 --> 00:11:51,534
You think I want to be an errand boy
in some Alaskan outpost?

235
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:53,092
You pick the city then.

236
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:56,564
Okay. Try the home office in DC.

237
00:11:56,822 --> 00:11:58,990
I'm gonna need moving expenses.
Sure.

238
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,747
Plus a car and a nice big fruit basket.

239
00:12:02,486 --> 00:12:04,942
I'm giving up my life,
you gotta give me something back.

240
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:06,062
I can make it happen.

241
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:08,366
Okay, no offense,
I'd like it in writing today.

242
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:09,902
Let's be clear here, Terry.

243
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:11,694
We're talking about making a case…

244
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:14,254
that puts Mackey
behind bars for a long time.

245
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:16,208
Because if we only wound him…

246
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:18,542
his friends upstairs will crush both of us.

247
00:12:18,582 --> 00:12:20,238
Yeah, I know what I have to do.

248
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:21,326
Good.

249
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:25,310
I know what I'm getting out of this.

250
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,078
What are you getting out of this?

251
00:12:28,118 --> 00:12:30,692
I just want a dirty cop off the street.

252
00:12:31,478 --> 00:12:37,088
You wanna be mayor someday, better learn
how to lie a hell of a lot better than that.

253
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,052
Ponyboy!

254
00:12:47,478 --> 00:12:48,590
Goddamn!

255
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:50,350
Claudette! Look what you made me do.

256
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,758
What is all this stuff?

257
00:12:51,798 --> 00:12:56,022
That? That's just a big bunch of VCRs
I stole from Circuit City.

258
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:00,430
I don't know anything about that girl.

259
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,926
All right? Be real.
You know me. Come on.

260
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:05,070
Why were you
at Nancy Reeborg's house yesterday?

261
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,278
I was looking for her old man, Lonnie.

262
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:09,102
Lonnie's not living there anymore.

263
00:13:09,142 --> 00:13:11,518
–I know that.
–You ever find Lonnie?

264
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:13,444
You know Bunny Jenkins?

265
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:16,750
Said he was using at this crack house
run by a guy named Monty.

266
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,430
I was gonna go there after I unloaded
the VCRs, which is when you showed up.

267
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,706
Okay. Good.
Good?

268
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:25,646
Now let's work out
this Circuit City misunderstanding.

269
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:26,864
Claudette?

270
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:35,697
Vic?
Yeah, what?

271
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:38,190
You know a crack house run
by some guy named Monty?

272
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,422
Yeah, sure. It's on Crescent,
just west of 7th. Why?

273
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:42,958
I gotta pick up a smokehound there.

274
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:43,980
No, no can do.

275
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:46,702
Monty gives me dirt,
I give him safe passage.

276
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,570
This guy might have
something to do with the missing girl.

277
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,422
All right, I'll go get him myself.

278
00:13:53,462 --> 00:13:55,534
The cards suck anyways.
Come on, Vic.

279
00:13:55,574 --> 00:13:56,696
No, I'm gonna go.

280
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:05,520
Shut up!

281
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,424
Vic.
Open.

282
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:13,104
Shut up!

283
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,998
Lonnie Reeborg. He here?

284
00:14:22,038 --> 00:14:24,678
–In there. Is there a problem?
–Show me.

285
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,025
Okay, Lonnie. Let's go.

286
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,070
Come on. Rise and shine.

287
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,933
You stop that.
Let's go!

288
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:39,765
What'd he do?

289
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,150
You got kids here.
It's Teacher Institute Day.

290
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,070
Where's their mom?
Buying supplies.

291
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,886
Jesus Christ, Monty.
You can't have kids around this place.

292
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:50,670
What am I supposed to do?
Stick them in a back room.

293
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,230
–Rent The Lion King.
–Someone stole the TV.

294
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,246
Then buy them some crayons
for Christ's sake!

295
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:57,596
Just keep them away from this shit.

296
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:01,969
Think back, Lonnie.

297
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:04,150
You killed your wife last night.

298
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,838
Why do you keep saying that?

299
00:15:05,878 --> 00:15:07,822
'Cause that's the God's truth, son.

300
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:09,998
–You can't lie to God.
–Or the crime lab.

301
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:11,790
Her blood's all over your shirt.

302
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,739
I don't even got a shirt.

303
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:15,091
It's evidence now.

304
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,429
Where's Jenny?

305
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:17,653
Jenny?

306
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,182
Where is your daughter?

307
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:20,718
I went there to pick her up.

308
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:22,897
Where is she?
I needed her.

309
00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:26,228
You remember killing Nancy?

310
00:15:27,318 --> 00:15:29,141
You remember the knife?

311
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,277
I just went there for Jenny.

312
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,249
Think, Lonnie.
You went over there…

313
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:37,739
I said that.
to get Jenny.

314
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:40,629
She's half mine.
Nancy made you angry.

315
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,286
She wouldn't let me take Jenny.

316
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:45,262
You didn't mean to kill her,
she made you do it.

317
00:15:45,302 --> 00:15:46,960
I didn't kill no one.

318
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,670
Think, Lonnie. What did you do to Nancy?

319
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:52,017
I don't feel good.

320
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:54,475
Concentrate!
What happened to Nancy?

321
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,452
I don't…
You gotta keep trying.

322
00:15:57,718 --> 00:15:59,027
I'm trying.

323
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:04,140
I went there to get Jenny.

324
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,091
Yeah.

325
00:16:06,838 --> 00:16:08,661
Nancy tried to stop me.

326
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,920
Keep going, Lonnie.

327
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:14,671
She had a knife.

328
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:18,930
What then?

329
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:23,029
I took it away from her.

330
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:31,763
What is it?

331
00:16:34,422 --> 00:16:36,081
What is it, Lonnie?

332
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:48,693
I killed her.

333
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,495
I killed my sweet Nancy!

334
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:57,967
And where's Jenny?

335
00:16:58,294 --> 00:17:00,116
What did I do that for?

336
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:02,032
'Cause you like crack?

337
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,572
My daughter!

338
00:17:03,638 --> 00:17:05,838
I told you from the start this guy did it.

339
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:07,438
Now where is she?

340
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:13,491
I sold her.

341
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:21,038
Sold her? You sold her to who?

342
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,144
He gave me $200.

343
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:27,061
Who did?
This guy.

344
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:29,900
He likes girls.

345
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:33,677
How come nobody stopped me?

346
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:39,445
I don't know.

347
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,317
Search warrant!

348
00:17:47,351 --> 00:17:48,341
Search warrant!

349
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:00,075
George Sawyer.

350
00:18:01,888 --> 00:18:03,676
Where's Jenny Reeborg?

351
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:09,663
“Sexy Schoolgirls.

352
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,418
Jane at 15.”

353
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:12,920
This is quite the reading list.

354
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,204
Where's my mother?

355
00:18:14,272 --> 00:18:16,824
–It's time for her medication.
–I'll make a call.

356
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:18,392
Make sure she gets her meds.

357
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,920
If you wanna hold this pervert's hand,
be my guest.

358
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,065
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

359
00:18:34,432 --> 00:18:35,708
Okay.

360
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:38,489
Who took my Ding Dongs?

361
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:40,504
Problem, Dutch Boy?

362
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:42,424
I had some Ding Dongs. They're gone now.

363
00:18:42,464 --> 00:18:43,292
Ding Dongs?

364
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,735
What are you, in kindergarten?
Look.

365
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,471
I've got a suspect
whose profile screams:

366
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:50,808
“Organized, humiliation-driven offender.”

367
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:52,440
Which means he won't crack easy.

368
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,256
Which means an interrogation
that will go on all night.

369
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:57,367
Which means I need my Ding Dongs…

370
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,935
and you took them. Didn't you?

371
00:18:58,975 --> 00:18:59,706
Right.

372
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:03,575
'Cause I can't make it through the night
without one of your precious Ding Dongs.

373
00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:05,912
Stay away from me,
and stay away from my desk.

374
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:07,577
We got an interview.

375
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,368
What are you all riled up about?

376
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:10,424
He took my Ding Dongs.

377
00:19:10,464 --> 00:19:13,398
Come on, son. Fork over his Ding Dongs.

378
00:19:17,663 --> 00:19:20,440
At my old squad,
people had respect for other people's…

379
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,658
Forget it!

380
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:24,376
How come everyone loves
this asshole so much?

381
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,167
Let's go, we've got an interview.

382
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,439
I think I saw some Twinkies
up in the break room.

383
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:30,063
It's not the same thing.

384
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:34,590
Here's your coffee.

385
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:37,175
When you gonna call about
my mom's pills?

386
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:38,742
In a minute.

387
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:40,796
I got nothing to hide.

388
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,200
I know.

389
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,677
Tell me something.

390
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,196
Think there's something wrong
with gay people?

391
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:52,986
Something wrong?

392
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:54,455
In the head, you know.

393
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,752
With queers, I mean,
you think they got a screw loose?

394
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:00,093
I don't know.
Not so long ago…

395
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:02,424
medical community
classified homosexuality…

396
00:20:02,464 --> 00:20:03,609
as a disorder.

397
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,066
Called it an illness.

398
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,367
Yeah?

399
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:09,463
Now scientists think maybe it's
some gene that makes people gay.

400
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:10,485
So?

401
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,239
For booking.

402
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,735
So if God made 'em that way…

403
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:19,640
who are we to say they're wrong
for doing the things they do?

404
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,338
It got me thinking.

405
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:23,096
What if scientists discovered…

406
00:20:23,136 --> 00:20:25,687
there's a gene
that predisposes some people…

407
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,773
to be attracted to young girls?

408
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:31,227
You think there is? In some people?

409
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,461
Why not?

410
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:37,148
And if scientists discover that gene, then…

411
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,056
Then maybe people won't think…

412
00:20:40,096 --> 00:20:43,132
it's so wrong
to have sex with underage girls.

413
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:46,044
Maybe not.

414
00:20:47,776 --> 00:20:50,284
Forgot to call about your mom's pills.

415
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,940
How's the car running, Miguel?

416
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:10,074
It's leaking oil.

417
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,600
Yeah, these old cars
always need a lot of work.

418
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,320
Must be a handy guy
with these tools laying around though.

419
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,920
No pliers though.

420
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:18,552
Miguel's not too fond of pliers.

421
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:20,534
I can't say I blame him.

422
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:22,903
Where's your lawyer, Miguel?

423
00:21:23,488 --> 00:21:25,081
I don't know.

424
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,536
Miguel Esteana's dropping his complaint
against you.

425
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:40,504
Told you it was bogus.

426
00:21:40,544 --> 00:21:43,576
I'd like your incident report
first thing tomorrow morning.

427
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:47,864
Sure. It'll be a couple of days.
I got something on the back burner.

428
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,562
It's not a request.

429
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:51,448
Tomorrow morning.

430
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,160
You'll get my report in a couple of days.
Maybe a week.

431
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,720
You don't like the timetable,
you take it up with Gilroy.

432
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,776
I don't have to.

433
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:01,020
In this building, I'm in charge.

434
00:22:02,624 --> 00:22:04,631
Maybe in your own mind, amigo.

435
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,480
But in the real world,
I don't answer to you.

436
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,886
Not today, not tomorrow,
not even on Cinco de Mayo.

437
00:22:17,728 --> 00:22:18,807
You call for the police?

438
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:20,631
Yeah, about two and a half hours ago.

439
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:21,687
What's the problem?

440
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:24,856
What you think the problem is?
Look at my goddamn tires!

441
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:26,424
Someone slashed your tires?

442
00:22:26,464 --> 00:22:28,603
Was the real police busy today?

443
00:22:30,304 --> 00:22:33,934
–Any idea who might have done this?
–Lamar. He's my ex.

444
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,016
I see he wasn't handling
his responsibilities as a man.

445
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,252
I see that, I got no choice
but to step in.

446
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:43,671
Did you witness
this Lamar slash your tires?

447
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:45,752
Yeah, bro. I got the whole thing
on tape.

448
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:47,801
Come on, man.
The brother dumb, but he ain't stupid.

449
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:48,921
Are you gonna go arrest him?

450
00:22:48,961 --> 00:22:49,624
Are you gonna go arrest him?

451
00:22:49,664 --> 00:22:50,852
We'll talk to him.

452
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:54,648
In the meantime, can you think of anyone
else who might have slashed your tires?

453
00:22:54,688 --> 00:22:55,833
Like who?

454
00:22:56,447 --> 00:22:58,302
Maybe a business associate?

455
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:00,347
Business associate?

456
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:02,680
What, you tryin' to imply something?

457
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,574
Nah. I'm just wondering…

458
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,869
why you got a $30·000 car
with $500 tires…

459
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:10,774
parked outside of a
$400-a-month apartment.

460
00:23:26,016 --> 00:23:28,087
Give me the goddamn money for this…

461
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:29,654
You, go to work.

462
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,230
Dmitri. Heard you got paroled.

463
00:23:34,687 --> 00:23:36,536
I see you got your old job back.

464
00:23:36,576 --> 00:23:38,616
I'm just temping
for somebody who got the flu.

465
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:40,063
Hand it over.

466
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:44,597
Bankroll, too.

467
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:48,434
Come on, Mackey, man.
That's just my playing-around coin.

468
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,016
DMITRI: This ain't right.
Get lost.

469
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:54,298
Yes, sir.

470
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,199
What did I tell you last week?

471
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:00,021
No more free passes, right?

472
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:03,102
–I know.
–Let's go. Come on.

473
00:24:13,247 --> 00:24:15,222
Any news on Two-Time's party?

474
00:24:15,296 --> 00:24:17,804
It's definitely on
for Saturday night.

475
00:24:18,464 --> 00:24:19,511
Sure?

476
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,822
'Cause I gotta be sure.

477
00:24:22,687 --> 00:24:24,411
He called up Ringo…

478
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,978
and asked for his four best girls
for Saturday night.

479
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,316
Guess I got left off the list.

480
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:35,552
Look like you lost some weight.
You been eating?

481
00:24:36,383 --> 00:24:38,325
Sure, after business hours.

482
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,864
I'll give you some money. Skip a couple
of tricks, get yourself some soup.

483
00:24:43,904 --> 00:24:45,560
I don't need your money, Vic.

484
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,087
Here. You look thin. Get some soup.

485
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,788
Don't worry about me, Vic.

486
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,480
I get by.

487
00:24:56,224 --> 00:24:57,631
Where's your boy?

488
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:02,524
With my mom.

489
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,256
Yeah. Get him some soup, too.

490
00:25:15,424 --> 00:25:18,174
–You're sweet, Vic.
–Go see your son.

491
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,811
I got a daughter. 14 next month.

492
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:30,552
She's got a few friends,
like to come over…

493
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:33,112
hang out, do homework,
that kind of thing.

494
00:25:33,152 --> 00:25:36,188
I don't know anything
about that missing girl.

495
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:38,750
You know who Britney Spears is?

496
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,767
I've seen videos.

497
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:42,392
My daughter's got these friends…

498
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:45,080
who like to dress up
like Britney Spears.

499
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,967
Tight jeans, cutoff T-shirts.

500
00:25:50,496 --> 00:25:51,903
13 years old.

501
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,085
She's got this one friend.

502
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,338
Natalie.

503
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:00,150
I'm telling you…

504
00:26:00,704 --> 00:26:02,936
I know I shouldn't be thinking
what I'm thinking…

505
00:26:02,976 --> 00:26:05,623
but the way this goddamn girl looks,
I mean…

506
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:08,600
She may not be a woman yet,
but you can't call her a girl either.

507
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,528
You know what I'm saying?

508
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:13,910
Thirteen's a good age.

509
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,429
Yeah, I bet it is.

510
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,979
Can I get you some more coffee?

511
00:26:28,512 --> 00:26:30,360
I didn't know he had a daughter.

512
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,222
He doesn't.

513
00:26:34,656 --> 00:26:36,440
What's your take on Vic Mackey?

514
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,007
How do you mean?

515
00:26:38,144 --> 00:26:39,835
You know what I mean.

516
00:26:41,152 --> 00:26:42,581
I hear things.

517
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:45,816
But as long as he's producing
on the street, he's got friends.

518
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:47,644
Gilroy, even the chief.

519
00:26:47,712 --> 00:26:50,265
So he's bulletproof?
From you, yeah.

520
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:53,848
I know what everybody here thinks.

521
00:26:53,888 --> 00:26:56,824
I'm a test taker.
I didn't earn it on the street.

522
00:26:56,864 --> 00:27:00,184
Came time to name a new captain,
I was the right color at the right time.

523
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,775
You think taking on Mackey's
gonna change people's minds?

524
00:27:02,815 --> 00:27:04,376
I'm just talking.

525
00:27:05,695 --> 00:27:09,560
Right now, Vic Mackey must look like
a mighty big catch to you.

526
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,771
Do the smart thing though, son.

527
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,050
Cut bait.

528
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,255
It doesn't bother you,
the things he does?

529
00:27:15,295 --> 00:27:17,944
–I don't judge other cops.
–Mackey's not a cop.

530
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:19,512
He's Al Capone with a badge.

531
00:27:19,552 --> 00:27:22,552
Al Capone made money
by giving people what they wanted.

532
00:27:22,592 --> 00:27:24,312
What people want these days…

533
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:27,512
is to make it to their class
without getting mugged.

534
00:27:27,552 --> 00:27:30,455
Come home from work,
see their stereo still there.

535
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:32,312
Hear about some murder in the barrio…

536
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:34,968
find out the next day
the police caught the guy.

537
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:36,664
If having all that means some cop…

538
00:27:36,704 --> 00:27:38,808
roughs up some nigger or spic
in the ghetto…

539
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:40,600
as far as most people are concerned…

540
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,647
it's don't ask, don't tell.

541
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,907
How you figure on changing that?

542
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:00,481
Lamar Tilton?

543
00:28:00,808 --> 00:28:01,790
Yeah?

544
00:28:01,864 --> 00:28:04,928
We're investigating vandalism to a car
owned by your ex-girlfriend.

545
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:06,882
You mean the tires I slashed?

546
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:08,360
Yeah.

547
00:28:08,424 --> 00:28:09,792
You admit to vandalizing the car?

548
00:28:09,832 --> 00:28:10,781
Sure. Why not?

549
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,480
How about 'cause the car isn't yours?

550
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,869
I gave that skank $1·500
on her down payment.

551
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:19,584
Day after she makes the delivery,
she kicks me out…

552
00:28:19,624 --> 00:28:23,265
then gives the car to this scrawny bitch
she's been balling on the side.

553
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:26,469
–Your point being?
–My point being $1·500!

554
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:28,032
Shit.

555
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:30,945
The way I figure it,
that at least make the tires mine.

556
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:33,632
Look, you tell that bitch
if she got a problem with that…

557
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:35,363
she know where I am.

558
00:28:37,128 --> 00:28:39,136
Now this is all wrong, man.

559
00:28:40,073 --> 00:28:41,250
Jewelry.

560
00:28:41,832 --> 00:28:43,648
You see that new guy she's with?

561
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:44,744
Yeah, I saw him.

562
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:48,438
Then you know what kind of prick
I'm dealing with here.

563
00:28:48,873 --> 00:28:50,596
So where's the love?

564
00:28:50,664 --> 00:28:53,534
Bible. Galatians, chapter 7, verse 6.

565
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,353
“For whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap.”

566
00:28:56,393 --> 00:28:58,901
You can stop with the sermon, Grandma.

567
00:28:59,177 --> 00:29:00,416
When I'm gettin' outta here?

568
00:29:00,456 --> 00:29:03,162
As soon as you arraign
and you post bail.

569
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,664
You got anything else?

570
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:07,231
How much bail gonna be?

571
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:08,869
$200, $300.

572
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:11,357
$200? I don't got that kind of cash.

573
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,256
How were you able
to afford this jewelry then?

574
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,672
I don't gotta explain myself to you.

575
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:21,217
Lonnie knew I liked them young.

576
00:29:21,257 --> 00:29:23,489
He needed money.
Said I could do whatever I wanted…

577
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:24,990
to his girl for $200.

578
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:26,144
When he brought her by…

579
00:29:26,184 --> 00:29:28,641
it was obvious
she was like seven, eight years old.

580
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:29,824
Was that a problem?

581
00:29:29,864 --> 00:29:31,904
I told Lonnie I like 'em 12 or 13.

582
00:29:31,944 --> 00:29:34,305
Like you were talking about,
developed a little.

583
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:35,648
You must have been disappointed.

584
00:29:35,688 --> 00:29:39,103
Yeah, but Lonnie'd
already spent the money, so…

585
00:29:39,656 --> 00:29:41,664
Even though I didn't want her,
the girl was…

586
00:29:41,704 --> 00:29:43,008
you know, she was still mine.

587
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,032
So you got rid of her?

588
00:29:44,072 --> 00:29:45,194
I don't hurt 'em.

589
00:29:45,544 --> 00:29:48,414
I like 'em to like me. Romantic-like.

590
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:50,881
Things just didn't work out this time.

591
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:52,256
What'd you do with her?

592
00:29:52,296 --> 00:29:53,540
I traded her.

593
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:55,328
You traded her?

594
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,928
To a doctor I met on the Internet.

595
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:58,240
He likes them 7 or 8.

596
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,481
He came right over and picked her up.

597
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:01,797
You traded her?

598
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,549
I was out $200.

599
00:30:03,753 --> 00:30:05,793
What'd this doctor trade you?

600
00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:07,774
A girl to be named later.

601
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,564
You know,
like the kind of trades ball teams make.

602
00:30:11,816 --> 00:30:12,929
Right.

603
00:30:20,808 --> 00:30:23,175
That's a nice boat.
Thanks.

604
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,472
I take the kids
up to Lake Powell every year.

605
00:30:25,512 --> 00:30:26,912
You know, fishing and swimming.

606
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:29,312
–Sounds great.
–Two weeks' vacation doesn't make up…

607
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:30,656
for a year of double shifts…

608
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,544
but the kids really look forward to it.

609
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:33,574
How's the meat?

610
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,585
Five more minutes,
you can bring out the buns.

611
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,607
Great.

612
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,233
Did you tell Matthew
he could keep a spider in his room?

613
00:30:39,273 --> 00:30:40,641
That's for a school project.

614
00:30:40,681 --> 00:30:42,721
If that thing gets loose…
It won't.

615
00:30:42,761 --> 00:30:44,081
Yeah, it better not.

616
00:30:44,104 --> 00:30:46,439
It won't.
Better not.

617
00:30:50,088 --> 00:30:52,794
What did I tell you
about jumping in the…

618
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:55,639
They grow up too quick.

619
00:30:55,945 --> 00:30:58,083
Especially with the job we got.

620
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,216
Yeah, what you're doing though,
has to be done.

621
00:31:01,256 --> 00:31:02,685
You think?

622
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,101
Absolutely.

623
00:31:04,744 --> 00:31:07,328
My dad was a cop.
He admired guys like you.

624
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:10,368
Those were some
honest-to-goodness men back then.

625
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:13,790
Guys like Captain Aceveda,
they never understand.

626
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:17,276
What do you expect
from a damn quota baby?

627
00:31:19,976 --> 00:31:22,625
I think I could be a lot
more useful to you.

628
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:24,909
You know, do more than just drive.

629
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:25,983
Yeah?

630
00:31:26,057 --> 00:31:28,480
Yeah. I know why you've been reluctant
to include me.

631
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,064
You got a team. You watch out for
each other, know how the others will move.

632
00:31:32,104 --> 00:31:34,282
You'd kill to protect each other.

633
00:31:34,408 --> 00:31:36,577
It's all about trust,
otherwise, you end up dead.

634
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:37,664
Yeah.

635
00:31:39,112 --> 00:31:40,574
Listen.

636
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,328
Up till now,
Two-Time's has been impossible to nail.

637
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,376
Never keeps drugs at his place
until tonight.

638
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:47,008
Yeah, what's so special about tonight?

639
00:31:47,048 --> 00:31:48,992
He's gearing up for a big bash
tomorrow night.

640
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,744
He's got a bunch of coke
he's handing out as party favors.

641
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,792
Our one chance to nail him with the goods.

642
00:31:53,832 --> 00:31:56,221
–Lock and load, baby.
–Yeah!

643
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,816
This is not gonna be
any beauty pageant, ladies.

644
00:31:58,856 --> 00:32:00,192
He's got steel-enforced doors…

645
00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:03,264
so we go through a window
and be fast before he starts flushing.

646
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:04,608
Knock, knock, who's there?

647
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:07,624
Strike Team, Mr Drug Dealer.

648
00:32:07,944 --> 00:32:10,976
And on top of that,
Terry here is losing his cherry tonight.

649
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:13,760
He's coming with us.
Terry is losing his cherry.

650
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,003
Welcome aboard. Congratulations.

651
00:32:17,512 --> 00:32:20,000
Remember, the team comes first.

652
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:22,464
We take care of each other, all right?

653
00:32:22,504 --> 00:32:24,773
–Cheers.
–Cheers.

654
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,600
We just have a few more questions.

655
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,550
–Dr Grady.
–Right, Dr Grady.

656
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:33,184
And I have a practice to attend to…

657
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:36,320
patients to see, so charge me
with something or release me.

658
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,951
Do you know who Jenny Reeborg is?

659
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:39,360
DR. No.
George Sawyer says…

660
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,432
he gave Jenny to you
for the purpose of sexual intercourse.

661
00:32:42,472 --> 00:32:44,479
I don't even know the man.

662
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:46,847
You tell us where Jenny is…

663
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:48,992
we'll get the DA to make a favorable offer.

664
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:50,821
Charge me or release me.

665
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,149
We'll see what we can do.

666
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:55,908
Tell me something.

667
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:58,336
As a man of science, I'd like your opinion.

668
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,310
Is homosexuality genetic or environment?

669
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:03,136
The latest studies suggest it's genetic.

670
00:33:03,176 --> 00:33:05,478
Really? Just the way they are?

671
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:07,072
Can't help themselves, huh?

672
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:09,422
I see where you're going with this.

673
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:11,041
Don't waste my time.

674
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,770
Or yours.

675
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:15,911
I've got plenty of time.

676
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:18,374
I'm bored.

677
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:20,454
Charge me or release me.

678
00:33:22,888 --> 00:33:25,696
This guy is definitely
a domination-control pedophile.

679
00:33:25,736 --> 00:33:27,167
Is he capable of killing her?

680
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:28,451
Fits the profile.

681
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:31,104
–Let him sit for a couple hours, try again.
–Couple hours?

682
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:34,239
Girl's missing since yesterday morning.
Has she got food or water?

683
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,704
–I can break him by the end of the day.
–Take all week.

684
00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:38,400
There's no way this pecker's gonna talk.

685
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,576
I know what buttons to push
with this guy.

686
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:41,824
I'm smarter than he is.

687
00:33:41,864 --> 00:33:44,128
This is not a quiz show, Dutch.
Lose the ego.

688
00:33:44,168 --> 00:33:45,472
Think about Jenny Reeborg.

689
00:33:45,512 --> 00:33:47,690
I am. You got a better plan?
Yes.

690
00:33:47,752 --> 00:33:48,734
Let him go.

691
00:33:48,808 --> 00:33:50,112
–Let him go?
–We tail him.

692
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:53,184
If we lose him, first thing he'll do is
kill her, dump the body.

693
00:33:53,224 --> 00:33:54,592
Look, I can break this guy.

694
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,224
Your way will get her killed.

695
00:33:56,264 --> 00:33:57,693
So will yours!

696
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:02,340
Anywhere in here.

697
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,022
What about attack dogs? I hate dogs.

698
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:07,365
I need you.

699
00:34:21,096 --> 00:34:22,623
And who are you?

700
00:34:24,424 --> 00:34:25,700
DR. Who is he?

701
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,539
You know what you're doing, son?

702
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,544
What's in the bag?

703
00:34:53,096 --> 00:34:54,812
DR. What's that stuff for?

704
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,904
That's what I'm gonna use to get you
to tell me where Jenny Reeborg is.

705
00:34:59,944 --> 00:35:01,660
Your turn to play bad cop?

706
00:35:01,672 --> 00:35:05,152
No. Good cop and bad cop left for the day.

707
00:35:06,664 --> 00:35:08,671
I'm a different kind of cop.

708
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:14,112
I'm ready to see my lawyer now.

709
00:35:14,152 --> 00:35:15,362
Later.

710
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:18,625
Right now it's just you and me.

711
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,542
People are watching us.

712
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:26,144
I got a little girl back at home.

713
00:35:26,184 --> 00:35:29,315
8-year-old daughter. Her name is Cassidy.

714
00:35:30,056 --> 00:35:31,648
What do you say I bring her down here?

715
00:35:31,688 --> 00:35:33,664
Let you stick your dick in her.

716
00:35:33,704 --> 00:35:35,024
How'd you like that?

717
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,342
–What?
–You know.

718
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:40,170
Suck her tits a little bit maybe?

719
00:35:41,064 --> 00:35:42,471
Not interested.

720
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:46,528
So you want to have some other guy's
little girl, but not my Cassidy?

721
00:35:46,568 --> 00:35:48,064
What's up with that, man?

722
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:51,232
I'd like to take a look
at this Jenny for myself.

723
00:35:51,272 --> 00:35:54,110
See what she's got
that my Cassidy doesn't.

724
00:35:54,536 --> 00:35:56,648
I'm sure you could arrange that.

725
00:35:56,936 --> 00:35:58,560
I don't know where the girl is.

726
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,316
Her name is Jenny Reeborg.

727
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,808
I'm giving you one chance
to let me know where you're hiding her.

728
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:05,790
I'm sorry. I wish I could…

729
00:36:15,432 --> 00:36:16,992
DR. You're the police!

730
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:48,663
He's got a basement apartment
under a fake name.

731
00:36:48,703 --> 00:36:49,912
Jenny's there alone.

732
00:36:49,952 --> 00:36:52,196
Last he knew, she was still alive.

733
00:36:55,968 --> 00:36:58,344
You got something to say, Dutch boy?

734
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,510
Like, “Thanks for solving my case”?

735
00:37:02,911 --> 00:37:04,700
Just glad I could help!

736
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:41,944
Jenny?

737
00:37:47,552 --> 00:37:49,242
Watch out.

738
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:54,068
Come on, goddamn it. Come on!

739
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:08,404
It's okay, baby.

740
00:38:09,055 --> 00:38:10,004
Jenny.

741
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,283
Jenny, you're safe now, sweetie.

742
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:14,166
You're safe now.

743
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:22,387
No way, man. I ain't got to listen to you.

744
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:25,175
Dutch.

745
00:38:25,823 --> 00:38:27,224
Heard you found your missing girl.

746
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:31,224
Yeah, guy turned out to be
a domination-control sociopath.

747
00:38:31,295 --> 00:38:33,565
Had her locked in this cage thing.

748
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:35,160
Good thing you took him out.

749
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,094
Yeah.

750
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,357
So what are you doing here?

751
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:40,056
Your shift was over this morning.

752
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:41,622
As I… Right?

753
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,143
Wickman and Greenwalt called in sick
and me and Julien worked a double.

754
00:38:45,183 --> 00:38:46,198
I hate doubles.

755
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:47,640
I'm on my way home now.

756
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,298
Listen, I was gonna grab a beer…

757
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:53,015
with some of my old buddies
from Sunset in case…

758
00:38:53,055 --> 00:38:55,191
you wanna tag along?
–That'd be great.

759
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:58,046
–Great.
–But I'm not free…

760
00:38:58,111 --> 00:38:58,972
tonight.

761
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,975
I mean, my friend Betsy set me up
on this blind date.

762
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:03,863
It's probably gonna be a nightmare and…

763
00:39:03,903 --> 00:39:05,725
No, it sounds like fun.

764
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:07,448
So some other time, okay?

765
00:39:07,488 --> 00:39:09,816
I'd love to go out
with you and the guys and stuff…

766
00:39:09,856 --> 00:39:11,832
and hear some of the old stories.

767
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,206
–What's that smell?
–What?

768
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:15,962
You don't smell that?

769
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:17,940
Oh, man. Yeah.

770
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,309
What is that?

771
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:28,445
It's dog shit. Jesus Christ.

772
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:32,273
All right. Whoever did this
better clean it up right now.

773
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,719
It's you, isn't it? You clean this up,
or I'm gonna shove it down your throat.

774
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:39,581
You got the wrong guy.

775
00:39:39,647 --> 00:39:41,559
I promise you, I am not gonna rest…

776
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,543
until the culprit is brought to justice.

777
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,241
Attention, everyone.

778
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:47,416
I'm declaring this an official crime scene.

779
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,888
Nobody leaves here
without providing a stool sample.

780
00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:54,205
Who gets to bag the evidence?

781
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:02,103
Some prank.
Yeah.

782
00:40:03,391 --> 00:40:06,552
You know,
I once heard about this old cop tradition.

783
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:10,007
Anytime someone in the squad
started getting a big head…

784
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:13,047
some other cop
would put dog crap in his locker.

785
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:14,265
Or desk.

786
00:40:15,263 --> 00:40:17,303
Remind him he's just one guy.

787
00:40:17,535 --> 00:40:19,095
Part of the team.

788
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:22,645
You heard about that?

789
00:42:27,528 --> 00:42:28,837
TWO-Give me that.

790
00:42:30,823 --> 00:42:31,968
Get up.

791
08:37:49,835 --> 08:37:50,794

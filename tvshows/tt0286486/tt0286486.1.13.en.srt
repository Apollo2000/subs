1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,280
Previously on The Shield:

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,320
- Got a double homicide in the Grove.
- It took you over an hour to show up.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,240
- Where's the police? Where are you?
- Someone leaked the 911 tapes.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,840
- Shit.
- We got a situation brewing.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,160
I know you're angry.
This is a serious problem.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,440
Wouldn't be no problem
in Beverly Hills.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,120
I was in a hit-and-run tonight.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,120
Tony!

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,960
I go to check on him and his buddy
took shots at me. That's his buddy.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,640
- He shot at me.
- Good friends to have, Jesus.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,160
- Yeah, if I keep quiet.
- You call me anytime.

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,520
- Jesus Christ! What did you do?
- Nothing you haven't done.

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,400
When were you gonna tell me you're
shagging a Latina?

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,720
- I didn't wanna get her involved.
- Who is she?

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,240
- Sedona Tellez.
- Sedona Tellez is listed as a CEO...

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,840
...of a corporation based in the Grand
Cayman Islands. Its sole purpose?

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,040
Buying up real estate
here in Farmington.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,760
You've been manipulating police
resources to crash land value?

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,600
Your mistress has been buying up
property in this area like Disney.

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,120
- She never checked into the bungalow.
- Another lie?

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,680
- Maybe he stashed her someplace else.
- Or slashed her.

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,440
I'm gonna miss dinner tonight.

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,320
- But Ben's already here.
- Gilroy's there?

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,360
- What are you doing at my house?
- You should've left Sedona out of it.

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,960
Pack bags for you and the kids.
You're not staying here.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,280
- What? This is our house.
- It isn't safe.

27
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,840
The police department is ordering
you to disperse.

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,040
The men are coming under
increased attack.

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,760
It's time to pull back
or turn them loose.

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,840
I wish I knew.

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,280
Send them in.

32
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,680
I'm getting reports of a casualty.

33
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,160
Civilian. Female.

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,160
Rescue standing by outside,
affirmative.

35
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,160
- One Tango 13, respond.
- Connor and Adelaide.

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,040
- One Tango 13 responding.
- One Tango 19 responding also.

37
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,400
Hey, wait a minute. This is our call.

38
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,960
It's a crazy night out here.
You might need backup.

39
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,440
Hit the lights. Go around the park.
Don't let them beat us there.

40
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,400
- Keep them comfortable and calm.
- You got it.

41
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,600
- You mind sleeping on the couch?
- Hell, no. I've had worse.

42
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,600
- Cool. Just lay low until I find Gilroy.
- Okay.

43
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,520
- They're all asleep.
- Good.

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,920
You wanna tell me
why my children are in danger?

45
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,160
- They're not.
- Why are we living like refugees?

46
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,720
- I have to find out a few things.
- I wanna go home.

47
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,600
- We can't.
- Why not? What've you done?

48
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,120
What are you mixed up in? This doesn't
happen to other cops' families.

49
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,360
What are you doing that's worth
making us go into hiding?

50
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,280
I just need the four of you to stay here.
All right?

51
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,840
- We should've taken Caravelle.
- We'd still be at the park if you had.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,920
- Guess we'll never know.
- Hey, was that a false alarm or what?

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,760
Oh, my God!

54
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,640
Officer down! One Tango 13!
Officer down! Rudy!

55
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,800
- Paula?
- He's dead.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,360
- What?
- Up.

57
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,080
Come on.

58
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,320
Come on.

59
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,480
- Get down!
- There's more than one of them!

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,200
Up there!

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,640
They're gone.

62
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,600
Paula.

63
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,680
Paula.

64
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,480
- What happened?
- Someone made a bogus 911 call.

65
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,520
When the units responded,
they opened fire.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,120
Thanks, Chris.

67
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,760
Who got hit?

68
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,400
Rudy's dead.

69
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,160
Paula's bad but has a chance. Danny
and Julien were there. They're okay.

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,000
Is this because of the dead women
who got stood up by 911?

71
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,200
- Yeah, looks like it.
- I want a shot at the SOB who did this.

72
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,760
Get in line.

73
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,280
Line starts here.

74
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,520
Hey. How you doing?

75
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,040
They killed him,
and Paula's really hurt.

76
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,840
I know.

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,880
We traced the 911 call to a cell phone.

78
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Who's it registered to?

79
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,440
Police! On the ground, asshole!

80
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,200
- Hey, hey, hold up.
- Don't move!

81
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,080
Hey. All right. Nobody shoot, man!

82
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,120
- Where's your cell phone?
- I don't know. Maybe I lost it.

83
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,320
You hear about the cops
that got shot, Cyrus?

84
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,720
- Your cell was used to lure them there.
- I say I lost my cell.

85
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,680
Why don't you tell us for the third time
you got no idea how?

86
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,960
Don't get all surly with me.

87
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,960
Ain't a crime to lose your cell phone.

88
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,560
Hey, Dutch. You still on top
of this hit-and-run thing?

89
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,320
Yeah.

90
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,600
Any luck on the whereabouts
of our driver's girlfriend?

91
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,840
- You kept insisting it's a waste of time.
- What? You want me to say it?

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,920
Maybe I was wrong. What do you got?

93
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,040
Sedona Tellez used to work in
accounting for the department.

94
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,280
- What, our department?
- Yeah. Down at headquarters.

95
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,760
Two months into the job she's buying
up Farmington property with this...

96
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,600
...Cayman Island shell company.
- Did you cut through the paper trail?

97
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,080
All the land transactions went through
the same escrow company.

98
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,240
- Did you talk to them?
- Without a warrant, they won't let me.

99
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,440
How about letting me
take a shot at it?

100
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,000
Really?

101
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,880
I just wanna keep my fingers busy till
we find out if this guy's gonna crack.

102
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,520
Gilroy's not at home or his office.
The guy's a goddamn ghost.

103
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,280
- He's gotta be somewhere.
- Who knows where he'll be next?

104
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,040
Your house again? My house?
We have to find him before he finds us.

105
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,240
- Maybe he's hiding with the mistress.
- Oh, come on. He killed her.

106
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,040
- We don't know that.
- He threatened your family.

107
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,840
Brings up Terry dying.
He's taking his last breaths.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,360
Will you stop making threats
and start helping me find the guy?

109
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,800
Now, dig in.

110
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,040
When did we start catching guys
by diving into financial records?

111
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,920
If Gilroy's gonna cash in on these
deals, he needs the girl's signature.

112
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,240
When we find this Sedona,
we find him.

113
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,880
Though I walk through
the midst of trouble...

114
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,320
...your hand will revive me.

115
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,400
- You will stretch out...
- Ready?

116
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,880
- Sorry.
- It's all right. I'm...

117
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,200
- You're shaking.
- No. I'm...

118
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,240
Julien, look, it's okay to be scared.

119
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,920
It is. I mean, you were almost
in a situation...

120
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,520
I almost lost my partner last night.

121
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,720
I'm just thankful.

122
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,200
Yeah, me too.

123
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,200
- This isn't the first phone you've lost.
- Excuse me?

124
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,440
I've talked to seven
wireless companies.

125
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,960
You've either had a phone lost or
cloned by each and every one of them.

126
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,040
- Always on the first of the month.
- Bill time.

127
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,840
You sell the phone to some grifter.
You wait a few days, report it missing.

128
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,680
Meanwhile, half of Union Station
is calling up Guatemala.

129
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,400
Or 911. That makes you
a felony accomplice.

130
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,160
Wait a minute, man. All I could tell you
is who I sell the phones to.

131
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,400
I wouldn't get mixed up
in no cop killings or nothing like that.

132
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,120
I mean, you guys
are the real heroes out there, right?

133
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,680
- Stop kissing ass and give us a name.
- His name is Igal.

134
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,000
- He's one of those Jews.
- Those Jews?

135
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,560
He's not American Jew. He's a real
Jew from Jerusalem or something.

136
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
- There's been another 911 shooting.
- What?

137
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,960
They got Patrick and Chris.
They're both dead.

138
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,120
- You see that?
- They took his badge.

139
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,200
Chris' too.

140
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,240
Jesus.

141
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,280
You know one of these vultures
saw something useful.

142
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,360
Wanna try the smoke-out?

143
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,080
Yeah.

144
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,960
Excuse me. Detective Vendrell.

145
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,880
Had reports someone
witnessed a crime or the perpetrator.

146
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,600
- What report?
- There wasn't one.

147
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,680
A woman was here when it
occurred. She didn't see the crime...

148
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,400
...but she did see another witness.
She's gonna be here in a few minutes...

149
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,600
...to identify you, so you may as well
come forward right now.

150
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,440
You, stop! Stop right there!

151
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,000
Stop!

152
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,480
Don't make me shoot you, asshole!

153
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,040
Stop!

154
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,400
- All right, you start talking!
- I didn't do nothing, man.

155
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,840
All right. Fine.

156
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,440
You're not a witness, then you're
an arrest, and this is just enough...

157
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,840
...to make you a trafficker.
- You can't do that.

158
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,440
What? Bust drug dealers?
You just made my quota for the week.

159
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,680
- Come on!
- Okay, look, man, I'll tell you.

160
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,720
- You just gotta get that rock off me.
- The whole truth first.

161
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,400
All right, look. I heard shots, man.

162
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,120
I see two cops go down, then someone
go over and mess with the body.

163
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
- Who?
- There's three of them, man.

164
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,680
- Blacks?
- Yeah. Two brothers and a sister, man.

165
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,920
Now, can you take the dope with you?
Please, man. Come on, man.

166
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,720
Have them secure the areas
before going in.

167
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,400
- Our artist just finished.
- How many copies did you run?

168
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,160
- Five thousand.
- Make it 10.

169
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,640
I'll talk to my contacts on the street.
Someone's gotta know these guys.

170
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,560
No one talks to the press but me.

171
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,480
I want every off-duty officer scrambled
and in this building within 45 minutes.

172
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,400
Wagenbach, why are you
sitting there?

173
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,880
I'm working a hit-and-run.

174
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,080
Well, stop. We got cops bleeding in
the streets. Half the district's on fire.

175
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,360
There's no other case. You and
Claudette will run the investigation.

176
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,120
- I was handling this personally.
- Not anymore.

177
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,320
Are you shitting me with this?

178
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,240
You had command of the riot squad
and a lady got trampled to death.

179
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,920
The shootings last night, I stayed out
of it, and now I got two more dead.

180
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,920
- I can't afford your leadership now.
- We're making progress.

181
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,440
Not enough. If you wanna cry
to the chief, give him a call.

182
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,480
But do it downstairs, because
I'm taking over your office.

183
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,400
Pete, I need the case file,
duty roster...

184
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,840
...and a cup of coffee,
not too much cream.

185
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,360
Pete, could you wait for a minute
outside, please?

186
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,560
Stay close in case
I need you, though.

187
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,560
- What do you want, Vic?
- You threatened my family.

188
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,920
If I wanted to hurt them, I could've.

189
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,840
You kept digging into Sedona and our
land deals. I was just refocusing you.

190
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,840
You know what you did.

191
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,320
- You know what I'm gonna have to do.
- You're not doing anything.

192
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,200
Not now. But soon.

193
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,400
You think I'd take you on
without insurance?

194
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,400
Trust me, I got something on you.

195
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,360
You bastard.

196
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,640
You hit that kid,
come begging to me for help?

197
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,880
- Call me friend?
- Stop chasing after me and Sedona.

198
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,360
Do what you do best.
Find these cop killers.

199
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,080
Okay, friend?

200
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,360
Pete!

201
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,840
Get me Donald Graham
on the phone.

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,240
I wanna get some of the Southside
boys here until we catch these pricks.

203
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,560
That's all for now.

204
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,320
Gilroy's really got you spinning, huh?

205
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,560
I mean, blame this whole mess
on you and then yank you off it.

206
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,800
We get these guys, he's the hero.
Either way, you're the goat.

207
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,400
Guess you can kiss that City Council
seat goodbye.

208
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,640
- You here to pile on?
- No. I'm here to help.

209
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,720
What if I told you there was a way to
flip things around, make you the hero?

210
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,880
Maybe even put your
political career on track.

211
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,400
- How?
- Help me take down a dirty cop.

212
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,080
Gilroy diverted police units from
that part of town so crime would rise...

213
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,160
...and he could buy property
at a discount?

214
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,680
Led to the murder of those two women,
the riots, the cop shootings.

215
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,040
When he killed that kid
in the hit-and-run with his mistress...

216
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,640
...he was afraid it'd get out.

217
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,440
If that's true, why don't you
go upstairs and arrest him?

218
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,040
Because I can't prove it.

219
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,080
This land deal is a paper-trail
nightmare. I can't begin to crack it.

220
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,800
Your smarts, you could.

221
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,720
You're flattering me,
so this must be a setup.

222
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,280
It's not.

223
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,120
- Gilroy's bad.
- You can't get him on the hit-and-run?

224
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,640
He had the car fixed.

225
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,720
And one of the witnesses
was already killed in a gang hit.

226
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,080
What about the woman in the car?

227
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,920
Sedona Tellez.

228
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,280
Gilroy's mistress is the key. Find her,
she can give him up for the land deal...

229
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
...and the hit-and-run.
- Find her yourself.

230
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,360
- Gilroy wants me out on the street.
- And why should I do all your legwork?

231
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,320
Because when I find
these cop shooters...

232
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,520
...I'll let you bring them in.

233
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,440
That way you get the credit
for taking down Gilroy and them.

234
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,200
Sounds like a nice headline to me.

235
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,880
A little too nice. I don't know
what trap you've set...

236
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,520
I don't expect you to trust me.

237
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,880
But I know you're too curious...

238
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,280
...not to check in on it.

239
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,160
Trying to put AT&T
out of business, Igal?

240
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,560
No. I'm just trying to get by.

241
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Each and every one of these phones
is either stolen or cloned.

242
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,240
I am as shocked as you are
to discover that.

243
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,440
I bet. Did you sell phones
to any of these kids?

244
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,720
- I don't know. What did they do?
- They killed three police officers...

245
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,000
...and put the fourth in a hospital.
- What? No.

246
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,600
- These are them?
- Yeah.

247
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,000
And they used your phones
to lure them there.

248
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,320
- No. This is horrible. I have no idea.
- So you did sell phones to them?

249
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,960
One each. Yesterday.

250
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,040
Please, tell me how I can help
you to catch these monsters.

251
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,640
- Give us the numbers of the phones.
- Of course, of course.

252
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,040
Now.

253
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
We were at Patrick's kid's party
weeks ago.

254
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,800
- I know.
- Jesus!

255
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,960
Let's hit south of Olympic. I'm giving
a reward to whoever ID's these three.

256
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,520
- How're my kids?
- Good. I rented them a PlayStation.

257
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,120
- Thanks.
- Hey, call Corrine. She's not thrilled.

258
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,000
- Okay. Call me if you find out anything.
- All right. Let's get them! Come on.

259
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,240
- Hey, it's me.
- When are we going home?

260
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,560
- I don't know. Hopefully a day or two.
- Day or two? Are you okay?

261
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,040
- Yes.
- Then what's going on?

262
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,920
I got things coming at me from every
direction. I don't need more problems.

263
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,200
What's happening to this family is the
problem, and you won't tell me why.

264
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,680
Just do nothing.

265
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,520
That's all I'm asking you to do. Just sit
there and do nothing. Is that so hard?

266
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,080
- I'm not your prisoner.
- Look, I'll tell you when it's safe.

267
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,000
Don't bother.

268
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,880
What's up, dog?

269
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,600
Tio! You're out early.

270
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,880
People's nerves are shot.
They need an escape.

271
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,040
Yeah, well, killing brain cells is fine.
Killing cops ain't. Let's go. Showtime.

272
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,400
Know anything about
these 911 shootings?

273
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,960
A lot of people think the cops
had it coming.

274
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,280
- I say we need to work with the police.
- I'm glad you feel that way.

275
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
- I need a line on these guys.
- I hear anything...

276
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,680
Not good enough. You're gonna
go out looking, be my eyes and ears.

277
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,160
Something happens,
you'll be my feet and hands too.

278
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,720
You'll have to get
off your corner and get involved.

279
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,240
- Shitheads sometimes brag about this.
- They do, we need to know.

280
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,760
- I'll get involved, see who's talking.
- You do that.

281
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Yes. I wanted information on some
escrow accounts at your company.

282
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,080
Well, who can release
that information?

283
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,480
Good. Now, call him at home and tell
him that Capt. David Aceveda's...

284
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,640
...about to show up there
with 10 officers and a subpoena...

285
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,800
...if he isn't on the phone with me
in about 30 seconds.

286
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,200
- Yes, I'll hold.
- You got a minute, David?

287
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,400
- Yes, sir.
- Listen...

288
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
...I'm sorry if I was hard
on you earlier.

289
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,440
- Nerves get a bit raw at a time like this.
- Yes, they do.

290
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,560
And I know how bent up you are
about being pushed aside here...

291
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,600
...but I got something that might
help take the pain away.

292
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,760
Really?

293
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,480
You've always tried to warn me
about Vic.

294
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,040
But until recently,
I figured he meant well.

295
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,360
- Now I'm not so sure.
- What are you talking about?

296
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,320
There was a dead kid the other day.
Jesus something.

297
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,840
It got written down as a gang hit.

298
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,760
I've got a source, though,
says it was Mackey.

299
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,240
- What?
- I know how badly you've wanted him.

300
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,160
And he has a lot of friends
who don't wanna see him hang.

301
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,240
You're the only one
I can trust with this.

302
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,080
Get down!

303
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,480
Lock down the building!

304
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,720
- Hands up!
- Freeze!

305
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,800
Let's see some hands!
See some hands!

306
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,160
- Throw your weapons outside the car!
- You're just gonna kill us.

307
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,120
- I got a clean shot, captain.
- No. No shots until I give the word.

308
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,360
Copycats?

309
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,320
They're Latino, not blacks.
Everyone in the neighbourhood...

310
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,360
...feels like they can take a
free shot now.

311
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,560
Nice job.

312
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,440
That thing we were talking about.

313
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,760
- You interested?
- Mackey?

314
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,400
- Very.
- Good.

315
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,280
Let's talk.

316
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,920
Heard about some punk flashing
a cop's badge like it was a souvenir.

317
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,200
Talking about how he started shooting
and the cops ran like bitches.

318
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,320
- Know where this asshole lives?
- His old man's a heavy biter.

319
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,040
- All loused up.
- Great.

320
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,680
Dad's busy mainlining
and junior's a cop killer.

321
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,040
I doubt Mom's Betty Crocker.
Thanks for the fast info.

322
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,240
Police!

323
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't move!

324
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,800
- Jesus Christ!
- What do you guys want?

325
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,520
- We're looking for your boy.
- Sonny? He ain't here.

326
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,120
- Where's your kid?
- I don't know.

327
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,720
Well, you better remember, or you're
gonna be visiting Jonestown.

328
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,320
In a brightly lit, cold cage.

329
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,800
I can get my boy down here,
but, like, what's in it for me?

330
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,240
I still got one vein working.

331
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,400
How much do you need, porcupine?

332
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,840
<i>Two Tango 13, 911 call.
Woman caller reports she's dying.</i>

333
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,560
8811 Lorraine.

334
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,480
That's three blocks from last night.

335
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,040
- Got yours on?
- Absolutely.

336
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,800
All right.

337
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,880
You call for the police?

338
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
In here!

339
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,000
Police in the house.

340
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,560
You got here!

341
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,640
What's wrong, ma'am?

342
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,720
Well, my daughter left
and I need to take my medicine.

343
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,520
- What medicine?
- For arthritis. It's over there.

344
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,920
You called us for your
arthritis medicine?

345
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,080
In the brown bottle over there.
Hand it to me.

346
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,200
- Ma'am, 911 is for emergencies.
- Well, this is emergency to me.

347
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,400
- How many?
- Two.

348
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,720
- What?
- Would it kill you to get me water?

349
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Hey, boy. Where you at?

350
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,320
Mama's here.

351
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,600
Yeah. She got Jesus now.

352
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,160
She looks good.

353
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,720
She can't wait to see you.

354
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,360
Okay. All right, son.

355
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,800
He's on his way.

356
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,040
Yes sir...

357
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,680
One of the phones Igal sold just got
used to call an apartment in the Grove.

358
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,680
- Yes. Here we go.
- Okay, roll.

359
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,600
Mama?

360
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,080
What are you...?

361
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,880
Sorry, sonny. I ain't your mama.

362
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,680
Look what we got here.

363
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,960
Looks nice.

364
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,600
This what you used to kill my friends?

365
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,520
Oh, you cop-killing piece of shit!

366
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,760
- Who are the other shooters?
- Kiss my ass, man.

367
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,400
I can't tell you how much I was hoping
that's what your answer would be.

368
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,200
You wanna kill me, sonny?

369
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,360
Wanna kill me?

370
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,040
- Who are the other shooters?
- Dad!

371
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,040
- Sorry.
- What are their names?

372
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,080
- Benji and Twanya.
- Where can I find them?

373
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,760
We were gonna find some abandoned
building to squat in.

374
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,800
What part of town?

375
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,560
Near the Groves.

376
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,520
- Police! Search warrant!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

377
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,200
- Whoa, it's just us!
- We already got him.

378
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,080
What do we got?

379
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,120
- He's one of our cop killers.
- He was stabbing me with that badge.

380
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,600
Asshole.

381
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,040
You look fine to me.

382
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,080
I'm listening.

383
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,960
First you want me to shut up,
now you want me to talk?

384
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,840
How many personalities
you got, lady?

385
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,520
Walking around
pretending to be a man.

386
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,520
- I know what you really are.
- You don't know nothing.

387
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,040
I know that leg's shaking.

388
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,040
Why'd you do it?

389
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,200
Three officers dead.

390
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,320
How many more lives
you plan on ruining?

391
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,800
More the merrier.

392
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,520
Bang.

393
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,960
It is...

394
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,600
...everything in me...

395
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,880
...not to slap you silly.

396
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,400
- Come on.
- No freebies, girl. Now, step off.

397
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,480
- Screw your mother in the ass, Tio.
- Already did twice this morning, bitch.

398
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,240
- Tio, I need another favour.
- You're as bad as her.

399
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,440
- How much money you got?
- A few thou.

400
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,000
Give it to me. I gotta grease a few
wheels. I left my play money at home.

401
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,640
- Come on.
- Can't say I ain't paying my dues.

402
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,560
No, I can't.

403
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,520
Talk to every Boxcar Willie
and bag lady you see.

404
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,560
If our shooters are squatting,
I wanna know where.

405
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,720
- Looks like it'll be raining Jim Beam.
- Make it Thunderbird, it'll go farther.

406
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,760
I'm Sedona Tellez. I heard
there's a problem with the closing...

407
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,680
...on one of my properties.
- Actually, there's not.

408
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,480
Sedona.
I'm Capt. David Aceveda.

409
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,560
- Have we met before?
- No.

410
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,520
But I've got lots of questions.

411
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,600
Very nice. Quite a step up
from your place in Farmington.

412
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,280
I've done well lately.

413
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,880
Thanks to your corporation
in the Caymans.

414
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,200
That's quite the shell game.

415
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,480
If you were going to arrest me,
you would've taken me in.

416
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,560
Not back to my place.

417
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,160
Sure you don't want a drink?

418
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,200
How does it work,
this land scheme of yours?

419
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,160
I speculate real estate. It's no scheme
and it's not against the law.

420
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,960
Unless your boyfriend keeps police
resources from there...

421
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,520
...so it stays a slum,
so you could buy it cheap.

422
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,320
Boyfriend?

423
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,600
Then he pours resources back in,
cleans it up and...

424
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,600
...you get to sell your properties
for a killing.

425
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,800
Wow, I should've thought of that.

426
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,160
I'm sure you did.
Seems a bit complicated for Gilroy.

427
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,360
I don't know a Gilroy.

428
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,920
You worked in his office for two
months. I bet you showed him...

429
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,280
...how to park pension funds into your
account to make your purchases.

430
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,720
Yeah.
I made a few calls this afternoon.

431
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Now, let's talk about
your boyfriend's hit-and-run.

432
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,080
- I understand your anger.
- You don't know me.

433
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,800
Your father's a heroin addict,
your mother left when you were 9.

434
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,560
Am I missing
any of the broad strokes?

435
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,720
The two women who were murdered
across the street from you.

436
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,520
Did you know them?

437
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,840
- Saw them sometimes.
- Is that what this is all about?

438
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,800
Revenge?

439
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,200
- No, no.
- What, then? Just for kicks?

440
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,960
Deal with it.

441
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,480
You murdered three of my people.

442
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,920
Twanya knew the women good.
They looked after her.

443
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,120
Benji and me figured the three of us
should do something about it.

444
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,960
The police didn't kill those women.
Wally Forton did.

445
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,440
They called 911.

446
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,440
- You all took an hour to show up.
- So you kill three people?

447
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,040
Just cops.

448
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,800
Just like you all killed those ladies.

449
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,960
I don't care how right
you think you are.

450
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,240
I don't care what kind of bad life
you had. What you did was wrong.

451
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,280
It's as wrong as it gets.

452
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,480
Vic, this is Sedona Tellez.

453
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,080
- I've been looking for you.
- I've been right here.

454
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,440
She has a lot of interesting things
to say about our assistant chief.

455
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,280
So much for loyalty, huh, lady?

456
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,760
Ben's in love. I have a future.

457
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,680
Gilroy's not the only one
she implicates.

458
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,360
- Meaning?
- Meaning I was wondering...

459
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,400
...what your trap was and now I know.

460
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,920
You didn't think I'd find out
about the murder?

461
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,240
- What murder?
- Jesus Rosales.

462
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,280
The witness to Gilroy's hit-and-run.

463
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,880
- That was a gang hit.
- Are you in a gang now?

464
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,000
What, is she saying I killed Jesus?

465
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,480
She says a cop buddy cleaned it all up
for Gilroy. I wonder who that is.

466
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,720
- Not me.
- You wanted me to take down Gilroy...

467
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,680
...before he could take you down.
You're both filthy in this.

468
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,920
Hey, I had nothing to do
with killing that Rosales kid.

469
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,520
So if I checked out your place
I wouldn't find the murder weapon.

470
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,040
- No way in hell.
- All right. Let's find out.

471
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,760
This is a search warrant
for your place.

472
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,480
Gilroy thinks we'll find something.

473
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,600
Ben...

474
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,480
Ben was at my house yesterday.
I thought he was there...

475
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,280
He must've planted the gun there.

476
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,040
And why would Gilroy have a murder
weapon to an unsolved gang hit?

477
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Because he killed Jesus.

478
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,440
- Oh, you are just full of surprises.
- I was in the room when he did it.

479
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,520
I found him. If I said anything,
it would've looked liked I was in on it.

480
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,120
And we all know
how squeaky clean you are.

481
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,960
- Gilroy had you get this warrant?
- That's right.

482
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,280
This warrant is six hours old.
You haven't searched my house?

483
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,120
I talked Gilroy into letting you
catch these cop killers first.

484
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,400
And then we're moving on you.

485
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,960
Yeah.

486
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,320
Hold on, hold on.

487
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,480
Okay, I got it.

488
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,640
Good.

489
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,880
That was Lem.

490
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,480
They know where
the other two shooters are.

491
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,480
Now...

492
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,120
...are you gonna help
Gilroy frame me?

493
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Or are you gonna go with me
and nail these bastards?

494
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,040
You sure the shooter's inside?

495
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,760
- Thunderbird did the trick.
- Couple squatters ID'd them.

496
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,600
Said the guy told them to get lost,
waved a gun around.

497
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,360
Good.

498
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,960
Now, stay close.

499
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,840
I know what I'm doing.

500
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,200
All right, ladies.

501
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,480
They wanna come peacefully, fine.

502
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,880
If not, they killed Rudy,
Patrick and Chris.

503
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,920
I ain't about the romance
I'm all about the finance

504
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,280
Hey, asshole.
One more inch and you're dead!

505
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,800
Now, put your hands on your head!

506
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,240
Okay.

507
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,960
Okay, it's cool. It's cool, it's cool.

508
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,120
Vic!

509
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,000
Don't! Get down on your knees!
Get down!

510
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,600
Hands on your head!
I'm not gonna tell you again!

511
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,280
- Everyone all right?
- Yeah. We got it.

512
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,040
Great work, David.

513
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,080
You got that warrant for Vic's place?

514
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,880
Right here.

515
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,960
You ready to serve it?

516
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,520
He caught three cop killers, cleaned
up your mess, and you can just...

517
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,800
...stab him in the back.
- My mess?

518
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,200
I practically choked
digging through the shit.

519
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,360
- Mackey's just covering his ass.
- The land schemes? The hit-and-run?

520
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,280
You gonna try laying those
at his door too?

521
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,080
Don't come near this, David.
Especially without any proof.

522
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,080
Everyone's gonna know
what you did.

523
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,800
Last time.
Don't play with fire.

524
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,160
Get out of my office.

525
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,600
If you won't serve this,
I'll find someone who will.

526
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,520
You're fired.

527
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,080
- Anything?
- No.

528
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,080
Check the den again.

529
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,600
- Nothing in Matthew's room.
- Check the garage.

530
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,800
This gun is nowhere.

531
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,400
- I found it!
- What?

532
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,840
- I found it! I found it.
- Where'd you find it?

533
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,960
It was in the central air vent
in Cassidy's room.

534
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,440
Still loaded.

535
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,800
Sedona!

536
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,200
Come on, we gotta go!

537
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,680
Hi, Ben.

538
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,760
I figured you'd be at your place.

539
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,840
Looking for this, right?

540
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,280
Sit down, you prick.

541
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,040
It was just some insurance, Vic.

542
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,120
Yeah?

543
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,360
You should've taken out
life insurance.

544
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,040
Vic, please.

545
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,240
You planted a murder weapon
in my house.

546
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,040
A loaded gun in my little girl's room.

547
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,880
- She wouldn't have found it.
- I found it.

548
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,800
- Oh, you are so over, man.
- Vic...

549
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,360
I'm really sorry about all this.
I mean...

550
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,160
...there's a way out.
- Shut up, you goddamn drunk!

551
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,440
Vic, just drop me and Sedona
off across the border.

552
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,160
We got some money. We'll disappear.
You'll never hear from me again.

553
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,680
I can't let you walk away
from this, Ben.

554
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,240
I'd be giving up my job, my life.

555
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,200
We got a different price tag
in mind.

556
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,200
Oh, yeah?

557
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,560
- Then kill me!
- You damn right.

558
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,680
Well, come on already!

559
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,960
Just kill me, Vic. Go ahead.

560
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,560
But don't act like you're
better than me.

561
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,080
What things have you done?

562
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,240
What've you done,
then covered those things up?

563
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,000
- I'm not like you.
- Not yet.

564
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,760
Not ever.

565
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,520
If you really believe that,
pull the goddamn trigger!

566
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,960
Do it, man.

567
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,360
Come on, it's time, man. Do it.

568
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,160
Well, you're such a saint.

569
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,320
Pull the trigger.

570
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,360
Look, it's all right, man.

571
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,360
It's all right. You two got history.
It's not easy.

572
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,080
Okay?

573
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,880
All right. Let me do it.
Let me do this for you, Vic.

574
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,440
Please, Vic.

575
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,160
Looks like it's starting to work.

576
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,760
Us.

577
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,040
Yeah.

578
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,320
Of course, you never ask me
about my stuff.

579
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,040
I'm always trying to get you to open
up, but you never pry. Why is that?

580
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,960
You wanna talk?

581
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,000
We will.

582
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,320
I'll wait outside,
we'll walk out together?

583
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,920
Sure.

584
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,280
Boss, went by the hotel.
Your family's gone, man.

585
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,360
- What?
- They're gone!

586
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,240
Two of the shooters have been
detained, the other is dead.

587
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,480
Captain, can you comment on the
arrest of Assistant Chief Ben Gilroy?

588
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,600
The facts will show that
Assistant Chief Gilroy chose a path...

589
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,400
...that led to tragic circumstances
for the city.

590
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,200
Corrine!

591
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,920
Cassidy!

592
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,200
It's me. I'm really tired.
I don't know where we're going, but...

593
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,520
<i>I know you'll
wanna find us, but...</i>

594
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,680
<i>... if you still have love for me,
you won't try...</i>

595
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,960
... for a while, anyway.

596
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,280
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

597
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,320
I can't comment at this time
until we have more information.

598
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,200
- One more follow-up question.
- There you are.

599
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,560
- I'm a sucker for a good show.
- Well, for us the show's over.

600
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,120
Husband shot his wife
because she lost his car keys.

601
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,000
He's already in custody. Wanna
pick up some food on the way?

602
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,440
Are you dragging me to that
Chinese place again?

603
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,680
- I got a thing for egg rolls tonight.
- You got it every night.

604
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,120
How about spareribs, roast beef,
anything else?

605
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,960
Oh, no.

606
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,520
Oh, that's okay. Okay.

607
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,520
Oh, God!

608
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,960
Goddamn it!

609
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,400
Do these arrests put you in the front-
running for the City Council elections?

610
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,800
In my experience, people hate being
told who to vote for. I wouldn't...

611
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,600
...declare me the winner quite yet. I've
enjoyed my underdog status up to now.

612
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,200
No...

613
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,160
But today's events can't hurt, right?

614
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,800
Let's focus on what today's events
really mean.

615
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,840
Three officers gave their lives
in defence of an institution...

616
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,280
...that their boss betrayed
for personal gain.

617
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,800
It's a scandal and an outrage.

618
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,120
The curse of corruption
has left its mark on this department.

619
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,880
Now we start the difficult task
of healing.

620
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,280

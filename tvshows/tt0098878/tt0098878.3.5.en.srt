Congrats, Maurice. Now,
the rest of you beware.

9
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:40,419
Here's a little something for all you
ghouls and goblins out there.

10
00:00:47,594 --> 00:00:51,086
Ah. Ah-ha!

11
00:00:51,164 --> 00:00:53,223
Ha!

12
00:00:57,904 --> 00:01:00,134
Ha.

13
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:03,836
Ah-Ah-ha.

15
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:25,821
Huh? What? Who is it?

16
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:28,663
<i>What?</i>

17
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,243
Trick or treat.
What?

18
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:43,373
Trick or treat.
What is this?

19
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,716
It's Halloween, dummy. Just give me some candy.
Halloween's for kids. You're a little old.

20
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:52,248
And why do you think I came all the ways up here?
They laughed me off the streets in Anchorage.

21
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:57,627
I don't believe this. Who are you? Frank Watson.
Just give me some candy- boom- I'm out of your hair.

22
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:59,961
I don't have any candy.
None?

23
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:04,595
No. In case you haven't noticed, I live in the middle
of nowhere, on a lake so remote it doesn't have a name,

24
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:08,835
miles from any living soul who might chance
upon my cabin looking for candy on Halloween.

25
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:11,309
Okay, okay, okay.
What do you got?

26
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:16,475
I don't know. I have macaroni
and cheese, Pop-Tarts, a banana.

27
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,111
Give me a banana. No, I will not. I will not give
you my banana. I'm not gonna give you anything.

28
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:23,188
No?
No.

29
00:02:24,257 --> 00:02:29,251
All right. How 'bout
- Look. I'll give you a dime, okay? Now do me a favor.

30
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:33,595
Let me eat my dinner before it
gets cold. A dime? A lousy dime?

31
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:37,694
Hey, Frank, you're lucky I don't have a
poison apple. Okay, pal. You asked for it.

32
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:43,004
Hey! Get out! Stop it!
Hey! Come back! Ow!

33
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,260
All righty. What are the
damages? Well, sir, we got $2,433.

34
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,690
Yeah. I'm a little short.
I'm gonna have to write you a check.

35
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,200
- You have some I.D., sir?
- Vikram, we've been in this cab three days.

36
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,400
- You don't know me by now?
- Okay, sir. Okay.

37
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,810
- All righty. What's that number again?
- $2,433.

38
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,400
What's your last name?

39
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,050
<i>- I'll just write it to "Cash."
- What about the girl, sir?</i>

40
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,320
Uh, take her back to-

41
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,360
Here you go.
Where the hell was that again?

42
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,530
Where'd you say you were
from, honey? Manitoba.

43
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:03,310
<i>Manitoba.
Manitoba, sir. Manitoba.</i>

44
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,370
Oh, your husband's
a lucky man.

45
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,010
<i>Thank you very much, sir.
Have a nice day, sir. Good-bye.</i>

46
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,490
<i>- Hiya. How you folks doin'?
Fleischman?</i>

47
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,500
No. Don't move.
I love the new look.

48
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,440
Hey, thanks.
Hot. Very hot.

49
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,640
The feeling
is entirely mutual.

50
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,940
It finally happened, didn't it?
All that unfocused rage. You finally snapped.

51
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,980
What's your name, peaches?
Huh?

52
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,220
You're really creepy sometimes,
Fleischman. I mean it. Spooky.

53
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,360
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
Z.Z. Top.

54
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,870
<i>Shelly, have you seen Fleischman?</i>

55
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,740
Yeah. I'm actually very worried
about him. He's disoriented, confused,

56
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,080
and he's dressed like a loan shark.

57
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,140
- Seemed fine to me.
- Shelly, did you ever think of putting towels in the dispenser?

58
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,810
You know, it's a two-step process-
first the washing, then the drying.

59
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,410
Oh. Sorry.

60
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,220
- What?
- How'd you do it?

61
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,750
<i>- You snuck in the back. He snuck in the back, right?
- Huh?</i>

62
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,320
<i>Oh, I get it.
You're in this together.</i>

63
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,670
<i>Come on. I saw Gaslight. Ingrid Bergman, Charles
Boyer. He tries to make her think she's crazy.</i>

64
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,700
- What are you talking about, O'Connell?
- Okay. Fine.

65
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,440
<i>I mean, you went through a lot of trouble, so
if you want me to play along, I'll play along.</i>

66
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,350
But just one thing: How did you
get that mousse out of your hair?

67
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,120
Huh? He's been here
for the last half hour.

68
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,250
Oh, yeah, right. And there's just some Fleischman
clone and evil twin stalking the streets of Cicely?

69
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,520
Wait, wait. This clone-
He looks like me?

70
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,260
- Is this your idea of funny, Fleischman?
- Sharkskin suit, lizard shoes, big, gold Magen David?

71
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,630
Yeah.

72
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,910
<i>Marilyn,</i>

73
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,240
by any chance have I received
any unexpected visitors today?

74
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,150
He's in there.

75
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,480
<i>- Ho, ho, ho.
- Hey, hey, hey.! He-Hey.!</i>

76
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,620
<i>Oh, no.
Schmegeggie.</i>

77
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,390
Look at you-
the doctor, all grown up.

78
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:43,460
You little putz. Come here!

79
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,560
He-Hey, how are ya?
I'm fine, Jules.

80
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,580
Come on. They don't feed ya up here? Ow.

81
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,610
Ho! Ho!
Stop! Cut it out!

82
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,370
Ow! Ow! Hey, Ma says you don't
write, you're in big trouble.

83
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,440
I'll write! I'll write!
All right. That's better.

84
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,010
Geez. What are you doing here?
I was in the neighborhood.

85
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,350
In the neighborhood?
Right. Are you in trouble?

86
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,450
Nah.

87
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,500
Yeah. You know.
The usual story.

88
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,160
A girl, some money,
a missing ledger.

89
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,900
Some people were upset.
It seemed prudent to leave New York.

90
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,340
I'll bet. How long you gonna
stay? Just a couple days.

91
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,240
I wanna check out
the Arctic Circle.

92
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,250
Tell you the truth, some of the
things I've been involved with-

93
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,440
just various improprieties-

94
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,750
<i>It's been emotionally
very taxing. Yeah, right.</i>

95
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,280
I could really use a break from myself.
Couldn't you-

96
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,480
Wait a second. Remember we
were kids? We used to switch?

97
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,000
I'd go to your violin class. You'd run numbers for
Ziggy Goldman. Jules, come on. We're adults now.

98
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,830
So what? You used
to love being me!

99
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,810
You got to boost comic books, pick fights.
You remember? You laid out Moose Mahoney.

100
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,870
Jules. Ever since your bar mitzvah,
it's been work/study, work/study.

101
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,010
You've been so serious.
Joel, I'm a vacation.

102
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,570
And I am a doctor.
I have responsibilities here.

103
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,480
I will not practice medicine.
What?

104
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:13,020
It's so wonderful being locked up inside the
HonorableJoel Fleischman 24 hours a day, seven days a week?

105
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,220
No. Absolutely not.

106
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,820
One day. I'm you, you're me.

107
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,100
No. And that is that. I am very happy with myself.
I have no need to go slumming in your persona.

108
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,670
<i>- Ha-Ha.!
- You still got it.</i>

109
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,140
<i>All righty.
You see this quarter?</i>

110
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,280
Yeah. Dollar says I remove this
quarter without touchin' the cup.

111
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,620
<i>Just a buck.
What do ya say?</i>

112
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,120
I'm in.
Me too.

113
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,120
All right. Here we go. You
ready? We got a eenie, a meenie,

114
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,960
a miney, a mo, a one,
two, three and away you go!

115
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,470
- There. It's gone.
- Wow.

116
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,040
It's still there.
Not anymore.

117
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,050
That's real slick.

118
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,930
- Hey, Joel.
- Hey, Joel, your brother here's a real pistol.

119
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,990
Who'd have thought it?

120
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,500
Thanks, Maurice.
Come on. I'll show you my igloo.

121
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,060
Later, guys. All right.
Thanks for the game.

122
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,470
He-Hey. Joey, wait up. What's
your hurry? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

123
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,610
- Hey, Fleischman-
- Yeah.

124
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,410
I heard. I didn't believe it.

125
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,080
<i>Believe it, sweetheart.</i>

126
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,450
Joel?
Jules.

127
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,290
- Joel?
- Joel. Jules, my brother. Maggie O'Connell.

128
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,260
We've had the pleasure.

129
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,090
Incredible. Two of you.

130
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,030
Double your pleasure.
Double your fun.

131
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,660
- Come on, Jules.
- Unbelievable. Oh, Fleischman? I need a syringe.

132
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,870
- What?
- To baste my turkey.

133
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,140
Don't be ridiculous.
Use a spoon.

134
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,610
- You can't shoot butter under the skin with a spoon.
- Right.

135
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,280
A syringe is not a toy, O'Connell. It's not
a cooking utensil. You know what a syringe is?

136
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:22,020
<i>It's desperate people huddled in filthy stairwells
and dark alleys and dank subway platforms.</i>

137
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,110
Fleischman, I'm not a junkie.

138
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,460
<i>Look, if you had a legitimate medical need
for a syringe-say, you were a diabetic-</i>

139
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,730
<i>- Am I hearing ethics from you? - Let's
just say I have one redeeming social value-</i>

140
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,820
I don't willy-nilly hand out syringes.

141
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,130
Geez, you never lighten up.

142
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,670
<i>You've got to be the most
anal-retentive individual I've ever met.</i>

143
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,870
<i>What?</i>

144
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,410
- What?
- Nothin'.

145
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,920
I'm not anal-retentive.

146
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,440
<i>Dr. Fleischman? That's me.
Hey, watch that cholesterol.</i>

147
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,970
<i>Wow, Red Cloud.
Bon chapeau.</i>

148
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,140
What's that? Oh, hello,
Joel. It's rotten fruit.

149
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,410
Well, as a physician, I have to tell you that's
a perfect breeding ground for aerobic bacteria,

150
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,820
salmonella, streptococcus,
cholera.

151
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,480
Yeah. I'd keep it covered.

152
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,050
I'm not anal-retentive-
I'm not, not. How ya doin'?

153
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,500
Yeah. How ya doin'?
I'm not anal-retentive.

154
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,970
Did you call me anal-retentive? Don't
call me anal-retentive, 'cause I'm not.

155
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,010
That's right. I'm not.

156
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,510
<i>Uh, Dr. Fleischman.
That's me.</i>

157
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,570
<i>Did my test results come in?
Uh, yeah, and you got an "A."</i>

158
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,680
Oh, yeah.

159
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,820
Okay. We got time for a couple more
calls before the big old salsa show.

160
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,420
<i>This is "Mea Culpa."
You are on the air.</i>

161
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,090
<i>Hello?
Sorry, sir. You're gonna have to speak up.</i>

162
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,030
<i>Chris, are you Abe Stevens's boy?
Yeah.</i>

163
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,730
<i>From Marshall County, West Virginia?
Yeah. Do I know you?</i>

164
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:26,510
<i>You know of me. This is Frank Watson.
Watson?</i>

165
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,380
<i>Yeah. Lasrove R. V. Sales?
Hauser Menswear?</i>

166
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,750
<i>Turner Plumbing Supplies?</i>

167
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,280
<i>That Frank Watson?
That's you? Yes, it is.</i>

168
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,450
<i>Wow.</i>

169
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,050
Uh, okay,
for our audience-

170
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,990
About 10 years ago,
there was a string of bombings...

171
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,260
of retail outlets
in the greater downtown Wheeling area.

172
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,390
Now, nobody was hurt,
but there was substantial property damage,

173
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,130
and the suspect,
identified as a Mr. Frank Watson,

174
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,540
was never apprehended
and is still at large.

175
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,880
<i>I tried to return the sport coat.
The seam split under the arm.</i>

176
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,580
<i>But Wally wouldn't return my money.
Oh, no. He'd only give me credit.</i>

177
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,880
<i>And that camper shell? First rain, it
leaked. You can understand how I felt.</i>

178
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,360
<i>Well- I mean, the consumerjust
doesn't have any other recourse-</i>

179
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,020
Maybe not. Hey, thanks
for your call, and, uh-

180
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,160
<i>Let me tell you about the commode.!
Sorry, Frank. The board's all lit up.</i>

181
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,100
<i>Okay, next caller,
you're on the air.</i>

182
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,210
All right. What do you want?
I'll have a gimlet, doll face.

183
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,010
- How 'bout a beer?
- Perfect.

184
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,540
<i>Excuse me, Shelly. I'm going to
have to return this to the kitchen.</i>

185
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,080
<i>Why? Tell the chef the proper way to prepare
salmon is to poach it or steam it only...</i>

186
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,680
until it turns a lighter shade of pink.

187
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,720
The fish should still be firm to the touch,
but flake when prodded with a fork. Flake.

188
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,240
<i>Okay.
Quintessential Fleischman.</i>

189
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,960
Get us a table.
I'll be right there.

190
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,750
You're layin' it on a bit thick.

191
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,180
Hi, Dr. Fleischman. Oh, no. I'm
Jules. That's Dr. Fleischman.

192
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,780
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone it's you.

193
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,420
How did you know, Ed?
Oh, it's an Indian thing.

194
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,020
We're not taken in
by appearances.

195
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,010
Hi, Dr. Fleischman.
Hey, Fred.

196
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,480
A toast to Alaska's most...

197
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,140
alluring natural beauty.

198
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,360
You should give your brother
some lessons. What do you mean?

199
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,760
Look at him.
All you ever get is one grim note.

200
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,490
<i>- He's so relentlesslyJoel.
- No, no, no.</i>

201
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,040
Joel is really complex.

202
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,470
He has a very refined
and subtle sense of humor.

203
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,030
A lot goes on inside that head
that you don't know about.

204
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,840
Really? Believe me. There's a whole
range of colors on that palette.

205
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,610
Look, I don't wanna talk
aboutJoel. Tell you the truth-

206
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,160
I'm pickin' up on an undercurrent here,
something subtextual in all this.

207
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,960
I sense that you are really attracted
to my better half.

208
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,900
Ho.
Ho. Come on. The truth, please.

209
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,340
<i>I swear, I won't tell my brother.
Strictly entre nous.</i>

210
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,370
I'm not sayin' that you would act
on this attraction,

211
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,740
only that it exists.

212
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,810
Just between us?

213
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,790
I mean, maybe it's because
he's such a malcontent,

214
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,190
you know,
because he's so self-centered,

215
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,160
egotistical, narcissistic,

216
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,820
and because he's so totally lacking
in any quality I look for in a man.

217
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,930
So, yeah, in some perverse
way, I am attracted to him.

218
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Huh.

219
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:18,940
<i>This is "Mea Culpa." I pay you
homage, and you're on the air.</i>

220
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,450
Hello? Anybody home?
Okay. Guess not. On to-

221
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,080
<i>Stevens. It's me.</i>

222
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,880
<i>Frank?
It's time people heard my side of the story.</i>

223
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,480
<i>I'm turning myself in. Hey, that's
good, man. That's really good. I'm happy.</i>

224
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,760
<i>I'm turning myself in to you.
What?</i>

225
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,820
<i>I trust you.</i>

226
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,000
Uh, listen, Frank.
That's not a very good idea.

227
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,910
<i>Why not? Why not? Because,
oh, geez, come on, Frank.</i>

228
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,420
<i>We have a relationship, Stevens.
We're both from West Virginia.</i>

229
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,540
Look, I'm not qualified,
all right? You need a police officer.

230
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,110
<i>A cop. Some trigger-happy flatfoot?
You're out of your mind.</i>

231
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,680
<i>I only meant that
- What's the matter with you, Stevens? "A cop'"?</i>

232
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,060
<i>Look, I'll call you tonight
with all the details, huh?</i>

233
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,260
<i>Frank, l-
And come alone.</i>

234
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,570
<i>I'll be wired with ordnance.</i>

235
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,440
<i>If I see anyone else, anyone, it's the big
bang, and it'll be on your head, understand?</i>

236
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,910
<i>Frank? Frank!</i>

237
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,950
Maurice, did you hear that?

238
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,990
That's one disturbed individual.

239
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,960
- Are you seeing Officer Semanski tonight?
- Yes, sir. Dinner theater in Chumuchu.

240
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,190
<i>They're showing Camelot.
It's a good deal.</i>

241
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,170
<i>You get prime rib, baked potato,
salad bar...</i>

242
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,670
and the show, all for 11.95.

243
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,840
Well, do you think that maybe, you know, you
could talk to Officer Semanski about Frank?

244
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:03,470
I don't know, Chris. These
paranoid types are tricky.

245
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,980
<i>If old Frank figures that
you're gonna double-cross him,</i>

246
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:12,650
he might walk in here with a little
C-4 and- blow us all to kingdom come.

247
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,520
You'll be all right.

248
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,000
<i>Good luck!</i>

249
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,370
He's no Bobby Goulet,
but that Erik Estrada...

250
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,070
made a damn fine Lancelot,
don't you think?

251
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,670
I could've used seconds
on the prime rib.

252
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,610
<i>Well, Dave'll whip us up a little
snack. You like camarones aztecas?</i>

253
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,810
That's his specialty. Anything else
you get around here is a little iffy.

254
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,080
<i>- See it? You got it? All right. Watch the lady.
- What's goin'on?</i>

255
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:47,180
<i>Okay. You got the bullet. Here you
got the bullet. There you got the lady.</i>

256
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,390
<i>The lady here. Okay, now, watch the lady.
Watch the lady. All right? You watchin'her, pal?</i>

257
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,660
Fellas, here we go.
Where's the lady?

258
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,930
<i>- The middle one. Here.
- That one. - Ooh! Bad!</i>

259
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,060
I thought you had me that time. All right.
Who's next? I'll take any bet up to a fiver.

260
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,070
- You're under arrest.
- How's that?

261
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,580
- Bunko. -
Arrest? - Barbara.

262
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,050
Get my cuffs.
Put your hands against the wall.

263
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,810
We're on a date here.
You're off duty. It's-

264
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,450
Doesn't matter. I'm obligated to intervene.
Look, I was gonna give the money back-

265
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,580
Spread 'em!
You have the right to remain silent.

266
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,220
Maurice, do something. The nearest
police station is 200 miles away.

267
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,630
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

268
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,690
Ow.

269
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,130
There has to be a visitors' lounge,
a waiting room.

270
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,640
I'm not gonna run away.
I'm a physician.

271
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,010
I have degrees from some of the finest
institutions of higher learning in the world.

272
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,310
There is no need
to put me behind bars.

273
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,080
Okay. All right.
I understand it's a procedural thing,

274
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,860
but isn't there supposed
to be a phone call?

275
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,560
One phone call?
That's my understanding, Officer.

276
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,900
Officer!

277
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,610
Hi.

278
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,750
No problem.

279
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,330
<i>- You seem uncomfortable.
- Pardon?</i>

280
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:46,370
I was remarking that
you appear somewhat ill at ease.

281
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,670
I'm in jail.
How am I supposed to feel?

282
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,680
Why do you assume
there's a correct emotional response?

283
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,550
<i>Any one of a number
of responses might be appropriate.</i>

284
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,990
I know you. Do I know you?

285
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,390
Let's get back to your feelings
about being incarcerated.

286
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,830
- Why?
- Uh-huh.

287
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,990
<i>- "Uh-huh" what?
- Your choice of words.</i>

288
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,870
<i>"Why," "who," "what," "where,"
"when," "how."</i>

289
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,140
Do you always do things
only out of a sense of obligation?

290
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,400
No.

291
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,710
Yeah. Most of the time. Yeah.

292
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,320
<i>See anything good in there?</i>

293
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,320
Hey. Willie.

294
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,380
<i>Oh, yeah, Willie Dixon.
Mighty Earthquake and Hurricane.</i>

295
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,400
Ed, anything drastic ever happens
to me, this is yours, buddy.

296
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,800
Well, maybe Frank won't call tonight.

297
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,360
<i>Hey. Just fine with me.</i>

298
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,400
- Hey. Maybe he'll never call again.
- You think?

299
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,440
Yeah. Of course, then you'd be
waiting on him to call.

300
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,880
All night. Every day.

301
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,290
<i>Every time the phone rings.</i>

302
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,350
<i>Every time there's a knock at the door.</i>

303
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,190
<i>Every time you get in the shower.
You know, likeJanet Leigh in Psycho.</i>

304
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,130
Ed. Can we
just talk about something else?

305
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,190
Okay.

306
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,340
What's that?
Did you hear that?

307
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,010
What?

308
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,920
Right-That.

309
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,820
M-Maybe.

310
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,690
You'd better get that.
All right.

311
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,040
Hello. Oh, hi, Frank.

312
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,940
Uh, no. I was- I was in the back.
I had to run up.

313
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,980
No, no. I'm glad.
I'm glad you called me.

314
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:08,040
Right. Uh-huh.

315
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,110
Uh-huh. Okay, hey, Frank? You think
we can meet somewhere a little closer?

316
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,680
You know, somewhere
with some streetlights?

317
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,920
Frank? Frank?

318
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,230
When?

319
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:34,800
Tomorrow night.
Out by the flume at Ketchum Lake.

320
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,040
Oh.

321
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:41,610
Ed, he said if I'm not there,
there's gonna be a crater 20 feet long...

322
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,650
with nothing but teeth and shoelaces.

323
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:51,120
You know what this reminds me of? A man
named Sweeho, up by the Noatak River.

324
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,690
- He had to bring in a psychopath?
- Oh, no. He was the psycho.

325
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,430
Chopped up eight miners.
Then Sweeho said he'd turn himself in,

326
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,500
but the sheriff had to
go into the mine... alone.

327
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,240
That's it? That's it, Ed?
That's the story?

328
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,550
Oh, no. Afterwards,
they went in and found the sheriff.

329
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,020
He was chopped up in little sections-
like Dave does with those chickens?

330
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,990
I guess Sweeho changed his mind.

331
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,500
You know, huh? Hey, don't worry
aboutJoel. Jail'll be good for him.

332
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,740
Broaden him.

333
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,970
Let's call in the next patient, shall we?

334
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,950
Number six.

335
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:00,290
Good morning, I'm Dr. Fleischman. Up
we go. So, what seems to be the problem?

336
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,760
Well, I got a headache
and a sore throat.

337
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,500
Yeah? I think I got that
flu that's going around.

338
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,230
Well, I'm not gonna rule out the flu,
but there are other possibilities.

339
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,140
There's tonsillitis, brain tumor.
Let's have a look-see.

340
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,200
<i>Ow.</i>

341
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,440
Oops.
Let's see the tonsils, huh?

342
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,680
Hey, wait. That's wet.
It's been used.

343
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:25,420
You want a new one? No problem. I
myself try to save a tree where I can.

344
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,650
<i>Conserve. Recycle.
That's my motto. Say "Ah."</i>

345
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,560
Ah.

346
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:38,470
A little sensitive, aren't we?
Okay, let's check your reflexes.

347
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,900
Boo! Good.

348
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,810
<i>So, Miss Hacket says, "You're making fun
ofJerry Trinkle, Joel."</i>

349
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,210
<i>I said, "No, I wasn't." She said,
"You were. Kenny Morgan saw you."</i>

350
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,610
<i>I said, "No, no. That was my brother."
Your "twin" brother?</i>

351
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,180
<i>Yeah. What was I gonna do? Admit that I had perpetrated
an act so gratuitously cruel and malicious...</i>

352
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,820
against a kid whose only-only crime
was a slight obesity and out-of-itness?

353
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:06,300
<i>- Hmm.
- "Hmm"? What does "hmm" mean?</i>

354
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,130
<i>"Hmm'"as in "Hmm, there's some
deep, dark significance here? '"</i>

355
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,360
Like, maybe I actually
identified with the Trinkle boy,

356
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,410
was actually
punishing myself by torturing him?

357
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:22,000
<i>Or is this "Hmm'"just, "Hmm, this is really boring. I'm
not really interested but I'll make him think that I am'"?</i>

358
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,210
What do you think?

359
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,780
Well, my point is,
what difference does it make toJules?

360
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,340
I mean, one more blot, more or less,
on his already disreputable character.

361
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,480
Whereas to soil my reputation would-

362
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,190
- Soil you?
- Yeah, soil.

363
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,720
<i>Sully. Tarnish. Soil.</i>

364
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:47,600
- What?
- This business of soiling,

365
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,200
does it remind you of anything?

366
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,940
Now, see, you would say that.

367
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,500
But, at leastJules expresses his id.
I mean, he is id.

368
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,910
Me, I am all superego, good behavior,
stellar achievement.

369
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,920
Always judging myself
by how others judge me.

370
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,820
But-

371
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:11,880
Who-Who really is the bad one here?
Joel, who is only pretending to be good?

372
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,730
OrJules, who expresses his evil side so that
when he is good, it's the genuine article?

373
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,460
Perhaps you project onto your brother
those parts of yourself...

374
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:25,270
<i>which it is uncomfortable
for you yourself to own up to.</i>

375
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,870
Isn't that merely a restatement
of what I was just saying?

376
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,280
That's all we have time for today.

377
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,340
Okay.

378
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,080
One more question
while I have you here.

379
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,090
Maybe you are who you are,
maybe you aren't.

380
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,790
Let's just say, for the sake
of argument, you are.

381
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,090
This whole swirl of controversy
that surrounds you-

382
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,470
My emphasis on Oedipal conflict
and penis envy?

383
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:59,530
Exactly. I mean, there's been almost
a century of psychoanalytic practice,

384
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,910
untold millions spent in dark offices
cluttered with expensive Oriental rugs...

385
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,140
and Hindu art on Park Avenue.

386
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,710
I mean, this huge, quasi-scientific,
monolithic edifice based on your principles.

387
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,950
And now people are beginning to
question those very ideas.

388
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:19,660
Postulating, in fact, that the whole sexual orientation of
Freudian psychoanalysis is, in fact, misguided and wrong.

389
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:25,120
How would you respond to
such criticism?

390
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,140
It's just a theory.

391
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:40,310
Whoa. No, no, no, no.
Save some for yourself.

392
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,220
It's so good.

393
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,520
Half the pleasure in these things
is watching other people's enjoyment.

394
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:50,080
That's what wine is for.
To be savored and enjoyed.

395
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,190
<i>Hmm.
Cheers.</i>

396
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,870
I'm surprised you even
opened this bottle, Fleischman.

397
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,930
<i>Your $400, precious '61 Margaux.</i>

398
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:08,170
<i>I thought you were saving it for the day
you left this "armpit of civilization."</i>

399
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:12,580
When you called me anal-retentive
the other day, well, point well taken.

400
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:18,050
<i>I saw the bottle, I thought, "Why hold on"?
And who better to share it with than Maggie?</i>

401
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,150
- Maggie?
- That's your name, isn't it?

402
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:26,560
What are you up to, Fleischman? Did your
brother tell you what I said about you?

403
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:30,960
- No.
- Because it was purely theoretical.

404
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,530
Besides, he was supposed to
keep his mouth shut.

405
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,440
<i>You have the most amazing eyes
I have ever seen.</i>

406
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,510
Has anybody ever told you that?

407
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,640
Well, yeah, I think
they're one of my better features.

408
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,880
Wait a minute. Eyes?

409
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,830
They're so intelligent.
They look right through a person.

410
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,830
What are you doing
talking about eyes?

411
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,560
I know I don't usually
say things like this.

412
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:08,090
Maybe it's from being around
my brother, but you are-

413
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,440
Fleischman. So beautiful.
Do you know that?

414
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,240
What are you doing, Fleischman?

415
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:17,940
And that mouth.
You have such beautiful lips.

416
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,780
<i>Fleischman.</i>

417
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,020
Hello. Yeah.
He's here. Hold on.

418
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,430
It's your brother.
Hmm?

419
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,930
Hello?

420
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,270
<i>Jules is-is an animal. Apredator.</i>

421
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,040
A sexual juggernaut whose idea
of guilt is something like lint.

422
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,240
<i>Say-SayJules meets a girl.</i>

423
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,880
As he rips her clothes off, they writhe like
eels into a frenzy of unadulterated lovemaking.

424
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,450
<i>I mean, me, I'd shower with
my socks on if they wouldn't get moldy.</i>

425
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:07,330
I have this thing about
getting totally naked.

426
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,420
- I feel so totally-
- Exposed?

427
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,000
Exactly. I mean,
I wanna be spontaneous. I do.

428
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,100
But I have this thing about
analyzing my every move.

429
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,110
And premeditated spontaneity...

430
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,440
is about as exhilarating as
getting the measles twice.

431
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,450
Elaborate, please.

432
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,010
Okay, let's take O'Connell, for example.

433
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,750
I mean, Jules plies her with alcoholic beverages,
instinctively tells her everything he knows she wants to hear,

434
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:39,590
<i>flatters her, charms her and then sticks his tongue
down her throat before she has a chance to say "Ah. '"</i>

435
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,430
I mean, me, do I want her
as badly as Jules? Absolutely.

436
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,490
But do I pin her against the wall,
pressing my chest against her chest?

437
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,100
Thrusting my hips
against her hips? I mean, do I?

438
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:54,840
- Do you?
- Me, yeah. Joel Fleischman. Are you kidding? No way.

439
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:58,570
I mean, I'd tell her it'd never work out
simply because we have nothing in common...

440
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,280
because I hate everything
that she likes.

441
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,220
<i>And in return for my forthrightness
and honesty,</i>

442
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,620
I'd get at best, if ever,
her grudging respect.

443
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,720
When, likeJules, what I really want...

444
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:13,200
is to lick her naked body from head
to foot like a postage stamp.

445
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,700
Did I mention that
I used to collect stamps as a kid?

446
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,700
Did I?

447
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:26,100
Sigmund?

448
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,210
Excuse me.

449
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,510
Hello?

450
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,140
- Chris?
- Frank?

451
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,240
Yeah. Oh, wow.

452
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,380
Yeah. Boy are you Abe Stevens's kid.

453
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,250
Oh. Same exact forehead.

454
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,420
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
People have said that.

455
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:52,650
Oh, Chris-
I've waited a long time for this day.

456
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,390
Yeah. I've thought about it.
An end to the running.

457
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:02,430
A chance to be heard, you know?
Whew. Well, let's go.

458
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,000
<i>- Okay.
- "Okay"?</i>

459
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,740
Yeah, Frank,
let's get the hell out of here.

460
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:15,250
<i>No, no, no, no. You said, "okay."
Okay, what?</i>

461
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,010
Um, nothing.

462
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:22,820
All right, Frank. I created
all this anxiety when you called,

463
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:27,120
and, you know, I fabricated this whole
scenario out here in the woods, you know.

464
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,430
With the Mad Bomber?
Right.

465
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,160
So, I'm not what you expected.

466
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,530
You expected somebody else.

467
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,600
Somebody dangerous?
A bigger person... maybe?

468
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,510
Nope.
Come on. I can take it.

469
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:47,040
Say it. I'm short. No, no. Frank.
Size is completely relative, you know?

470
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,550
Say it. I'm short.

471
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,020
Short. Of no account.

472
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:57,080
A piffle. An elf.
A midget. A dwarf.

473
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,320
<i>"Oh, don't worry about Frank.
Frank is no problem."</i>

474
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,390
<i>"Hey, shorty. Why don't you
get up off your knees?"</i>

475
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:08,230
Frank, listen to me. You are not
that short. Yeah? How tall are you?

476
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,210
Frank. Frank. Short's good. Short's good.
Better balance. Lower center of gravity.

477
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,140
You know, think of it.
All the tough guys, they weren't giants.

478
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,200
B-Bruce Lee.
Napoléon- 5'2", conquered Europe.

479
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,810
Uh, Edward G. Robinson.
James Cagney.

480
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,180
Oh, James Cagney.
I likeJames Cagney.

481
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:28,550
Right. Right.
Chris.

482
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:33,360
I'm sorry, Chris.
I've got a temper.

483
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:37,330
We should be going.

484
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,890
Whenever you're ready.

485
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,900
I'm ready.

486
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,960
Frank?
Huh?

487
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,200
This way.
Oh, yeah.

488
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,270
Listen, your father.
Whatever happened to him?

489
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,340
Um, cirrhosis of the liver.

490
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:59,080
Oh, too bad. Nice guy.
Very nice guy.

491
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:08,030
Where the hell were you? How could you leave
me in there like that? In a jail with criminals?

492
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,260
I was tied up. Unspeakable
things could've happened to me.

493
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,000
Hey, I'm the one who's gonna suffer,
pal. Your indiscretion goes on my record.

494
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:20,800
I think an apology's in order. An apology?
I shudder to think what you've been up to.

495
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,280
- Nothing bad happened.
- What is that supposed to mean?

496
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,980
No fatalities.
You saw patients?

497
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,820
You promised you wouldn't see
patients. I couldn't help it.

498
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,790
That's not only unethical and illegal,
that is dangerous.

499
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,380
All right. You're right. You're right.
I'm sorry.

500
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,230
But, Joel, try to understand.
You're a professional.

501
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,060
You have an office, a receptionist.
People look up to you.

502
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,940
<i>A guy like me, you know, I could never
get anywhere with a woman like Maggie.</i>

503
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,570
What has Maggie got to do with this?

504
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,840
What I mean is,

505
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,240
it felt so good to put on
that white coat-

506
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,580
I felt clean. Joel, clean.

507
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,980
I tricked people. I took advantage
of them. Look at me.

508
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,020
I haven't had a shower in days.

509
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:11,580
I could get used to this.
Yeah.

510
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:16,620
Jules, do me a favor. Don't come back
for a couple of years. No problem.

511
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,360
Sure.

512
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,300
<i>Oh, by the way,
you got a date with Maggie tonight.</i>

513
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:29,540
<i>Okay. Breast or thigh? White or dark?</i>

514
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,440
Uh, white.
White.

515
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,350
No skin. White, no skin. Okay. Okay.

516
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,680
Do you always do a
Thanksgiving trial run? Uh-huh.

517
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,750
Thanks for being my guinea pig.
Looks good.

518
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,790
Well, it would've been better
if you'd given me a syringe.

519
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,200
<i>O'Connell, in the immortal words of Popeye
- "I am what I am and that's all I am."</i>

520
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:53,720
<i>What happened to "Maggie"?
What?</i>

521
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,000
<i>Last night you called me Maggie.
Last night?</i>

522
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,170
- Don't you remember?
- Sure, I remember.

523
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,580
Y-You said all those things
about my lips and my mouth.

524
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,880
Well, you know, you said
they were, uh-

525
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,480
- Sure. When we were-
- Yeah.

526
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,580
- In the, uh-
- On the couch.

527
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,650
Right.

528
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:28,700
Wow. This is delicious.

529
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,970
Mmm.

530
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,700
You know, it's amazing
how much you look like your brother.

531
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,750
I'm taller.

532
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:43,550
Slick back your hair, put you in a polyester
suit. You guys could almost pass as one another.

533
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,720
<i>Never work. Inside we are
very different people.</i>

534
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,190
Maybe.

535
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:56,150
You know, O'Connell, all that stuff
I said last night?

536
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,430
I meant every word.

537
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:21,290
<i>Joel? Jules? Jules? Joel?</i>

538
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,850
Joel? Jules? Fleischman.
Fleischman, wake up.

539
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,090
<i>Fleischman?
Huh?</i>

540
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,930
Fleischman? It's okay.

541
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,590
O'Connell, it's you.

542
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,970
<i>Of course it's me.
Hey. Anybody there?</i>

543
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,310
I heard about what happened toJoel,

544
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,040
<i>and, well, he looks okay now.</i>

545
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:49,240
Yeah, but he hit his noggin real hard. We
thought for a while there he was a goner.

546
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,150
No, you don't understand.
I wasn't here.

547
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,980
l-I wasn't, really.

548
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,500
l-I was in jail with Freud-

549
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,400
You ran into the railing, Fleischman,
and these guys found you.

550
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:08,630
- You just had a bad dream.
- No, it wasn't a dream. It was real, and you were there.

551
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,330
A-And he was there. And him.

552
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:14,100
Sometimes weird things happen.

553
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,340
Ed, Chris and you were talking about
bringing in the Mad Bomber.

554
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,080
And, O'Connell,
you were seduced byJules.

555
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:25,640
Jules? My twin brother,
who you thought was me, and-

556
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,150
Wait.

557
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,530
I don't have a twin
brother named Jules. Do I?

558
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,430
It was just a bad dream, Joel.

559
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,330
- Halloween jitters.
- Oh.

560
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,170
It felt real.

561
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,570
Well, we, uh-
we better be shoving off.

562
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,910
Yeah, we got a long flight tomorrow. Uh,
hey, you take care of that bump on your head.

563
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,980
<i>Okay?
I will. Thanks.</i>

564
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:02,390
<i>- Rest easy, Joel.
- Bye-bye, Dr. Fleischman.</i>

565
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,060
You need anything, Fleischman?

566
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,700
No. I don't think so.

567
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:17,760
Okay. Get a good night's sleep.
We'll come see you tomorrow, okay?

568
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,930
<i>Can I give you a hand with that stuff?
No, thanks.</i>

569
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,170
<i>But, uh, where can we get
a good meal around here?</i>

570
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,740
<i>Holling's bar. Good food.
How's the hunting, boys?</i>

571
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:32,480
<i>Oh, it was great,
but we're looking forward to getting home.</i>

572
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:37,050
<i>Where's that?
Topeka.</i>

573
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,790
<i>Kansas?</i>

574
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,460
Nah.

575
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,470
<i>There's a dark side
to each and every human soul.</i>

576
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:01,040
We wanna be Obi-Wan Kenobi
and, for the most part, we are.

577
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,450
But there's a little Darth Vader
in all of us.

578
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:09,010
'Cause the thing is,
this ain't no either/or proposition.

579
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:14,430
'Cause we're talking about dialectics.
The good and the bad merging into us.

580
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,090
You know, you can run,
but you can't hide.

581
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:23,330
My experience?
Face the darkness.

582
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,570

1
00:00:01,782 --> 00:00:03,716
Steak?
Yeah, steak.

2
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:07,880
Thick, well-marbled, loaded with fat,
cholesterol, red dye number five. You?

3
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:09,888
Spaghetts.
Spaghetti?

4
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:12,254
Yeah, man. Al dente. A nice
pesto. Good morning, Chris.

5
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:16,057
Come on, Chris. Not when you're really
hungry. No, when you haven't eaten for days,

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,859
you want flesh
- flesh dripping in its own juices. Hi, Chris.

7
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:21,423
Something with sinews. Something
you have to tear with your teeth.

8
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:23,435
<i>Chris.
Hi.</i>

9
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:25,903
When you're really hungry, that's
too much work. Who wants to-

10
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:27,997
<i>Hi. Hi. Who wants to
do all that chewing?</i>

11
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:31,442
<i>Chewing's the best part. Mastication is
integral to the whole desire. Hello, Chris.</i>

12
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:34,344
Mandibles moving like pistons,
triggering saliva.

13
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:37,713
<i>I think the basic craving is get that
belly full quickly as possible. Hi.</i>

14
00:00:37,784 --> 00:00:40,048
You know, chewing just takes
too much time. Hi. How you doin'?

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,611
Now, you get a nice, big
mouth full of spaghetts, right?

16
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:44,623
<i>It just goes down like-
Hi there.</i>

17
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:47,455
Hi. Good to see you
- oysters or maybe some ice cream.

18
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:49,791
You know, none of that
jaw syndrome thing happening.

19
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:52,889
What? T.M.J.? Yeah, right.
Now, chili- Chili's really good-

20
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:55,059
Hi. Hi, darling. How are you?

21
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:59,162
As long as there's not too many beans in it. Too many
beans, you're in the realm of a vegetable side dish.

22
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,400
Or, you know-
Hold it. Hold it.

23
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:03,739
Are we walking down the street
discussing food,

24
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,302
and are not women, several-
no, numerous women- smiling at you,

25
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:11,340
shamelessly greeting you, almost
practically coming on to you? Yeah.

26
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:16,718
Oh, okay.
Okay. I get it.

27
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,883
What?
It's funny. Very funny.

28
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,893
What?
The gag.

29
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:23,862
Women fawning, googly-eyes.
You play dumb. It's very funny.

30
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,592
Hi. Excuse me, Chris.
Would you mind?

31
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,100
No, no. Not at all.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

33
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:23,682
<i>No- "N. '"</i>

34
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:26,123
<i>"M. '" "M. '"
Definitely an "M. '"</i>

35
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,120
You know, you really should
change this typeface.

36
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,130
People must complain.
Don't they?

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,990
I mean, this was
much thicker... or something.

38
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,070
Well, not that I can't read it. Um-

39
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,600
<i>It's a- "N."</i>

40
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,270
<i>"N." Definitely an "N."</i>

41
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,000
<i>"Z." "Z" maybe?</i>

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,610
Wait a minute. You can't possibly think
there's something wrong with my eyes...

43
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,080
just because I couldn't read that.

44
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,210
It's nothing serious.

45
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,890
Well, what do you mean nothing
serious? Just a little farsightedness.

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,930
You've probably noticed it yourself.

47
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,690
The newspaper's starting to look blurred.

48
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,030
Maybe you've been finding yourself
holding books at arm's length.

49
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,230
Well, yeah. But so what?

50
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,830
I mean, I find it uncomfortable to read
a book jammed right underneath my face.

51
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,030
Right. Well, it sounds
to me like presbyopia.

52
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,480
<i>Press by what? "Opia," for
sight. "Presby" for old.</i>

53
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,670
When you're young, the lens
in your eyes got enough flexibility...

54
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,840
to change its curve
based on what you see.

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,720
But as you get older,
that flexibility starts going.

56
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,690
By the time you're middle-aged-
Middle-aged?

57
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,320
Middle- Middle-aged?
Y-You think I'm middle-aged?

58
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,330
I don't-
Do I look like middle-aged?

59
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,330
What I meant was, presbyopia is not
uncommon in someone in their early 30s.

60
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,770
30s? I am not in my 30s.
I'm nowhere near 30.

61
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,930
I'm 29.

62
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,640
Your testosterone level's
a little on the high side,

63
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,800
but it's still in the normal range.

64
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,440
Yeah? I don't think it's a hormone. No?

65
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,580
No, my dad always said
it was more like a smell.

66
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,880
A smell?
Like an aroma?

67
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,120
Yeah. A smell like
- Like what?

68
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,250
Like aftershave?
Like incense?

69
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,320
Yeah.

70
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,020
I don't smell anything.
Well, you wouldn't.

71
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,590
Why's that?
You're not a woman.

72
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,600
I mean, there have been a few men
that could smell me.

73
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,070
Comes a pretty big shock
to 'em too, especially if they...

74
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,070
haven't come to terms
with their feminine side.

75
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,870
- But mainly it's women.
- Mainly women.

76
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,640
What women?
Your basic cross section of humanity?

77
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,620
Rich, poor, young, old,
Jewish, gentile, black, white?

78
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,550
Yeah. All types.

79
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,490
Wait a minute. You're telling me if my grandmother
walked through this door, she would lust after you?

80
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,990
Naomi Fleischman of Brooklyn Heights
would lust after you?

81
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,030
Well, Joel, it's not as simple
as lust. I mean-

82
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,060
Somebody like your gram- I don't know.
It's hard to say, not knowing her,

83
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,100
but she'd probably experience
something along the lines of...

84
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,970
an overwhelming need to pinch
my cheeks, uh, knit me a sweater.

85
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,070
Whip you up a batch of hamantaschen.

86
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,980
If that's something
she's inclined to do, yeah.

87
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,020
I mean, desire's a pretty
individual phenomenon.

88
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,280
So you're saying
this smell that causes...

89
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,450
all women to desire you
in their own unique way, travels?

90
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,690
How far?
A few feet?

91
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,750
A mile?
Ten miles?

92
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,020
We could get tour buses from Idaho?

93
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,290
Wow, I don't know.

94
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,600
I never got anybody
out of the metropolitan area before.

95
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,540
<i>Except that time I was in St. Louis, but
that's practically in Illinois anyway.</i>

96
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,300
- That time? Which time?
- Had it a couple times since puberty.

97
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,310
The last episode was pretty bad.

98
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,370
- Bad? What?
- File.

99
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,010
<i>I kinda let things get out ofhand.</i>

100
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,450
I mean, let's face it, with something like
this, you got a real tendency to overindulge.

101
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,490
Sure, a room full of naked
18-year-olds is great.

102
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,220
<i>But you get a bunch of teenagers
missing a night or two of sleep-</i>

103
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,230
fuses start to get short.

104
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,730
You got disputes over
whose turn's next,

105
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,740
um, unpleasant things are said.

106
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,860
Pretty soon,
everything reaches critical mass.

107
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,870
I think I learned a lesson or two.

108
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,910
How's- How's that?

109
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,240
<i>Aurea mediocritas.
Everything in moderation.</i>

110
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,010
I stay clear of friends
and married women.

111
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,110
<i>What?</i>

112
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,020
<i>Marilyn.!</i>

113
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,330
Now that's- that's too much, Maurice.

114
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,430
How so?
Well, you don't look quite sincere.

115
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,940
Oh. Well, how 'bout this?

116
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,170
Friendlier. Like you're
welcoming me into your home.

117
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,610
<i>Yeah.! Where's this
gonna hang anyway?</i>

118
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,710
Houston. Space Center.
They've got a gallery where they...

119
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,150
pin up all the guys
that took the big ride.

120
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,050
Most of those other fellows
are a little long in the tooth...

121
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,250
and a little... thick across
the gut to go Thinsulate.

122
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,530
But I'll tell you
- I feel like a C.E.O. gettin' ready for a quarterly report wearin' this getup.

123
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,900
You look terrific.
Reassuring. Strong.

124
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,960
<i>Presidential.
Yeah. I suppose so.</i>

125
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,770
I really appreciate you doing
this, Holling. I really do.

126
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,810
Oh, it's my pleasure, Maurice.
My pleasure.

127
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,610
Hey, that's good.
That's a nice smile.

128
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,680
<i>Okay, here's your order.</i>

129
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,450
Three burgers, two with
cheese, one with salsa.

130
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,120
What's the damage?
On the house, Chris.

131
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,680
You smell bitchin'.
Well, thanks, Shel.

132
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,560
Let's go, girls. Ruth-Anne, I probably
can't make it till a little past 10:00 tonight,

133
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,790
if that's okay with you.
No problem.

134
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,530
I kinda overbooked.
I'll see you later everybody.

135
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,070
Chris is coming
to your place tonight?

136
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,980
Yes. And the two of you-
You and Chris are going to-

137
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,710
Have a late supper, Joel.

138
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,880
Do you believe this?

139
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,150
Have you ever seen a man with this kind of
incredible, irresistible magnetism to the opposite sex?

140
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,350
- James Bond.
- That's the movies, Ed. Try reality.

141
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,620
No, thanks.

142
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,060
Oh, not you too, O'Connell.

143
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,230
Not me too, what?
You're looking for Chris, right?

144
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,470
No, Fleischman,
I'm looking for you.

145
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,570
<i>Listen
- Do you know anything about something called "presby" something or another.</i>

146
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,610
<i>"Old eyes."
Ever heard of it?</i>

147
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,340
Presbyopia. Farsightedness. Right.

148
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,850
Is there anything
you can do about it?

149
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,980
Like what? I don't know.
Like diet, exercise?

150
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,360
That's an interesting
concept, O'Connell.

151
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,360
A weight loss program
for farsightedness.

152
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:46,020
Afraid not. It's just part
of the normal aging process. Why?

153
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,470
No reason. A friend, uh,
wants to know. That's all.

154
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,770
Well, tell her presbyopia
is nothing to worry about.

155
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,670
No? It's just, you know, a warning sign.

156
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,140
A harbinger, if you will.
Harbinger? Of what?

157
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,150
Of the inevitable downhill slide.

158
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,380
Old age.
The eyes go first.

159
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,610
Then the claims of gravity set in
with a fold under the eyes,

160
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,950
a roll beneath the chin,
wattles, cellulite.

161
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,820
The breasts, the buttocks go. Next thing you know,
you look in the mirror, you see a basset hound.

162
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,160
Your friend's how old?
Forty-five? Fifty?

163
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,630
What? You want me
to talk to her?

164
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,630
Uh, listen, before we
get started, we, uh-

165
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,900
we might wanna set
some ground rules.

166
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,910
<i>Nothing personal or anything,
it's just-</i>

167
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,640
<i>You know, to be up front.
You're busy. I'm very busy.</i>

168
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:37,240
<i>I think if you just summon up a little willpower,
we'll get through this thing together, alone.</i>

169
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,310
Okay.

170
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,530
And I think it's probably better if you
don't touch me too, because once you do, well-

171
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,930
I know you probably mean well. It's just gonna be hard
for you to keep things from getting out of control.

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,190
You don't want me to touch you?

173
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,200
Well, believe me, it's for the best.

174
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:01,370
I mean, you know, it's a perfectly normal
urge. So, you know, don't be embarrassed.

175
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,410
Okay.

176
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,440
You know, it just means you're a woman.
A normal woman, that's all.

177
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,570
You don't have to read
anything into that.

178
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,140
Look into the light.

179
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,120
Uh-uh.
No touching. Please.

180
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,420
Man, you're sneaky.

181
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,070
How you doing?

182
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,930
Fine. You?
Good.

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,500
Just take shallow breaths. You gotta be
careful not to suck me too deep into your lungs.

184
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,010
I'll try to remember that.

185
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,510
You sure you're okay?
Yeah.

186
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,980
Hmm.

187
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,120
<i>- Where is he?
- Who?</i>

188
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,720
- Well, hello, Maurice.
- You couldn't resist, could you?

189
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,890
<i>What are you talking about?
I'm talking about trust, Holling.</i>

190
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,190
I'm talking about betrayal.
I'm talking about this!

191
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,500
You think that's funny, don't you?

192
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,970
I bet you sat at home all night,
holding your sides laughing at me.

193
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,440
Go ahead. Put it up on
your dartboard back there.

194
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,450
You don't like this picture?

195
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:19,110
Do you think that's what I look like? Is that what
you think of when you think of Maurice Minnifield?

196
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,620
But I thought you
- You thought I'd enjoy being made a fool of?

197
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,490
No. I should've known.
I should've remembered.

198
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,360
I let my guard down.
Maurice-

199
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,490
You have this twisted desire, this-

200
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,560
this need to destroy any
happiness that you find, don't you?

201
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,830
Maurice-
Shelly wasn't enough.

202
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,930
Shelly? No, you stuck the knife
in, and then you had to twist it.

203
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,070
What's Shelly got to do with this? I haven't
forgotten that you stole Shelly from me.

204
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,240
I did not steal Shelly from you.

205
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,480
If you're gonna give me that old line about how
she came to you, forget about it. Save your breath.

206
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,210
Nobody's buying that,
least of all me!

207
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,870
Sniff. How does that scent
make you feel?

208
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,210
Any particular response?
Smells okay.

209
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,510
And-
That's all.

210
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,510
Okay. Good.

211
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,490
That was English Leather.

212
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,730
And this?

213
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,730
Does this make you
want to do anything?

214
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,320
What?
Eat.

215
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,230
Eat?
Herring.

216
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,960
Herring?
That was Brut.

217
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,470
And... how about this?

218
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,050
What?
That's him.

219
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,750
Incredible.

220
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,750
<i>Marilyn, how are you?
Hello, Holling.</i>

221
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,100
- Hi, Holling. Anything wrong?
- No.

222
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,070
Just one of those things
where you think one thing...

223
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,660
and someone else thinks
something else,

224
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,110
and before you know it,
your whole world is shot to hell.

225
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,770
<i>And you don't know what to
think. Oh, I see. I think.</i>

226
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,940
<i>Take a look at that.</i>

227
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,520
<i>Well, Joel?
Well what?</i>

228
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,320
In your honest opinion, Joel,
is that a good picture?

229
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,380
Oh, I don't know, Holling.

230
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,120
Good is a relative concept, and then
you have to take in account the subject.

231
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,960
I don't know if there really could be
a good picture of Maurice.

232
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:51,090
- Would you say you've seen better?
- The one he has in the den with L.B.J.

233
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,260
I'd say that's pretty fair.

234
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,270
<i>What?</i>

235
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,310
He thinks I made him look like a fool.

236
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,140
Oh. Well, you know,

237
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,610
I don't think we always look
the way we think we look to others.

238
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,920
<i>Joel, I never intended to make
Maurice look bad. Of course not.</i>

239
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,320
- And Shelly was the same way.
- What way?

240
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:16,350
He says I stole her. Stole my best
friend's girl. He says I'd do that to him.

241
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,790
You did.

242
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,660
- Well, didn't you?
- No. No!

243
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,760
Oh, I admit I was
smitten with Shelly...

244
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,400
from the very first moment
I laid eyes on her,

245
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,410
but I swear to God,
Joel, I never did what he says.

246
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,340
Holling, really,
you don't have to explain.

247
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,410
Joel, I remember every detail
of the day he brought Shelly to Cicely.

248
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,450
<i>Holling, it's none of my business.</i>

249
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,510
It was a Tuesday.
I had a good lunch crowd.

250
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,580
<i>Ran out of the salmon loaf.</i>

251
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,790
<i>Maurice came into the bar,</i>

252
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,660
<i>and behind him,
there she was-</i>

253
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,670
<i>the most beautiful
young lady I'd ever seen.</i>

254
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,140
<i>There was a kind of
electricity in the air.</i>

255
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,640
<i>My heart was pounding.</i>

256
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,740
<i>Of course, I made every effort
to hide my feelings,</i>

257
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,780
<i>but I could feel her gaze.</i>

258
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,450
<i>Maurice was strutting like the king
of the roost, and who could blame him?</i>

259
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,920
<i>I guess Shelly had a headache
from the drive.</i>

260
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,550
<i>She was trying to open
a bottle of aspirin.</i>

261
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,430
<i>If only Shelly had asked
Maurice to open that bottle.</i>

262
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,600
<i>But she didn't. She asked me.</i>

263
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,870
<i>And from that moment on,
I was a lost man.</i>

264
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,240
A lost man.

265
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,550
And the happiest man
on the face of the Earth.

266
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,170
<i>Yeah? Who is it?</i>

267
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,080
<i>It's me. Joel.
You alone?</i>

268
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,310
Yeah. You got a minute?

269
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,560
Sorry about that.

270
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,660
Hey, I got some wonderful news.
Yeah, what?

271
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,330
I called a colleague at Beth Zion, one
of the best E.N.T. men on the East Coast.

272
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,670
Board certified. On the faculty
of Harvard Medical School.

273
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,680
Really. A leading
light in his field.

274
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,480
He confirmed to me that what you are
experiencing is, in fact, actually happening.

275
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,540
He thinks it may be
your pheromones. My what?

276
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,180
Pheromones. Chemical substances,
that when discharged,

277
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,780
act like a triggering device that prompts
specific behavioral responses. Huh.

278
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,120
Although your case is extreme,
there've been precedents to support it.

279
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,590
<i>Yeah. There was this man, uh, Curtis,</i>

280
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,600
<i>who was profiled in
the Nasopharyngeal Review.</i>

281
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,500
He could identify by smell the presence
of sulfur dioxide in the air...

282
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,870
<i>in quantities as minute
as.6 parts per million.</i>

283
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,030
- Really?
- Yeah. In the realm of the senses,

284
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,040
there's been lots of bizarre
phenomena documented-

285
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,740
blind people whose touch is so sensitive,
they can read typeface.

286
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,040
<i>Not braille. Actual typeface
off the written page.</i>

287
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:25,240
Wine connoisseurs who can tell you
the composition of the soil...

288
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,310
in which a particular
grape grew.

289
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,580
We now know humans can hear sounds transmitted at
frequencies once thought too high for human behavior.

290
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,820
Wow. All right. Here's
what I need to do.

291
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,020
I need to take some samples,
run a test, build a case history.

292
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,260
- I'm gonna answer this medical conundrum.
- Good. All right.

293
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,130
First thing we need to do,
we need to examine your family tree,

294
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,040
catalog any common traits in the males where
there might be any unusual pheromone secretions.

295
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,870
- Common traits?
- You know, genealogical patterns.

296
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,880
Oh, right, right, right. Well, you know,
Joel, most of us did time in the joint.

297
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,180
<i>Interesting. Anything else?</i>

298
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,950
- Uh, what else? Pretty heavy drinkers.
- Alcoholism?

299
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,550
Yeah, you could say that. Look, Joel,
you think we could finish this up later?

300
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,860
<i>'Cause I gotta go see Irene,
the eye doctor. Oh, sure.</i>

301
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,360
Would you distract the women?
'Cause I'll be okay if I can make the tree line.

302
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,270
No, look, I'll just make a run
for it. I'll see you later, okay?

303
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,110
Hello, Maggie.
Can you read this?

304
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,200
<i>"Bert Sinclair plans
a quiet Thanksgiving this year."</i>

305
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,950
<i>Wait. You can't possibly read this.</i>

306
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:41,020
<i>"Bert, PattyJo, Kelly and PattyJoJr.
with their 12-pound turkey."</i>

307
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,030
Why? Can't you?

308
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,460
Well, of course I can.
I'm only 29.

309
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,470
Why couldn't I?

310
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,590
Did I say something wrong?

311
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,100
No. Of course not.
You didn't say anything wrong.

312
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,570
It doesn't matter to me how old
people think I am. It doesn't. Doesn't.

313
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,170
I don't understood why people
are so sensitive about their age.

314
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,240
It's a natural process. There's
absolutely nothing you can do about it.

315
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,280
Absolutely nothing.

316
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,750
<i>Blur five.</i>

317
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,520
Or blur six?

318
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,820
Uh, Dr. Rondenet.
Yes?

319
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,890
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm with a patient.

320
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Right. I'm sorry.

321
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,700
Would you mind?
This'll just take one second.

322
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,260
Do you, by chance,
have a sense of smell?

323
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,270
A sense of smell?

324
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,280
Yes.

325
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,400
Right, right. Of course.

326
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,470
I'm sorry, sir.

327
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,350
Was that blur five? Look,
are you sure about the smell?

328
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,450
Just one second. Maybe you assume
you do because everybody does.

329
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,960
But really you don't. You never noticed
before because, not having a sense of smell,

330
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,790
you didn't know what one was,
so you couldn't conceive it, right?

331
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,460
No. I know what smell is.

332
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,870
- You do?
- Yes.

333
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,240
Look, would you just
do me one small favor?

334
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,470
I am really sorry.

335
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,910
Would you just smell me?

336
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,970
Just please? Inhale me deeply.

337
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,110
What do you smell?

338
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,490
Well- Soap.

339
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,550
Soap.

340
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,390
Just one more question, mister,
then I'm out of here.

341
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,430
You're telling me you can
resist me, physically, sexually?

342
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,100
Yes.

343
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,400
That's great. That's-
That's wonderful.

344
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,100
I'm sorry, sir.
Good luck with your eye test.

345
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,050
All right.

346
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,780
<i>Hold on. Yeah, yeah.</i>

347
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,560
How can you sleep, Fleischman?

348
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,230
What? It-It's 3:00 in the morning.

349
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,290
I thought we were friends.
How could you do it?

350
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,030
Do it? Do what?

351
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,870
- Talk to Holling!
- I talked to Holling because he came to my office.

352
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:17,540
And you just couldn't say no, huh?
You had to see him.

353
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,450
<i>You didn't think for a minute
how it might make me feel.</i>

354
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,550
Let me give you a flash,
Fleischman. I have feelings!

355
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,990
Okay. You have feelings.
It's 3:00 in the morning.

356
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,160
Sure, I keep 'em under wraps.
I keep 'em hidden. I play the big guy.

357
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,200
<i>Maurice the rock.
Maurice the tree.</i>

358
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:39,290
Well, let me tell you something,
Fleischman. I am a human being.

359
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:44,400
If you stab me with a shiv,
I bleed just like the next guy.

360
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,410
You're saying all this
because I talked to Holling?

361
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,340
Did you see that photograph?

362
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,650
There's nothing wrong with that portrait,
Maurice. Nothing that nature didn't intend.

363
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,590
- You think I look like that?
- More or less, yeah.

364
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,420
<i>Come on, Maurice. What was I supposed
to do, throw him out of the office?</i>

365
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:06,020
I guess he told you that story
about Shelly too.

366
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,000
<i>About how she came into the bar one night
and said, "I'm yours if you want me."</i>

367
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,100
<i>No, not exactly.
Well, that's bull, Fleischman.</i>

368
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,440
He was after her from the beginning.

369
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,440
<i>Yeah?
With a vengeance.</i>

370
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,500
What'd he do?

371
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:27,180
I never expected to be ambushed
like that, especially by my best bud.

372
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,360
I couldn't wait to introduce 'em.

373
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,050
<i>I thought we'd make
the perfect threesome.</i>

374
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,600
<i>But he was just waiting to steal her.</i>

375
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,150
<i>We'd done 500 miles on the Alcan...</i>

376
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,260
<i>and were only looking for a quick bite
before heading home.</i>

377
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,130
<i>The signs were all there-</i>

378
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,300
<i>the leering gaze,</i>

379
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,840
<i>the brazen touch.</i>

380
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:58,110
<i>But I foolishly chose
to ignore them.</i>

381
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,380
<i>Shelly had a headache
from the long drive...</i>

382
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,420
<i>and was having trouble
opening a bottle of aspirin.</i>

383
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,420
<i>I started to help her,</i>

384
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:10,860
<i>but Holling stepped between us
and took the bottle from her hand.</i>

385
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,060
<i>Then the die was cast.</i>

386
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,100
Just like with the picture,

387
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,910
I was blinded by my own trusting nature.

388
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,040
Saw the light.

389
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:02,510
Thought I'd come in, see how
you're holding up. Oh, I'm fine.

390
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,140
Not feeling up to, um,
intercourse tonight, huh?

391
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,240
Nah, not really.
I don't blame you.

392
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,950
<i>Cherchez la femme.
That's one thing the Frogs got right.</i>

393
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,790
Yeah.
Lady Love sure can turn a man's head,

394
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,530
make him betray his country
or his dearest friend.

395
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,870
Or she could just not care.
Make you lose your self-respect.

396
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,170
Think about a woman who doesn't know you're thinking
about her, doesn't care you're thinking about her,

397
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,300
makes you
think about her even more.

398
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,640
I'm thinkin' about him.

399
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,780
How him and her became them
and I became only me.

400
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,050
Yeah, him.
I wonder who her him is.

401
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,610
Bet Holling's got her moaning
on the bun-warmer right now.

402
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,790
Yeah.

403
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,850
Irene?

404
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,200
Shelly.
I'm talking about Irene.

405
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,290
Irene who?

406
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,770
It doesn't matter.

407
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,500
No. Guess not.

408
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,120
Hi, Chris.
Hey.

409
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,560
How ya doing?
Great. Great.

410
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,320
You know, Patti, this never happened
to me before. It's no big deal.

411
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,190
It's just kinda interesting
'cause on one level,

412
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,200
I wanna perform-
you know, all men do.

413
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,600
But on another,
I guess I didn't.

414
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,110
<i>I mean, my mind was there, but-</i>

415
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,540
It really wasn't.
I just couldn't focus.

416
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,640
Hi. Hello. Hi.

417
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,170
Wow, it's, um-
It's really pretty here.

418
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,980
Ooh, those, uh, spruce trees?

419
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,990
That's a spruce.
Huh.

420
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,920
You don't have to avoid the subject.
You know, we can talk about it.

421
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,930
The subject is?
Impotence.

422
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,190
He couldn't focus.

423
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,200
You guys were great.

424
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,960
I mean, very giving,
very sensitive, very erotic.

425
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,130
Thanks. You too.

426
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,040
I'll tell you the truth.

427
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,080
I can't quit thinking
about somebody else.

428
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,880
<i>I mean, I look at
your two lovely bodies, and...</i>

429
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,970
I see her.

430
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,990
Although I've never seen her.

431
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,980
<i>Her body. Huh. Wow.</i>

432
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,990
It's more than sex. You know, it's-

433
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,520
I wanna go for a walk with her.
I wanna- I wanna feed her.

434
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,260
- I wanna read Sendak to her.
- Who is she?

435
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,600
The itinerant optometrist.

436
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,860
Well, why don't you
let her get a whiff of you?

437
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,000
Hey, Linda, believe me, I've
tried. She's just not interested.

438
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,010
Really?
Really?

439
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,240
Well, how come?
I don't know.

440
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,710
I guess she just
can't smell the real me.

441
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,840
Wow.
Too bad.

442
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,160
O'Connell.
Fleischman.

443
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,270
What?
You're wearing mascara.

444
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,770
So?
You never wear makeup.

445
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,860
So? Today I am.

446
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,640
What?
Eye shadow.

447
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,050
Fleischman, what's the big deal?

448
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,980
Why today?

449
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,610
I don't know. Look, Fleischman,
I'm a grown woman.

450
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,180
I don't have to give you or anyone else
a reason why I decide to wear makeup.

451
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,820
Why today?

452
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:40,330
I don't know. I guess I just
felt the need to feel pretty.

453
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,900
Chris.
Chris?

454
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:47,670
You're attracted to Chris
like every other woman in town.

455
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,870
Fleischman, you don't understand
anything that's not in a book-

456
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,240
not makeup, not men, not me.

457
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,440
You haven't a clue.

458
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:01,010
Let me just say I have more important things
on my mind than carnal, erotic pleasures.

459
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,140
Hmm.
I do.

460
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,350
Granted, Chris might be a stud,
but I am not some cow in heat...

461
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,330
waiting to get poked by
the lankiest bull in the pasture.

462
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,500
Touchy.

463
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,930
Hi, Dr. Fleischman.
Shelly.

464
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,990
Did Holling talk to you?
Yeah.

465
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,010
And?
Maurice too.

466
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,940
Oh. We have two radically
different stories here, Shelly.

467
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:31,380
Maurice says Holling seduced you. Holling
claims he successfully resisted his desires.

468
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,380
What's your recollection?

469
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,180
My record collection?

470
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,020
The first time you came
into this place, what happened?

471
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,930
Well, let me think.

472
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,690
We'd been driving all day.

473
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,790
And Maurice's muffler had a hole in it,
so the engine was really loud.

474
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,730
It sounded kinda cool,
it being a V-8 and all,

475
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,970
but still,
it gave me a huge headache.

476
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,010
<i>Maurice introduced me to Holling.</i>

477
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,270
<i>But I wasn't paying too much attention.</i>

478
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,640
<i>All I could think about
was getting an aspirin.</i>

479
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:09,410
<i>The bottle had one of those safety caps, and I'd broken
a nail packing my suitcase, and I couldn't get it off.</i>

480
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,820
<i>Maurice and Holling didn't notice.
They were too busy catching up.</i>

481
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,990
<i>Luckily, Dave was standing nearby.</i>

482
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,930
Dave? Dave opened the- the bottle?

483
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,990
Uh-huh.

484
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:28,160
This reminds me of the story of the six blind men
who try to figure out what an elephant is by touch.

485
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,870
The one at the trunk thinks it's a rope. The one at the
tusk thinks it's a horn. Nobody knows the whole truth.

486
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,400
Huh.
Yeah.

487
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,020
<i>Well, what animal
was the elephant anyway?</i>

488
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,420
<i>It's like you think I'm a rope,</i>

489
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:51,390
and you think I'm a horn.

490
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,760
But you're both wrong.

491
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,800
I'm an elephant!

492
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,460
So go ahead.
Shake hands and make up.

493
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:05,110
We are gonna sit here
until you two patch things up.

494
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,170
I don't care if it takes all day.

495
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,970
Well, if Maurice
is ready to apologize.

496
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,810
Me?
For the false accusations.

497
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,080
I'm the injured party here.
Boys.

498
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,450
<i>What about my reputation.
Your reputation?</i>

499
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,720
Repeat a lie often enough,
people will believe it.

500
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,730
- Boys.
- And what about me?

501
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,990
<i>You think I don't know what they're saying when I walk
down the street? "There goes Minnifield the cuckold."</i>

502
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,360
- What gave you the right to claim her in the first place?
- Holling!

503
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,170
I went to a great deal of time and
expense to bring this girl up here.

504
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,540
A few meals and a frock or two. I've been
supporting her for the last three years.

505
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,410
- I work!
- She could live like a queen with me.

506
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,570
That's right, Maurice. Don't
let me forget. You're a rich man.

507
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:49,090
You can't forget it. You wanna
know why? Because you're jealous.

508
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,520
That's what this whole thing's about.
Well, good.

509
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,180
I'm sure glad I'm not the elephant.

510
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,420
The truth is, I'm just a bone
for you two dogs to fight over.

511
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,660
And I'm really glad.

512
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,630
I'm so glad, I never want to see
either one of you ever again!

513
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,270
<i>The patient, Christopher Stevens,
is a 28-year-old male Caucasian.</i>

514
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:15,870
Although family records are limited, it appears
that both the father and the paternal grandfather...

515
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,710
manifested signs of
the same secretory syndrome.

516
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,980
<i>Uh, thus it appears the condition
is genetic rather than acquired,</i>

517
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,110
although environmental cofactors
can't be ruled out.

518
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,280
<i>Got a sec?
Sure. Come on in.</i>

519
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,990
What's up?

520
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,990
Not much.

521
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,430
- I'm impotent.
- Impotent?

522
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,270
- You are impotent?
- Yeah.

523
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,810
Fantastic.
When did this happen?

524
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,610
- Last night.
- Is this normal?

525
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,120
- Wait. Do you mind?
- No. Go ahead.

526
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,750
Is impotence consistent
with the pathology?

527
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,020
I mean, has it happened
before? No. First time.

528
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,030
Wow. This is terrific.

529
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,320
Yeah, well- No, no. I'm
sorry. l-l-It's terrible.

530
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,630
I commiserate, but this is
great. Oh, I know why. I'm-

531
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,960
Let's wait. Hold on.
Let's not rush to a conclusion.

532
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,440
It could be any number of things.
Maybe none related.

533
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,000
What I need to do is
a complete urological workup,

534
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,310
plus a blood count,
hemoglobin, a thyroid-

535
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,250
- No, I'm in love.
- You're in love.

536
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,980
Actually, I think it's a
form of narcissism. I mean-

537
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,450
How can you love somebody
you don't even know?

538
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,180
Aren't you really just, like, projecting
all the qualities you want them to have...

539
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,090
<i>'cause you're lacking 'em in yourself?
Huh.</i>

540
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,420
<i>Well, anyway, in any case,
you are impotent?</i>

541
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,460
- Yeah.
- Good.

542
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,470
A-And you think
it's because you're in love.

543
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,090
Oh, yeah, 'cause, you know,
I'm obsessing on this woman.

544
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,470
Why?
Why?

545
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,010
I can't have her.
She's not interested in me.

546
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,810
Incredible. This person,
the woman of your desires,

547
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,280
um, can she smell you?
Yeah.

548
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,150
Only, I don't smell to her
like I do to all these other women.

549
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,520
What am I gonna do?

550
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,020
I don't know.

551
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:08,320
Obsessions and fixations
are not really my field.

552
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:13,560
All I know, when the mind really
grabs hold of something, look out.

553
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,390
Crazy glue.
Exactly.

554
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,240
Uh, hi. We gotta talk.
We do?

555
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,250
Yes, we do. I'm a mess.

556
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,220
You're all I'm thinkin' about. I hear
your voice in the wind in the trees.

557
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,590
I see your face in shadows.
You know what the ironic thing is?

558
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,720
There's women lined up- literally lined
up- desperate for me. Some of'em would kill.

559
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,920
- And you, Irene, you don't-
Can I call you Irene? - Yes.

560
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,530
- You're not even the slightest bit interested in me, are you?
- No.

561
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,040
- May I ask you a personal question, Irene?
- If you have to.

562
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,040
- Are you married?
- No.

563
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,600
- Boyfriend?
- No.

564
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,440
- Gay?
- No.

565
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:05,380
And you don't foresee any changes
in your feelings towards me?

566
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,280
- I'm sorry.
- Why? Why? What's wrong with me?

567
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:13,050
Would you just answer me
that one question, Irene, please?

568
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,660
Nothing.
Nothing.

569
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,330
I understand.

570
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,630
I guess that's why
I'm crazy in love with you.

571
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,470
Because I'm not interested in you?

572
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,600
- Yeah.
- Oh.

573
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,410
Look, it's not your fault, all right?
You just gotta understand, Irene.

574
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,810
- I got a big problem here.
- I can see that.

575
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,820
All right, what if you just
showed a little interest in me?

576
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:46,320
<i>You know, then this whole "unobtainable
object of desire" thing vanishes.</i>

577
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,760
I go on with my life.
You go on with yours.

578
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,020
You know, just consider me another
notch in your belt, so to speak. Okay?

579
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,960
I don't think I want to do that. Look,
your interest doesn't have to be genuine.

580
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,800
Uh-uh.
You got a better idea?

581
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:02,270
Well, we could try to be
friends. Oh, no. Come on.

582
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,570
Everybody says that. I've
said that. It doesn't work.

583
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,240
True.

584
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,300
I wish I could help you.

585
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:15,070
I guess the best thing is- the only
thing is-we don't see each other anymore.

586
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,720
If you think that's best.
Yeah. Cold turkey.

587
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,320
Nothing I can do? Nothing I
can say to change your mind?

588
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,790
Uh-uh.
All right.

589
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,610
<i>Hello, Maurice?</i>

590
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,320
- Maurice?
- What do you want?

591
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,150
We've got to talk.

592
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,630
I remember when
you bought this place.

593
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,690
I thought it was a big mistake-

594
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,860
dry rot, cracked foundations,
rusted pipes.

595
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,990
But you had a vision.

596
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,000
You saw the possibilities.

597
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:13,200
<i>It's always been
like that with you, Maurice.</i>

598
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,270
You see ahead.

599
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,840
Maybe it's being an astronaut,

600
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,980
<i>looking out into all that empty space,</i>

601
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,680
<i>imagining what would fill it.</i>

602
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,350
We used to sit right in that window...

603
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,290
and pick off rabbits in your garden
with a.22 all night long.

604
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,400
You used to
grow okra out there.

605
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,900
Some of the best gumbo
I ever tasted.

606
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,780
I recall this one time
we almost came to blows.

607
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,440
You called Truman
a fainthearted old auntie...

608
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,380
because he wouldn't let Patton
go marching on into Moscow.

609
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,220
Never mind what the French
or the English had to say.

610
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,920
Never mind the Russians
were our allies.

611
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,980
Hold on there.

612
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,030
What about Eastern
Europe now, smart guy?

613
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,030
Maurice,

614
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,800
you're the best friend
I ever had.

615
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,240
I would've shot a hole in my own hand...

616
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,770
if I'd have thought it'd stop me
from being in love with Shelly.

617
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:31,120
You got to know
that I fought against it.

618
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,590
Problem was,
I wanted two things at once.

619
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,720
I wanted to do the right thing,
and I wanted Shelly.

620
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,600
<i>And the part that wanted Shelly
had the advantage because it was crazy.</i>

621
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,240
Maybe I did reach out to Shelly.

622
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,110
Maybe the crazy part of me did.

623
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:06,890
The thing is, if I had it to do again,

624
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,020
I can't say but that I'd do it
exactly the same way.

625
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,040
<i>Genetic diseases-
I mean, not that this is a disease-</i>

626
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,480
are common in groups where inbreeding,
what we call consanguinity, is prevalent.

627
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:33,350
See, there's a greater chance of
recessive gene matching. Right. Right.

628
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,080
Now, I don't mean to pry, but in your
family, has there been any, um, linkage?

629
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,880
Brothers and sisters? No!

630
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,010
Cousins?
Yeah.

631
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,790
Really? All right, Joel, look.
It gets confusing, all right?

632
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,450
Your third cousins
are also your nephews,

633
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,120
but if their kids marry your kids
and they have kids,

634
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,930
then that's your grandchildren,
but your third cousins, once removed.

635
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,170
But us Stevenses, we're all tall,
eyes aren't too far apart. You know,

636
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,470
what the hell. Huh. That's interesting.

637
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,840
Yeah. You skip the small talk
when you date family.

638
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,970
No, I mean those women.
They didn't even see you.

639
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,840
Her too.
Yeah, well,

640
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,750
woke up this morning, five
good-bye notes taped to the fridge.

641
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,280
Wait, wait, wait. It's too soon.
You said the episodes, they last-

642
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,020
Five to seven days.
But it's only been three days.

643
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:19,930
Yeah.
I don't understand.

644
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,230
It's so interesting. Why?

645
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,240
Irene.

646
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,000
<i>Irene the eye doctor?
I don't know. Maybe-</i>

647
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,560
<i>Maybe it's not beyond
the realm of possibility.</i>

648
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,510
It- It's as if your body is saying,

649
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,770
<i>"I have my mate.
I don't need to attract another."</i>

650
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,820
Yeah, but, Joel,
l- I don't have her.

651
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,650
Yeah, but I know that and you
know that, but your body doesn't.

652
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,650
O-Or maybe it doesn't care.

653
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,220
Hi.
Again?

654
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,760
Uh, you don't have to worry.
I just came to say good-bye.

655
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,070
Oh. Okay.

656
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,940
Where you headed?
Samsuk.

657
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,600
I give a glaucoma workshop
every year.

658
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,650
Hmm.

659
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,310
Uh, look, Irene, the fact this didn't
work out with you and me, you know-

660
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,820
Maybe that's good.
You know, maybe that's... right.

661
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,920
You never really became
a real person to me.

662
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,450
I mean, what I'm trying
to say, Irene, is...

663
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,790
this whole thing's
been so intense.

664
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:33,060
You know, it's-
The rejection, it's been devastating.

665
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,000
I mean, its like
an emotional tsunami and-

666
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:41,870
I'm in this excruciating pain.
And I feel like I'm losing my mind.

667
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,500
And it's just- it's great.

668
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,280
I'm glad.

669
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,610
<i>Anyway, I want to thank you.</i>

670
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,620
Thank you for the experience.

671
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:56,280
You're welcome.
Actually,

672
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,920
it wasn't altogether
unpleasant for me.

673
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,930
No?

674
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,090
To get that kind of attention from a
good-looking guy like you- I'm flattered.

675
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,170
Really?

676
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,750
Sure.
Well, look then, maybe-

677
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,150
It was nice. Thanks.

678
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,290
Right.

679
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,000
Um-

680
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,760
Why don't you let me
help you with these chairs?

681
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,240
Okay.
Okay.

682
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,930
Can I borrow your glasses?

683
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,410
My glasses?
May I?

684
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,440
Thanks.

685
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,850
Wow.
What?

686
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,190
I can see.

687
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,030
You need glasses?

688
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,470
I'm sure that amuses you.
Why would that amuse me?

689
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,470
It's obvious.
I'm in a state of decline.

690
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:05,310
And knowing how sadistic you are,
that probably delights you.

691
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,500
Thank you.

692
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,350
I mean, it's not like I'm
already married with three kids.

693
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,010
You know, it's not like
my looks are unimportant.

694
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:17,110
Huh.
I'm still a single woman.

695
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:21,130
And I have a biological imperative
to attract the opposite sex.

696
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,660
Let me tell you something, O'Connell.
Glasses are not your problem.

697
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,890
You're a knockout. I don't
mean just pretty. No, beautiful.

698
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:32,660
The lips, the mouth, the eyes,
the quality of the skin,

699
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,670
the smile,
the whole megillah.

700
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,070
You have a face that could
launch a thousand ships.

701
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,510
Really?
Absolutely.

702
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,310
Your problems are not physical,
they're emotional, psychological.

703
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,750
If men aren't attracted to you, it's
totally because of your abrasive personality.

704
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,020
<i>You're defensive.
And the fact that you don't like us.</i>

705
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:55,650
Thank you.
Thank you, Fleischman.

706
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,660
You're welcome, O'Connell.

707
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,380
Well, Maurice,

708
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:24,390
what's it gonna be?

709
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,660
The usual.

710
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,430
Warm night.
It certainly is.

711
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,840
Why don't you get the special
because it has carrots?

712
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,510
<i>I know most of you
have been where I am tonight.</i>

713
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,340
<i>The crash site of unrequited love.</i>

714
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:04,130
You've asked yourself,
how did I get here?

715
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,130
What was it about her?

716
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,730
Was it her smile?
Was it... the way she crossed her legs?

717
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,130
The turn of her ankle?

718
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,110
The poignant vulnerability
of her slender wrist?

719
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:21,640
What are these elusive and ephemeral things
that ignite passion in the human heart?

720
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:27,150
That's an age-old question. It's perfect food
for thought on a bright midsummer's night.

721
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,150
Hey, you said it best, Will.

722
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,990
<i>"Love looks not with the eyes,
but with the mind;</i>

723
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,050
And therefore is winged Cupid
painted blind."

724
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,060
Yeah.

724
00:44:38,305 --> 00:45:38,863

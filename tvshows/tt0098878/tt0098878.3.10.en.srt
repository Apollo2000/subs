1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,389
Seasons greetings,
everybody, from K-Bear,

2
00:00:05,392 --> 00:00:07,799
the heart and soul of Cicely, Alaska.

3
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,051
This is Chris in the Morning.
From where I'm sitting,

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:14,180
I got a great view of all the yuletide
decorations going up all over town.

5
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,534
That's right. Everywhere
I turn my head, I

6
00:00:16,537 --> 00:00:18,810
see ebony birds roosting
for the holidays.

7
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,563
You know, twinkling,
colored lights are nice,

8
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:24,733
and so are plastic Santas and reindeers
and manger scenes.

9
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:28,153
But, tell you something, friends-

10
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,196
nothing like the sight of a beautiful,

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,199
black-as-pitch raven to get you
in the Christmas spirit.

12
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,784
Oh, hey, that reminds me.

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,454
Congratulations
to our own Marilyn Whirlwind,

14
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,498
who's landed the part of the Princess
Susitna in this year's raven pageant.

15
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,667
Break a wing, Marilyn.

16
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:47,255
Whoops. I There stumbles Maggie
O'Connell in her usual Christmas mode.

17
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,007
She gets a little accident-prone
this time of year,

18
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:52,177
so it's best for your own safety,
keep a wide berth.

19
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,554
Hey, this one's for everybody out there.

20
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,521
I understand the suicide rate goes up
dramatically around Christmas time.

21
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,225
Yeah, well, you know, it's a stressful

22
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:07,108
time of the year for
most people, Maurice.

23
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:12,155
Yeah. The thing is, you go through
the rest of the year fine.

24
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:16,910
You've got your friends, you've got your
business, you're part of the community.

25
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:20,830
And then, round the middle of December,

26
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,209
if you're alone,
you start to feel like an outsider.

27
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,294
Well, you feel alienated.

28
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,963
Here, this is for you -
top of your Christmas tree.

29
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,717
Thanks. You know,
it's the nature of a family holiday...

30
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,095
to make a single man
feel disenfranchised.

31
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,015
You're made to feel like
a hungry vagrant...

32
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,767
with your nose pressed
up against a window-

33
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,895
staring at somebody else's dinner.

34
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,065
Maurice,
there's some people here to see you.

35
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,609
People? What the hell do they want?

36
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,530
Here, have a raven.

37
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,074
Thanks.

38
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,536
I'm Minnifield.

39
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,919
Hello. I'm Yung Bong Joo.
This is my dad, Yung Duk Won.

40
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,965
And my grandmom, Yung Yong Ja.
We're very happy to meet you.

41
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,925
Likewise, I'm sure.

42
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,515
Who are you?

43
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:22,725
- He's my dad.
- Yeah, I got that part.

44
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,227
And your son.

46
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:22,577
- Hey, Ed. Dave. - Hi.
- Hello, Dr. Fleischman.

47
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,328
- Christmas tree, huh?
- Uh-huh.

48
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:28,249
Good choice. Full base.
Tapering off nicely at the top.

49
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:31,711
You know, a lot of people go for the
Douglas fir, but I'm a spruce man too.

50
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,755
- Watch your end, Dave.
- Okay.

51
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,757
What a smell.

52
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,677
You know, a Christmas tree is wonderful
in and of itself, but it evokes so much.

53
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,764
It's images of snowmen, sleigh rides.

54
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,515
- You want us to cut you one?
- Me?

55
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,726
- Uh-huh.
- Guys, I'm Jewish.

56
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,227
So?

57
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,813
Well, I mean, a Christmas tree's
a major Christian symbol.

58
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,282
Next to the cross itself, you can't get

59
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:53,816
anything that's more
Christian than that.

60
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,818
You know what I mean?

61
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:58,863
Traditionally, Jews try to avoid
Christian symbols.

62
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:01,025
Oh, well, you know,
Dave's an animist, and

63
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:02,867
he has a Christmas tree, right, Dave?

64
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,494
- Right.
- Ah, yes.

65
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,746
But Dave wasn't raised by
Herb and Nadine Fleischman.

66
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,665
Herb and Nadine Fleischman,
who would rather be flayed alive...

67
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,644
than allow so much as a
candy cane, let alone

68
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:13,544
a full-blown Christmas
tree, into their home.

69
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,795
Coming through.

70
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,964
Not that I haven't fantasized
about having a tree.

71
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,883
- Watch it here.
- Hold on. Hold on.

72
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:20,676
Hey, Lou, you still owe me.

73
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,259
As a kid, our kitchen
window faced the living

74
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,014
room of this Irish
family, the McGoverns.

75
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:27,311
I used to watch them
decorate their tree.

76
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:29,268
They'd string popcorn, drape tinsel.

77
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,188
Like a Hallmark card.
I mean, this lovely tableau.

78
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:36,526
Christmas music on the radio.
So warm. So inviting.

79
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,735
Watch it.

80
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,862
Actually, you know,
I've always liked Christmas.

81
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,989
It's a great holiday for a Jewish kid.

82
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,951
I mean, two weeks off from school
and nothing expected of you.

83
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:45,910
Right here, Ed.

84
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,563
And it's true that I've enjoyed and even

85
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:49,455
embraced other trappings
of the holiday season.

86
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,040
The music, the gift-giving.

87
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:53,376
You don't have to be Republican
to celebrate Lincoln's birthday.

88
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,002
So, when you think about it,

89
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,089
I'm, uh - I'm probably splitting hairs
in denying myself a tree, right?

90
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,508
- Right.
- So, you want one?

91
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:04,262
Huh. Let me think about it.

92
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,474
Hey, Fleischman, I got
your plaster bandages.

93
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,646
Oh, hey. Easy. You all right?

94
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:17,066
Why do you put yourself through this?
There's an easier way to get out of it.

95
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,484
Put myself through what?

96
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:21,445
Come on. Everyone knows you hate
going home for Christmas. So?

97
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,490
So, don't break your neck.
Just tell your parents you're busy.

98
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:28,411
First of all, Fleischman, my clumsiness
is not part of a subconscious agenda.

99
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,337
And secondly, tell my
parents I'm too busy?

100
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:30,955
Yeah.

101
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:32,637
Fleischman, that is one
of your more brainless

102
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,208
ideas. It's Christmas, Fleischman.
Christmas.

103
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,085
You're not too busy.

104
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,548
Hey, go easy on yourself.
I don't wanna have to use these on you.

105
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,977
- You like the glasses?
- They're cool.

106
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,731
They're hand painted...
from Czechoslovakia.

107
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,109
Look at the details.
You can see every feather.

108
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,319
They're really neat.

109
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,071
What's wrong, hon?

110
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,825
I don't know, Holling.

111
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:10,327
You seem a little down.

112
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,456
I was watching this
Christmas special on TV.

113
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:15,374
You know that really
fat Italian singer...

114
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,794
and this little boys' choir
in this big ol' cathedral.

115
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,712
Yeah?

116
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,924
Well, it was like
I could smell the incense, you know?

117
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,844
Like I was back at Our Lady of Refuge.

118
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,889
Christmas Eve, they always had
a midnight Mass.

119
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:34,477
And just before 12:00,
they used to turn off all the lights.

120
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,149
Then the organ would start to play,
and the doors would open,

121
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:44,195
and the choir would come down
the aisles carrying candles.

122
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:48,282
Then the altar boys. Then Father Perone.

123
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:50,409
They'd all be singing.

124
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:58,417
I love the ravens, Holling. I really do.

125
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,378
But it just doesn't feel like...

126
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,089
an old-fashioned,
Charlie Brown Christmas.

127
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,763
Hi, Grandpa.

128
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:16,852
Everything checks out.
Letters, documents, blood tests.

129
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:22,733
I acknowledge he's my son.

130
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:29,698
I was very young in Korea. I was 16.

131
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,744
I forged my father's signature
so I could get in the Marine Corps.

132
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,122
I was a boy in a man's body.

133
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:39,667
I did some foolish things.

134
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,298
Never mind.

135
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:50,636
What-What do they want?
Ask her what she wants.

136
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,643
- Pork chops.
- No. Not to eat.

137
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:01,146
What do you want?
How much do you want from me?

138
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,649
Money. Dinero. Money.

139
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:05,442
No, no, no. No. No dollar.

140
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,695
- No. No dollar. No, no, no.
- Money, no. No money.

141
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,280
- No?
- No. No, no dollar.

142
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,615
- You don't want money?
- No dollar.

143
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:16,704
Then what are you doing here?
What-What are they doing here?

144
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:23,627
- My dad just want to meet you.
- That's it?

145
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,007
That's all? You just wanna meet me?

146
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,676
- Yeah.
- Okay.

147
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,928
How do? Pleased to meet you.

148
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:36,432
Excuse me, Grandpa.

149
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,978
Now, just so we understand each other,

150
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,190
I want you to know that I live up to
my obligations.

151
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,568
But I also protect my interests.

152
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,904
If you intend to take me to court,

153
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:55,034
bear in mind that I have a team
of lawyers who will eat you for lunch.

154
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,038
That being said,

155
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,333
enjoy your stay.

156
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,463
Kids look at holidays materialistically.

157
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:09,007
I always thought that
Hanukkah was a better

158
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,507
deal. I mean, you get
eight presents, right?

159
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,260
They're staggered over a week.
You're forced to savor each one.

160
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,649
Careful, Bong. With Christmas, you get

161
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:16,305
everything all at once.
It's easy to overload.

162
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,724
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- We got it. We got it. We got it.

163
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:23,812
There was only one year
I envied my neighbor. Tom McGovern.

164
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:27,816
He got this autographed Bobby Mercer
baseball glove. God, I loved that glove.

165
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,570
Whoa! Whoa! All right.
Whoa. Okay. Go ahead.

166
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:33,572
Boy, it's shedding all over the place.

167
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:36,950
Yep. Trees'll do that.
You might put a sheet under it.

168
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,495
Where would you like this,
Dr. Fleischman?

169
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:41,705
Uh, well, over by the fireplace.

170
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,832
- That's an appropriate place, right?
- Yeah. Not too close though.

171
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,751
Okay. All righty.

172
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:51,340
- On three. One, two, three.
- All right.

173
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,843
- Wow. It's big.
- Yeah.

174
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,429
- It's immense.
- Looks good.

175
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,517
- Well, see you later, Dr. Fleischman.
- Wait, wait. Where are you going?

176
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,728
Bong wants to check out the new
sinkhole over by the Kinuk fault.

177
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,980
Yeah. Hey, it's not going
anywhere for a few millennia.

178
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,317
Stick around. I got sodas
and crackers, ice cream and...

179
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,069
No, thanks, Dr Fleischman.

180
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,782
Wait a sec. What about the tree?
I mean, what do I do?

181
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:19,868
- Oh. Decorate it.
- Bye.

182
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,379
Uh, excuse me.

183
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,217
I'm afraid I owe you an apology.

184
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,762
Your dress got in the hamper.
I didn't see it.

185
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,515
Yeah. It got in the wash with my cords.
They bleed a little bit.

186
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,601
No, I'll buy you another one.

187
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,530
No, no. Now, these things
cost a pretty penny,

188
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:48,105
and I insist on buying you another one.

189
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,984
No. Now, I insist.

190
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,736
All right. That's settled.

191
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,323
Uh, ma'am?

192
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:01,410
Gosh, how do I say this? Uh-

193
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,420
Clearly, we-you and I-

194
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:15,048
had an intimate relationship.

195
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:19,344
But I don't remember you.

196
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,057
For the life of me,
I can't remember a thing about you.

197
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,976
Don't be offended.

198
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,980
I had a lot of relationships
with women in those days.

199
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:34,860
I was young, unattached,
in a strange country.

200
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:41,700
Maybe you could jog my memory.

201
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:46,496
There was a place that
I used to frequent in Seoul.

202
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,750
There was a gal who worked there
named, um,

203
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,505
Kika. Kika?

204
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:58,091
Kija? Kija.

205
00:11:58,126 --> 00:11:59,134
Kija?

206
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,678
Yeah. Yeah. She was short
and had black hair.

207
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:06,266
Kija. Yeah. Yeah. She was a particular
favorite of my friend Scooter Wilson.

208
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,337
Michael... Wilson.

209
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,519
Mike Wilson. Yeah. Yeah. That's Scooter.

210
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,521
Now we're gettin' somewhere.

211
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,485
A- Are you Kija?

212
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,196
Kija? Yeah.

213
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:21,656
No.

214
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:33,752
Ma'am, I didn't wanna say anything
in front of the kids, but,

215
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:38,298
if you have any hopes of renewing our
relationship in any significant way,

216
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,300
that's impossible.

217
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:45,430
A lot of water's gone under the bridge.
We've gone our separate ways.

218
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:50,519
Well, if you think about it
in the cold light of day, rationally,

219
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:55,565
you'll see that you'd be happier
with someone of your own persuasion.

220
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,569
I'm glad we had this chat.

221
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,239
Straightened things out.

222
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:11,665
Okay, let me get something straight.

223
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,210
The fact that I have you
in my living room is meaningless.

224
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:19,339
I'm not betraying anything.
You're a tree.

225
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:23,301
Flora, a plant-a nonsentient being.
That's all.

226
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:26,388
I mean, I know there are people who like

227
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:27,889
to endow you with
religious significance,

228
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:30,600
but even at that you're really
more of a cultural symbol...

229
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,521
like, uh, the Easter bunny,
Uncle Sam, Tony the Tiger.

230
00:13:35,605 --> 00:13:37,941
You're something fun.
Something for everybody to enjoy.

231
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,860
Buddhists, Muslims, Rastafarians-

232
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:41,570
Fleischman?

233
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:44,739
- What? It's open.
- I think I've hurt my ankle.

234
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:48,785
- What happened?
- Oh, I slipped and fell off the porch.

235
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,747
- Could you take a look at it?
- Yeah, sure.

236
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,082
Good.

237
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,627
Ow! Oh. Watch it, O'Connell.
You're gonna wreck the furniture.

238
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:01,715
You're not just a menace to yourself.
You're a menace to others as well.

239
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:04,759
- Sorry.
- All righty, which one?

240
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,845
This left one here.

241
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,892
- Okay. Easy, easy.
- Nice tree.

242
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:14,394
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Just that. Nice tree.

243
00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:16,563
Don't be coy with me, O'Connell.
Go ahead, say it.

244
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,314
What?

245
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:18,752
I'm Jewish. What am I doing with a

246
00:14:18,755 --> 00:14:20,567
Christmas tree? It's
inappropriate, right?

247
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,987
I - I should have a mezuzah, or menorah,
both of which, by the way, I do have,

248
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,031
and I display proudly for all
the goyim to see.

249
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:29,117
- But, God forbid, a Christmas tree.
- Fleischman, what is your problem?

250
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,703
I'm not the one with a problem.
I'm not the one who, every Christmas,

251
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,080
indulges in an orgy of self-destruction.

252
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,916
Well, if you had to face what I face,
you wouldn't want to go home either.

253
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,670
All right, I can take a X-ray, but I'm
pretty sure this is just a sprain.

254
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:43,045
Now, tell me what could be so terrible.

255
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,549
My mother, for starters.

256
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,135
I mean, from the minute
I walk in the door,

257
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:50,430
it's, "When are you gonna get married?
When am I gonna have grandchildren?"

258
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:53,183
And my father who,
of course, agrees with her,

259
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:55,185
tells her to be quiet,
and they just start fighting.

260
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:59,105
And my brother, the iceberg, who thinks
any display of emotion is in poor taste,

261
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,025
he just retreats to his room
and fondles his old swim team trophies.

262
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,527
Well, there has to be
something nice about going home.

263
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:07,072
I mean, sitting around a tree,
opening presents.

264
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:10,325
Oh, the presents.
The presents are the worse part.

265
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:14,371
I get all these froufrou outfits
that I wouldn't wear in a million years.

266
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:17,123
Come on, O'Connell. These are your
parents. They raised you. They love you.

267
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,125
- They're doing the best they can do.
- I know that.

268
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,670
I mean, of course I know that.
Don't you think I know that?

269
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:24,089
That's what makes it so awful.

270
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:27,842
I'm a horrible, ungrateful child
for even having such thoughts.

271
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:37,018
It's hopeless. Tomorrow it'll
be waiting at Ruth-Anne's.

272
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,104
A letter from my parents
with a round-trip ticket.

273
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,648
I can't begin to describe to you
the sense of dread I feel...

274
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,691
at the thought of opening that envelope.

275
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,779
There's no escape.

276
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:53,017
Stay off the ankle.

277
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,787
Good night, Fleischman.
Thanks for nothing.

278
00:15:57,497 --> 00:16:01,751
Attention, Cicelians. Only two
shopping days left till Christmas.

279
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:05,964
Hey, I see the Minnifields
out for a family stroll. How nice.

280
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:09,384
Merry Christmas. everybody.

281
00:16:09,425 --> 00:16:11,928
This just in from
the Cicely Choral Society.

282
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:14,764
All members are requested to gather
at Mel's Guns and Ammo...

283
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:16,641
7:00 tonight for caroling.

284
00:16:16,724 --> 00:16:18,101
Please remember to dress warm.

285
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,479
Also, a reminder to anybody attending
tomorrow night's raven pageant.

286
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,399
You're welcome to take pictures,
but, please, no flash equipment.

287
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,443
It's hazardous to the performers.
Okay. Here's one for Maurice.

288
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:31,197
- Mmm. What smells so good, Ruth-Anne?
- Raven bread.

289
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,450
- I make it every Christmas. Try some.
- Okay.

290
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:39,414
Mmm, pumpernickel. I'll take a loaf.

291
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:41,603
Listen, I need some of
these Christmas tree

292
00:16:41,606 --> 00:16:43,668
decorations. Ornaments,
tinsel, the usual.

293
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:47,130
Well, we have some raven lights,

294
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:51,676
and, um, raven ornaments.

295
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,137
Do you have anything else,
you know, besides Heckle and Jeckle?

296
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:58,641
- I mean, what do you put on your tree?
- I don't have a tree, Joel.

297
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,977
- No?
- It pains me.

298
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,689
The very thought of chopping down
a healthy, living thing...

299
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:08,109
and displaying it in my living room
until there's nothing left except...

300
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:12,071
a brittled, withered shell
of its former self.

301
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:13,948
Well, what about the fake kind?

302
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:16,618
To tell you the truth, Joel,
I happen to be an atheist.

303
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:19,203
- Huh, you're an atheist? No kidding.
- Uh-huh.

304
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:22,248
I always admired atheists.
I think it takes a lot of faith.

305
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,043
I mean, you know, conviction to deny
the existence of a supreme being.

306
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:27,629
Oh, I believe in a supreme being.

307
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,715
I- I just don't think
that she takes human form.

308
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:33,978
Interesting, Ruth-Anne.

309
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:37,013
Okay, Ruth-Anne. Let's get it over with.

310
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:39,349
Here's your letter, dear.

311
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,686
- That's 11.95, Joel.
- They're going to St. Thomas.

312
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,356
Let me take a look at that, O'Connell.

313
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:51,361
"We hope you forgive us," but the
Morrisons offered us their time-share,

314
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:52,945
and Daddy really needs the vacation.

315
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,615
- Maybe we'll get together at Easter."
- Congratulations.

316
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:57,450
You don't have to go home now.

317
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,452
Yeah, O'Connell.
You can stop abusing yourself.

318
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:04,040
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing. I'm just, um-

319
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:06,626
- What?
- I-I don't know. I'm just-

320
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:10,880
- Surprised?
- Yes. Well, no. No, no. I'm just so-

321
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:14,425
- Relieved?
- Yes. Relieved. Relieved and-

322
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:16,177
- Happy?
- Right.

323
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:18,221
I'm relieved and happy and surprised.

324
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:21,683
I mean, what a fantastic relief.
What a happy surprise.

325
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:24,686
I'm just so-so-So.

326
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:39,030
Excuse me. Uh, could we turn that down?

327
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:40,076
Sure.

328
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,997
Oh, no, no, no. No, thank you.

329
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:46,916
No, I'm fine.

330
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:52,964
Oh, yeah.

331
00:18:57,343 --> 00:18:59,429
D- Da-Dad?

332
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:29,125
Look, I-I don't have a clue here.
Bong, what's he saying?

333
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:36,465
- Dad say he's happy you're his dad.
- Oh, well, that's-That's fine.

334
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,143
What?

335
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,354
Music. Music.

336
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:45,701
Here is my gift for Baby Jesus.

337
00:20:51,123 --> 00:20:55,878
Chris, are you planning on some kind of
special service for Christmas this year?

338
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:58,130
No. Nothing special. I mean,

339
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:00,297
I thought I'd have a
post-raven question-and-

340
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,385
answer with some of the
pageant participants.

341
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:04,095
What?

342
00:21:04,178 --> 00:21:07,515
I was thinking of something
a little more traditional.

343
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:11,185
Yeah, well-yeah, we could sing
some Christmas songs, Holling.

344
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:14,397
Well, something more along
the lines of a Mass.

345
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,026
Shelly's Catholic.
She misses her Christmas Mass.

346
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,947
Oh, yeah. Well, you know, that's
some serious codified ritual, Holling.

347
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,037
You know, that's way
out of my league, man.

348
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,701
You know a little Latin, don't you?

349
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,746
In vino veritas. Tempus fugit.
That kind of stuff.

350
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:35,334
Oh, hey, I got a Latin copy of
the Aeneid laying around somewhere.

351
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:37,878
You know, I could read Shelly
a couple of lines from that.

352
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:43,259
No, I don't think that'd do it.
But thanks anyway, Chris.

353
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:49,974
- Hi, Shelly.
- Hey, Maggie.

354
00:21:50,057 --> 00:21:52,226
Congratulations.
I heard you aren't going home.

355
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:54,603
Oh, yeah. It's great.
It's an incredible relief.

356
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:57,690
- Dave made eggnog.
- Oh, wonderful.

357
00:21:57,773 --> 00:21:59,692
You know, I really look forward
to Christmas Eve...

358
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:03,112
'cause it'll be the first time in my
life I get to spend it entirely alone.

359
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:06,323
There'll be nobody bothering me,
placing demands on me, expectations.

360
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:09,910
- It'll just be quiet and peaceful.
- Holy.

361
00:22:09,952 --> 00:22:12,204
Hmm, that's an interesting way
of looking at it.

362
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:14,457
I mean, I don't have to deal
with my mother or my brother.

363
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,583
Our Father.

364
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,043
Oh, well, my father.
He's impossible at Christmas.

365
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:22,089
- There's just no talking to him. No...
- Communion.

366
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:25,676
Exactly. You know, when my parents told
me they weren't going to have Christmas,

367
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,970
in a way that was the best gift
they could have given me.

368
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:32,600
Maggie, uh, you've never met my parents
before. They're just in from Barrow.

369
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:35,686
Mom, Dad, this is Maggie O'Connell.

370
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:57,041
Oh, man. Maurice, I tell you.
I hear those carolers,

371
00:22:57,124 --> 00:22:59,403
you know, all those
human voices ascending

372
00:22:59,406 --> 00:23:01,795
up to heaven in a harmonic
pyramid of sound.

373
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:05,007
I get very zoned. I get very light in my
galoshes, you know?

374
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,509
Does that happen to you?

375
00:23:07,968 --> 00:23:09,428
- Uh-uh.
- No?

376
00:23:10,512 --> 00:23:13,849
- Hey, uh, where's the Kinder at?
- At the house.

377
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:18,562
Ah. At my house, which no
longer feels like my house.

378
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:23,150
I had to get out and get some
fresh air. Hear some English.

379
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:26,695
- Yeah, well.
- You know, Chris,

380
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:30,449
all my life
I've dreamed of having a son.

381
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:33,994
A little towheaded tyke
I could bounce on my knee,

382
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:36,538
teach to ride, hunt, fish.

383
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,250
- Yeah, a little mini Maurice, right?
- Yeah, and what do I get?

384
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:42,002
A middle-aged Chinaman.

385
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:45,881
- I thought Duk Won's Korean.
- It's all the same difference.

386
00:23:46,882 --> 00:23:48,968
Well, Maurice,
a lot to be said for having grown kids.

387
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:51,136
You know, they're out of the house.
You don't have to worry about...

388
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:53,013
car insurance, you know, tuition.

389
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:56,934
It's not the age, Chris. I could handle
that. Hell, I can handle anything.

390
00:23:57,017 --> 00:24:00,354
Physical impairment, low I.Q.
I could handle that.

391
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:02,542
I could even handle
if he was a bookworm.

392
00:24:02,545 --> 00:24:04,233
I'd find some way to accept him.

393
00:24:04,316 --> 00:24:06,652
But, if he was only-

394
00:24:07,778 --> 00:24:09,738
White?

395
00:24:10,823 --> 00:24:13,492
Yeah. White.

396
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:21,166
I understand this thing about you
and your brother Bernard...

397
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,676
and your decision to
be a person of color.

398
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:27,172
I even respect it. Hell, everybody's
got a right to make their own mistakes.

399
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:32,428
But this-
this is my own flesh and blood.

400
00:24:34,096 --> 00:24:36,932
This cuts a little close to the bone.
You know what I mean?

401
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:39,935
- It's the other.
- Other what?

402
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,355
Maurice, think of concentric circles.

403
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:46,734
The inner circle is ourselves,
then the family, then the tribe,

404
00:24:46,775 --> 00:24:49,278
then the neighboring tribe,
so on and so on.

405
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:53,323
The further you get away from the
center, the more foreign things become.

406
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:56,034
The people in the outer circles,
they become the "other."

407
00:24:57,745 --> 00:25:02,416
- What's your point?
- Well, with sex, the other's good.

408
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:06,462
I mean, you were probably very attracted
to Duk Won's mother way back when.

409
00:25:06,545 --> 00:25:10,841
But, you take the other from the outer
and make it part of the inner,

410
00:25:10,924 --> 00:25:13,260
sometimes it doesn't work out.

411
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:16,847
Chris, no matter how you
explain this thing, it's a nightmare.

412
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,601
This man is my son.
I don't like the way he looks.

413
00:25:20,642 --> 00:25:23,353
I don't like the way he talks.
I don't like what he eats.

414
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:25,400
Well, if it's any
consolation, Maurice, you

415
00:25:25,403 --> 00:25:27,191
know, your feelings aren't instinctual.

416
00:25:27,274 --> 00:25:29,943
- No?
- No. It's cultural.

417
00:25:29,985 --> 00:25:31,737
Well, how the hell
could that be a consolation?

418
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,781
- It's learned behavior.
- So?

419
00:25:34,823 --> 00:25:36,950
So, you can unlearn it.

420
00:26:00,182 --> 00:26:04,144
- Hi, Marilyn. On your way to rehearsal?
- Run-through.

421
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:06,897
You nervous? About
performing in front of people?

422
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,650
- No.
- You know, Marilyn,

423
00:26:09,691 --> 00:26:11,735
I'm familiar with parts
of the New Testament.

424
00:26:11,818 --> 00:26:13,862
I also know about
the winter solstice tie-in.

425
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,199
Well, this might seem like
a shocking display of ignorance,

426
00:26:17,282 --> 00:26:19,618
but I seem to be the only one
in town who doesn't know.

427
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:22,537
I mean, what exactly is
this thing with the raven?

428
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:23,247
Thing?

429
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:26,208
Well, I don't understand
what it has to do with Christmas.

430
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,253
A long time ago, the raven
looked down from the sky...

431
00:26:29,336 --> 00:26:32,714
and saw that the people of
the world were living in darkness.

432
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,135
The ball of light was kept hidden
by a selfish, old chief.

433
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:40,555
So, the raven turned himself
into a spruce needle...

434
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:43,892
and floated on the river where
the chief's daughter came for water.

435
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:45,894
She drank the spruce needle.

436
00:26:45,978 --> 00:26:48,981
She became pregnant
and gave birth to a boy,

437
00:26:49,064 --> 00:26:51,650
which was the raven in disguise.

438
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:57,197
The baby cried and cried until the chief
gave him the ball of light to play with.

439
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:59,241
As soon as he had the light,

440
00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:03,745
the raven turned back into himself
and carried the light into the sky.

441
00:27:03,787 --> 00:27:06,456
From then on,
we no longer lived in darkness.

442
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,459
Wow, that's a great story.

443
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:28,353
- Hello, Dad. - Maurice.
- Hi, Grandpop.

444
00:27:28,437 --> 00:27:32,315
Yeah. Uh, I just came in
for some coffee.

445
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:37,487
- Uh, no-
No. No tea. Thank you.

446
00:27:39,823 --> 00:27:42,492
Uh, no, no. I'll just-

447
00:27:43,076 --> 00:27:47,080
Would you tell her that I've got some
desk work that I've got to clean up.

448
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:53,545
So, I'll just take this and go in there.

449
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:57,799
Um, Grandpop? Dad wants to know if
you'd like to go on a hike with him.

450
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:00,218
Hike?

451
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:05,849
- Up the mountains.
- Oh, uh, yeah. Yeah.

452
00:28:05,932 --> 00:28:08,518
I'd like to take a hike,

453
00:28:08,602 --> 00:28:11,605
but I don't think
I'm gonna have time today.

454
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:14,483
Excuse me.

455
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:26,953
It's open.

456
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:34,294
Grandma wants to talk to you.

457
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:39,841
- Grandmom say you're not happy.
- No, no. I'm just-

458
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:44,846
- She said let her finish.
- All right.

459
00:28:59,444 --> 00:29:03,198
All these years, Grandma was afraid
to tell you that you had a son.

460
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:07,702
She knew it would be a big shock.
Grandmom didn't want to come here.

461
00:29:07,827 --> 00:29:11,081
But my daddy said
it's time to meet his father.

462
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:20,966
It was a mistake. She's sorry we came.

463
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:38,525
"Ghastly grim and ancient raven
wandering from the nightly shore-

464
00:29:38,566 --> 00:29:42,237
"Tell me what thy lordly name is
on the night's Plutonian shore.

465
00:29:43,154 --> 00:29:46,157
Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore. "'

466
00:29:46,449 --> 00:29:50,412
Well, that's how Mr. Poe saw the raven.

467
00:29:50,453 --> 00:29:55,125
You know, lots of references in Western
literature do tend toward the negative.

468
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:59,379
Like most things in life,
when it comes to transcendental symbols,

469
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:03,091
one man's savior
is another man's pair of lead boots.

470
00:30:04,843 --> 00:30:07,345
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

471
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:09,264
You're very welcome.

472
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:15,478
Listen, Duk, your mom is upset with me.

473
00:30:15,562 --> 00:30:17,897
There's probably
some justification for it.

474
00:30:17,939 --> 00:30:21,818
I mean, I sometimes give
the impression that, uh,

475
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:24,738
I'm a little bit insensitive.

476
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,782
But I never meant to hurt her feelings.

477
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:34,998
I don't know how much of this
is getting through the static,

478
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:37,459
but I'm gonna be straight with you.

479
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:41,337
You are not the son
that I bargained for.

480
00:30:41,421 --> 00:30:44,090
Not by a long shot.

481
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:49,846
But, you are my progeny.
I am your father.

482
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:52,640
- Father?
- Yeah. Yeah, father.

483
00:30:52,724 --> 00:30:56,644
So, I think we should make a good-faith
effort to understand each other,

484
00:30:56,728 --> 00:30:58,897
get to know each other a little bit.

485
00:31:00,356 --> 00:31:02,067
Uh, anyway, cheers.

486
00:31:03,943 --> 00:31:05,278
Yeah.

487
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:14,704
You like sour mash, huh?

488
00:31:16,414 --> 00:31:19,751
Uh, Dave, bring Duk here another round.

489
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,294
Coming up.

490
00:31:22,378 --> 00:31:24,214
Pretty good there.

491
00:31:24,964 --> 00:31:28,676
So, uh, what do you, uh- what do you do?

492
00:31:29,677 --> 00:31:31,012
- Do?
- Do.

493
00:31:31,095 --> 00:31:35,683
You know, job? Work? Do for a living?

494
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:39,103
Okay, look. Truck driver?

495
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:43,733
No. Musician?

496
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:50,365
How about barber? Haircut?

497
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:55,078
Okay, look. Me. Me. Astronaut.

498
00:32:00,124 --> 00:32:01,793
Astronaut.

499
00:32:02,418 --> 00:32:04,087
- Yeah, yeah. Right.
- Astronaut.

500
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,756
Yeah, that's right. Now, you.

501
00:32:10,134 --> 00:32:11,177
Gisa.

502
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:13,012
Gisa. Gisa.

503
00:32:13,054 --> 00:32:14,931
No. I don't understand.

504
00:32:16,474 --> 00:32:18,476
Yeah, sure.

505
00:32:22,564 --> 00:32:24,399
Uh-huh. That's a diode.

506
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:28,152
- A capacitor.
- Capacitor.

507
00:32:28,236 --> 00:32:30,196
Yeah. Capacitor.

508
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,240
- Yeah. Let me see that.
- Thank you.

509
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:36,494
- No problem.
- A transistor. This is a circuit.

510
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:40,873
Cir-Circuit. Yeah, circuit. Yeah.

511
00:32:40,957 --> 00:32:44,127
- You're an engineer.
- Engineer. Gisa.

512
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:48,047
An electrical engineer.
Hey. Hey, guys. He's an engineer.

513
00:32:50,675 --> 00:32:54,012
You know, I know my way around
a slide rule pretty well too.

514
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:58,516
- That's all right. An engineer, huh?
- Engineer.

515
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:00,727
Yeah. Well, cheers.

516
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:12,864
You're no- You're no wimp, are you?

517
00:33:14,574 --> 00:33:16,492
Strong too. Yeah.

518
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:18,786
You, uh-you lift?

519
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:21,956
Uh, pump iron.

520
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,800
- "Ahnulda"?
- Arnold. Movie. Movie. Arnold.

521
00:33:32,842 --> 00:33:34,802
Oh, Arnold. Yeah, Arnold.

522
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:49,233
Okay.

523
00:33:55,406 --> 00:33:57,784
- One.
- Uh

524
00:33:57,992 --> 00:34:00,161
- Two.
- Two.

525
00:34:00,953 --> 00:34:02,413
Three.

526
00:34:26,562 --> 00:34:28,606
No, no. It's fine.

527
00:34:28,689 --> 00:34:30,149
Hey, that's not bad.

528
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:35,404
Now, wait here.
We're gonna do this right.

529
00:34:40,535 --> 00:34:43,871
Is this great? I got some chestnuts.
I can put 'em in the oven.

530
00:34:43,913 --> 00:34:46,374
- What?
- Well, where are the lights?

531
00:34:46,415 --> 00:34:48,251
Right here.

532
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:50,711
Fleischman, you gotta put
the lights on before the ornaments.

533
00:34:50,795 --> 00:34:53,881
Aha! See, that's why I brought you here.
I needed an expert.

534
00:34:53,965 --> 00:34:56,342
You're gonna have to take
all the ornaments off.

535
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:58,177
Okay. No problem. We can do that.

536
00:34:59,804 --> 00:35:02,320
See, what you do is you
string the lights.

537
00:35:02,323 --> 00:35:04,725
But test them first to see if they work.

538
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:08,145
Then you put the little ornaments
at the top and you work your way down,

539
00:35:08,229 --> 00:35:10,857
and you put the heavier,
bigger ornaments on the lower branches.

540
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,109
See? I'm enjoying this already.

541
00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:16,529
And then, people put tinsel,
but I usually don't.

542
00:35:16,612 --> 00:35:18,447
- Yeah, me neither. It's-
- Tacky.

543
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:21,033
- My sentiments exactly.
- Okay.

544
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:24,245
Well, look, Fleischman, you know, it's
really easy decorating a Christmas tree.

545
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:26,956
- It's common sense.
- You don't need me.

546
00:35:26,998 --> 00:35:29,333
So, um, I'll see you later.

547
00:35:30,293 --> 00:35:33,254
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

548
00:35:33,296 --> 00:35:35,637
Well, I-I have to get things organized.

549
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,924
Things? What things?

550
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:39,218
- Well, my taxes, for one.
- Your taxes?

551
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,597
O'Connell, it's Christmas Eve.
They're not due till April.

552
00:35:42,638 --> 00:35:47,476
Come on. I'm gonna string some popcorn.
Mull some wine.

553
00:35:47,602 --> 00:35:49,729
I'm really not in the mood.

554
00:35:58,446 --> 00:36:03,618
"I, said the cow, all white and red.
I gave him my manger for his bed."

555
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:06,245
"I gave him my hay to pillow his head."

556
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:09,498
"I, said the cow, all white and red."

557
00:36:09,582 --> 00:36:14,587
"So every beast by some good spell
in the stable dark was glad to tell..."

558
00:36:14,629 --> 00:36:17,131
"of the gift he gave Immanuel."

559
00:36:17,214 --> 00:36:20,384
"The gift he gave Immanuel."

560
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:22,928
It's an old legend that
on Christmas Eve at midnight,

561
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:27,850
all the animals fall to their knees
and speak, praising the newborn Jesus.

562
00:36:29,268 --> 00:36:32,938
Back in the winter of'69,

563
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,609
my dad was serving a short time
for a D.U.I.,

564
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,487
and I don't know where my mom was.

565
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,572
Anyway, I was home alone Christmas Eve,

566
00:36:41,655 --> 00:36:45,409
and I stayed up extra kind of late
to see if my dog Buddy would talk.

567
00:36:45,493 --> 00:36:47,453
And he did.

568
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:50,623
I don't remember his exact words,
but that's not important.

569
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,543
What matters is
that a seven-year-old boy...

570
00:36:54,627 --> 00:36:56,962
experienced his own personal epiphany.

571
00:36:57,671 --> 00:36:59,340
What's my point?

572
00:36:59,423 --> 00:37:04,678
Well, it's that Christmas reveals itself
to us each in a personal way,

573
00:37:04,762 --> 00:37:06,931
be it secular or sacred.

574
00:37:07,765 --> 00:37:12,019
Whatever Christmas is,
and it's many things to many people,

575
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:13,729
we all own a piece of it.

576
00:37:13,813 --> 00:37:17,316
It's like-Well, it's kind of like
Santa's bag.

577
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:19,985
Inside there's a gift for everybody.

578
00:37:20,861 --> 00:37:24,865
My Christmas wish for you tonight?
May your dog talk.

579
00:37:27,868 --> 00:37:31,205
Good night, Cicely. Merry Christmas.

580
00:37:32,957 --> 00:37:35,960
- Dave, where's Holling?
- He said he had an errand to run.

581
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:39,171
Well, I'm gonna stop by church, so
tell him I'll meet him at the pageant.

582
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:40,965
Okay.

583
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:43,843
Just a second.

584
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,182
- Hey, O'Connell.
- Hey, Fleischman.

585
00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:52,226
What, you're not going
to the raven pageant?

586
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:57,523
You know, I tried. I really did.

587
00:37:57,565 --> 00:38:00,651
I gave it my best shot.
It just didn't work.

588
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:03,737
Scratch the plum pudding,
there's a matzo ball underneath.

589
00:38:04,029 --> 00:38:08,158
- I'm a Jew. That's all there is to it.
- What are you talking about?

590
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:11,161
I have something that
I think belongs to you. Close your eyes.

591
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:13,998
Come on. Just close 'em.

592
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:18,794
- Step out here. Oh, come on.
- Fleischman.

593
00:38:18,878 --> 00:38:22,882
Come on. Just close your eyes
one sec. One sec, that's all.

594
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:25,593
Hold on. Hold on.

595
00:38:26,844 --> 00:38:30,848
All righty. One sec. Keep 'em closed.

596
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:33,893
Open 'em.

597
00:38:34,935 --> 00:38:37,271
Wow.

598
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:40,024
Merry Christmas, O'Connell.

599
00:38:43,986 --> 00:38:47,156
- Thanks, Fleischman.
- Yeah. Belongs here.

600
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:52,322
Excuse me.

601
00:40:53,615 --> 00:40:55,701
I didn't mean to intrude.

602
00:40:57,703 --> 00:40:58,954
Listen, uh,

603
00:40:59,037 --> 00:41:03,500
I just wanna tell you
that you did a good job.

604
00:41:04,334 --> 00:41:09,173
It couldn't have been easy without
a husband-without a father figure.

605
00:41:10,174 --> 00:41:12,509
But you should be very proud.

606
00:41:13,635 --> 00:41:16,597
Duk Won, he's a fine man.

607
00:41:18,056 --> 00:41:20,559
Yeah. Yeah. He's smart.

608
00:41:21,768 --> 00:41:24,313
And strong. Very, very strong.

609
00:41:31,945 --> 00:41:33,572
Say that again.

610
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,160
You.

611
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:48,003
That's "strong and big."

612
00:41:49,755 --> 00:41:53,926
Yeah. That's what you used to call me.

613
00:41:56,261 --> 00:42:00,140
I remember now.
You had beautiful, long hair.

614
00:42:01,141 --> 00:42:03,977
It reached all the way
to the small of your back.

615
00:42:05,562 --> 00:42:11,234
And-And you were so petite that I could
put my two hands around your waist.

616
00:42:14,071 --> 00:42:16,907
And you loved maraschino cherries.

617
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:23,872
- Yong Ja.
- Yes.

618
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:27,584
So, how are you?

619
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:36,843
A long time ago, the raven
looked down from the sky...

620
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:40,847
and saw that the people of the world
were living in darkness.

621
00:42:42,683 --> 00:42:46,520
The ball of light was kept hidden
by a selfish, old chief.

622
00:42:53,193 --> 00:42:56,655
So the raven turned himself
into a spruce needle...

623
00:42:56,697 --> 00:43:01,201
and floated on the river where
the chief's daughter came for water.

624
00:43:02,577 --> 00:43:04,287
She drank the spruce needle.

625
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:12,170
She became pregnant
and gave birth to a boy,

626
00:43:12,212 --> 00:43:15,048
who was the raven in disguise.

627
00:43:19,803 --> 00:43:22,556
The baby cried and cried...

628
00:43:22,597 --> 00:43:26,435
until the chief gave him
the ball of light to play with.

629
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:42,117
As soon as he had the light,

630
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,703
the raven turned back into himself.

631
00:44:15,025 --> 00:44:18,528
The raven carried the
light into the sky.

632
00:44:39,382 --> 00:44:44,888
From then on,
we no longer lived in darkness.

632
00:44:45,305 --> 00:45:45,695

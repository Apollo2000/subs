1
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,260
Many years ago there was...

2
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,471
a little girl and a little boy.

3
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,516
They lived in a small village in Mexico

4
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:17,893
and they were best friends.

5
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,260
One day the little girl's parents

6
00:00:20,302 --> 00:00:23,023
were killed in a terrible accident.

7
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,734
Pop.

8
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:25,943
Pop, pop, pop.

9
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,943
Without her parents,

10
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:29,385
the little girl didn't
have anywhere to live.

11
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:34,243
So the little boy's parents
took her in to live with them

12
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:36,286
in their castle high on a hill.

13
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,331
Every night before they went to sleep,

14
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,876
the little girl and
the little boy prayed together.

15
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:46,585
But the little girl was still
very sad about her parents,

16
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:50,367
and scared to live in the
big castle with her new family.

17
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,243
So the little boy

18
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:54,353
gave her one of his favorite toys

19
00:00:54,395 --> 00:00:56,498
to make her feel better.

20
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,518
This made the little girl feel
much better.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,064
But one day, a very mean boy
stole the toy from her

22
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,692
and laughed at her when she got upset.

23
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,991
So the little boy sneaked up
on the mean boy

24
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:15,743
and snatched the toy from him...

25
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,416
...and returned the toy
to the little girl.

26
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:25,420
She felt safe and protected
by the little boy.

27
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:28,256
When the little girl was older,

28
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:31,408
she decided it was time
to leave the big castle

29
00:01:31,449 --> 00:01:33,553
and move to the United States.

30
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,432
And she brought the toy with her

31
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:39,892
so she would always remember
the little boy.

32
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:48,109
To this day,
the toy still comforts her...

33
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:51,446
every night before she sleeps.

00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:23,519
Okay.

36
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:26,356
Jesus... fuck. What are you...

37
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:27,899
doing here?

38
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,401
I thought you might
need a towel or something.

39
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,768
For what, my ankles?

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,868
What are you still...

41
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,203
Are you...

42
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,152
Are you expecting a tip?

43
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:43,576
Is that what's happening here?

44
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:45,375
You want a... because... you...

45
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,951
Okay. Well, man, you got balls,
I'll tell you that.

46
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:50,296
I'm sure I got something in here for you.

47
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:55,134
Oh, shoot, I left all
my cash in my other pants.

48
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,806
Well, this is a complete
waste of my time.

49
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,557
Just give it five minutes.

50
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,851
I think you're trying to play me.

51
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,151
Goddamn it. He-He's gonna be here.

52
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:08,564
Just give him five minutes, all right?

53
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,150
Same old McBride bullshit.

54
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:14,195
Same old bullshit.

55
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:16,072
Look, this cat's gonna tell you

56
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:18,574
Julio's not the killer.

57
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:19,992
You know this case is over,

58
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,995
so you're saying you're desperate.

59
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,123
There's got to be something we can do.

60
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:10,418
I mean, if we lose our witness,
you're all we got.

61
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,463
It's complicated. Okay?

62
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:17,175
The Tito Garcia thing is part
of a much bigger investigation

63
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,051
that I can't talk about.

64
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,642
- Oh, come on, Jeff, don't spin this.
- Look, there are

65
00:04:21,684 --> 00:04:23,765
a lot of players involved now.

66
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,267
The La Mano Cartel?

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,127
You know I can't say that.

68
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,649
I know this is not your top priority,

69
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:34,734
but it is ours.

70
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,360
I guarantee you,

71
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:39,238
our witness is part
of your bigger investigation.

72
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,411
Okay, look,

73
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:48,247
we're investigating Tito's deportation.

74
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:50,833
All right? If I come across
something that can help you...

75
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,084
Then help us.

76
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:57,072
I'll see what I can do.

77
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,510
I'm not making any promises.

78
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,429
All right.

79
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,681
Appreciate it.

80
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,004
Fine.

81
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:17,360
Fine.

82
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:19,888
You coming?

83
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:21,572
Yeah, I'm coming.

84
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:27,203
Thank you.

85
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,631
We get a lot of weird stuff in the mail.

86
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:35,503
People send baked goods, but trust me,

87
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:36,963
don't eat anything
that comes in the mail.

88
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,256
Don't eat the mail, got it.

89
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,591
Can you work a phone?

90
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,343
Is that a trick question?

91
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:45,346
A lot of volunteers your age
have never used a landline.

92
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,473
If you have any questions,
I'm right over there.

93
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:48,641
Great, thank you.

94
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,000
You're welcome.

95
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,694
Hi.

96
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,320
- May I help you?
- I'm here to see

97
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:02,446
Marisol Silva?

98
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,675
Yes, um, of course.

99
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:05,992
D-Do you have an appointment?

100
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,326
Do I need an appointment?

101
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,495
I think so. Yes, um...

102
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:10,580
What's your name?

103
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,831
Miguel Torres, from the...

104
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:15,975
- Miguel...
- ...Disabled Veterans Association.

105
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:17,461
Um...

106
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,130
Just... okay, yeah, l-let me...

107
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,860
One second. Sorry.

108
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,966
No. You need to make an appointment.

109
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:29,140
I-I'm here to speak with you.

110
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,391
The only way you're gonna speak with me

111
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,767
is through the proper channels.

112
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,561
My boss says

113
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:34,937
I'm to speak to you today.

114
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,439
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

115
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,984
Make an appointment... next time.

116
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:47,538
Sorry about that.

117
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,665
No, I'm so sorry.

118
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:49,952
Did I handle that wrong, or...?

119
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:51,505
No, that was perfect.

120
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:53,146
Thank you, Denise.

121
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:58,836
Okay.

122
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:00,630
Who was that guy?

123
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:03,341
Uh, he said he was from the
Disabled Veterans Association.

124
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,926
Are you sure?

125
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,386
That's what he said.

126
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,709
It was so embarrassing.

127
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,586
Oh...

128
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,797
So, what do you even say to a kid

129
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,090
who tells you something like that?

130
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,383
I know, I know.

131
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:46,634
I just sort of didn't.

132
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,721
Yeah, I hear you.

133
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,431
Unless you got kids, you just can't know,

134
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:53,724
you know what I mean?

135
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:55,393
- Oh, yeah. No, I know.
- Hey.

136
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,646
- I know... hi.
- Hey. What's going on?

137
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:00,690
I told Mary you were running
late, so we've just been

138
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:01,732
having a little chat here, and...

139
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:03,192
Yeah.

140
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:05,175
Sorry, I-I should've called.

141
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:06,570
It's okay.

142
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,572
Well, Keith and I
are on working this case.

143
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,616
I-Innocent kid, wrong place, wrong time,

144
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,576
and all that, and we got a guy.

145
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:15,621
If he'd come forward, he could
prove the kid's innocent, but...

146
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,498
Come on, Billy.

147
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,750
Don't need to bother Mary with all that.

148
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,585
- I'm just curious what she thinks.
- She probably

149
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:22,965
doesn't care.

150
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,717
I'm sure she's got an opinion.

151
00:08:24,758 --> 00:08:26,215
I mean, what do you think?

152
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:28,884
Honestly, I mean,
should the guy come forward,

153
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,465
and... even though he'd have to admit

154
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:33,737
- that he did something wrong?
- Kid's innocent?

155
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,392
Yeah, I mean, that seems like
what a decent person should do.

156
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,742
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Problem is,

157
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:40,479
we're not sure he's a decent person.

158
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,356
He may just be a scumbag, so...

159
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:43,858
What do you think, Keith?

160
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:46,195
I think we should talk outside.

161
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:47,361
Yeah.

162
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,363
Yeah, we don't want
to bore Mary with all this.

163
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:50,781
We'll see you later, honey.

164
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:52,909
Okay. Oh...

165
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:55,179
I hope that guy does the right thing.

166
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:56,305
Yeah, me, too.

167
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:57,461
Say bye.

168
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,290
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye.

169
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:12,928
Fuck do you think you're doing, huh?

170
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,305
Just trying to give you
one more chance...

171
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,140
Just stay the fuck away from me.

172
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:18,517
Okay? Stay the fuck away from my family.

173
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,269
You know what I could do to you.

174
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,523
Whatever it is, it ain't gonna
make your problem go away.

175
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,945
I'm trying to help you and your family.

176
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:27,163
Fuck you.

177
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:28,637
You don't give a fuck about me.

178
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:30,237
Let's say that's true.

179
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,823
It ain't your wife's fault,
and it ain't your kids' fault.

180
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,198
Do not use my family to get to me, okay?

181
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,293
I know that fucking trick.

182
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:38,770
This ain't a trick.

183
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:43,735
Listen, all this is
gonna come back on you.

184
00:09:43,777 --> 00:09:45,461
I got the FBI all over it.

185
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,340
You need to tell me what
you want to do, right now.

186
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,392
I fucked up, man.

187
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:05,231
I ruined our lives.

188
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:10,260
I need your help, Bill.

189
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:12,738
Yeah, I know.

190
00:10:13,054 --> 00:10:14,889
And that's what I'm trying to do.

191
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:18,494
So let's go get in the car
and see Hakeem,

192
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:20,311
- all right?
- No.

193
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:22,748
I don't, I don't think I can

194
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,166
look him in the eye
and tell him this shit.

195
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,293
You're gonna have to, man.

196
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,660
You should probably leave your gun here.

197
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:08,627
Oh, shit, there it is.

198
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,046
What? Caviar for you, Pringles for me?

199
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,798
All right, you know what?

200
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,634
You just shut your mouth,
you take this bite,

201
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,383
it'll change your life right now.

202
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:18,828
Here it comes.

203
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,807
Oh, my God.

204
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:24,351
Aw, that's awesome.

205
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,071
Mm-hmm, that's Jean-Georges right there.

206
00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:28,076
There's more where that came from.

207
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:28,981
Oh.

208
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,235
- Here you go, my friend.
- Thank you.

209
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:37,990
Wolf it down, sister.

210
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:41,410
Look at you.

211
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:43,761
- Look at you on this boat.
- You know,

212
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,917
I think all this looks
pretty fucking good on me.

213
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,169
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

214
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,713
Tell you what, Brittany.

215
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:52,741
What?

216
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,799
I think everything looks good on you.

217
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:57,843
So, there.

218
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:13,442
Oh, fuck.

219
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,283
Oh...

220
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,619
I'm not, like, uh...

221
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:30,251
I can't, like, regular people, um...

222
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:34,880
It doesn't work that way for me, um...

223
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,051
It's complicated, so I'm not, uh...

224
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,012
Well, I got my own
complicated past, so...

225
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:45,140
- Not like mine.
- No, I get it.

226
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,726
I don't know.

227
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,396
You don't scare me. I've seen it all.

228
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,299
Done it all.

229
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,724
Can I show you something?

230
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:13,860
McBride's a piece of work.

231
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:18,156
I mean, we don't have to talk.

232
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,395
The fuck is this?

233
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:33,772
He'll tell you.

234
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,243
I need a guarantee.

235
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:49,233
Witness protection.

236
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,415
Immunity.

237
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:53,149
You're the guy?

238
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:56,248
I need your word or I'm not saying shit.

239
00:13:56,273 --> 00:13:58,233
Look, he's not gonna do anything

240
00:13:58,258 --> 00:14:00,865
for you, Roman, unless you
tell him what you told me.

241
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,304
I, uh...

242
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:11,602
Julio Suarez...
did not kill Hunter Friedman

243
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,853
and Marcos Peña.

244
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,316
Tito Garcia was my C.I.

245
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:19,300
He killed those boys.

246
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:21,779
Tito told you that?

247
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,114
- No.
- Then how do you know?

248
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:26,825
That's all I'm telling you
till my family is safe

249
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,203
and I have immunity.

250
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:35,334
- What'd you do?
- I'm not telling you a thing.

251
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:36,377
- What the fuck did you do?
- No,

252
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,836
that-that's all I'm saying now.

253
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,275
- You plant that fuckin' gun?
- That's all...

254
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:41,090
No, no. Come on. Come on.

255
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,256
Hakeem, buddy, come on, come on, come on.

256
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,301
- He set the kid up.
- I know, I know, I know.

257
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:45,803
I prosecuted an innocent fucking kid.

258
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,221
- Yes, I know that.
- Not to mention every case

259
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,931
- that we worked on can be thrown out.
- He's helping us now,

260
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,374
- okay?
- What the fuck were you thinking?

261
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,055
Please.

262
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:54,019
No, I'm not giving him any fucking help.

263
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,354
Need you to tell me everything
I need to fucking know.

264
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:56,355
No fucking way.

265
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:57,773
- No?
- No.

266
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,745
Oh, you think you're calling
the shots right now?

267
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:02,236
There's more to it.

268
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,574
You guys know everything?

269
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,410
We know what we need to know.

270
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:13,747
But you're gonna have to get his
family witness protection. Okay?

271
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,148
And immunity.

272
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:17,584
You need to tell me every
goddamn thing I need to know.

273
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:19,519
Everything.

274
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,088
Okay.

275
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,173
I'm gonna get my wife
and kids out of town,

276
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:24,988
- and then I'll tell you everything.
- No, no.

277
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,289
- No, I can't let you do that.
- Come on.

278
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,922
- I'm gonna put a cop on you.
- Hakeem, you know me, all right?

279
00:15:27,947 --> 00:15:29,325
- No.
- I'm not gonna put my family at risk.

280
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:30,472
- I...
- I'm gonna put a cop on you.

281
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,516
You got me, man.

282
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,545
Okay.

283
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,232
Just make it someone
I don't know already.

284
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,525
Hey, Hakeem.

285
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,446
He's your boy now, give him a ride home.

286
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,739
Get in the fucking car.

287
00:15:57,693 --> 00:15:59,793
Good luck, Detective.

288
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:14,456
So, it all started, uh, with my sister.

289
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:15,667
Mm-hmm.

290
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,687
When she was 12, she lost her leg.

291
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:22,065
And, uh... it was like a staph infection.

292
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,925
And, um...

293
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,528
Sorry, I feel like...

294
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,572
- Huh?
- I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

295
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:30,122
Really? It's okay.

296
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,034
Hey, it's okay.

297
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,702
Keep going.

298
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:40,209
Anyway, um... the... the first morning

299
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,252
that my sister was home
from the hospital,

300
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:44,630
at breakfast, my mom was trying to,

301
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,383
you know, just keep it light
with cartoons and cereal.

302
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,385
You know, like we're...

303
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:53,305
It's a normal... normal morning,

304
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,765
normal kitchen.

305
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:10,513
This is the table. Um...

306
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:15,953
I... My sister sat in her wheelchair.

307
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,288
She had her prosthetic on.

308
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,041
But it was bothering her, so my mother

309
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,085
helped her take it off here at the table.

310
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:28,507
And... I was nine, and I sat right here

311
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:32,553
watching it all. And, uh...

312
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,806
her knee was, uh...

313
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,893
I just couldn't take my eyes off of it.

314
00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:42,896
It was red, and...

315
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:45,399
it's where her leg was cut off.

316
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,924
Oh.

317
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:51,113
Anyway, it was sore,
so my mother was rubbing it

318
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,948
to soothe her.

319
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:58,495
And... I... realized that

320
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:02,958
she was going to exclusively
have my mother's love

321
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,276
from that point, um...

322
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,506
which, strangely...

323
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,429
I mean, I don't know,
I was a fucking kid.

324
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,347
I didn't know what a hard-on was,

325
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:19,516
but that's what happened.

326
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,187
Um, and my therapist later reduced it

327
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,608
to something called
eroticized childhood trauma,

328
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,383
which, uh,

329
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:32,863
is just like, uh...

330
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:38,619
Well... I'm so fucked up. You know?

331
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,037
And, uh...

332
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:42,869
But it happened.

333
00:18:44,631 --> 00:18:47,294
I don't know what I'm...

334
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,153
So, you built this?

335
00:18:50,947 --> 00:18:54,635
That therapist said I really needed to

336
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:57,554
imagine myself in my childhood kitchen,

337
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:01,415
really put myself... here.

338
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,416
I guess if you have the money, right?

339
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:07,773
Why not, huh?

340
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,068
Yeah. I don't know.
It's-it's over the top.

341
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,653
It's a lot. I don't...

342
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,516
Can I?

343
00:19:20,017 --> 00:19:21,495
Come on, I don't want you to... You...

344
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,622
- I want to.
- Don't-don't make fun of me.

345
00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:26,416
I want to.

346
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:30,629
Okay.

347
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,957
The right?

348
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,502
The left.

349
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,120
Like that?

350
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:24,558
Yeah.

351
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:05,724
I've never been intimate
with anyone before.

352
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:08,852
I've been in relationships

353
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:12,189
and had sex and...

354
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,399
But never...

355
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:19,011
Is it weird that I'm...

356
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,743
thinking about us being together?

357
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,539
No.

358
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,442
I like helping you.

359
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,546
- You do?
- Yeah.

360
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,924
Why?

361
00:21:39,573 --> 00:21:43,303
Because... I understand you.

362
00:21:46,747 --> 00:21:49,017
Do you understand me?

363
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,231
I think I do.

364
00:22:00,261 --> 00:22:02,072
Come down here.

365
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,575
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my God.

366
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:08,286
Not... no...

367
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,663
Stop.

368
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,581
Hey, do you want to sleep over?

369
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:14,501
I can't tonight.

370
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:16,711
But soon.

371
00:22:16,986 --> 00:22:18,964
- Hmm?
- Okay.

372
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,800
I got to go back to the office.

373
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,635
Prep some final paperwork for Billy.

374
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,679
Yeah? What's final? What's going on?

375
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,373
I don't know, I guess he thinks
Julio's gonna get out next week?

376
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,561
Wha-What happened?

377
00:22:33,043 --> 00:22:35,689
Uh, Billy found a guy
who's willing to testify

378
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,173
about the murders.

379
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,301
So, he's-he's got somebody
who's gonna flip?

380
00:22:41,385 --> 00:22:44,739
It always happens on cases
like this with Billy.

381
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,825
He just digs and digs and digs

382
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:50,328
and keeps, I don't know,
asking people questions.

383
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,249
And... eventually...

384
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,460
someone comes forward
and tells the truth.

385
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,240
Well, that's-that's awesome.

386
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,993
Yeah, but it's a mess of paperwork.

387
00:23:08,496 --> 00:23:10,247
Did I bring a purse?

388
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:22,652
Billy.

389
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:26,072
- Hi.
- Hey.

390
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,327
How's it going?

391
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:33,622
It's good. Good. I...

392
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,082
I was worried about you.

393
00:23:36,607 --> 00:23:38,460
Well, you shouldn't be
worried about my ass.

394
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,545
I mean, I should've called you, and I...

395
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:43,089
I'm a fucking idiot. I'm really sorry.

396
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,841
I was just thinking
you didn't trust me enough

397
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,593
- to talk to me.
- No, I do trust you.

398
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:48,929
- Really. I wanted to also...
- Well, maybe you shouldn't.

399
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,513
...apologize, you know...

400
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,349
You don't need to apologize
to any... Forget it.

401
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,059
You didn't say anything, it was me.

402
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,311
The whole fucking thing was me.
I was an asshole.

403
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:59,564
And the fact that you
came down here surprises me.

404
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,817
Why are you not mad at me?
I don't understand.

405
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:06,947
Well, I was worried. I wasn't mad.

406
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,800
- Hey.
- Hey.

407
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:33,306
What's going on?
I, uh, I can't go inside?

408
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,225
- No.
- No more, uh, Uncle Danny?

409
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,768
Mary's feeling like shit, you know.

410
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,978
Kids are coming down with something.

411
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,146
- Oh, that sucks.
- Yeah.

412
00:24:41,505 --> 00:24:43,817
Thought I was gonna see you
at the game today.

413
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:46,695
What, were you afraid
I was still gonna own you,

414
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,238
even with the bum knee?

415
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,782
- In your dreams, buddy.
- Yeah.

416
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:58,123
So, um, the pickup, the locker...
everything cool?

417
00:24:58,522 --> 00:25:00,356
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

418
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,377
- Yeah, all good.
- Oh.

419
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,005
All right.

420
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:06,965
I don't know.

421
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,800
I'm feeling like shit, too.
I think I'm coming down with it.

422
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,261
Oh. Anything I can do?

423
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:12,995
No.

424
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,224
You'd tell me if there was, right?

425
00:25:16,665 --> 00:25:18,083
Yeah.

426
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,396
Yeah, I'm sure I'll be fine
in a couple days.

427
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:23,339
Yeah, yeah.

428
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:27,777
- All right, be better, man.
- Okay.

429
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:48,182
- Hey. You-you look beautiful.
- No. Sit down.

430
00:25:48,224 --> 00:25:51,551
Sit down. This is gonna take a second.

431
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:55,805
I'm gonna try to break this
down for you. Okay.

432
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:58,799
First of all, I want
to preface this by saying that

433
00:25:58,841 --> 00:26:01,686
I-I really do think
you're a very brave man.

434
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,938
- Thank you.
- That being said,

435
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,276
uh, hypothetically, this
is gonna go great. All right?

436
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,987
You're tall and you're nice,
and you can't figure me out,

437
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,114
which you find interesting for now.

438
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:16,030
So, so we go out a couple times, right?

439
00:26:16,072 --> 00:26:17,410
And that goes well.

440
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:19,454
It goes so well, in fact,
that we sleep together.

441
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:23,249
That goes extremely well
because you are, in fact,

442
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,986
tall and nice and I am
extraordinary in bed.

443
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:31,132
I'm very serious. I'm extraordinary.

444
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,051
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

445
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:34,928
So we do that a couple of times,

446
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,138
and you're still interested,
I start getting comfortable,

447
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,594
so I give you a set of keys. Right?

448
00:26:39,636 --> 00:26:41,224
You leave a toothbrush at my place.

449
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,521
And then we start getting
into a routine. All right?

450
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:48,233
And this is what that clown show

451
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,606
is gonna look like, okay?

452
00:26:50,647 --> 00:26:53,071
I'm gonna come home from work, late.

453
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,614
So you've already eaten.

454
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:57,158
So I have a quick salad
and I jump in the shower.

455
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,452
I double cleanse my face.
I do my business in there,

456
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:01,871
then I hop out, and then it's,
uh, toner, serum, oil,

457
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:05,500
eye cream, and I coat it all
with hyaluronic acid.

458
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,889
Then I put eyelash grower on my eyebrows

459
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:09,381
because I was starting
to look like a chola,

460
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:11,289
and I was trying to fill them in,

461
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:12,799
but you can't really tell
'cause I have blonde tips,

462
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,592
but it's happening.
I'm terrified of getting old.

463
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,151
Then I put on my self-tanner.

464
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:18,638
Okay? Then I put on my jam-jams.

465
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,181
Very important because, at first,

466
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:23,268
I'll only wear my jam-jams.
Okay? It's a comfort thing.

467
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,436
Then I'm gonna start wearing your shorts.

468
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,440
I'm gonna wear your shorts.

469
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,298
- That's not funny.
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,980
I'm gonna put on my humidifier,

471
00:27:33,022 --> 00:27:34,696
my air purifier, and the television.

472
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,282
It's gonna be set to a channel
that you fucking hate.

473
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,450
Then I'm gonna hop into bed, all right?

474
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,077
Now, this is where,

475
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,146
this is where the real fun
begins, all right?

476
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,583
This is when the Vicks comes out.

477
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:49,485
I put that shit on my feet.

478
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,853
I put it on my chest.

479
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:54,716
I put it under my nose
and I put it on my sinuses.

480
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,342
All right?

481
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,052
I guarantee you,

482
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:01,121
I guarantee you,
that if you stick around...

483
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,851
you're gonna smell like Vicks
for the rest of your life.

484
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:08,563
- Mm.
- For the rest of your life.

485
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:11,482
Okay? It will never get out
of your clothes.

486
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,818
It will never leave you.

487
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,819
Hmm.

488
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:16,237
How do I know this?

489
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,013
Because I have been married twice,

490
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,474
and they both stink.

491
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:22,893
Okay?

492
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:27,332
So that's... that's pr...

493
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:30,043
Oh, shit, last thing: Invisalign.

494
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,170
Oh, for my fucked up teeth.
Is it genetic?

495
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,005
Who knows? My birth parents gave me up

496
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,924
and I grew up in foster care.

497
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,675
Um... so that's another bag of trash

498
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:38,927
that I carry around with me

499
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,887
that will eventually become your problem.

500
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,723
Hey, you want to dance?

501
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,312
I... Absolutely not.

502
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,648
Come on, just one dance.

503
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:57,719
Just one.

504
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:00,365
If I do it, will you leave me alone?

505
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:01,930
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

506
00:29:01,971 --> 00:29:02,992
Yes, okay.

507
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:04,786
You will leave me alone
if I dance with you?

508
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,330
One dance, please.

509
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:14,504
Fine.

510
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:29,477
No. That's so stupid.

511
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,188
- That's such a stupid thing to do.
- No, it's great.

512
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:18,901
So no question about credibility?

513
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:20,385
No.

514
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,864
Well, Mr. McBride, it looks like

515
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:24,115
you have all the evidence you need.

516
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:25,491
I have to draft the immunity letter

517
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,060
and, uh, get the witness'
statement on record.

518
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,413
We have a motion

519
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:31,956
to dismiss the charges here.

520
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:33,958
Can you get that through
today, you think?

521
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:37,323
Mr. Rashad, are you prepared?

522
00:30:37,364 --> 00:30:39,676
- No, I'm sorry, I'm not.
- Well, we'd like to tell him,

523
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:40,927
so when do you think you will be?

524
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:42,675
Well, as long as everything
checks out with the witnesses,

525
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:44,927
I should be done by,
I don't know, Monday.

526
00:30:46,203 --> 00:30:47,889
Okay, well,

527
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,475
let's have the motion to dismiss
on the books by Monday morning.

528
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,769
Can we at least get him
in protective custody

529
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,604
over the weekend?

530
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,672
- That works for me.
- Cool.

531
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:03,363
- Mr. McBride.
- Yeah?

532
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:05,990
Mr. Rashad and I are going
to take care of everything,

533
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,658
but, uh...

534
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,869
I just want you to know that

535
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:13,164
you've really done your job
and your client is going home

536
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,500
and I want to thank you

537
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:19,212
for not letting this court
send an innocent kid to prison.

538
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:23,299
Thank you.

539
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,266
- Hey.
- What's up, bud?

540
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,559
How you doing?

541
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,713
They put me in a P.C. unit.

542
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,691
- They said you ordered it.
- Yeah.

543
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,985
- That's right.
- Why do I have to be in there?

544
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,695
It's like solitary confinement.

545
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:47,448
It's only for a couple of days,
and there's good reason for it.

546
00:31:48,682 --> 00:31:50,201
So then I can get out of there?

547
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:52,199
I can go back to my old cell?

548
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:54,271
No, then you get to leave.

549
00:31:56,565 --> 00:31:58,517
What do you, what do you mean?

550
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,628
They're dropping the charges against you.

551
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:05,091
Are you serious?

552
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,468
Come Monday, you're gonna be a happy boy.

553
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,054
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

554
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:12,014
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Oh.

555
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,975
No, I'd hug you, I just
don't like doing that.

556
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,521
Oh, my...

557
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:29,389
I'm open!

558
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,827
Oh!

559
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:34,245
I made it!

560
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:36,873
Can't believe I made that.
I suck at basketball.

561
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:38,940
Oh, shit.

562
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:41,878
How's the knee?

563
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,046
- It's good. It's fine.
- All right, sorry about that.

564
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:45,756
That got out of hand. I won't...

565
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,300
I won't let that happen again, okay?

566
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:48,509
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

567
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:49,802
What's up?

568
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:52,221
Uh, not much, just checking in
on you. You all right?

569
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:54,056
Fine.

570
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,808
Who do you think it is?

571
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,311
Um...

572
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:00,062
What do you mean?

573
00:33:00,504 --> 00:33:02,527
Danny, I'm not, I'm not wearing a wire.

574
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:04,591
There's nobody here.
You don't have to be secretive.

575
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:08,529
- Who do you think it is?
- Who-who do I think what is?

576
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:09,739
Come on, Danny.
I don't want to joke around.

577
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,033
- I don't want you...
- I...

578
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,892
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

579
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:16,913
- Do you really not know?
- I really don't know.

580
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:23,669
Billy McBride has someone
who's going to flip.

581
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:28,174
Wait, what? Wh...

582
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:29,699
Where'd you hear that?

583
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,012
Danny, how do you not know this?

584
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:35,223
I-I-I haven't,
I haven't heard that, I mean...

585
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:38,250
O-Okay, well, now you know.
So, who do you think it is?

586
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:42,355
I-I don't know. Uh... Marisol?

587
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:44,023
Mar... Why Marisol?

588
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,234
Well... I mean, isn't... she's...

589
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:47,735
- been hanging out?
- She's not making

590
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:49,487
those kind of moves without us. Right?

591
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:51,489
I'm thinking about, you know,
maybe one of your friends,

592
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:52,740
some people you've been trying
to stay close to.

593
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:54,033
One of my friends? What, like Roman? No.

594
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:56,953
- It is, it is not Keith Roman.
- But how do you know?

595
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,663
- I mean, look, he's your friend...
- I'm just...

596
00:33:58,704 --> 00:33:59,872
...you're close with him,

597
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:01,791
but you said he's been stressed
out, maybe there's a...

598
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,793
Yeah, yeah, ab-about
his wife and his kids,

599
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,419
but, I mean, not about this shit.

600
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,341
This is getting serious.

601
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:12,552
Do you understand?

602
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:16,430
- Yeah, I understand.
- But do you really?

603
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,849
- Yes, I understand.
- Okay.

604
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:23,396
- So, if it's not Roman...
- Yeah.

605
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,399
...then who is it? I mean, is...

606
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,817
is it me?

607
00:34:29,551 --> 00:34:31,404
- Okay, that's funny.
- It is funny.

608
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,138
And maybe it's you.

609
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,242
Yeah, it's me. It's me. I'm sorry.

610
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,868
That's not funny.

611
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,495
Wh-Wh-Whoa!

612
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,539
I'm kidding. I'm not gonna
do that to you anymore.

613
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:44,625
- Let's figure it out, okay?
- Yeah.

614
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:55,177
I've made it a priority as mayor

615
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,805
and will continue to push policies

616
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:00,766
that will address the opioid crisis.

617
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,776
I'm Joe from Hacienda Heights,

618
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:13,154
and my question
is for Councilwoman Silva.

619
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,740
You've talked a lot about
building an inclusive community

620
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,241
through your outreach programs.

621
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:18,986
Even with your poll numbers dropping,

622
00:35:19,608 --> 00:35:22,121
you are very public
in supporting a murderer

623
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:24,957
from one of those programs.
Are you concerned that

624
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,505
may undermine even your base

625
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,276
this close to the election?

626
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:32,256
Joe, thank you
for your question, and, um,

627
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,550
just to clarify, Julio Suarez

628
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:37,428
has been accused of murder.

629
00:35:37,911 --> 00:35:40,556
I stand by his innocence
because in this country

630
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:43,309
you're innocent until proven otherwise.

631
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:54,940
But, Joe, I don't blame you
for your choice of words.

632
00:35:54,982 --> 00:35:58,574
Mayor Anderson also neglects
to include the word "accused"

633
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:01,059
when it comes to my support of Julio.

634
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:05,873
You know, Julio grew up
in tough circumstances.

635
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:07,917
He could have just easily
slipped through the cracks

636
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,044
and become a victim of the system.

637
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,839
Instead, he's an honor student

638
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:16,157
and a talented musician.

639
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:21,430
As many of you know, I was born
in a small village in Mexico.

640
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:25,434
And my parents died
when I was very young.

641
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:28,354
And though I was fortunate
to come to this country,

642
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:31,725
I was poor and I didn't
speak the language.

643
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:32,972
So I, too,

644
00:36:33,014 --> 00:36:35,528
could have just easily
slipped through cracks.

645
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,990
As mayor, I want to become
the voice that unites all of us,

646
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:42,201
no matter what the circumstances.

647
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:45,287
This is the Los Angeles I know and love.

648
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:47,123
And this is the Los Angeles

649
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:51,001
I will proudly represent as your mayor.

650
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:01,887
Oh, thank you.

651
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:13,190
- How do you know this?
- Well, I followed your lead,

652
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,817
I inserted myself into Billy's camp,

653
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:17,677
I got to know one of his employees.

654
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,990
I'm not sure who's flipping,
but I think we're...

655
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:24,118
extremely close to being exposed.

656
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:33,002
- Jesus...
- I just want you to have

657
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:35,004
the information, but...

658
00:37:35,528 --> 00:37:39,908
I would still love to support
you standing by Julio,

659
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,328
but our options are...

660
00:37:45,622 --> 00:37:46,748
limited.

661
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:52,462
- Tom, what if I just quit?
- Marisol.

662
00:37:56,435 --> 00:37:57,860
It's time.

663
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:13,042
Hello?

664
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,502
Who's this?

665
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:16,504
Elena Morales.

666
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:18,702
Marisol Silva's
campaign manager. Who's this?

667
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:21,801
Oh, it's very nice to meet you,
Elena. I'm Gabriel.

668
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:23,636
Would you mind giving Marisol
a message from me?

669
00:38:24,285 --> 00:38:25,638
Okay.

670
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,599
Ask her when's the last time she prayed?

671
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:29,975
Can you remember that?

672
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:32,019
I'm sorry. Who is this?

673
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:33,896
Hello?

674
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:38,067
Hey.

675
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:40,194
Do we have any new numbers yet?

676
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:43,072
Everyone has you winning
the debate by a landslide.

677
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,949
Instant polls already have you up by ten.

678
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,450
Fantastic.

679
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,285
I'm exhausted.

680
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:49,995
Who's Gabriel?

681
00:38:54,023 --> 00:38:55,626
Uh...

682
00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:57,628
He wanted me to give you a message.

683
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,089
Uh, "When's the last time you prayed?"

684
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,133
What does that mean?

685
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,832
You ask a lot of questions, Elena.

686
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:14,103
I'm just trying to keep you safe.

687
00:39:14,627 --> 00:39:16,522
You're very good at your job,

688
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:19,233
but I think it's time for you to move on.

689
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:23,028
You're firing me?

690
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,822
No. Never.

691
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:28,075
I'm giving you the freedom
to explore a new opportunity.

692
00:39:31,186 --> 00:39:34,248
Elena, the campaign is over.

693
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,917
Senator Briggs from your hometown

694
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:40,348
inquired about your service
a while ago, but at the time,

695
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:41,630
I didn't want to let you go

696
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:44,633
because you're such a valuable asset.

697
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:48,178
But he's very impressed with
what you've done for me so far.

698
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,955
I don't want to go back to Sacramento.

699
00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:57,187
I'm calling him and giving you
my highest recommendations.

700
00:39:57,229 --> 00:40:00,149
This is best for both of us.

701
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,922
Good luck.

702
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:11,827
I wish you the best.

703
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:19,126
Anyways, Marisol's
really brave, you know?

704
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:21,462
I mean, this guy came in today
who had a hook for a hand.

705
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:22,755
No shit.

706
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:24,757
- Yeah, it's crazy, right?
- Yeah.

707
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,175
It was pretty weird.

708
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,886
Marisol just walked right up to him

709
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:31,388
and told him he needed
to make an appointment,

710
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,892
but he kept insisting
and being really pushy with her

711
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:36,894
and she stood her ground, though.

712
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:38,086
Sent him on his way.

713
00:40:39,963 --> 00:40:42,691
Did you ever find out
what he wanted or who he was?

714
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:45,464
- Uh-uh.
- Like a street person or something?

715
00:40:45,505 --> 00:40:48,364
- He said he was a disabled veteran.
- Oh.

716
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,991
Those guys go through
a lot of shit, you know.

717
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:55,162
He could've had... you know,
some kind of PTSD or whatever.

718
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,913
Marisol was brave, though.

719
00:40:59,732 --> 00:41:01,168
If it were me, I probably would have

720
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,544
just hidden in my office.

721
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:05,714
I really like her.

722
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:07,407
You do?

723
00:41:08,575 --> 00:41:10,469
- I think you made that clear.
- Mm-hmm.

724
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:12,638
- About 300 times.
- Okay.

725
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,557
You just seem really happy is all.

726
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:20,270
I'm all right, I guess.

727
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:33,742
Thank you, Luis.

728
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:36,453
Of course, Ms. Silva, any time.

729
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,706
Did Mr. McBride tell you?

730
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:41,750
Yes. They're dropping the charges.

731
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,671
I'm so happy.

732
00:41:45,987 --> 00:41:49,216
My girlfriend's gonna throw
this really big party.

733
00:41:49,782 --> 00:41:51,260
And I'd really like you to come.

734
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:53,262
Of course, of course.

735
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:54,746
I'll be there.

736
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,423
You didn't deserve any...

737
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,302
you didn't deserve any of this.

738
00:42:10,553 --> 00:42:13,323
Well, it's all going to be over soon.

739
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:20,581
Look, thank you so much
for believing in me.

740
00:42:22,982 --> 00:42:24,752
I'll never forget it.

741
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:30,758
I love you.

742
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,968
I love you, too.

743
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:21,999
Okay, Keith.

744
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:24,144
Tell me.

745
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:25,562
I can't.

746
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:26,897
You owe me an explanation.

747
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:28,357
I-I don't want you to get involved.

748
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:30,567
Oh, yeah? I am fucking involved.

749
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:32,152
We're all fucking involved.

750
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:36,698
Look, all I can say is,
Danny came to me...

751
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,450
- Yeah?
- ...with this thing.

752
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:39,743
- What thing?
- Okay?

753
00:43:39,785 --> 00:43:41,703
- And-and-and it got out of hand.
- What?

754
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:44,414
Do not touch me!

755
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,337
- I could kill him.
- No.

756
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:51,713
Where is he? I'll kill him.

757
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:53,423
I need to own it.

758
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:01,765
I did not sign up for this, Keith.

759
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:04,309
I don't deserve this.

760
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:06,228
Your kids don't deserve this.

761
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,272
I know.

762
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:37,509
What's gonna happen to Danny?

763
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:56,945
Danny?

764
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:00,449
It's him.

765
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,451
It's fucking him.

766
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:04,685
Well, Danny, you better take care of it.

767
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:08,749
Wait, what?

768
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,292
He's my-my fucking best friend, man.

769
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:11,710
What are you talking about?

770
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:13,945
And I'm very sorry about that.

771
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,507
No, Tom, no...

772
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,516
Fuck. Fuck!

773
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,914
I have a surprise for you.

774
00:46:30,956 --> 00:46:32,582
I don't like surprises.

775
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:36,336
I don't like them either, but...

776
00:46:36,777 --> 00:46:37,963
this is a good one.

777
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:39,256
Yeah?

778
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:40,674
Okay.

779
00:46:41,248 --> 00:46:42,700
What you got?

780
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:48,497
I want you to come away with me.

781
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:52,835
What do you mean?

782
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:55,504
Right now.

783
00:46:58,341 --> 00:47:00,527
You're not too busy running for mayor?

784
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:02,446
Just one night, and, you know,

785
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:04,156
my numbers are up.

786
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:07,034
I think it would be good
just to get away from all this.

787
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:08,517
Yeah.

788
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:11,496
Sounds good to me.

789
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:13,707
- Good.
- Yeah.

790
00:47:13,749 --> 00:47:15,417
So, where-where are we going?

791
00:47:16,108 --> 00:47:18,295
Really? It's a surprise.

792
00:47:18,819 --> 00:47:20,589
Okay.

793
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:21,965
I'm intrigued.

794
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,301
Good.

795
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:25,510
I think it's gonna be good.

796
00:47:26,535 --> 00:47:28,221
Would you go to the beach?

797
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:29,997
Right now.

798
00:47:31,165 --> 00:47:32,625
Well...

799
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:35,937
just go stand on the beach
and wait for you?

800
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:37,129
Yes.

801
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:41,985
Okay. You're gonna leave
and go home, aren't you?

802
00:47:44,178 --> 00:47:46,323
Well, should I just leave a credit card,

803
00:47:46,365 --> 00:47:48,408
- and they can bring...?
- No, everything's taken care of.

804
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,786
- Really?
- Of course.

805
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:52,329
No shit.

806
00:47:52,371 --> 00:47:53,985
I'll see you in a little bit.

807
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,172
Yeah.

808
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,643
Billy.

809
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:19,886

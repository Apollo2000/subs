1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,094
UN Owen is unknown.

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,147
We must all have
something in common.

3
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:08,107
Someone who knows us all.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,179
It's the poem.
It's the poem, don't you see?

5
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:13,123
No-one's coming for us.
This is the end.

6
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,135
You like Uncle Hugo, don't you?

7
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:18,131
I do. I am in love with him.

8
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:20,175
"One chopped himself in half
and then there were six."

9
00:00:20,177 --> 00:00:22,187
So she's right. It is the poem!

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,143
We have sharp minds.
We should stay together.

11
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:28,163
It was locked.

12
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:31,139
Which means there must be
a master key.

13
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:34,099
Any one of us could have had
the key.

14
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,091
Any one of us could have the gun.

15
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:38,095
The killer is not out there.

16
00:00:38,097 --> 00:00:39,183
The killer is in here.

17
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:41,177
It is one of us.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,074

19
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:23,095
Look how happy Cyril is now.

20
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:25,151
Hugo always works wonders.

21
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:28,123
He is the most marvellous man.

22
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,111
He seems very nice.

23
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:34,115
I really can't imagine many would be
as kind, under the circumstances.

24
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:36,109
What circumstances?

25
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:41,119
Well, I had no idea I was pregnant
when my husband died.

26
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:44,123
So Hugo, as the nephew,
stood to inherit.

27
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:48,167
And when little Cyril popped out,
that was it for Hugo's hopes. Hm!

28
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:52,143
What he needs is some rich girl
loaded down with Daddy's money,

29
00:02:52,145 --> 00:02:54,167
but he's a romantic.

30
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:56,167
Wants to marry for love.

31
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:59,119
But how can he when he doesn't have
a penny?

32
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:02,185
Love, Miss Claythorne,
is a very costly pursuit.

33
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:06,131
Oh, well done, Cyril! Oh!

34
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,181
I might go and play with them.

35
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:17,155
Ah, hello.

36
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:20,101
Looks like we've got
some reinforcements, Cyril.

37
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:22,187
Ready, old thing?

38
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:25,123
Ready? I don't think
Miss Claythorne can hit a ball.

39
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,121
- Girls can't, Uncle Hugo.
- Well, we'll have to see.

40
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:32,131
Oh, shot!

41
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:34,151
Over here! Quick, quick!

42
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:37,095
Quick, she's going to get all
the way around. Come on now.

43
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,165
Well done! Almost.

44
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:50,107
We can't just sit here
doing nothing!

45
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,107
What are we supposed to do?

46
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:54,127
Light a fire on the headland,
signal for help?

47
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:56,125
Not in this weather.

48
00:03:57,165 --> 00:04:00,127
Where's... where's she going?
Where are you going?

49
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,103
To make tea. I'll bring it in.

50
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:05,187
What else are you going to bring in?
A knife from the kitchen?

51
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:08,095
The gun from wherever
you've hidden it?

52
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:09,187
And what are you going to be
putting in the tea?

53
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,163
She's going to wipe out
all four of us!

54
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:14,127
There'll be lemon in the tea.

55
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,187
I-I won't bring a knife
and I don't have the gun.

56
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,183
Even if I did, I wouldn't be killing
you all at the same time, would I?

57
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:22,187
- How do we know that?! - Because it's
one by one and in a particular way,

58
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:24,163
or have you not been paying
attention?

59
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:27,155
And nowhere on that does it say
anything about a gun, does it,

60
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:29,143
you idiotic, cretinous bastard?!

61
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:33,131
I'll come with you.

62
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:34,169
No!

63
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:40,135
No. We go... singularly,
or in a group.

64
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:50,185
I hear you were one for the black
square and the rope, Judge Wargrave.

65
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:55,155
When it was appropriate, yes.

66
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:59,167
Tubs here tells me you used to watch
all the hangings you'd ordered.

67
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:01,175
Is that true?

68
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:04,095
You really want to stop calling me
that.

69
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:05,177
Is that true, Judge?

70
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:11,133
I had the power to condemn men
and women to death for their crimes.

71
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:15,185
With great power
comes great responsibility.

72
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,171
I believe that to look away
as that power is exercised

73
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:23,117
was both irresponsible and cowardly.

74
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:28,125
Did you watch Edward Seton hang?

75
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:36,159
I remember Edward Seton,
from the newspapers.

76
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,141
Everyone said he was innocent.

77
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:41,159
He wasn't.

78
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,109
He left diaries.

79
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:47,115
They proved a warped
and corrupted mind.

80
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:50,095
He believed his victims
were full of filth

81
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:52,185
and that he was cleansing the world
of their stain.

82
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:59,187
Taunting the police with... clues
and misdirections excited him.

83
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:02,145
As much as torture and sadism.

84
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:06,179
He was guilty and you passed
the right verdict.

85
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:08,163
Why didn't you go and see him?

86
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:10,133
I did.

87
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,131
It was unsettling.

88
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,093
Different.

89
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:20,137
He refused the hood.

90
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:23,261
He wanted me to see his face.

91
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:28,135
Perhaps to impute there was
some commonality between us,

92
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,159
perhaps to... laugh at me.

93
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:34,095
Laugh at you?

94
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:35,113
Yes.

95
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:38,113
At justice.

96
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:41,145
It meant nothing to him.

97
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:45,101
He wasn't cowed by it, or by me.

98
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:48,149
I was nothing.

99
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:52,161
I would soon be forgotten,
a footnote in history.

100
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:58,139
Whereas he, with his legacy of blood
and horror,

101
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:00,113
would be remembered for ever.

102
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:05,097
Well, it worked.

103
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,157
He haunts me still.

104
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,163
But... laughter or not,

105
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:18,189
justice came, as it always does.

106
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:25,093
And the world is free
of his terrible darkness.

107
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:42,139
This is ridiculous!

108
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:44,135
I mean, we can't just sit around
doing nothing!

109
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:46,121
Very well, Doctor.

110
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:50,157
We said singly, or in a group.

111
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:53,179
I'm going to read.

112
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:58,185
I'm sorry, Dr Armstrong,
but your agitation tires me greatly.

113
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:28,109
Justice came.

114
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:32,111
The killer and Wargrave
having common cause.

115
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:36,103
The same thrill... from
handing out death.

116
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:38,139
You took the piss
when I said the judge.

117
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:41,115
Yes, well, now I think different.

118
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:44,185
How many men has he seen dangle?
What does that do to someone?

119
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:47,151
He's on his own.

120
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,177
Could be plotting anything.

121
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,169
Stop it, will you?! Just stop it!

122
00:09:29,145 --> 00:09:31,163
As if we haven't had to put up
with you.

123
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:34,127
Breathing and smoking.

124
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:36,173
Scratching, fidgeting and pacing.

125
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,157
I'm going to bed.

126
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:45,141
Singly, or in a group.

127
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,141
You can watch me go up the stairs.

128
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:26,141
Cyril?!

129
00:11:27,157 --> 00:11:29,101
Cyril?!

130
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,117
N-o-o-o-o-o-o!

131
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:42,181
No!

132
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,101
No!

133
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:52,167
Vera?

134
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,105
(Hey!)

135
00:11:57,097 --> 00:11:58,177
(Vera?)

136
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:06,131
Here. For Christ's sake,
it's sal volatile. Smelling salts.

137
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:09,159
Breathe slowly. In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

138
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:13,095
There we are.

139
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:22,105
I thought there was somebody
in the room with me.

140
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,175
Here, have some brandy.

141
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:30,125
Ah!

142
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:35,123
Good for you, Vera.

143
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,111
What, you think I've done
something to it?

144
00:12:38,113 --> 00:12:41,145
I'm going to go and fetch another
bottle that hasn't been opened.

145
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:47,091
- I need some water.
- This brandy's all right.

146
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:48,155
I haven't done anything to it.

147
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:50,143
Brandy's good for shock,
that's why I got it.

148
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,117
(He called her Vera.)

149
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:56,135
Lombard. That's the second time.

150
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:58,169
There's something going on
between them.

151
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:03,129
Sealed and untampered with.

152
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,145
What's that for?

153
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:15,167
I don't know. A chandelier, maybe.

154
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,103
Like downstairs.

155
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:19,111
A chandelier in the bedroom?

156
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:21,091
Well, it's posh people, innit?

157
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:23,107
They put a chandelier anywhere.

158
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:26,103
Put a chandelier in a pigsty
if the fancy took them.

159
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,167
- I'm becoming very fond of you, Tubs.
- Hm!

160
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:35,171
You're an arrogant arsehole, you.

161
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:39,099
Ooh! Bloody hell!
Sorry, Miss Claythorne.

162
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,147
No, you're right. He's an arsehole!

163
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:45,165
Where's the judge?

164
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,117
Jesus!

165
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:07,149
He's been shot in the head.

166
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:12,179
Well, what are you doing?

167
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:15,155
Well, his head needs to be wrapped
if we're going to move him.

168
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:17,119
He's right.

169
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:20,111
We don't want his brains
spilling out all over the floor.

170
00:14:20,113 --> 00:14:23,113
Don't use your jacket, Armstrong.
I'll find something else.

171
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:27,157
Shot?

172
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:30,157
- Are you sure?
- Well, look at him!

173
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:34,157
We searched everywhere for that gun.

174
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:08,143
You went back downstairs
to get the bottle.

175
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:11,133
You went downstairs, too,
to get a glass of brandy.

176
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,151
And you, you disappeared for a bit.

177
00:15:14,153 --> 00:15:17,159
To fetch my bag
so that I could attend to... Vera!

178
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:19,127
We didn't hear the shot.

179
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:21,103
You could have muffled it
with a cushion.

180
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:22,183
Well, we'll have to
take your word for it.

181
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:26,099
I've never shot a man in the head.
That's more your field of expertise.

182
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:28,155
How would I have had the time
to go downstairs,

183
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:30,095
grab a bottle of brandy,

184
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,091
quickly put a slug in Wargrave,
making sure that nobody heard him,

185
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:35,159
dress him up and make it back
upstairs again?

186
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:37,103
Tubs here was away for longer.

187
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:39,095
I'm not as quick on my feet as you.

188
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:41,131
"Five little soldier boys
going in for law

189
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:44,143
"One got Chancery
and then there were four."

190
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:47,107
One by one

191
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:48,175
and in a particular way.

192
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:50,123
And where's my gun?

193
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,145
- Don't bloody look at me!
- Or me!

194
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:26,093
I can't stand the sound of
that wind.

195
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:29,177
I can't stand it!

196
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:33,121
I'm not just going to sit here
and wait to die!

197
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:47,169
In the war, do this all the time!

198
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:52,127
And stay awake!

199
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:56,119
Bodies, bodies, bodies, bodies!

200
00:16:56,121 --> 00:16:59,163
Bones, blood, skulls!

201
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:02,127
Just this... this... this... this
parade!

202
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:06,143
Endless parade of
shattered... shattered meats!

203
00:17:06,145 --> 00:17:11,099
Just standing there,
cutting off legs and arms

204
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:15,157
and... guts everywhere
and bodies and screaming!

205
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:27,141
Ladies and gentlemen, silence,
please!

206
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:32,159
You are charged with
the following indictments...

207
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:34,135
Edward George Armstrong...

208
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,155
That's me!

209
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:39,143
...William Henry Blore.

210
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:40,179
Yeah, that's me!

211
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:43,143
...that you did murder
James Steven Landor.

212
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,143
Well...

213
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:47,179
Vera Elizabeth Claythorne...

214
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:50,155
The smell! And the noise, the noise,
the noise...!

215
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:05,131
Prisoners at the bar,
how do you plead?

216
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:07,129
Guilty!

217
00:18:10,181 --> 00:18:13,093
What are you laughing at?

218
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,139
(Blore? Watch them!)

219
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,129
Watch them!

220
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:09,167
You stick with me, Vera.

221
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:11,141
We're going to get through this.

222
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:16,113
I have no intention
of getting killed.

223
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:23,125
Death... is for other people,
not for us.

224
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:30,167
(You see? Look at them.)

225
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,157
(Together. Perhaps it's them.)

226
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,181
Mr and Mrs Owen.

227
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:41,107
It's them!

228
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:42,175
It's them!

229
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:44,133
It's them!

230
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,189
Fine!

231
00:19:50,177 --> 00:19:54,091
Why am I wearing this fucking hat?!

232
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:55,129
I'm going to bed.

233
00:19:57,093 --> 00:19:58,121
This party's over.

234
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:17,139
'Now, look here, sunshine,
you've been pinched.

235
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:19,171
'And we know what for.

236
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:24,147
'Lurking about in a gentleman's
public convenience, in the bogs.'

237
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:27,131
What am I, born yesterday?

238
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:29,159
Now, you're lucky you got me.

239
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:32,157
Not some other copper.
He might've been a bit heavy-handed.

240
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:37,127
I mean, look at you,
there's nothing of you!

241
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:39,093
You're soft.

242
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,165
Eh? Like a peach, or something.

243
00:22:44,185 --> 00:22:46,137
You'd be mush in a moment.

244
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:50,151
So go on.

245
00:22:50,153 --> 00:22:52,133
On your way.

246
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:58,155
Let this be a lesson to you,
all right? Be more discreet.

247
00:22:58,157 --> 00:23:00,143
You don't want to end up getting
a bloody nose

248
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,091
or doing a stretch inside

249
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:04,151
because it's no fun for you lot
in the nick.

250
00:23:04,153 --> 00:23:06,109
Go on, scarper.

251
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,105
Thank you.

252
00:23:16,157 --> 00:23:18,169
That's what I should've done, innit?

253
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,097
That's what I should've done.

254
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:25,189
But I didn't.

255
00:24:24,105 --> 00:24:25,187
Bastard!

256
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:30,143
(Lombard! Lombard!)

257
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:32,111
Lombard! Lombard!

258
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,181
(Ed?!)

259
00:24:39,117 --> 00:24:41,091
What is it?

260
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:43,135
It's him. It is Armstrong!

261
00:24:43,137 --> 00:24:45,109
(He's left the house, I saw him.)

262
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:50,115
Lock your door, Vera,
and put a chair against it.

263
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:29,105
How are you?

264
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:32,115
How is Mrs Hamilton?

265
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:34,131
I'm taking her to London.

266
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,111
She can't stay here.

267
00:25:36,113 --> 00:25:37,141
Of course.

268
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:43,175
She, um... wants to give you
three months' pay in lieu of notice

269
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:46,187
because, obviously,
you cannot be a governess

270
00:25:46,189 --> 00:25:48,177
when there is no child to govern.

271
00:25:50,189 --> 00:25:55,093
If Mrs Hamilton is in London,
I can look after the house.

272
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:59,131
Even if I'm not governess,
I can still look after the house.

273
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:00,183
As a friend.

274
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,153
I'm locking the house up.

275
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:05,101
I imagine it might be sold.

276
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:08,133
But it's yours now.

277
00:26:14,185 --> 00:26:17,097
I will have to find somewhere
to stay.

278
00:26:18,145 --> 00:26:19,181
I'll find a nice hotel.

279
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:23,119
For when you come down.

280
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:25,151
Perhaps I'll find us
a little cottage.

281
00:26:25,153 --> 00:26:27,093
I have to be with Olivia.

282
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:30,121
She's really rather unwell.

283
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:32,185
There will be an inquest.

284
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:38,099
They want it to be quite soon,
so you'll be needed.

285
00:26:38,101 --> 00:26:39,185
Of course.

286
00:26:41,093 --> 00:26:42,293
And you'll come down for that?

287
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:46,141
I have to go.

288
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:50,165
Poor little Cyril.

289
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:57,145
Poor little Cyril.

290
00:27:21,101 --> 00:27:23,093
Vera? It's us.

291
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,115
It was just on your bed.

292
00:28:01,117 --> 00:28:04,171
It was just... on my bed.

293
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:07,119
Well, how do I know you didn't plant
it in there last night?

294
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:09,183
If Philip had the gun before now,
he would have taken it with you

295
00:28:09,185 --> 00:28:11,171
when you went after
Armstrong, wouldn't he?

296
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:13,183
You could have crept out
of your room and planted it.

297
00:28:13,185 --> 00:28:15,159
There was no-one around here
to hear you.

298
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,175
I had my door locked
in case Armstrong came back.

299
00:28:17,177 --> 00:28:21,143
Armstrong's disappeared. Thin air.

300
00:28:21,145 --> 00:28:25,111
We split up when we went searching
last night, didn't we?

301
00:28:25,113 --> 00:28:27,151
- Yes, we did.
- Did you find him?

302
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:29,115
Did you chuck him off the cliff?

303
00:28:29,117 --> 00:28:31,123
No, Tubs, I didn't find him

304
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:34,093
and chuck him off the cliff.
- Did you? - No!

305
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:36,155
No.

306
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:38,109
Red herring.

307
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:40,151
What?

308
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:43,167
"Four little soldier boys
going out to sea

309
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:47,131
"A red herring swallowed one
and then there were three."

310
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:49,107
Red herring.

311
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:50,143
Armstrong's still alive.

312
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,133
Why's it always you
that works it out?

313
00:28:55,145 --> 00:28:58,115
Has been from the off, innit?

314
00:28:58,117 --> 00:29:00,135
Working it out.

315
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:02,139
Armstrong said that and all.

316
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:05,107
It's been a long night.

317
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:09,131
You're letting the booze and powder
do the thinking for you, Tubs.

318
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:11,121
I've told you to stop calling me
that!

319
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:16,183
Your first name's William, isn't it?

320
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:18,187
Do you get Will, or...?

321
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:22,101
Bill. I get Bill.

322
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:25,115
Well, Bill,

323
00:29:25,117 --> 00:29:27,159
whose idea was it to put music on,

324
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:31,105
to get drunk so we'd all pass out
and not hear anything?

325
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:36,129
- Armstrong.
- And who did you first suspect?

326
00:29:38,105 --> 00:29:40,173
Who did you get the scent on,
right from the off?

327
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,161
(Armstrong.)

328
00:29:46,093 --> 00:29:47,119
Red herring.

329
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:50,147
He's been playing us off each other
from the start.

330
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:52,127
And he's still alive.

331
00:29:52,129 --> 00:29:56,123
Because people don't just vanish,
not on an island this size.

332
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,181
He's still alive.

333
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:04,165
I've got an allotment at home.

334
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:08,129
In Edmonton.

335
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:11,119
I love it.

336
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:14,097
It's my little patch of paradise.

337
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:19,137
That's the best thing in the world,
just sitting there, watching it all.

338
00:30:21,093 --> 00:30:22,167
Growing away.

339
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:24,159
Hm!

340
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:29,101
Cup of tea from the flask and a bit
of bread and a bit of cheese and...

341
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:34,157
...radish that you pulled
from the ground a moment before.

342
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:37,149
Great, big, peppery radish.

343
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:44,129
Simple things.

344
00:30:46,117 --> 00:30:47,145
Good things.

345
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:56,117
I wish I'd chucked that letter
from Ulick Norman Owen in the bin!

346
00:30:58,141 --> 00:31:00,143
And it serves me right,

347
00:31:00,145 --> 00:31:04,159
trying to earn... a bit of cash
on the sly.

348
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:06,121
It serves us all right.

349
00:31:11,117 --> 00:31:13,151
Are we dead already?

350
00:31:13,153 --> 00:31:15,131
What?

351
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:19,173
Perhaps we're dead already
and we just don't realise it.

352
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:22,145
And this is hell.

353
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:25,143
We're in hell.

354
00:31:25,145 --> 00:31:28,141
And we're being punished
for what we done.

355
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:32,177
Because I did kill him.

356
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:36,157
Landor.

357
00:31:38,185 --> 00:31:41,109
I stomped him till he was pulp.

358
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:45,159
His own mother couldn't see him.

359
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:47,141
Couldn't say goodbye.

360
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,097
I murdered him, all right.

361
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:58,093
He was helpless and I didn't stop.

362
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:01,297
He must've been so frightened.

363
00:32:03,097 --> 00:32:05,183
Just... just a young lad.

364
00:32:09,153 --> 00:32:12,171
I've got a tomato crop that's got to
be harvested. Who's going to do it?

365
00:32:12,173 --> 00:32:15,159
What's going to happen to
my allotment?

366
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:18,119
Hey. Hey, come on, Tubs.

367
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:19,153
We're not done yet.

368
00:32:20,177 --> 00:32:23,143
It's us three against him.
We can hold our own.

369
00:32:23,145 --> 00:32:26,155
And someone has to come for us soon.
They... they have to.

370
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:28,135
Mm-hm. That's the spirit.

371
00:32:28,137 --> 00:32:30,159
Who's going to come for us?

372
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:34,141
That Narracott never turned up
when he was supposed to.

373
00:32:35,177 --> 00:32:37,135
Reckon he was paid off.

374
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:39,107
We light a fire.

375
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:41,179
On the cliff.
Someone's bound to see it.

376
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:44,115
OK. We're going to need supplies.

377
00:32:44,117 --> 00:32:46,167
I don't want to spend another night
in this house, do you?

378
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:49,105
(I reckon we're being watched.)

379
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:54,145
We are.

380
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:22,181
Let's go.

381
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:26,117
Come on, Tubs, let's go!

382
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:18,101
Where is he?!

383
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:26,165
Stay here.

384
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:29,125
Don't follow me!

385
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:07,165
Oh!

386
00:35:17,137 --> 00:35:21,167
"Three little soldier boys
walking in the zoo

387
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:24,145
"A big bear hugged one
and then there were two."

388
00:35:26,117 --> 00:35:27,141
Poor Tubs.

389
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:30,153
Poor Tubs.

390
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:11,125
The tide's changing!

391
00:36:15,157 --> 00:36:17,093
Philip?

392
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:19,179
Philip!

393
00:36:19,181 --> 00:36:21,141
There's something down there.

394
00:37:21,149 --> 00:37:23,105
Armstrong.

395
00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:41,103
- Come on!
- Where?

396
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:42,137
Not here.

397
00:37:43,153 --> 00:37:45,103
I need to find a better view.

398
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:48,139
No, no, no. We... we can't leave him
like this.

399
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,175
It's not right. We can't leave him!

400
00:37:50,177 --> 00:37:52,095
Yes, we can.

401
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:55,103
No, when the boat comes, Philip,
they'll see him like this

402
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:57,175
and we haven't done the decent,
the... the right thing.

403
00:37:57,177 --> 00:37:59,181
How will it look for us?

404
00:38:01,097 --> 00:38:02,113
Please!

405
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:04,177
Please!

406
00:38:20,121 --> 00:38:21,173
Argh!

407
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:35,163
It's you!

408
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:38,111
It's you! It's all you, all of it!

409
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:39,183
Give me the gun.

410
00:38:39,185 --> 00:38:41,151
You're going to kill me!

411
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:46,151
No! No, I'm not going to kill you,
Vera.

412
00:38:46,153 --> 00:38:49,163
- But there's somebody else on
this island... - No, there's no-one else!

413
00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:53,131
There's somebody on this island
and they're going to kill us both
if you don't give me that gun.

414
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,143
There's no-one else,
you've killed them all!

415
00:38:55,145 --> 00:38:57,139
Listen to me, we're being hunted!

416
00:38:57,141 --> 00:38:59,125
Right now, we're being hunted!

417
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:02,177
I need the gun!

418
00:39:05,157 --> 00:39:06,189
Give it to me.

419
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:11,181
Vera?

420
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:19,133
Give me the gun.

421
00:39:22,189 --> 00:39:24,149
Give me the gun, Vera.

422
00:39:36,149 --> 00:39:38,117
Ah!

423
00:40:14,185 --> 00:40:19,101
'I promised him a game of bat
and ball after our lessons.'

424
00:40:20,153 --> 00:40:23,109
A reward for being so good.

425
00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:27,135
He wanted to swim.

426
00:40:27,137 --> 00:40:29,117
He always wanted to swim.

427
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:31,157
But I said no.

428
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:36,189
I went to get the bat and ball
for our game...

429
00:40:37,189 --> 00:40:39,157
...and he was gone.

430
00:40:40,177 --> 00:40:42,147
I ran after him.

431
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,137
I ran as fast as I could.

432
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:48,127
If only I hadn't turned away
for a minute,

433
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:50,249
but it was only a minute
while I got the bat and ball.

434
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:54,093
(If only...)

435
00:41:07,129 --> 00:41:10,165
(Thank you.
Thank you for trying to save him.)

436
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:16,185
Oh, God! Oh, God!

437
00:41:28,149 --> 00:41:30,109
You know, before, I wasn't sure.

438
00:41:33,129 --> 00:41:35,091
But I am sure now.

439
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,147
Watching you, hearing you speak.

440
00:41:37,149 --> 00:41:39,097
Now I'm sure.

441
00:41:40,157 --> 00:41:42,161
- What are you sure of?
- That you're lying.

442
00:41:45,157 --> 00:41:48,155
You couldn't catch up with... Cyril?

443
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:51,163
I've seen you run, Vera.

444
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:54,143
You're fast. You're strong.
You sprint.

445
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:57,163
You turn your back for a moment and
you couldn't catch up with Cyril?

446
00:41:57,165 --> 00:42:00,151
- Hugo, you can't think this...
- I know why you did it.

447
00:42:00,153 --> 00:42:03,171
But what you don't understand is
that I really loved that little boy.

448
00:42:03,173 --> 00:42:06,157
(So did I. And I love you.)

449
00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:11,187
(I can't prove it.
I can't prove a thing.

450
00:42:11,189 --> 00:42:17,109
(Oh, but, Vera, if I did have
proof... I'd see you hang.)

451
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:30,181
Cyril?

452
00:43:21,117 --> 00:43:22,181
Now...

453
00:43:25,105 --> 00:43:27,346
...you're strong enough
to swim to that rock, aren't you?

454
00:43:28,153 --> 00:43:31,097
You're strong enough. Excited?

455
00:43:32,145 --> 00:43:37,153
OK. On your marks, get set, go!

456
00:44:40,113 --> 00:44:42,093
Nearly there!

457
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:48,177
Hold on!

458
00:44:52,113 --> 00:44:56,101
Don't worry. I've got you.
I've got you.

459
00:48:18,169 --> 00:48:20,149
Hugo?

460
00:48:21,153 --> 00:48:23,101
Hugo?

461
00:48:40,149 --> 00:48:43,097
"Two little soldier boys
sitting in the sun...

462
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:48,177
"One got frizzled up
and then there was one.

463
00:48:52,101 --> 00:48:54,133
"One little soldier boy
left all alone...

464
00:48:56,113 --> 00:49:00,129
"He went and hanged himself
and then there were none."

465
00:49:03,181 --> 00:49:06,135
You wondering about that...?

466
00:49:08,129 --> 00:49:09,189
Liver and kidneys.

467
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:13,179
You all believed the doctor
when he said I was dead.

468
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:16,147
- None of you checked.
- I need to get down!

469
00:49:16,149 --> 00:49:19,137
Armstrong made it so much easier.

470
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,189
He was very keen
to forge an alliance.

471
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:26,175
I don't know what he thought
was going to happen

472
00:49:26,177 --> 00:49:28,175
when he ran out into the night
to meet me.

473
00:49:28,177 --> 00:49:30,161
Perhaps that I was
going to save him.

474
00:49:32,141 --> 00:49:34,165
I lied about the success
of my surgery.

475
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:40,163
The mass, the tumour is spreading.

476
00:49:40,165 --> 00:49:44,183
There's nothing to be done
but await the inevitable.

477
00:49:44,185 --> 00:49:47,149
It's quite extraordinarily painful.

478
00:49:50,093 --> 00:49:52,179
Well... not long now, though, hm?

479
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:54,143
Why are you doing this?

480
00:49:54,145 --> 00:49:56,149
Because justice comes to all.

481
00:49:58,157 --> 00:50:00,145
I told you that,
were you not listening?

482
00:50:01,157 --> 00:50:03,187
The evidence that led me to convict
Edward Seton

483
00:50:03,189 --> 00:50:06,161
was considered too terrible
to be made public.

484
00:50:09,113 --> 00:50:11,093
It was the stuff of nightmares.

485
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,137
Really.

486
00:50:15,101 --> 00:50:17,101
And where others were revolted...

487
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:22,141
...Miss Claythorne, I was fascinated.

488
00:50:25,133 --> 00:50:27,167
And when Seton looked into my eyes,

489
00:50:27,169 --> 00:50:29,157
he could see that I was thrilled.

490
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:33,161
He knew that I was a kindred spirit.

491
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,161
And when his neck snapped...

492
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:41,187
...I felt as if I'd been handed
a gift.

493
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:44,119
No. No!

494
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:46,179
You don't mean any of this.

495
00:50:46,181 --> 00:50:50,115
You are a good man. Moral.

496
00:50:50,117 --> 00:50:52,131
Moral?

497
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:57,111
Maybe there's something in that.

498
00:50:57,113 --> 00:51:00,093
There are differences
between Seton and myself.

499
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:03,105
All his victims were innocent.

500
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:06,181
You are all guilty.

501
00:51:08,189 --> 00:51:10,143
Now, imagine.

502
00:51:10,145 --> 00:51:14,107
The detectives arrive to find
a house full of slaughter

503
00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:17,173
and the handiwork of UN Owen
everywhere.

504
00:51:19,173 --> 00:51:23,171
But UN Owen himself
is nowhere to be seen.

505
00:51:23,173 --> 00:51:26,095
But who else could have fired
the final shot

506
00:51:26,097 --> 00:51:29,101
that ended the life
of the unimpeachable judge?

507
00:51:32,113 --> 00:51:34,133
Ten bodies and no murderer.

508
00:51:36,113 --> 00:51:38,103
How could he have disappeared?

509
00:51:41,093 --> 00:51:43,157
It's so unfathomable.

510
00:51:45,137 --> 00:51:47,165
They'll be worrying about it
for years.

511
00:51:49,121 --> 00:51:51,171
No! No, wait!

512
00:51:51,173 --> 00:51:56,095
There's... there's no... there's
no more bullets!

513
00:51:56,097 --> 00:51:58,143
There... there can be no final shot

514
00:51:58,145 --> 00:52:01,091
because the gun is empty.

515
00:52:01,093 --> 00:52:02,177
There are no more bullets.

516
00:52:04,097 --> 00:52:06,115
Damn!

517
00:52:06,117 --> 00:52:08,131
That's all spoiled.

518
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:09,159
No, it's not spoiled.

519
00:52:09,161 --> 00:52:12,143
Yes, it is. There are corpses
everywhere and only me left.

520
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:15,091
No, not just you. There's me!

521
00:52:15,093 --> 00:52:18,153
The two of us, together.

522
00:52:20,117 --> 00:52:21,183
We'll... we'll say it was Philip.

523
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:23,155
That he was mad.

524
00:52:23,157 --> 00:52:26,135
Oh, he was quite the sanest
of the lot, I thought.

525
00:52:26,137 --> 00:52:28,135
He was insane.

526
00:52:28,137 --> 00:52:31,181
He... he killed us all
and I shot him.

527
00:52:33,113 --> 00:52:35,133
I shot him to defend us.

528
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:38,179
It was all Philip Lombard.

529
00:52:38,181 --> 00:52:40,127
Huh! Hm!

530
00:52:40,129 --> 00:52:42,131
You took him as your lover.

531
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:44,131
Yes.

532
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:47,139
- Got his blood on your feet.
- Self-defence!

533
00:52:47,141 --> 00:52:49,109
(We'll say that.)

534
00:52:51,117 --> 00:52:53,165
We'll say that. They'll believe us.

535
00:52:54,165 --> 00:52:56,137
They believed me last time.

536
00:53:02,129 --> 00:53:05,109
What a beguiling woman you are,
Miss Claythorne.

537
00:53:06,169 --> 00:53:08,093
Vera.

538
00:53:11,093 --> 00:53:13,117
Quite my favourite, really.

539
00:53:14,185 --> 00:53:16,173
There's no final bullet, Judge.

540
00:53:18,101 --> 00:53:19,125
But I can save us both.

541
00:53:21,153 --> 00:53:24,189
I'll keep your secret
and I'll save us both.

542
00:53:26,157 --> 00:53:29,097
Just let me down. Please!

543
00:53:46,129 --> 00:53:48,125
You forgot the one that shot me.

544
00:53:49,305 --> 00:54:49,397

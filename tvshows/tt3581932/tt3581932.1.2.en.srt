1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,550
Previosly

2
00:00:01,608 --> 00:00:04,386
Mrs Owen is expecting
a lot of guests. She chose you.

3
00:00:04,388 --> 00:00:06,082
Welcome to Soldier Island.

4
00:00:06,084 --> 00:00:08,022
Mr Lombard.

5
00:00:08,024 --> 00:00:11,058
You seem to be under the impression
that I am a particular kind of woman.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,018
I assure you that I'm not.

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,038
They're the ten little soldiers.
You know, from the poem.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,006
- 'Ladies and gentlemen!'
- Who is that?

9
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:21,062
'You are charged with
the following indictments!

10
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:25,006
'Philip Lombard,
that you did murder 21 men.'

11
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:27,070
What the hell are they playing at?

12
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:28,998
Malicious nonsense.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,054
Cyril, I really tried to save him.

14
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:33,002
I almost drowned.

15
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:34,054
21 men?

16
00:00:34,056 --> 00:00:37,018
I am the only one telling
the truth in a room full of liars.

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,000
Who is it?

18
00:00:40,044 --> 00:00:42,090
We are cut off.

19
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:44,094
Rats in a barrel.

20
00:00:44,096 --> 00:00:46,010
Almonds.

21
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,014
Almonds be buggered.

22
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:49,060
Cyanide.

23

24
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:02,270
None of you moved them?

25
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:04,278
No. No.

26
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:06,294
Was it you, Doctor?

27
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,298
No.

28
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,278
How did Mrs Rogers die?

29
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:17,268
I have no idea.

30
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,252
Did you give her something?

31
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:20,324
Yes, a mild sedative.

32
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:22,280
Did you give her too much?

33
00:02:22,282 --> 00:02:26,276
Miss Claythorne, I warned
you against becoming hysterical.

34
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:27,316
It's the poem.

35
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:29,336
It's the poem, don't you see?

36
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:32,304
Ten little soldier boys.
One choked himself,

37
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:35,256
one overslept himself
and then there were eight!

38
00:02:35,258 --> 00:02:38,286
There were ten of these and ten of us
and now there's eight.

39
00:02:40,262 --> 00:02:43,256
Oh, General. General, did you
move the figures?

40
00:02:43,258 --> 00:02:45,344
- What? - The figures. Did
you move the figures?

41
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:47,284
No, course not.

42
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:49,284
Perhaps it was you, Miss Claythorne.

43
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:50,324
You discovered it.

44
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:52,312
Course it wasn't me.
Why would I do that?

45
00:02:52,314 --> 00:02:55,316
To be the centre of attention?
Do you crave attention, Miss Claythorne?

46
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:57,344
- Any kind of attention?
- What are you talking about?

47
00:02:57,346 --> 00:02:59,318
Shall we just have breakfast?

48
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:08,260
It was dreadful news about
Mrs Rogers.

49
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:10,268
She was a wonderful cook.

50
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,294
Such a shame.

51
00:03:12,338 --> 00:03:16,270
Er, this egg is four
minutes precisely, is it?

52
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,308
Yes, madam.

53
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,292
Rogers, did you take away
two of these figures?

54
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:25,340
No, miss.

55
00:03:25,342 --> 00:03:29,328
Condolences, Mr Rogers.
When are you expecting Narracott?

56
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,286
Mid to late morning, sir. His
timekeeping is somewhat erratic.

57
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:36,280
Will that be all?

58
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,322
Yes. Thank you, Rogers.
Thank you very much.

59
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:43,280
Tony Marston was young and strong.

60
00:03:43,282 --> 00:03:46,288
He didn't die from some stimulant.

61
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,312
Perhaps he was poisoned.

62
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:51,260
And Mrs Rogers, perhaps
she was given too much.

63
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:54,268
What drugs do you
have in your medical bag, Doctor?

64
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,308
Why did you even bring it?

65
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,260
You are a guest, it's not work.

66
00:03:58,262 --> 00:03:59,282
Actually, it is work.

67
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,256
I was trying to maintain some
sort of professional discretion.

68
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:05,324
However,

69
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:08,332
Mrs Owen suffers from female
neuroses.

70
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:11,294
My speciality is women's disorders.

71
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:15,252
Mr Owen engaged me in a
professional capacity

72
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:18,328
- to tend to his wife.
- Gave up on the surgery, then, Doctor?

73
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,316
People do not just die
out of nowhere for no reason!

74
00:04:21,318 --> 00:04:25,296
They die because something was done
to them by someone!

75
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,272
- I'm going to check your bag.
- Don't you dare touch my possessions!

76
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:31,304
- What have you got to hide?
- How about I do it?

77
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:33,328
I'm not being searched like some
grubby criminal!

78
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,320
Then what if the General goes
with him?

79
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:38,292
He's an honourable man!

80
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:41,328
Fine! But while you're at it, you
might want to search

81
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,860
Judge Wargrave's case as well.

82
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:45,310
I know where I've seen you before.

83
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:49,268
Chap who has the clinic beneath mine
in Harley Street,

84
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,296
he's a cancer specialist.

85
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:51,340
That's where I saw you.

86
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:54,344
If anyone has strong painkillers
and sedatives in his case,

87
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:56,274
it's Judge Wargrave.

88
00:04:58,294 --> 00:04:59,326
Is that true, Judge?

89
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:03,258
I have had health problems, yes.

90
00:05:04,074 --> 00:05:07,316
- Then that's very cruel, Doctor.
- Don't blame me. You pushed it.

91
00:05:07,318 --> 00:05:09,290
General, shall we?

92
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:20,318
Just mild sedatives.

93
00:05:21,326 --> 00:05:23,288
As I said.

94
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,336
Bog-standard. Nothing special.

95
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:28,302
My surgery was a success.

96
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:33,252
This - the house, the island -

97
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:35,304
is meant to be my recuperation.

98
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:37,280
Sea air,

99
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:39,296
peace,

100
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,320
and rest.

101
00:05:41,322 --> 00:05:44,262
Very sorry. I'm very sorry.

102
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:49,308
- Well, there's an end to it.
- Like hell it is.

103
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,290
Why shouldn't she be searched?

104
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,252
Equal rights for women.

105
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:57,344
Let's see what you've got.

106
00:05:57,346 --> 00:06:00,346
Doctor Armstrong,
control yourself, please.

107
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,332
Who the hell do you think you are?

108
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:11,342
I'm a doctor.
You're a secretary.

109
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,274
Somebody moved them.

110
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:23,312
They did.

111
00:06:23,314 --> 00:06:24,346
Someone did that.

112
00:06:51,282 --> 00:06:53,314
Did you really kill all those men?

113
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:59,262
Yes, Miss Claythorne.
I did kill all those men.

114
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:02,316
And more.

115
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:04,296
Why?

116
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,338
It seemed like a good
idea at the time.

117
00:07:08,306 --> 00:07:12,274
They had something I wanted.
In this case, it was diamonds.

118
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,256
Worth more than a few lives.

119
00:07:16,258 --> 00:07:17,298
What about you?

120
00:07:22,286 --> 00:07:23,310
What did you want?

121
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:27,278
I nearly drowned.

122
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:31,340
I failed to save a little
boy in my care.

123
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:34,346
And there isn't one minute of every
day that I'm not sorry for that.

124
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:38,320
Why aren't you?

125
00:07:38,322 --> 00:07:39,342
I know what I am.

126
00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:43,318
I always knew it would
catch up with me.

127
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,294
And here it is.

128
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,324
"I love you, I love you,
I love you.

129
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:55,252
"I think about you and you kissing
me, and your hands on me and in me,

130
00:08:55,254 --> 00:08:57,272
"and your mouth on my body and I
cannot bear

131
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:59,332
"that you are not with me now.

132
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:04,276
"I wish, I long, I crave for you, my
darling,

133
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:08,260
"and I feel so cruel to poor, dear
John.

134
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:11,332
"The sun rises and sets in your eyes,
Henry.

135
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:13,262
"I love you. I love you.

136
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:16,318
"I am yours."

137
00:09:17,342 --> 00:09:20,276
The men are all ready for the
whistle, sir.

138
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:21,310
Morale, fairly good.

139
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:33,318
Here. Er, let me.

140
00:09:39,334 --> 00:09:41,294
Henry.

141
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:48,332
You've been a great friend

142
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:51,262
to my wife and I.

143
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,294
Perhaps you could call me John?

144
00:10:04,314 --> 00:10:06,334
Thank you, John.

145
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,300
Myself and Mrs Rogers were here for
a week without seeing another soul

146
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:29,250
apart from Narracott with
the delivery, sir.

147
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:36,276
Lombard.

148
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:38,256
Where are you going?

149
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:41,304
We're sat around waiting for Ulick
Norman Owen.

150
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:43,322
What if he's been here all along?

151
00:10:45,298 --> 00:10:47,306
Plenty of places he could be hiding.

152
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,326
Wait for me.

153
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:27,248
Please, please, please,
just fucking stop. Stop.

154
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,276
Stop, stop,

155
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,278
stop, stop...

156
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:48,342
This is barmy!

157
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:52,298
No-one could hide down there.

158
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:04,320
Ever get the feeling you're
being hunted, Tubs?

159
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:07,300
Stop calling me that.
I ain't even fat.

160
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:09,300
And, no, I don't.

161
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:11,254
Really?

162
00:12:12,262 --> 00:12:16,272
Cos Mr Owen, whoever he may be,

163
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:17,336
knows a lot about us.

164
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:19,292
Well, not about me.

165
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:22,336
Edward Landor was a degenerate.
He was a pansy.

166
00:12:22,338 --> 00:12:25,262
He fell down the steps
into his cell.

167
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:36,278
You never touched him?

168
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,290
I wouldn't want to be near one of
them dirty bastards.

169
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,298
Come on, Tubs, keep up.

170
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,304
General?

171
00:13:00,306 --> 00:13:02,282
Is your suitcase ready?

172
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,318
She died.

173
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,324
Of Spanish influenza, after the war.

174
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:14,300
Who?

175
00:13:14,302 --> 00:13:17,264
My wife Lesley.

176
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:19,332
After all that,

177
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:21,294
she died of the Spanish flu.

178
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,260
So many did.

179
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:33,272
I should've just stepped
aside like a gentleman and...

180
00:13:33,274 --> 00:13:35,258
just let them be happy.

181
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:41,276
Do come back to the house, General.

182
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,332
You haven't brought your case down
yet

183
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:46,266
and we want to get away as soon as
Mr Narracott arrives.

184
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:52,268
He's not coming, Narracott, you know.

185
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,300
No-one's coming for us.

186
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:57,270
We won't be leaving the island.
This is the end.

187
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:04,340
It's a relief to come to the end,
to know that it's over.

188
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:07,316
You won't understand that yet
but you will...

189
00:14:07,318 --> 00:14:09,266
in time.

190
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:14,292
I think you're quite mistaken.

191
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:17,302
The boat will come and we'll all be
waiting for you.

192
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,256
Ah, Miss Claythorne.

193
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:16,276
Good.

194
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:18,286
Bring a couple of chairs, would you?

195
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,284
What's going on?

196
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:32,268
It's a bit early to be on the sauce.

197
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,300
It's been something of a morning.

198
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:36,298
Hey. Hey, sh!

199
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:43,248
Bastard's down there. I heard him.

200
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,252
What bastard?

201
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:46,304
Owen.

202
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:49,280
I can hear him moving about.

203
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,274
Marston's room.

204
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:17,262
What are you doing?

205
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:25,272
Camp bed.

206
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:28,256
We had to find somewhere to
store it and...

207
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:31,316
- young men don't look under beds.
- But what do you need a camp bed for?

208
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:33,280
What were you planning?

209
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:35,316
Well, I can't sleep in my room,
can I?

210
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:37,256
Me wife.

211
00:16:37,258 --> 00:16:40,260
Yeah, obviously. Of course.

212
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:43,328
- I've got to find somewhere else to
set up. - What for? We're all leaving.

213
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,276
Well, you might be. This is my job.

214
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:49,268
I can't go anywhere
until my employer dismisses me.

215
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,336
Your employer? Your employer is
insane.

216
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:54,314
Be that as it may, I've got nothing
else to go to.

217
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:59,302
All right, then. Carry on, Rogers.

218
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,288
Did you know he had a gun?

219
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,346
No.

220
00:17:23,262 --> 00:17:28,262
Do stop. Mr Narracott seems
a sensible man. He'll be here.

221
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,268
I must say, I understand now

222
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,298
why you teach in such a substandard
establishment.

223
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:43,276
I'm just observing that most schools
would not want to be

224
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:45,272
associated with an inquest.

225
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:48,328
I'm not accusing you. There's been
quite enough of that already.

226
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,288
Yes, there has. More than enough.

227
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,340
Apart from the egregious Mr Lombard,

228
00:17:53,342 --> 00:17:59,296
Rogers, who I find most dubious,
and the depraved Mr Marston,

229
00:17:59,298 --> 00:18:01,316
it's all nonsense.

230
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:03,346
Everyone was simply doing their
duty.

231
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,280
As was I.

232
00:18:07,282 --> 00:18:09,260
As were you?

233
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:12,252
You didn't say anything last night?

234
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:14,264
It wasn't for gentlemen's ears.

235
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:16,346
But Beatrice Taylor
was my maid of all work.

236
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:20,312
Foundling girl.

237
00:18:20,314 --> 00:18:22,324
An unwanted,

238
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:25,338
from the war, you know?

239
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:32,272
I believed her to be a clean,
decent, modest girl.

240
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:34,300
I taught her needlework skills.

241
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:36,282
We had quite the little home.

242
00:19:00,294 --> 00:19:03,280
But then she got
herself into trouble.

243
00:19:03,282 --> 00:19:05,250
The family way.

244
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,254
As her own loose mother had with
her.

245
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:14,256
She begged me for help.

246
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:17,282
Naturally, and quite properly,
I refused.

247
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:25,278
Miss Brent, please!

248
00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:31,326
I beg you!

249
00:19:34,254 --> 00:19:35,304
What happened to her?

250
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:37,296
She threw herself under a train.

251
00:19:37,298 --> 00:19:39,252
She killed herself?

252
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:41,316
Even made the local paper.

253
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:45,320
And they turned it into some
pot-boiling sentimental tale.

254
00:19:45,322 --> 00:19:47,332
She asked you for help.

255
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:49,304
If you had helped her...

256
00:19:49,306 --> 00:19:52,328
It was the weakness in her character
which drove her actions.

257
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,302
Why should I be reproached?

258
00:19:58,334 --> 00:20:00,310
Ask Rogers for some tea.

259
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,318
Lemon, not milk.

260
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,328
It's a wild goose chase,
if you ask me.

261
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,292
Grown man hiding and sneaking about.
It's ridiculous.

262
00:20:18,294 --> 00:20:21,304
Marston was given cyanide, though.

263
00:20:21,306 --> 00:20:24,328
- Wasn't he, Tubs?
- Cyanide?

264
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,254
I'm pretty sure of it.

265
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:31,274
I don't know... You were
convinced of it this morning.

266
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,268
Claythorne, for the cyanide.
I'd put money on it.

267
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,300
She don't seem the type.

268
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:40,264
No, she's exactly the type.

269
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:42,344
What about the old boy, the general?

270
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:45,312
Dangerous men come back, you know,
from over there,

271
00:20:45,314 --> 00:20:47,284
their noggins all scrambled.

272
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:49,308
Oh, well, let's search everybody,
then.

273
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,256
God-bothering Miss Brent... Let's
search Wargrave.

274
00:20:52,258 --> 00:20:53,336
What, the judge?

275
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:56,340
Well-known as a hanging judge.
He's infamous for the black square.

276
00:20:56,342 --> 00:21:00,316
The story goes that he'd watch every
execution he'd ordered.

277
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:04,292
Tubs, you've been looking
sideways at Armstrong all morning

278
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:07,260
and now everyone's fair game.

279
00:21:07,262 --> 00:21:08,336
You suggested the judge.

280
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:12,324
I was taking the piss.
Mr Owen is on the island.

281
00:21:12,326 --> 00:21:14,270
And I'm going to find him.

282
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:18,344
You don't want to pay attention
to what he said.

283
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:20,334
He's just stirring the shit pot.

284
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:24,298
Well, I can stir it right back.

285
00:22:56,254 --> 00:22:57,334
Don't look.

286
00:23:00,282 --> 00:23:02,284
Someone did this?

287
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:04,314
Well, it weren't no bleedin'
accident.

288
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,290
It's murder.

289
00:23:11,318 --> 00:23:13,306
He said no-one was coming for us.

290
00:23:14,322 --> 00:23:16,278
He said this was the end.

291
00:23:37,306 --> 00:23:39,344
Miss Claythorne.

292
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:42,316
Eight little soldier boys
travelling in Devon.

293
00:23:42,318 --> 00:23:45,306
One said he'd stay there
and then there were seven.

294
00:23:48,322 --> 00:23:51,264
Count them, Judge.

295
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:52,306
Count them.

296
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:12,286
Cyril!

297
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,324
Run!

298
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:19,324
Find help!

299
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:21,326
A boat! Run!

300
00:24:27,326 --> 00:24:29,316
Cyril!

301
00:24:29,318 --> 00:24:31,278
Cyril!

302
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:45,332
Miss Claythorne!

303
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,284
I just want to go!

304
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,346
You'll drown!

305
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,322
Please.

306
00:24:56,282 --> 00:24:58,320
Please.

307
00:24:58,322 --> 00:25:00,344
Come inside.

308
00:25:00,346 --> 00:25:02,318
Come, come.

309
00:25:04,258 --> 00:25:05,288
I've got you.

310
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,522
Don't worry, it's all right.

311
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,328
I told you Owen was on the island.

312
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,254
What made you so sure?

313
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:26,314
- Instinct. - We've got to be rational.
Stick with procedure.

314
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:29,252
Who is this Owen?

315
00:25:29,254 --> 00:25:30,300
And Mrs Owen?

316
00:25:30,302 --> 00:25:32,300
I don't think there even is
a Mrs Owen.

317
00:25:32,302 --> 00:25:34,312
We must all have something
in common,

318
00:25:34,314 --> 00:25:36,292
someone who knows us all.

319
00:25:36,294 --> 00:25:38,252
Well, how can that be possible?

320
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:41,288
I can imagine crossing paths with
a doctor...

321
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,304
a judge, but someone like Mr Lombard?

322
00:25:44,306 --> 00:25:47,294
Well, we've crossed
paths now. Haven't we?

323
00:25:48,322 --> 00:25:52,270
Mr Lombard, Blore tells me
that you have a revolver.

324
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:55,248
Oh, Tubs.

325
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,276
Why have you got a gun?

326
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:57,296
He's got a gun?

327
00:25:57,298 --> 00:25:59,268
I carry it everywhere.

328
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,306
And it was implied that
I might need it.

329
00:26:02,318 --> 00:26:04,298
Implied by whom?

330
00:26:06,286 --> 00:26:10,274
My client needs a good man who can
handle situations.

331
00:26:12,342 --> 00:26:14,268
Who's your client?

332
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,296
Mr Owen. Ulick Norman Owen.

333
00:26:17,298 --> 00:26:18,344
Never heard of him.

334
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:20,320
But he has heard of you.

335
00:26:20,322 --> 00:26:22,302
Audrey, the box.

336
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:46,272
It's dangerous, then.

337
00:26:46,274 --> 00:26:48,318
My client believes that it could
become volatile.

338
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,322
I see.

339
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,298
And how would Mr Owen
wish me to proceed?

340
00:26:56,342 --> 00:26:59,292
He leaves that to your discretion.

341
00:26:59,294 --> 00:27:01,276
But forewarned is...

342
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:02,282
...is fore-armed.

343
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,250
I understand.

344
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,276
That's who got in touch with me
about the job with Mrs Owen -

345
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:21,334
Isaac Morris in Soho.

346
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,306
Soho? Hmm.

347
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:31,252
I was invited here by the Owens,
whom I've never heard of,

348
00:27:31,254 --> 00:27:32,336
to join a mutual friend -

349
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:34,300
Mrs Culmington.

350
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:36,344
The perfect place
to recover, it said.

351
00:27:36,346 --> 00:27:39,338
The envelope was postmarked
London, Soho.

352
00:27:42,306 --> 00:27:47,278
A sink of depravity.
A godless desert of vice.

353
00:27:48,274 --> 00:27:50,300
What brings you here, Miss Brent?

354
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,308
Mrs Owen wrote to me.

355
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,258
She was interested in my work.

356
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,272
The moral education of girls
of the lower orders.

357
00:27:58,274 --> 00:28:00,324
They have to be taught modesty
and decency

358
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:05,256
or society will be drowned in a
rising tide of unwanted babies.

359
00:28:05,258 --> 00:28:06,302
All squalling to be fed.

360
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:10,344
She wanted to contribute
to my cause.

361
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:12,266
Blore?

362
00:28:13,286 --> 00:28:16,314
I got a letter.
From Ulick Norman Owen.

363
00:28:18,262 --> 00:28:21,256
He was impressed
by my standing in the force.

364
00:28:21,258 --> 00:28:24,328
He said if I could see my way clear
to spending some time,

365
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,308
keeping an eye out,
that he'd recompense me generously.

366
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,284
Keeping an eye out for what?

367
00:28:30,286 --> 00:28:32,340
He said that someone was here
under false pretences.

368
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:34,334
He also supplied a list of guests.

369
00:28:35,342 --> 00:28:37,332
All of you.

370
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:39,260
Everyone here.

371
00:28:39,262 --> 00:28:42,302
What he didn't say was that
Lombard would have a gun!

372
00:28:44,254 --> 00:28:47,300
Is it Mr Owen's voice on the record?
Does anybody recognise it?

373
00:28:47,302 --> 00:28:49,264
Are we forgetting
about the gun here?

374
00:28:49,266 --> 00:28:51,276
There's a Fenian sat over there
with a bloody gun!

375
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:53,304
- Don't blaspheme!
- Hand it over.

376
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:56,332
- Come on, surrender your weapon,
Mr Lombard! - Not a chance.

377
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,248
I could make you!

378
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,316
You can try.

379
00:28:59,318 --> 00:29:02,248
Is Isaac Morris Mr Owen?

380
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,260
No!

381
00:29:04,262 --> 00:29:06,336
I'd have found that sweaty
bucket of lard by now.

382
00:29:06,338 --> 00:29:11,314
Jews. Wherever there's a problem,
there's Jews at the bottom of it.

383
00:29:13,282 --> 00:29:16,248
Something struck me.

384
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,266
I can't think
why I didn't see it before.

385
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:22,260
Ulick Norman Owen.

386
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:25,248
Una Nancy Owen.

387
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,270
Or..

388
00:29:31,322 --> 00:29:32,326
...UN Owen...

389
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:36,306
...is UNKNOWN.

390
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:42,318
It's a riddle, perhaps.

391
00:29:43,318 --> 00:29:45,288
What does it mean?

392
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,340
It means that Mr Lombard
is right to insist

393
00:29:47,342 --> 00:29:49,330
that the killer is on the island.

394
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:53,256
And he's getting very wet out there.

395
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,276
The killer's not out there.

396
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:56,310
The killer is in here.

397
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,250
It is one of us.

398
00:30:06,322 --> 00:30:09,272
We've never
met each other before now, why...

399
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,344
How could I possibly be capable?

400
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:13,326
Oh, anyone is capable, Miss Brent.

401
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:17,340
40 years on the criminal bench
has taught me that.

402
00:30:17,342 --> 00:30:21,344
- Rogers. - Oh, here we go again.
Lining up the next suspect.

403
00:30:21,346 --> 00:30:24,276
You mark my words, Rogers.

404
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:25,316
He's an oily bugger.

405
00:30:25,318 --> 00:30:26,344
Slinking around.

406
00:30:26,346 --> 00:30:28,960
Going back and forth during dinner,

407
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:31,332
he would have had time to put
something into Mr Marston's drink.

408
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:33,344
I heard him tell Mrs Rogers to shut
up.

409
00:30:33,346 --> 00:30:36,272
Well, she's shut up now, isn't she?

410
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:38,260
He's the one moving the figures.

411
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:42,320
But the General, the rest of
us, that record, this house, why?

412
00:30:42,322 --> 00:30:46,248
Rogers has got low cunning running
though him

413
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,268
like Brighton through a stick of
rock. We need to watch him.

414
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:53,264
Any faith I ever
had in the Thin Blue Line evaporated

415
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:55,280
the second I met you, Tubs.

416
00:30:55,282 --> 00:30:58,286
- You call me that one more time mate,
one more time... - And you'll what?

417
00:31:02,302 --> 00:31:03,340
We...

418
00:31:03,342 --> 00:31:06,250
are all being hunted.

419
00:31:07,262 --> 00:31:09,336
There's someone else on this island

420
00:31:09,338 --> 00:31:12,336
and when I find him, I'm
going to make him number 22,

421
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:14,304
with a bullet right there.

422
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,328
Oh, God.

423
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,336
How can you say that... SO easily?

424
00:31:18,338 --> 00:31:21,302
I just open my mouth
and it comes out.

425
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:29,272
I'll see what can be done
about supper.

426
00:31:29,274 --> 00:31:31,304
There's some livers and kidneys.

427
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,270
Perhaps a pie with some good gravy.

428
00:31:35,338 --> 00:31:38,292
That would be delicious, Rogers.

429
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:40,256
Thank you.

430
00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:41,290
Thank you, Rogers.

431
00:31:45,302 --> 00:31:48,274
Well, I ain't eating
a mouthful of his pie.

432
00:32:30,294 --> 00:32:31,336
Oh. Well, goodnight.

433
00:32:35,342 --> 00:32:37,254
Trust in God.

434
00:32:38,306 --> 00:32:39,322
But perhaps also...

435
00:32:40,346 --> 00:32:42,306
...we should lock our doors.

436
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:12,268
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

437
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,308
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures,

438
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,296
he leadeth me besides the
still waters...

439
00:34:04,282 --> 00:34:08,316
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

440
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:11,338
Yay, though I walk through... the
valley of the shadow of death...

441
00:34:13,294 --> 00:34:17,254
...I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

442
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:31,292
I will fear no evil.

443
00:34:31,294 --> 00:34:33,284
I will fear no evil for thou art...

444
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:36,258
I will fear no evil,
thou art with me...

445
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,288
Get up!

446
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,338
Get up!

447
00:35:04,278 --> 00:35:05,280
Get up!

448
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:09,302
Get up!

449
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:15,260
I was looking for him.

450
00:35:16,266 --> 00:35:18,308
I wanted a coffee. I looked...

451
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,270
and I found this.

452
00:35:23,262 --> 00:35:24,266
It wasn't me.

453
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:27,296
I just wanted a damn coffee,
it wasn't me...

454
00:35:27,298 --> 00:35:29,320
He's been here all night.

455
00:35:29,322 --> 00:35:32,292
Seven little soldiers
chopping up sticks,

456
00:35:32,294 --> 00:35:35,262
one chopped himself in half
and then there were six.

457
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,254
So she's right.

458
00:35:39,286 --> 00:35:41,324
It is the poem,

459
00:35:41,326 --> 00:35:43,320
but he's fucked, Mr Unknown Owen,

460
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:47,308
because six little solder boys
played with a hive.

461
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:51,304
A bumble bee stung one and then there
were five and there is no hive here
and there are no bees,

462
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:54,272
so what are you going to do now,
Mr Unknown Owen? You're fucked!

463
00:35:54,274 --> 00:35:55,294
You're fu...

464
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:01,344
I will get dressed,

465
00:36:01,346 --> 00:36:03,322
we will all get dressed...

466
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:06,286
...and I will make coffee.

467
00:36:07,346 --> 00:36:09,298
Miss Brent, shall we? Yes.

468
00:36:15,262 --> 00:36:17,312
Shit. Shit the bed.

469
00:36:17,314 --> 00:36:19,324
We need to find something to
wrap him up with

470
00:36:19,326 --> 00:36:21,266
or he's going to go everywhere.

471
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,334
Coffee.

472
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:47,268
There's no milk, I'm afraid.

473
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,250
Does this person...

474
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:51,266
...mean to kill us all?

475
00:36:53,266 --> 00:36:54,294
I believe so, yes.

476
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:00,290
I've lost a ball of wool.

477
00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:04,330
I'm quite ridiculously distressed
about it.

478
00:37:06,346 --> 00:37:08,308
It's only wool...

479
00:37:16,338 --> 00:37:18,290
I'm so very tired.

480
00:37:22,314 --> 00:37:24,266
Drink your coffee, Miss Brent.

481
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,276
I'll bring you a candle to see by.

482
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,306
Thank you, dear.

483
00:38:14,342 --> 00:38:16,274
I'll make some more.

484
00:38:40,302 --> 00:38:42,316
Judge Wargrave, I feel I...

485
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:44,336
owe you an apology for...

486
00:38:44,338 --> 00:38:47,340
exposing your illness in such
an unforgiveable fashion.

487
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:50,346
We're all feeling a little ragged.
Understandably.

488
00:38:58,334 --> 00:39:00,294
What's your opinion of the others?

489
00:39:00,794 --> 00:39:02,332
I haven't really formed one.

490
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:05,248
I don't trust any of them.

491
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,288
Blore. That bastard Lombard.
Claythorne.

492
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,298
Miss Brent and her religious mania.

493
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,254
But you and I...

494
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:17,294
...we have sharp minds.

495
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,326
Actual intellects.

496
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,322
We should stay together.

497
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:26,342
Hm.

498
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:29,298
Very well.

499
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:38,266
Oh, Go...

500
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,280
Here. Here.

501
00:39:41,282 --> 00:39:42,286
Thank you.

502
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,302
Dribbling down myself like a child.

503
00:39:52,286 --> 00:39:54,318
Miss Claythorne's
making the coffee...

504
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:57,330
She should be watched.

505
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:19,262
Right.

506
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,256
You do the stairs,

507
00:40:22,258 --> 00:40:24,298
I'm going to wash
the guts out of the woodstore.

508
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,306
Can I?

509
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:06,278
I rather enjoy domestic tasks.

510
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:09,250
They are soothing.

511
00:41:10,314 --> 00:41:11,338
Normal.

512
00:41:13,266 --> 00:41:14,278
Indeed.

513
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:33,304
I'll just be a moment.

514
00:41:33,306 --> 00:41:34,330
All right.

515
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,290
Stung by a bee.

516
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:34,332
And then there were five.

517
00:43:56,278 --> 00:43:59,320
Well, I suppose, with no Rogers,
I should think about lunch.

518
00:43:59,322 --> 00:44:01,266
I could eat a scabby horse.

519
00:44:02,302 --> 00:44:03,318
You're actually hungry?

520
00:44:05,274 --> 00:44:08,336
That was heavy work...
dealing with Rogers.

521
00:44:08,338 --> 00:44:10,332
And you're the one that
suggested lunch.

522
00:44:10,334 --> 00:44:13,304
Only because it's what
one does at this time of day,

523
00:44:13,306 --> 00:44:15,332
but I'm not hungry,
how could you possibly be hungry?

524
00:44:15,334 --> 00:44:17,328
Oi, you!

525
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:19,278
Don't go implying...

526
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:24,256
Casting aspersions... I've got not,
I've got nothing to do with this.

527
00:44:24,258 --> 00:44:25,316
I've got nothing to do
with any of it.

528
00:44:25,318 --> 00:44:27,256
Just because I said I was hungry.

529
00:44:27,258 --> 00:44:29,266
I AM hungry,
it doesn't prove a single thing!

530
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,250
I'm going to get dressed.

531
00:44:40,266 --> 00:44:41,308
The whole morning,

532
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,320
dragging Rogers around,
clearing up guts,

533
00:44:43,322 --> 00:44:46,332
without so much as a cup of tea
to wet me whistle, and you..

534
00:44:46,334 --> 00:44:48,330
You look at me like I... Calm down.

535
00:44:51,278 --> 00:44:52,818
You've got some front, love.

536
00:44:54,254 --> 00:44:55,822
You've got some right brass neck.

537
00:44:59,588 --> 00:45:01,568
Don't go downstairs on your own.

538
00:45:02,568 --> 00:45:03,596
Not with those two.

539
00:45:05,508 --> 00:45:07,500
What, Wargrave and Armstrong? Mm-hm.

540
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:09,580
You wait up here for me.

541
00:45:32,552 --> 00:45:36,510
It was locked. Which means there
must be a master key.

542
00:45:36,512 --> 00:45:38,502
Rogers must have had a
master key.

543
00:45:38,504 --> 00:45:40,560
You two dealt with the body!
And you found it!

544
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,582
Or did you?

545
00:45:42,584 --> 00:45:46,538
You shrieking like a woman, was that
a bit of amateur dramatics, was it?

546
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,546
I did nothing to Rogers. I
didn't take any master key,

547
00:45:49,548 --> 00:45:51,558
we don't even know
if there IS a master key,

548
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,574
and we only had your word that the
gun was stolen,

549
00:45:53,576 --> 00:45:55,594
you could've taken it.
Why would I steal my own gun?

550
00:45:55,596 --> 00:45:57,582
I don't know why you'd do anything,

551
00:45:57,584 --> 00:46:02,522
Lombard, I don't know why you killed
Rogers or Miss Brent or MacArthur.

552
00:46:02,524 --> 00:46:04,578
I didn't kill them. Well,
you WOULD say that, wouldn't you?

553
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,574
Just like you'd say
that your gun was stolen.

554
00:46:07,576 --> 00:46:10,590
You really are a first-class,

555
00:46:10,592 --> 00:46:12,530
five-star,

556
00:46:12,532 --> 00:46:14,574
solid gold fucking moron.

557
00:46:14,576 --> 00:46:16,558
Please! The lady! Hm?

558
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,572
Double bluff.

559
00:46:21,532 --> 00:46:22,586
What, Tubs?

560
00:46:22,588 --> 00:46:25,590
Why you would steal your own gun.
Armstrong's got a point.

561
00:46:25,592 --> 00:46:28,564
It's all riddles and games,
smoke and mirrors, double bluff.

562
00:46:30,596 --> 00:46:32,532
You were the last one down.

563
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:37,510
The last one.

564
00:46:37,512 --> 00:46:40,564
Ages behind everyone else.
What, what took you so long?

565
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,574
I don't care to say.

566
00:46:44,576 --> 00:46:46,552
You killed Rogers.

567
00:46:47,556 --> 00:46:49,578
You took the master key,
you went to bed,

568
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,554
you made sure all of us
were downstairs,

569
00:46:51,556 --> 00:46:53,522
then you got in my room
and took my gun.

570
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:55,590
You have my gun, you little prick.
Lombard! For heaven's sake.

571
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:59,550
I never killed Rogers and I ain't
got your key or your sodding gun!

572
00:46:59,552 --> 00:47:01,502
Then what took you so long?

573
00:47:01,504 --> 00:47:02,582
If you weren't in my room,
stealing my gun,

574
00:47:02,584 --> 00:47:04,510
then why were you last down?

575
00:47:04,512 --> 00:47:07,510
I was in the bloody lavvy,
if you must know!

576
00:47:07,512 --> 00:47:08,560
Constipated.

577
00:47:12,556 --> 00:47:13,574
Oh, yes.

578
00:47:13,576 --> 00:47:14,590
Yeah, laugh it up.

579
00:47:14,592 --> 00:47:16,586
It's not funny.

580
00:47:18,556 --> 00:47:19,988
Bound up something rotten.

581
00:47:21,544 --> 00:47:22,588
Sat there in a muck sweat.

582
00:47:24,504 --> 00:47:25,582
So it weren't me.

583
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:27,544
It could have been any of us.

584
00:47:28,588 --> 00:47:32,498
Any one of us could have had the
key.

585
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500
Any one of us could have the gun.

586
00:47:53,516 --> 00:47:54,872
It is the only way to be sure.

587
00:47:57,572 --> 00:48:00,510
It's not like you have
been singled out.

588
00:48:00,512 --> 00:48:01,964
We're all getting the same.

589
00:48:20,504 --> 00:48:21,538
No key.

590
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,544
No gun.

591
00:48:25,596 --> 00:48:27,556
Now you, Miss Claythorne.

592
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:30,500
Of course.

593
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:50,560
I'm just being thorough.

594
00:49:15,588 --> 00:49:18,522
You like Uncle Hugo, don't you?

595
00:49:18,524 --> 00:49:19,582
I do.

596
00:49:19,584 --> 00:49:21,512
I'm... in love with him.

597
00:49:22,528 --> 00:49:24,518
I love him so much it hurts.

598
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,580
Silly. Girls are silly.

599
00:49:28,544 --> 00:49:30,526
And I'm going to marry him.

600
00:49:30,528 --> 00:49:32,584
I heard Mummy say
he couldn't afford to get married.

601
00:49:33,584 --> 00:49:35,570
Well, I'll find a way, Cyril.

602
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:38,542
If you marry Uncle Hugo...
When I marry Hugo.

603
00:49:38,544 --> 00:49:40,530
Will you be my aunt?

604
00:49:40,532 --> 00:49:41,534
I will.

605
00:49:41,536 --> 00:49:42,586
Aunt Vera.

606
00:49:42,588 --> 00:49:44,586
And what fun we'll have.

607
00:49:44,588 --> 00:49:47,578
Christmas and birthdays
and summer holidays.

608
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,534
Picnics. Parties.

609
00:49:49,536 --> 00:49:51,546
Pony rides.

610
00:49:51,548 --> 00:49:53,596
Hmm! How happy we'll be
when we have everything!

611
00:50:30,564 --> 00:50:31,592
Cyril!

612
00:50:58,536 --> 00:50:59,988
Why isn't Lombard doing this?

613
00:51:01,564 --> 00:51:04,584
Blore and I thought it a good idea
to keep you two apart.

614
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,512
Well, well, Miss Claythorne.

615
00:52:13,504 --> 00:52:14,548
Mr Lombard.

616
00:52:15,568 --> 00:52:16,576
Philip.

617
00:52:18,532 --> 00:52:19,548
Vera.

618
00:52:32,528 --> 00:52:34,538
Nothing.

619
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,580
We'll search the rest of the
house. Every room.

620
00:54:47,552 --> 00:54:49,514
We're in hell...

621
00:54:49,516 --> 00:54:51,578
and we're being punished
for what we've done.

622
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,550
He refused the hood.

623
00:54:53,552 --> 00:54:55,522
He haunts me still.

624
00:54:55,524 --> 00:54:58,512
Look at them. There is
something going on between them.

625
00:54:59,528 --> 00:55:02,534
Someone has to come for us
soon. They have to.

626
00:55:02,536 --> 00:55:03,992
I reckon we're being watched.

627
00:55:08,516 --> 00:55:09,532
We are.

628
00:55:10,305 --> 00:56:10,679

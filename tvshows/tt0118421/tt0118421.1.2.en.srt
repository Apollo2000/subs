6
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,267
Fuck is a four letter word.

7
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,728
Rape is a four letter word.

8
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,856
Wife is a four letter word.

9
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,649
So is love.

10
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,735
Fuck is a curse.

11
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,612
So is love.

12
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,365
And I don't just mean boys and girls.

13
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,285
I'm talking friends, I'm talking family.

14
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,483
Somebody wanna tell me what the fuck happened to Dino Ortolani?

15
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,737
Well, he suffocated an AIDS patient, Emilio Sanchez,
and I put him in the hole.

16
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,739
I heard you had him sedated.
You what?

17
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,201
Dr. Nathan put him on 4 milligrams of Lorazipan.

18
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,496
He was violent.
Since when is it prison policy to drug inmates?

19
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:46,542
What the fuck difference does it make?
Your boys had already beaten him senseless.

20
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:49,586
The question is, who set him on fire?

21
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,255
Maybe the Latinos did it,

22
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:55,467
to get Dino for killing Sanchez.
Everybody had a reason to hate Ortolani.

23
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,096
The homies, the Muslims, the Aryans.
Everybody wanted to smoke him.

24
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:02,558
Including you.
Me? Me personally?

25
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,892
You or some other officer.

26
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:08,480
Somebody let whoever lit the match into the hole.
Fuck you, McManus.

27
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,147
Yeah, fuck me.

28
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,483
Hey, guys, the enemy's out there.

29
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:16,029
Lenny, I want you to head up the investigation.

30
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,489
Question everyone.

31
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,493
Find out who killed Ortolani before Nino Schibetta does,

32
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,663
before the Governor sends in the Feds,

33
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,374
before we have a full scale riot on our hands.

34
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,668
The niggers did Ortolani.

35
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:34,464
You got any evidence to prove that?
Yeah, right, like you guys ever need evidence.

36
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,217
You hear one of them admit to killing him?

37
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,429
No, but think about it.

38
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,347
Who else is there?

39
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,724
Latinos?

40
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,560
No. Burning isn't the spics' style.

41
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,605
Niggers burn things.

42
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,523
You could've done Ortolani.

43
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,608
Yeah, sure.

44
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,694
There's no valentines between me and Dino,

45
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:59,656
but when I kill a man it's because

46
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,576
he's standing in the way of my constitutional rights.

47
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,829
I kill to protect what's mine.

48
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,499
What God has given me.

49
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,419
The Sicilians understand that.

50
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:18,175
The rest of these fucks would cut a man
for a pair of sneakers or a fucking cigarette.

51
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,552
They are animals.

52
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,554
Break it up! Break it up!

53
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,823
He hasn't come out in days?

54
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,910
Not for dinner, not for lunch, not for a shower.

55
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,458
Beecher?

56
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,879
Hey, what's up? Is he sick?

57
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,507
Get lost for a minute, ok?

58
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,758
Sure.

59
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,636
Hope you feel better, buddy.

60
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,645
So you've been keeping pretty much to yourself lately.

61
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:17,317
Prison is a rough adjustment for anyone,

62
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,653
but a man like you...

63
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,697
They burned Ortolani.

64
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,073
Yeah.

65
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,450
He was tough, strong.

66
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,786
If a guy like that isn't safe...
Beecher,

67
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,663
I could tell you you're safe,

68
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,415
but that'd be a lie.

69
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,295
You gotta be careful, respectful.

70
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:40,507
You gotta try and focus on the day you're getting released.

71
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,844
You're married, right?
You got kids?

72
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:49,725
Your family been to visit you lately?
I haven't seen Genevieve since,

73
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,101
since about a month ago.

74
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:55,063
The kids, it's even longer.

75
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,524
So call your wife and ask her to come.

76
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,861
The first time alone,
let her get a sense of the place.

77
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,780
Make a romantic evening of it,
just the two of you.

78
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,992
Romantic here? How?

79
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,535
Go see Sister Pete.

80
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,454
Ah, here we are.

81
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,081
Tobias Beecher.

82
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,083
Oh, good, you're married.

83
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:19,296
A lotta fellows in here try to bring
their girlfriends in as wives.

84
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,964
It's no dice.

85
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:24,426
Once in a while one of these guys,
who is married,

86
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,388
tries to pull off a fast one on me and
pass off a hooker as his mate.

87
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,682
They do that once.

88
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:36,647
They don't do it again.
The whole point of a conjugal is not just sex.

89
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,441
But it's, your wife comes in, she brings food,

90
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:46,156
she can cook for you, you talk to each other.
You're together again, you know.

91
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:54,289
OK, fill in this form and I'll handle the rest.

92
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,254
Where you been, sweetpea?

93
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,466
To see Sister Peter Marie.

94
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,801
Went to the shrink?

95
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,304
What, about those nightmares you been having?

96
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,099
To arrange a visit with my wife.

97
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,684
Oh, a conjugal.

98
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,479
You didn't ask my permission.

99
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,442
When are you gonna learn, prag?

100
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,361
You belong to me.

101
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,155
I make all your decisions, right?

102
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,743
So ask me.

103
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:37,541
Come over here and ask me if you can fuck your wife.

104
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,544
I...

105
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,005
Come on, ask me! Now!

106
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,215
Can I be with my wife?

107
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,260
Fuck my wife.

108
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,263
Fuck my wife.

109
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,266
Louder, and say "please" and "sir".

110
00:07:55,851 --> 00:08:01,398
Please, sir, may I fuck my wife?

111
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,691
Louder.

112
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:11,200
Please, sir, may I fuck my wife!

113
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:17,331
When you ask me like that, I can't deny you anything.

114
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,927
I'm here to see my....

115
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,512
Tobias Beecher.

116
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,138
B-e-a...

117
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,641
B-e-e-c-h-e-r.

118
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,351
OK.

119
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:41,980
Let me see the basket and your purse.
They said that I can bring food.

120
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,483
Yeah.
Step right through here, please.

121
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:49,780
Are you transporting any drugs,

122
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,157
weapons, explosives, alcohol?

123
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,617
No.

124
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,871
Sign this.

125
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,171
If I was carrying explosives, why would I say yes?

126
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:09,508
Lady, I don't know.
The state says I have to ask, I ask.

127
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,054
Purse goes in the locker.

128
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:24,565
When you're finished there,
go to room one right here.

129
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:34,908
Hi.

130
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,789
Hi.

131
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,973
I've missed you so much.

132
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:06,190
Holly made a painting for you
but I left it in my purse.

133
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:10,319
The guard asked me about explosives and
I completely forgot about the painting.

134
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,322
It's of our house.
Holly and Gary are standing out front

135
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:18,410
and I'm holding the baby.
She drew the dog about twice as big as anybody else.

136
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,998
You're not in it.

137
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,543
You're not in the painting.

138
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,768
I thought I'd make spaghetti.

139
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:50,651
Please, honey, just hold me. Please.

140
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,077
Let's go! Move it, Beecher!

141
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,828
Lorenzo, let's go.

142
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,540
Stay right there.

143
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,959
Let's go, Beecher, double time.

144
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,192
How was it?

145
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,654
Good.

146
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,200
Good?

147
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:26,038
You come from a night of wild sex
with the only woman you love and

148
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,332
you tell me it was good?

149
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,755
You've got a lovely family.

150
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,427
I'm amazed you haven't shown me these pictures before.

151
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:44,598
Amazed and a little hurt.

152
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:50,354
I hope you don't mind me finding
these hidden underneath your mattress.

153
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,607
Beautiful.

154
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,486
My wife is dead.

155
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,073
I got two sons.

156
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,451
Seventeen and sixteen.

157
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,330
Handsome fucking kids too.
Good Aryan stock.

158
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,251
My sons are devoted to me.

159
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,546
I am an icon to them because

160
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:17,965
I went to prison for my beliefs.

161
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,344
They would do anything I asked them to.

162
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:27,516
Steal, maim, kill.

163
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,773
Maybe I should have them go visit your family.

164
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,691
Huh?

165
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:39,820
Just a little friendly call, what do you think?

166
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,905
My sons and your wife.

167
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,368
My sons and your daughter.

168
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,609
Bitch, herd, maytag, shill.

169
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:21,028
Here in Oz we call 'em "prags".

170
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,657
I don't know where it comes from,
but you make a man your prag,

171
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,326
he's your prag for life.

172
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,411
It's like the old days when people didn't get divorced,

173
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,456
the only way out of marriage is death.

174
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,417
'Til death do us part.

175
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,463
Donald Groves.

176
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:43,550
You killed your parents and ate them, right?

177
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,927
I only ate my mom.

178
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,180
I was saving my dad for Thanksgiving.

179
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,681
That's festive.

180
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:54,645
So what can you tell me about Dino Ortolani's murder?

181
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,232
I got in trouble for sneaking in the morgue.

182
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,317
What were you doing in the morgue?

183
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,402
I was just looking.

184
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,406
And they put you in the hole.
Yeah.

185
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,453
And you were in the cell next to Ortolani's when he got burned.
Yeah.

186
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,247
You hear anything?

187
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,707
No. Not a sound.

188
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,294
He didn't scream.

189
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,966
He gets set on fire but he doesn't scream.

190
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,386
That's balls.

191
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,014
Anything else?

192
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,142
I saw 'em carry him out.

193
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:39,481
Looked like a roasted, broiled chicken.

194
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,485
His flesh was all brown and crispy.

195
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,656
He looked good enough to eat.

196
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:15,350
What's he saying?
He's talking about how taxpayers shouldn't

197
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,728
have to foot the bill for prisoner frills.

198
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,897
Thank you, Governor Cocksucker.

199
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,734
Therefore I am introducing to the legislature a measure

200
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,113
which would save this state an estimated $3 million a year.

201
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:31,950
This law would eliminate all conjugal visits

202
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,119
between inmates and their wives...

203
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,996
I'm going to see McManus.

204
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,927
Hang on, stop talking!

205
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,597
I'm going to hang up my "out to lunch" sign
All right?

206
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,766
Get in line!

207
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:01,271
All right, now, thank you.
Pass this on to the fellow in back of you,

208
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:04,691
take the pencils and start filling out the forms.

209
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:08,237
I have counted all the pencils
and I want them back.

210
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,657
So if you use any of them as a weapon
or any of them is missing,

211
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,743
none of you will get a visit.
Is that understood?

212
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:17,704
Am I making myself clear?
Because, if not, I will repeat myself.

213
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:06,271
Prisoner number 95H522, Augustus Hill.

214
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,398
Convicted November 6, '95.

215
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,609
Possession of illegal substances,

216
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:16,823
murder in the second degree.
Sentence: life imprisonment. Up for parole in twenty years.

217
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,075
Can you believe this shit?

218
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,744
Word. Fiending to see my wife.

219
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,706
Least you get to see yours, huh?

220
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,250
What you mean?

221
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:27,918
Funky back.

222
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:31,880
What, you think cause I can't walk I can't fuck?

223
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,007
So you can fuck?

224
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,509
Yeah.

225
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:41,265
Are we talking getting hard or licky-licky?

226
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:43,684
We talking in and out, up and down.

227
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:49,481
I never thought a nigger could get hard in a wheelchair.

228
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:53,360
Yeah, well, it's easier for some of us than others.
Some people gotta use a pump,

229
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:56,280
some niggers gotta use drugs,
get a needle stuck in their dick.

230
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,991
Yo, the worst one is implants.

231
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:02,953
They slice your dick open and they lay in this kinda like

232
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:06,331
a steel rod to keep the shit stiff.
Oh, please.

233
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:09,585
No, man, I get hard the old-fashioned way.

234
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:13,589
Only problem is I don't know it.

235
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,675
You don't know what?

236
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,719
I don't know when I'm hard.

237
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:25,100
You don't know when you're hard?
I got no sensation down there

238
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:28,228
so I don't know when I'm hard,
I don't know when I come.

239
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:31,023
My wife gotta tell me.
You don't know when you're hard,

240
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:35,861
you don't know when you fucking come.
You don't get any pleasure at all, huh?

241
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,281
What the fuck are you doing it for?

242
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,240
For her.

243
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,413
You can take a lot of things away from a man.

244
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:47,956
Cigarettes, the gym.

245
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,001
You can take his freedom, his legs,

246
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,796
but not his feelings.

247
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,716
Not his feelings.

248
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,768
A man loves a woman.

249
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,355
No matter what kind of man he is,
if he loves her he wants her.

250
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,856
He wants her body.

251
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,733
He wants her to want his.

252
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,652
So you say to him,

253
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,904
You will never make love again.

254
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:22,449
You will never touch her in that way again.

255
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,619
This is the last time.

256
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:30,249
The last time forever.

257
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:35,879
If that's not cruel and unusual punishment,

258
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,591
I don't know what is.

259
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:45,639
I'm investigating the murder of Dino Ortolani.

260
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,182
Lucky me, right?

261
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:51,562
He used to supervise you in the kitchen?
Yeah.

262
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,607
You ever had any run-ins with him?
No.

263
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,441
No?

264
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,069
He's ordering you around all day,

265
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:00,779
"boy do this, boy do that",

266
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:04,199
it never pissed you off?
He never called me "boy".

267
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:08,829
He put your little brother Billie in the hospital.
He nearly beat him to death.

268
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:10,914
Ortolani was a scumfuck, man.

269
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,468
You married, Jefferson?

270
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:26,847
What's that got to do with anything?
Answer the question.

271
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:31,018
No, I ain't married.
You got a girl waiting for you on the outside?

272
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:31,810
Yeah.

273
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:35,397
She know you're a lying sack of shit? Huh?

274
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:41,904
If I find out you had anything to do this this,
I'm gonna bury you so deep in gen pop

275
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:43,780
she'll never see your black ass again.

276
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:48,952
So what do I say when they call me in?
You say nothing, Johnny. Nothing.

277
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:51,914
Listen up.

278
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:56,710
I'll be running the kitchen from now on, ok?
Everything's gonna be the same.

279
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,420
'Til we find out who whacked Dino,

280
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:01,882
we ain't selling any contraband to anyone for any reason.

281
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,674
OK?

282
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:08,222
I'll set that wop motherfucker on fire next.
Shut the fuck up.

283
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,766
I ain't afraid of no fucking greaseball.
Shut the fuck up.

284
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:38,710
Jefferson. Cops want to see me about Dino tonight.
Shhh.

285
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:40,963
What's up?

286
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,507
I'm having a visit with Mavis.

287
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:44,466
What?

288
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,385
My girl, Mavis.

289
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:49,471
I called her, told her I'd been missing her.

290
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:52,307
She says she wants to stand outside.

291
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,476
Holy fuck.

292
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:57,437
I'd been missing her body.

293
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:03,777
Oh, shit. Jefferson, you the shit.

294
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:56,747
Prisoner number 97K186, Jefferson Keane.

295
00:24:57,623 --> 00:25:00,542
Convicted May 14, '97.

296
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:03,253
Two counts murder in the first degree.

297
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:08,467
Sentence: life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

298
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:12,179
I wanna get married.

299
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:14,389
To anyone in particular?

300
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,517
Yeah, my girl Mavis.

301
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:18,435
Mavis wants to marry you in the spite of the fact

302
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,813
that you're gonna be in here for the rest of your life?
Yeah.

303
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,566
Sounds like a remarkable woman.

304
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:25,400
She is.

305
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:31,532
All right. I'll make the arrangements.

306
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:32,950
No, absolutely not.

307
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:33,909
Why?

308
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:37,287
This is prison, McManus, not the Elvis Chapel.

309
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:39,748
Besides,
I got enough shit going on right now as it is.

310
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:41,542
A wedding might help ease some of the tension.

311
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:46,505
It might also be perceived as a reward for Jefferson Keane who,
as far as I can tell,

312
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,215
has done nothing to deserve a reward.

313
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:51,969
He's not a model prisoner, no,
but this could help turn him around.

314
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:56,014
The guy killed a couple on their wedding day,
shot them both down in cold blood.

315
00:25:55,681 --> 00:26:00,018
He says the two of them ripped off his package.
And you think that justifies it?

316
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:02,479
No, it explains it.
Leo, are you saying you'd be ok with this

317
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:03,689
if he'd waited to kill them 'til

318
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:05,524
after their honeymoon?
Yeah.

319
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:08,777
Leo...
Hey, I believe in the sanctity of marriage.

320
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,114
It's a holy ritual, a sacred bond between a man,

321
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,448
a woman, and God.

322
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:17,619
Marriage is when a husband and wife live together,
in the same house,

323
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,871
sleep in the same bed.

324
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:22,332
Jefferson Keane and whatever her name is...
Mavis.

325
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,084
They can't do that.

326
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:26,837
The marriage would be a fraud and
I'm not gonna be a party to it.

327
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:29,506
Well, Keane lives in Em City. It's my decision.

328
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:32,718
That's true.

329
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:37,222
But the lobby is under my jurisdiction and

330
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:40,350
you try to bring in that bride-to-be through the front door.

331
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:45,063
They don't have a clue what went down with Ortolani.
So just chill the fuck out.

332
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:47,608
But what about the wiseguys?

333
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:52,196
They stopped everything.
No more drugs, no more bets, no more contraband.

334
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:56,200
Ain't nothing moving in any direction
'til Nino Schibetta gets satisfaction.

335
00:26:57,618 --> 00:26:58,952
Jefferson.

336
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:03,332
I, uh, I spoke to the Warden.

337
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:04,458
Yeah?

338
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:07,836
I'm sorry.
He's not going to give you permission to get married.

339
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:12,174
That's not to say he's not gonna change his mind
but I think for now we're gonna have

340
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:12,925
to put this thing on the backburner.

341
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,801
We can't.
Why?

342
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,553
'Cause I'm gonna lose her.

343
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:20,140
Well, if she loves you as much as you say...
You promised me, McManus.

344
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:23,227
Now you're going back on your fucking word.

345
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:26,021
A man who can't keep his word ain't shit with me.

346
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:27,564
He ain't shit.

347
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:31,235
You know, I really appreciate that you've come to me.

348
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,946
It's just that I love her so much.

349
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,447
I'm sure you do.

350
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:40,452
But, you know, your desire to marry her,

351
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:42,329
it can't come out of your ego.

352
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:46,542
It can't come out of the jealousy,
can't come out of the fear that

353
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:50,128
because you are in here and you can't have her,
no man should.

354
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:52,631
If you love her,

355
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:57,678
you must be careful that you do not deprive her
of the fullness of life.

356
00:27:57,386 --> 00:28:00,013
No, man, I wouldn't do that to her.

357
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:03,016
OK. OK.

358
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:09,189
Now, you've told me why you love Mavis, right?

359
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:13,193
Now you explain to me how you know she loves you.

360
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:15,612
It's like the little things.

361
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,532
It's like at my trial, she was there every day.

362
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:22,578
I mean, just seeing her made everything so much easier for me.

363
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:26,123
Her face, her smile, it's like....

364
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,502
Hell, I ain't got the words like you.

365
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:35,215
That's why I want you to plead my case for me.
I'll get you anything you want up in here.

366
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:37,885
You have nothing I need.
So what's that, a no?

367
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:42,890
I believe that you love each other.

368
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:49,104
But you've gotta take that love, my brother,
and you've gotta trust in the will of Allah.

369
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,856
Yo, my girl is pregnant.

370
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,483
I screwed up, now Allah is screwing me.

371
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:22,346
I decided to let Jefferson Keane get married.

372
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:24,556
Because?

373
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,683
Kareem Said came to see me.

374
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:28,977
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

375
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,523
I come to you on Keane's behalf

376
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:36,818
and you blow me off in a cloud of platitudes.
Now Kareem Said says God knows what to you,

377
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:38,695
now the clouds have parted and the sun is shining.

378
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:42,366
Do you realize how this damages my credibility with the inmates?

379
00:29:41,824 --> 00:29:46,286
So then what?
I shouldn't let him get married for the sake of your credibility?

380
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:51,416
That's right.
McManus, how often does a guy like Said come to see us

381
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,668
to ask for a favor?

382
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:58,590
Oh, I get it. So now he owes you.
Yeah. He's gonna help contain the Ortolani situation,

383
00:29:57,506 --> 00:30:01,426
he's gonna help slow down the drugs.
Which means nothing.

384
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,683
Why didn't you tell me that Jefferson Keane's girlfriend was pregnant?

385
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:12,396
Because I didn't know. He didn't tell me that.

386
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:16,191
So much for your credibility.

387
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,943
Man, this is some bullshit!

388
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:22,197
Jefferson, the warden was very specific about

389
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,657
how this was going to work.

390
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:25,742
So what's this proxy shit?

391
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:30,664
While you'll be here and your fiancee will be

392
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,999
at your local Baptist church,

393
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,793
you'll both be exchanging vows at the same time

394
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:38,672
and each of you will have someone standing in

395
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:40,007
for the other person.

396
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:44,303
C'mon, Father, don't this seem fucked up to you?

397
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:14,750
With the power vested in me,

398
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:18,462
I pronounce you husband and wife.

399
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:21,131
You not gonna kiss the bride?

400
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:31,183
For better, for worse.

401
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:34,686
Shit, it don't get much worse than this.

402
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,316
Yo, man, got a letter from Mavis.

403
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:03,173
It's the will of Allah, brother.

404
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:05,217
Asalaam aleikuum.

405
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:06,885
Asalaam aleikuum.

406
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:12,641
What're you doing tonight?

407
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:13,433
Huh?

408
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,854
Well, I was thinking maybe you'd come over

409
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:20,357
to my house for dinner.
So you sleep here at the prison sometimes?

410
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:22,359
Believe me, I don't want to.

411
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:25,487
I been doing double shifts and I live two hours away

412
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:29,908
so by the time I get home I gotta turn around and come back.
So move closer.

413
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:35,706
If I could afford to move I wouldn't have to do double shifts.
Appreciate it, Leo. I can't.

414
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:38,125
Too much work to do, right?

415
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:43,463
You can take a break from saving the world.
Even Jesus had supper.

416
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:46,884
Yeah, and right afterwards he was betrayed and crucified.

417
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:51,513
I'll try not to take that personally.
You got a daughter if I remember?

418
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:57,394
How does she feel about you being gone for days on end?
Please. We live with my mother.

419
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:59,229
Between the two of them I get the crap beat out

420
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:02,357
of me everytime I walk through the door.
Come on, get your coat.

421
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,193
I can't. I have a date.

422
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:05,444
A date?

423
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:09,698
Yep. Is that so hard to believe?

424
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,617
Frankly, yes.

425
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:14,578
I got a dick like every other guy.

426
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:17,998
You need to find a job closer to home.
You think I haven't looked?

427
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:20,542
There are no jobs.
You think if the Chevy plant was hiring

428
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:23,587
I would choose to come here and babysit these pisspots?

429
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:25,464
I have no choice.

430
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,466
Just like these inmates.

431
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:29,259
Trapped.

432
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:31,803
McManus, get a wife.

433
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:33,388
I had a wife.

434
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:37,351
From what I hear you had a nightmare.
You been checking up on me?

435
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:39,937
Dinner, tomorrow.

436
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:42,105
Yeah, you bet.

437
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,069
Have a nice date.

438
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,544
God made sunsets full of color

439
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:07,464
and God made racehorses that run in a flash.

440
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:10,717
God made the orange, the apple, and strawberries.

441
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:14,471
But God's greatest creation is pussy.

442
00:34:14,263 --> 00:34:16,181
I don't mean to be crude or nothing,

443
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:19,810
but you can have all the sunsets, horses, and fruit there is,

444
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:24,231
just give me all the pussy in the world.
Fuck, I don't need all the pussy.

445
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:26,692
Just one a day, every day.

446
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:40,789
Miguel Alvarez.

447
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:45,669
I'm Father Ray Mukada.
I'm one of the prison chaplains.

448
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:47,337
No, shit.

449
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:53,760
According to this file you're about to be a father.
You've got a girlfriend, Maritza,

450
00:34:52,843 --> 00:34:55,429
she's an inmate at Parker Women's.

451
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:57,347
Yeah, we got arrested together.

452
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:58,682
Ain't that sweet?

453
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:04,771
I can arrange for you to be there for the birth.
I don't give a shit about shit like that.

454
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:08,775
Miguel, you'll probably be paroled in two years.
When you get out

455
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:10,777
you'll wanna be a father to your kid.

456
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:15,157
Is that right?
Yo, that's my father.

457
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,910
You know,
he went up to some cell block somewhere

458
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:21,830
with my grandfather so don't be giving me none of this shit.
I get it.

459
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:24,416
You had a miserable childhood. Tough.

460
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:25,876
But let me tell you something.

461
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:29,838
You're still responsible for bringing a new life into this world.

462
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:31,465
You are responsible.

463
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:35,594
The same way that I'm responsible for you,
for your soul.

464
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:39,181
So get ready, Miguel Alvarez,
because I'm gonna be over your shoulder.

465
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:40,974
Comprende, mi amigo?

466
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:47,731
Hey, Ray, you wanted to know,

467
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:51,401
I just signed the papers transferring Miguel Alvarez to Em City.

468
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:52,528
Miguel Alvarez.

469
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:56,824
Another shining example of how well the penal system works.

470
00:35:56,782 --> 00:35:59,868
Guy walks in the front door and he gets stabbed in the chest,

471
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:04,122
not to mention the fact that his father and grandfather
are both inmates here.

472
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:04,873
Yeah, I know.

473
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:08,335
You know, maybe I should talk to them both about Miguel.

474
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:12,673
The kid's about to become a father and
he refuses to accept any responsibility for it.

475
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:17,135
Well, the granddad, Ricardo Alvarez,

476
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:18,053
is in solitary.

477
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,057
And having a conversation with the father, Eduardo,

478
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,518
it's gonna be tough.

479
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:27,813
Why? He's belligerent?

480
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,649
He has no tongue.

481
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:56,216
Senor Alvarez?

482
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:59,803
I'm Ray Mukada, I'm the...
I know who you are.

483
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:05,058
I'd like to speak with you about your grandson, Miguel.

484
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:06,977
What about him?

485
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:10,230
He's an inmate here now.

486
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,441
I heard.

487
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:17,237
Well, then,
maybe you also heard that he's about to become a father.

488
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,908
His girlfriend, who he was arrested with,
is at Parker Women's.

489
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:26,413
And?
I'm trying to get Miguel to accept responsibility

490
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:27,789
for raising the child.

491
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:32,878
Maybe you can help me?
Because I'm his grandfather?

492
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,926
Padre, I never even seen him.

493
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:44,890
You were a shitty father,
your son was a shitty father.

494
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:47,518
Don't you think it's time we break the pattern?

495
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:49,520
I was 18 when I was convicted.

496
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:52,439
Eduardo was a baby.

497
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:58,320
Next time I saw him he was 18

498
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:02,282
and wearing the same prison uniform I was.

499
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:07,287
Then my son started mouthing off to everybody here,

500
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:11,250
making fun of people, making threats.

501
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:15,921
And he started poking around with a Haitian

502
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,550
and one night, one night while Eduardo was sleeping,

503
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:24,638
the Haitian cut his tongue out.

504
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:27,015
Yes, sir, I know.
I read the report.

505
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:31,645
So you found the Haitian and you cut his heart out.

506
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,604
Yeah.

507
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:37,901
So what you're telling me is
you were being a good father to Eduardo

508
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,989
when you carved up the Haitian.

509
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:49,496
Well, if somebody hurts your grandson
you won't be able to do anything about it, will you?

510
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:51,498
At least not that way.

511
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:54,543
All I'm asking is to talk to the boy,

512
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:56,753
not for you, not for him,

513
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:59,673
but for the baby that's about to be born.

514
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:03,552
Your great-grandchild.

515
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:26,658
What the fuck?

516
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,664
Come here.

517
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,377
Who the fuck are you?

518
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:38,712
Come here!

519
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,148
OK, I'm here. Now what?

520
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:15,541
You know who I am, don't you?

521
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:20,087
Yeah.

522
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:29,263
Sex is a mindfuck.

523
00:40:29,513 --> 00:40:32,641
A wad of jizz hits an egg and bing bam

524
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:36,311
you're connected to all these people.
These strangers,

525
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,648
who maybe got the same eyes as you or the same sort of nose.

526
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:41,775
Or maybe they passed you some cell

527
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:45,112
that makes you drink or do drugs,
even if you don't want to.

528
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,488
Even if it's killing you.

529
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:49,783
These gene things are like the shackles they put on us here,

530
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:51,827
chains to keep us from moving freely.

531
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:58,083
You gotta be Houdini to get outta them.
You gotta be fucking Houdini.

532
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:21,773
Ortolani committed suicide.

533
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:23,484
Suicide?

534
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:28,322
How can he be tied down with restraints and set himself on fire?

535
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:31,992
That's impossible.
Even so, he committed suicide.

536
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:35,579
What makes you say that?
God told me.

537
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:39,750
God told you?
God comes to visit me every once in a while.

538
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:42,753
Actually, he comes more often than I'd like but it's God.

539
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:46,298
What can I say?
That I'm busy, that I'm in the shower?

540
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:47,090
He knows.

541
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:52,763
We talking 'bout a burning bush here?
No. It's more like a strobe.

542
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:56,308
A little too flashy,
a little cheesy for my taste.

543
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:59,394
And God told you Ortolani committed suicide?

544
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:03,440
Well, that the kid wanted to die and consciously or un,

545
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:06,235
he said if the circumstances were...
he'd be killed.

546
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,153
God happen to tell you who did it?

547
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:09,071
No.

548
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:14,034
I didn't think so.
He told me to tell you to tell Nino Schibetta

549
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:14,993
not to seek revenge.

550
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:17,871
Why didn't you tell Schibetta?

551
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:21,208
Just 'cause I talk to God doesn't mean I'm crazy.

552
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,502
How's your mother?

553
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:26,380
Not good, Papa, not good at all.

554
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:29,216
Doctor says she ain't got long.

555
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:30,676
Who is this doctor?

556
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:34,805
This specialist. The best.

557
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:38,183
Is he Jewish?

558
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:39,560
I dunno.

559
00:42:40,102 --> 00:42:43,564
His name's Dr. Bidner.
Dr. Russo recommended him.

560
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:44,481
Get a Jew.

561
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:50,737
Hey, don't.

562
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,578
OK.

563
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:00,080
What else?

564
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:04,877
Dino's funeral's tomorrow, you know.

565
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:09,131
How are his parents taking it?

566
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:13,594
How do you think?

567
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:20,601
Paolo is philosophical and Maria wants revenge.

568
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:26,315
Yeah.
Tell her she's got it.

569
00:43:28,484 --> 00:43:29,443
OK.

570
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:27,459
Prisoner number 95S604, Nino Schibetta.

571
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:29,962
Convicted December 12, '95.

572
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:32,673
Two counts conspiracy to commit murder.

573
00:44:32,631 --> 00:44:38,929
Sentence: 120 years. Up for parole in 70.

574
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:42,099
I'm gonna arrange for you
to visit your wife in the hospital.

575
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:46,436
That's very considerate of you.

576
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:52,860
But forgive me, I'm cynical by nature.
Why are you being so considerate to me?

577
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:56,405
It's hard enough her being this ill
without you being able to, uh...

578
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:58,949
Say goodbye?

579
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:03,912
What do you want from me?

580
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:08,000
Your continued patience.
You're gonna find out who killed Dino?

581
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:08,208
Yes.

582
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:12,129
And you're gonna bring him to justice.
Now you're laughing at me.

583
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:13,881
As I said, I'm a cynical bastard.

584
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:16,967
No one wants a riot.
True.

585
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:23,098
I would like to see my wife.

586
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,517
Then we have a deal.

587
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:29,813
No.

588
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:59,551
Look, uh,
I know you're supposed to be my sponsor

589
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:02,846
and all that shit, show me the ropes,
but I don't need any help. All right ?

590
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:06,517
O'Reily. That's Irish, right?

591
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:09,144
Yeah, you got a problem with that?

592
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:11,355
I run the Aryan Brotherhood.

593
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:13,357
You're doing a hell of a job.

594
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:16,318
When we heard somebody was transferring in from the gen pop,

595
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:18,320
we all got kinda curious 'cause,

596
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,280
doesn't happen that often.

597
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:25,160
Saw you being all palsie with that hack.
Yeah, I have much love.

598
00:46:25,828 --> 00:46:27,788
Yeah, you got friends.

599
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:31,416
You got another friend, if you want.

600
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,127
See ya.

601
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:37,548
Hey, by the way,

602
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:40,133
whose cell was this beforehand?

603
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:41,885
Dino Ortolani's.

604
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:11,707
Mr. Schibetta requests your company.

605
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:37,649
Thank you for coming. Sit.

606
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:51,371
Dino Ortolani's death has upset me very deeply.

607
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:57,503
I am obviously hoping to learn who killed him,

608
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:01,215
especially in such a hideous fashion.

609
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:03,342
Does he gotta be in here?

610
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:04,801
Joey...

611
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:13,310
I know there was bad blood between you and Dino.

612
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:15,479
I didn't burn him.
I'm not accusing.

613
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:16,939
I'm extending my hand.

614
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:18,273
Dino is dead.

615
00:48:19,274 --> 00:48:21,360
Nothing can change that.

616
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:27,991
But if you could see a way to help us find his murderer,

617
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,246
I would show you my appreciation by forgiveness

618
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:34,706
for your past indiscretion.

619
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,668
Honestly, I don't know who offed Dino.

620
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:40,420
And with no disrespect,

621
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,965
I can't say I'm unhappy about it.

622
00:48:43,382 --> 00:48:46,426
But your friendship would mean a lot to me.

623
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:49,346
So if I hear anything, I'll come to you first.

624
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:51,098
That's all I ask.

625
00:49:02,985 --> 00:49:04,278
He knows.

626
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:09,575
Schibetta ain't gonna rest until he knows who done it.

627
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:14,288
You wanna be around when he finds out you were involved?
We gotta give him Johnny Post.

628
00:49:13,662 --> 00:49:16,665
Fuck that.
We give him Post, it all goes away.

629
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:19,585
Maybe you micks work like that,

630
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:24,089
but I would never rat on a brother.
What do you say we do, huh?

631
00:49:23,213 --> 00:49:25,674
Chill. 'Til it fades.

632
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,760
The Sicilians don't forget.

633
00:49:28,552 --> 00:49:31,263
The Sicilians don't let things fade.

634
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:44,401
O'Reily's awfully chummy with mumanatta.
Could mean nothing.

635
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:46,904
Want to talk to Keane?
Not yet.

636
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:48,906
Get word to Burrano.

637
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:52,826
He should bring O'Reily in for a little fishing trip.

638
00:49:53,243 --> 00:49:54,036
She's a hooker.

639
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:55,621
You're full of shit. - She's a hooker.

640
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:58,790
I tell ya, I been there.
You're shitting me about this.

641
00:49:58,123 --> 00:50:02,377
The St. Pauli sector of Hamburg,
Germany is the red light district.

642
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:06,757
So you tell me what a St. Paul Girl does after she takes up her apron.

643
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:11,678
And I always thought the little bitch was smiling just for me.

644
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:13,263
You got a cigarette?
Yeah.

645
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:17,226
Oh, man, you don't know.
This ban against smoking.

646
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:18,852
Can you believe that shit?

647
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:22,815
So here's what we got on Dino Ortolani's murder, right.

648
00:50:23,816 --> 00:50:26,735
Jefferson Keane and his crew did it.
Really?

649
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:27,402
Yeah.

650
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:33,450
I don't know which one actually lit the match yet,
but makes sense.

651
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:35,744
Ortolani put Keane's brother in ICU.

652
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:38,956
That kind of thing don't go unpunished around here.
Uh-uh.

653
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,707
What has me fucked up is,

654
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:44,461
who arranged for the guy
who did the deed to get in the hole?

655
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:45,087
I mean,

656
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:48,841
that would have to be a pretty well connected son of a bitch.
I mean,

657
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:52,719
connected to two officers on duty.
The niggers could've just paid a hack to let 'em in.

658
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:55,514
Nah, nah.
An inmate arranged it all.

659
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:57,891
And now I know who that inmate is.

660
00:50:57,641 --> 00:50:58,809
You do?

661
00:50:58,642 --> 00:50:59,810
Sure.

662
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:04,606
Same guy connected enough
to get movedfrom gen pop into Emerald City.

663
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:07,985
Same guy who Ortolani shot in the chest.

664
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:08,443
You.

665
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:09,528
Me?

666
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:12,573
You're kidding me, right?
Eventually,

667
00:51:12,614 --> 00:51:17,452
I'm gonna get the little fuck who killed Ortolani
and he's gonna start singing.

668
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:20,747
And the only name that fucking nigger is gonna rap

669
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:22,499
is the skinny ass white boy's.

670
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:28,422
My advice to you is to give him up now

671
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:30,174
or shut him up soon.

672
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:35,220
Thanks for stopping by.

673
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:43,770
Mr. Schibetta, I know who killed Dino.

674
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:01,371
Can I help you?

675
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,540
Black ten on the Jack.

676
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:09,379
Thanks.

677
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:11,089
I'm very sorry, Nino.

678
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:14,218
She's been sick, you know.

679
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:17,304
For the past year.

680
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:19,556
Cancer.

681
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:23,769
So it's not unexpected.

682
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:27,481
Even so...

683
00:52:27,815 --> 00:52:30,025
Is there anything I can do?

684
00:52:33,654 --> 00:52:36,281
I'm very grateful for your concern.

685
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:41,954
I'd just like to be alone for a little while.
Sure.

686
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:44,706
Let me know if you need anything.

687
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:51,171
Sorry about Angie, Skipper.

688
00:52:52,923 --> 00:52:54,675
Such a good woman.

689
00:52:55,884 --> 00:52:57,803
Such a patient woman.

690
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:04,393
I'm not the easiest man to live with, you know.
Yeah, I know.

691
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:11,066
I want Angie's funeral to be magnificent.

692
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,028
I want a gold and bronze casket.

693
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:17,239
Red velvet interior.

694
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:24,079
At the wake, I want on both sides of her Calla lilies.

695
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:25,455
She had them on her wedding day.

696
00:53:25,038 --> 00:53:29,793
And get that actor she likes to be one of her pallbearers.
Which actor?

697
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:32,671
You know, he's a big movie star.
What's his name?

698
00:53:31,962 --> 00:53:35,174
He was in that movie where the thing blew up.

699
00:53:34,715 --> 00:53:37,092
Oh, yeah, I know who you mean.

700
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:39,469
And Lena Horne.
As pallbearer?

701
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,180
Sing a hymn.

702
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:44,474
Tell the Cardinal to go easy on the incense.

703
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:46,852
The smell makes my, makes my....

704
00:53:47,186 --> 00:53:48,562
Oh, Jesus!

705
00:53:48,729 --> 00:53:50,397
Angie!

706
00:54:02,993 --> 00:54:05,287
I'm gonna ask you this once:

707
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:09,833
Who paid you to kill Dino Ortolani?
Fuck you.

708
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:12,711
Fuck you, you fucking dago.

709
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:16,006
Before I did it, I fucked him up the ass.

710
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:19,384
Kill him.

711
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,887
Start with his dick.

712
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:30,395
What the fuck y'all gonna do, fucking dagos.

713
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,814
Fuck you!

714
00:54:32,189 --> 00:54:34,107
Sex and death.

715
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:36,735
They're different but the same.

716
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,530
To reach that final moment,

717
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:40,948
that climax,

718
00:54:41,657 --> 00:54:46,328
you gotta give up control of your body,

719
00:54:46,578 --> 00:54:49,915
of your soul.

720
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:57,464
Another inmate at Oswald State Penitentiary was murdered yesterday,

721
00:54:57,089 --> 00:55:00,092
the second such incident in as many weeks.

722
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:02,803
John Post, a drug dealer serving life,

723
00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:06,139
was found in a utility closet at the prison mutilated,

724
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:09,560
his fingers missing and several stab wounds to his heart.

725
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:13,689
Authorities are investigating both murders
but still have no suspect.

726
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:14,731
In a related story,

727
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:17,943
state legislatives have overwhelmingly passed a bill

728
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:21,238
banning conjugal visits between the inmates and their wives.

729
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:26,285
Governor James Devlin has hailed the vote
as a victory for law-abiding citizens.

730
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:31,874
And love?
Well, if sex is sweet and death is bitter,

731
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:33,292
love is both.

732
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:37,421
Love will always and forever break your heart.

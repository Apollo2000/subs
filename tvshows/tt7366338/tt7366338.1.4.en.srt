You're not the first soldier
to stand here with a gun.

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,762
When I was 12,
the revolution came.

40
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:27,969
Czar's men.
Then Bolsheviks.

41
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:30,887
Boys like you
marching in lines.

42
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:34,219
They told us to leave. No.

43
00:02:34,303 --> 00:02:36,803
Then there was Stalin
and his famine,

44
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:38,969
the Holodomor.

45
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:43,094
My parents died.
Two of my sisters died.

46
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:45,803
They told the rest of us
to leave.

47
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:47,470
No.

48
00:02:47,553 --> 00:02:49,303
Then the Great War.

49
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:52,595
German boys.
Russian boys.

50
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:56,219
More soldiers,
more famine, more bodies.

51
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,969
My brothers
never came home.

Even our lunar rovers

Animal control?

175
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,720
Yeah, they're
radioactive,

176
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:02,053
so they have to go.

177

But it's not hard.
They're mostly pets.

dump them in a pit,
bury them in concrete.

Written in 1976.

249
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:21,887
It's about the operation of RBMK
reactors under extreme conditions.

250
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:23,511
So?

251
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:25,969
The names of the authors
have been redacted,

252

have been removed.

253
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:32,219
Well, the State must protect
its secrets, Comrade.

254
00:23:32,303 --> 00:23:34,762
Do you dare
suggest otherwise?

255
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:37,178
They made a mistake.

256
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,845
They didn't redact
the table of contents.

257
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:54,303
The missing pages
apparently refer

258
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:58,303
to a positive void
coefficient and AZ-5.

259
00:23:59,219 --> 00:24:00,595
Does that mean
anything to you?

What are you after here?
Why are you asking me this?

261
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,470
You worked with the reactor.
You know it better than I do.

262
00:24:05,553 --> 00:24:08,637
So everything's
my fault, then?

263
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,762
Is that what this is?

264
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:11,345
I'm not here
to blame you.

265
00:24:11,428 --> 00:24:13,928
I'm here to find out
what happened.

266
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:15,345
And whether you
realize it or not,

267
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:17,678
I'm your best chance
to avoid a bullet.

268
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:22,136
Can you help me or not?

00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,969
I have no idea what
would've gone here.

270
00:24:33,053 --> 00:24:36,094
Void coefficients have
nothing to do with AZ-5.

271
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:39,011
There.
Now you can go.

272
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:41,887
- You're not even curious?
- What for?

273
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:46,386
You think the right question
will get you the truth? (scoffs)

274
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,678
There is no truth.

275
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:53,637
Ask the bosses whatever you
want and you'll get the lie.

276
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,053
And I will get the bullet.

One.

282
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:35,887
Don't point this gun at me.
That's easy, right?

283
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,887
You can point it
at this piece of shit.

284
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:40,094
I don't give a fuck.
Never me.

285
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:41,969
Two.

286
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:45,428
If you hit an animal
and it doesn't die,

287
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:48,219
keep shooting
until it does.

We were moving
through a house,

341

and I shot him in the stomach.

boom, stomach.

00:32:48,011 --> 00:32:49,969

pull the trigger again

Tarakanov:
Comrade soldiers,

497
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,428
the Soviet people have had
enough of this accident.

498
00:48:58,511 --> 00:49:00,094
They want us to clean this up,

499
00:49:00,178 --> 00:49:02,845
and we have entrusted you
with this serious task.

500
00:49:02,928 --> 00:49:05,219
Because of the nature
of the working area,

501
00:49:05,303 --> 00:49:09,261
you will each have no more than
90 seconds to solve this problem.

502
00:49:09,345 --> 00:49:12,219
Listen carefully to each
of my instructions,

503
00:49:12,303 --> 00:49:14,762
and do exactly as
you have been told.

504
00:49:14,845 --> 00:49:19,511
This is for your own safety and
the safety of your comrades.

505
00:49:19,595 --> 00:49:21,887
You will enter
Reactor Building Three,

506
00:49:21,969 --> 00:49:25,720
climb the stairs but do not
immediately proceed to the roof.

507
00:49:25,803 --> 00:49:27,803
When you get to the top,
wait inside,

508
00:49:27,887 --> 00:49:30,887
behind the entrance to the
roof and catch your breath.

509
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:33,511
You will need it
for what comes next.

510
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:36,637
This is the working area.
We must clear the graphite.

511
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,219
Some of it is in blocks, weighing
approximately 40 to 50 kilograms.

512
00:49:40,303 --> 00:49:42,428
They all must be thrown
over the edge here.

513
00:49:42,511 --> 00:49:46,428
Watch your comrades moving
fast from this opening,

514
00:49:46,511 --> 00:49:48,094
then turning to the left,

515
00:49:48,178 --> 00:49:50,303
and entering the workspace here.

516
00:49:50,386 --> 00:49:52,011
Take care not to stumble.

517
00:49:52,094 --> 00:49:55,595
There's a hole in the roof.
Take care not to fall.

518
00:49:55,678 --> 00:50:00,386
You will need to move quickly, and
you will need to move carefully.

Tarakanov: These are the most
important 90 of your lives.

522
00:50:08,553 --> 00:50:11,969
Commit your task to memory,

Toptunov was telling the truth.

588
00:56:40,595 --> 00:56:43,969
They shut the reactor down,
and then it exploded.

Please, believe me
when I tell you that

593
00:57:02,637 --> 00:57:05,053
I had no idea it could
cause an explosion.

594
00:57:05,136 --> 00:57:08,136
- None of us knew.
- None of you knew what?

595
00:57:09,428 --> 00:57:12,428
In 1975, in an RBMK
reactor in Leningrad,

596
00:57:12,511 --> 00:57:14,845
a fuel channel ruptured.

597
00:57:14,928 --> 00:57:16,720
The operators pressed AZ-5,

598
00:57:16,803 --> 00:57:19,553
but instead of the power
going down immediately,

599
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:22,511
for a brief moment
it went up.

600
00:57:22,595 --> 00:57:24,345
How is that possible?

601
00:57:24,428 --> 00:57:25,803
Well, this was
the very question posed

602
00:57:25,887 --> 00:57:27,803
by a colleague of mine
named Volkov.

603
00:57:27,887 --> 00:57:29,845
He's the one who
wrote this article.

604
00:57:29,928 --> 00:57:33,678
When an RBMK reactor runs at low
power, it's notoriously unstable.

605
00:57:33,762 --> 00:57:37,094
Prone to swings
in reactivity.

606
00:57:37,178 --> 00:57:38,595
Under normal circumstances,

607
00:57:38,678 --> 00:57:40,511
the control rods can
compensate for that.

608
00:57:40,595 --> 00:57:41,969
Under normal circumstances.

609
00:57:42,053 --> 00:57:45,511
The Chernobyl staff stalled
the reactor during the test.

610
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,428
They pulled almost
all the control rods out

611
00:57:47,511 --> 00:57:51,345
- to bring the power back up.
- This is what Volkov learned from Leningrad.

612
00:57:51,428 --> 00:57:52,845
If the boron control rods

613
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:55,637
are completely withdrawn
from the reactor,

614
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,011
when they're put back in,

615
00:57:57,094 --> 00:58:00,219
the first thing that enters
the core isn't boron.

616
00:58:00,303 --> 00:58:02,511
It's graphite.

617
00:58:05,678 --> 00:58:07,928
The control rods
have graphite tips

618
00:58:08,011 --> 00:58:10,428
that displace
water and steam.

619
00:58:10,511 --> 00:58:12,845
So the reactivity
doesn't go down.

620
00:58:12,928 --> 00:58:15,011
It goes up dramatically.

621
00:58:15,094 --> 00:58:18,470
(scoffs) Why on Earth would
they press that button?

622
00:58:18,553 --> 00:58:20,553
They didn't know.

623
00:58:22,386 --> 00:58:25,011
Legasov: Volkov
warned the Kremlin,

624
00:58:25,094 --> 00:58:26,845
ten years ago.

625
00:58:27,595 --> 00:58:30,136
(sighs) But there
could be no doubt

626
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:34,094
about the supremacy of
the Soviet nuclear industry.

627
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,011
Ah.

628
00:58:36,094 --> 00:58:39,762
The KGB classified it
as a state secret.

629
00:58:42,011 --> 00:58:43,511
Legasov: When I saw the
reactor blown open,

630
00:58:43,595 --> 00:58:47,053
I still didn't think it could
be this flaw in AZ-5.

631
00:58:47,136 --> 00:58:50,178
Because the flaw will not
lead to an explosion

632
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:55,428
unless the operators have pushed the
reactor to the edge of disaster.

633
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:58,345
- So it is their fault?
- Yes.

634
00:58:58,428 --> 00:59:00,470
But not only
their fault.

635
00:59:01,887 --> 00:59:03,386
No.

636
00:59:04,511 --> 00:59:07,094
Is that what you're
going to say in Vienna?

637
00:59:08,803 --> 00:59:09,928
(sighs)

638
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:13,011
You can't possibly
be that naive.

639
00:59:13,094 --> 00:59:16,511
There are 16 RBMK reactors

640
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:19,386
running in the Soviet Union
right now.

641
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,428
We have to fix them.

642
00:59:21,511 --> 00:59:24,219
The only way to do that
is to go public,

643
00:59:24,303 --> 00:59:26,303
force the Central Committee
to take action.

644
00:59:26,386 --> 00:59:29,386
What you're proposing is that
Legasov humiliate a nation

645
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,470
that is obsessed with
not being humiliated.

646
00:59:32,553 --> 00:59:35,011
We can make a deal
with the KGB.

647
00:59:35,094 --> 00:59:37,178
You'll leave this information
out in Vienna,

648
00:59:37,261 --> 00:59:40,386
and they quietly let us fix
the remaining reactors.

649
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:42,803
A deal with the KGB?

650
00:59:42,887 --> 00:59:44,595
And I'm "naive."

talk to the world, Valery.

00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:55,928
But it isn't, is it?

655
00:59:57,178 --> 01:00:00,303
I've know braver souls
than you, Khomyuk.

656
01:00:00,386 --> 01:00:02,553
Men who had their moment
and did nothing.

657
01:00:02,637 --> 01:00:06,762
Because when it's your life and
the lives of everyone you love,

658
01:00:06,845 --> 01:00:09,470
your moral conviction
doesn't mean anything.

659
01:00:09,553 --> 01:00:11,678
It leaves you.

660
01:00:11,762 --> 01:00:16,303
And all you want at that moment
is not to be shot.

661
01:00:20,345 --> 01:00:22,720
Do you know the name
Vasily Ignatenko?

662
01:00:22,803 --> 01:00:24,345
No.

663
01:00:25,678 --> 01:00:28,428
He was a fireman.

664
01:00:28,511 --> 01:00:31,595
He died two weeks
after the accident.

665
01:00:31,678 --> 01:00:34,553
I've been looking in
on his widow.

666
01:00:34,637 --> 01:00:36,428
She gave birth.

667
01:00:36,511 --> 01:00:37,928
A girl.

668
01:00:38,011 --> 01:00:40,303
The baby lived
for four hours.

669
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:43,345
They said the radiation
would have killed the mother,

670
01:00:43,428 --> 01:00:46,094
but the baby
absorbed it instead.

671
01:00:46,178 --> 01:00:47,595
Her baby.

672
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:50,720
We live in a country

673
01:00:50,803 --> 01:00:53,511
where children have to die
to save their mothers.

674
01:00:54,762 --> 01:00:56,887
To hell with your deal.

675
01:00:58,887 --> 01:01:01,219
And to hell with our lives.

676
01:01:02,803 --> 01:01:05,053
Someone has to start
telling the truth.

JUDGE: This session of court

The state calls Comrade Khomyuk.

702

ULANA KHOMYUK: To understand
what happened that night,

703
01:05:55,762 --> 01:05:58,053
we have to go back
to the first critical moment.

The time is 28 past midnight.

Once it's over,
we will have our villains.

We will have our hero.
We will have our truth.

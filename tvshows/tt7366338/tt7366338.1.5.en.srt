1
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:11,384
Congratulations, comrades.
You're the last of 3,828 men.

2
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:16,343
I found this
in the state archive.

3
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:17,426
I need your help.

4
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:20,051
Can you confirm
that the reactor exploded

5
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:22,217
after they attempted
to shut it down?

6
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:23,569
What, you think
the right question

7
00:00:23,593 --> 00:00:24,801
will get you the truth?

8
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,046
They're going
to put Dyatlov on trial.

9
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:31,051
We're going to be asked
to give expert testimony.

10
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:32,718
I've analyzed the data.

11
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:35,760
They shut the reactor down,
and then it exploded.

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,885
You've seen this before.

13
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:40,051
I had no idea it could cause
an explosion.

14
00:00:40,134 --> 00:00:42,027
- So, it is their fault?
- Yes.

15
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:43,235
But not only their fault.

16
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:44,943
We can make a deal with the KGB.

17
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:46,843
You'll leave this information
out in Vienna.

18
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:49,676
They quietly let us
fix the remaining reactors.

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,926
You have a chance
to talk to the world.

20
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:54,259
Someone has to start
telling the truth.

21
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:32,176
I hear they might
promote Bryukhanov.

22
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:36,259
This little problem we have
with the safety test...

23
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:40,092
if it's completed successfully,

24
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:43,926
yes, I think promotion's
very likely.

25
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:46,176
Who knows, maybe Moscow.

26
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:50,384
Naturally, they'll put me
in charge once he's gone,

27
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:53,509
and then I'll need someone
to take my old job.

28
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,593
I could pick Sitnikov.

29
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:08,468
I would like to be considered.

30
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:13,176
I'll keep that in mind.

31
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:16,551
Viktor Petrovich,

32
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:18,885
preparations for the test
have gone smoothly.

33
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,217
Comrade Dyatlov's been
working per my instructions,

34
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:26,551
and Reactor 4 output's been
reduced to 1600 megawatts.

35
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:30,134
With your approval,
we're ready to continue lowering power to...

36
00:04:30,217 --> 00:04:32,009
We have to wait.

37
00:04:33,092 --> 00:04:34,426
Is, uh...?

38
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:37,426
Are you going to ask me if
there's a problem, Nikolai?

39
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:39,760
You can't read
a fucking face?

40
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:42,384
Three years,
I've tried to finish this test.

41
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:44,009
Three years.

42
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:53,092
I've just had a call from
the grid controller in Kiev.

43
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:55,426
He says we can't
lower power any further,

44
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:56,676
not for another
ten hours.

45
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,551
The grid controller?
Where does he get off...

46
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:02,551
It's not the grid controller's decision,
Dyatlov.

47
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,676
It's the end of the month.

48
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,384
All the productivity quotas.

49
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:10,217
Everyone's working overtime,
the factories need power.

50
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:12,176
Someone's pushing
down from above.

51
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,843
Although,
we'll never know who.

52
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:24,676
So, do we have to scrap it
or what?

53
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,134
No, I don't think so.

54
00:05:27,217 --> 00:05:29,134
If we need to wait
ten hours,

55
00:05:29,217 --> 00:05:30,843
- we wait
- Running at half power,

56
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:33,217
we're not going to have
stability issues?

57
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:36,551
- No, I-I should think...
- I'm not asking you.

58
00:05:39,176 --> 00:05:40,509
It's safe.

59
00:05:40,593 --> 00:05:42,134
We'll maintain at 1600.

60
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,801
I'll go home, get some sleep,
come back tonight.

61
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:46,843
We'll proceed then.

62
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:49,217
I'll personally
supervise the test.

63
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,801
And it will be completed.

64
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:58,217
Well, I'm not waiting
around then.

65
00:05:58,301 --> 00:05:59,801
Call me when it's done.

66
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,843
How do you feel?

67
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:42,134
You went
to the doctor yesterday.

68
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:44,343
How is your health?

69
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:46,635
You don't know?

70
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,301
From Vienna.

71
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:50,926
Do you read German?

72
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:57,926
It says, "At last a Soviet
scientist who tells the truth."

73
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,843
Obviously, I resent
the insinuation,

74
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:03,551
but I think it's fair to say, you made an
excellent impression at the conference.

75
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:06,635
Turns out,
you're quite good at this.

76
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:08,593
At what? Lying?

77
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:11,676
Statecraft, Legasov.
Statecraft.

78
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,176
The West is now satisfied

79
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,217
that Chernobyl was solely
the result of operator error,

80
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:19,301
which it essentially was.

81
00:08:19,384 --> 00:08:21,301
We have you
to thank for that,

82
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:23,051
and we intend to.

83
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:29,551
"Hero of the Soviet Union."

84
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,676
Our highest honor.

85
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,509
They haven't even
given it to me.

86
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:38,593
"Promotion to Director
of the Kurchatov Institute."

87
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:42,635
I'm humbled.

88
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:47,259
I don't think there's anything humble
about you, Valery Alexeyevich.

89
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:49,801
These rewards are
not yours yet.

90
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:51,635
First, your testimony
at the trial.

91
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:56,885
Comrade Charkov,
I understand my duty to the State.

92
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:59,635
But you gave us
assurances.

93
00:08:59,718 --> 00:09:02,134
The reactors
would be made safe.

94
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:04,635
It's been months,
no changes have been made.

95
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:08,384
- No changes even discussed.
- First, the trial.

96
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:11,926
Once it's over,
we will have our villains,

97
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:16,051
we will have our hero,
we will have our truth.

98
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:19,676
After that, we can deal
with the reactors.

99
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,092
Did you take a train?

100
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:48,926
Yes, I took a train.

101
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:51,843
Now let's talk about Vienna.

102
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:53,967
I'm not here to scold you.

103
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:57,718
I know how the world works
despite what Shcherbina says.

104
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:02,301
So... why are you here?

105
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:05,301
Because I'm
brutally stubborn.

106
00:11:05,384 --> 00:11:07,593
Which you were
hoping for.

107
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:15,801
Charkov is saying they're going to
fix the reactors after the trial.

108
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,926
Do you believe him?

109
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:24,009
The State will never
willingly fix the reactors,

110
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:27,718
because acknowledging the problem
means admitting that they lied.

111
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:29,718
They will have to be forced.

112
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:40,426
At the trial,
you're going to tell the truth.

113
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,885
You're going
to convince the jury.

114
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,217
It's a show trial.

115
00:11:46,301 --> 00:11:50,426
- The jury's already been handed their verdict.
- I'm not talking about them.

116
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:53,801
The Central Committee
have invited

117
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:57,509
members of the scientific
community to observe the trial.

118
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:01,259
Our colleagues,
from Kurchatov,

119
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:03,384
from Sredmash,
from Minenergo,

120
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:07,176
they will be sitting in the crowd
listening to every word you say.

121
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,343
A jury that only
we know is there.

122
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:13,509
And when your testimony arrives
at the moment of the explosion?

123
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,635
That is when our jury will
finally hear the truth.

124
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:21,509
- And do what with it?
- Insist on reform.

125
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:26,718
- Not just to the RBMK, but the entire industry.
- No, no, no, no, no.

126
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:29,217
- They can't function without us.
- No, no, no.

127
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:31,509
Do you know
what happened to Volkov

128
00:12:31,593 --> 00:12:34,051
the man whose
report you found?

129
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:38,843
They just removed him from
his position at the Institute.

130
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,051
Sacked for the crime
of knowing.

131
00:12:42,134 --> 00:12:44,426
And you think that
these scientists,

132
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:47,259
handpicked to witness
a show trial,

133
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:50,967
will somehow be stirred
into action by me?

134
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:55,092
Because of some heroic stance
I take in defiance of the State?

135
00:12:55,176 --> 00:12:57,051
- Yes.
- Why?

136
00:12:57,134 --> 00:13:01,092
Because you're Valery Legasov,
and you mean something.

137
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:05,843
I'd like to think that if I
spoke out, it would be enough.

138
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:09,509
But I know
how the world works.

139
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:15,468
They will shoot me, Khomyuk.

140
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:21,551
You told me
to find out what happened.

141
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,760
I spoke to dozens of people.

142
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:28,384
Every word they said,
I wrote down.

143
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:30,801
All in these books.

144
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:32,551
These are the ones
who are still alive.

145
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,301
These are the ones
who are dead.

146
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:35,967
They died rescuing each other.

147
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:39,259
Putting out fires,
tending to the wounded.

148
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:41,134
They didn't hesitate,
they didn't waiver.

149
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:43,384
They simply did
what had to be done.

150
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:45,718
So have I.

151
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:47,635
So have I.

152
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:50,635
I went willingly
to an open reactor.

153
00:13:50,718 --> 00:13:54,009
So I've already
given my life.

154
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:56,217
Isn't that enough?

155
00:13:57,718 --> 00:14:00,885
No, I'm sorry,
but it is not.

156
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:12,259
The Central Committee of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union

157
00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:15,343
and the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.

158
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:17,343
has determined that
justice be carried out

159
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:18,843
on behalf of the People

160
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:21,426
in accordance with
the general goal of our Party

161
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:25,217
as determined by its 20th,
21st, and 22nd Congresses,

162
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:27,217
which is a Leninist goal.

163
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,509
It was, is, and will be

164
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:31,259
the only immutable goal
in the Soviet state.

165
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:32,635
The path of Leninist principles

166
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:35,426
shall be consistently
and undeviatingly followed

167
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:38,760
as it expresses the vital
interests of the Soviet People,

168
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:40,092
its hopes and aspirations

169
00:15:40,176 --> 00:15:42,343
as we guide the life
of the Party and the State.

170
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:44,635
This session of court
is now open,

171
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:47,843
Comrade Judge Milan
Kadnikov presiding.

172
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:50,509
Indictments:

173
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:52,635
Viktor Bryukhanov,

174
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,926
Anatoly Dyatlov,

175
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:56,926
Nikolai Fomin...

176
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:59,967
are accused of violating
Article 220 Section 2

177
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:02,092
of the Criminal Code
of the Soviet Union,

178
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:07,217
resulting in a nuclear disaster
on April 26, 1986.

179
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,801
The State calls witnesses
Comrade Khomyuk

180
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,259
of the Byelorussian
Nuclear Institute,

181
00:16:12,343 --> 00:16:16,426
Comrade Legasov of the Kurchatov
Institute of Atomic Energy,

182
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:21,092
and Comrade Boris
Evdokimovich Shcherbina,

183
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:23,593
Deputy Chairman of
the Council of Ministers

184
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:27,217
and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.

185
00:17:01,092 --> 00:17:06,676
It began with, of all things,
a safety test.

186
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,676
Why was there need
for a safety test at all?

187
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,009
Reactor Number 4 was not new
when the accident occurred.

188
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:19,635
In fact, it went into operation
on December 20th, 1983.

189
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:23,676
Eleven days later,
on the last day of the year,

190
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,509
Plant Director Viktor Bryukhanov
signed this document...

191
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:34,926
certifying the completion of
the construction of the reactor.

192
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:40,967
As a result of finishing the
work before the end of the year,

193
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:44,801
Comrade Bryukhanov was awarded
Hero of Socialist Labor.

194
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:49,551
Comrade Fomin was awarded
for Valorous Labor.

195
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:54,301
Comrade Dyatlov was given
an Order of the Red Banner.

196
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:58,843
But their work was not finished.

197
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:04,593
And this document was a lie.

198
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:07,551
In order to sign
this certificate,

199
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:12,009
all safety tests had to have
been successfully completed,

200
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,217
and yet, one remained.

201
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:22,426
A nuclear reactor generates
heat in the core here.

202
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:24,718
A series of pumps,
here and here,

203
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:28,259
send a constant flow of cooling
water through the core.

204
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:30,801
The core's heat turns
the water to steam,

205
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:33,259
and the steam spins
the turbine here,

206
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,635
and the result is electricity.

207
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:39,468
But what if a power plant
has no power?

208
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:43,926
What if the power feeding
the plant itself is disrupted?

209
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:46,551
A blackout, equipment failure,

210
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:49,426
or an attack
by a foreign enemy?

211
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:51,301
If there's no power,

212
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:54,259
the pumps cannot move
water through the core.

213
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,134
And without water,
the core overheats,

214
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:58,718
the fuel melts down.

215
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:01,217
In short, a nuclear disaster.

216
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:02,967
The solution?

217
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:06,967
Three diesel fuel
backup generators here.

218
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:09,301
So, problem solved?

219
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:11,009
No.

220
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:13,635
Bryukhanov knew that the problem
was not solved at all.

221
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:17,134
The backup generators took
approximately one minute

222
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:19,509
to reach the speed required

223
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,635
to power the pumps
and prevent a meltdown,

224
00:19:21,718 --> 00:19:26,259
and by that time,
it would be too late.

225
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:28,718
So we arrive
at the safety test.

226
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:34,051
If the facility lost power,

227
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:35,967
the turbine,
which had been spinning,

228
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,760
would take some time
to slow down and stop.

229
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:41,217
What if you could take
the electricity

230
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:44,509
it was still generating
and transfer it to the pumps?

231
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:46,176
What if the dying turbine

232
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,384
could keep the pumps
working long enough

233
00:19:48,468 --> 00:19:52,926
to bridge the 60-second gap
until the generators came on?

234
00:19:57,801 --> 00:19:59,259
Any questions?

235
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:04,134
No. Continue, please.

236
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,967
To test this theory,

237
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:11,009
the reactor is placed
in a reduced power mode...

238
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:12,676
700 megawatts...

239
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,343
to simulate
a blackout condition.

240
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:17,343
Then the turbines
are turned off,

241
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,426
and as they slowly spin down,

242
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,301
their electrical output is
measured

243
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:25,051
to see if it's enough
to power the pumps.

244
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:27,384
The science is strong,

245
00:20:27,468 --> 00:20:32,509
but a test is only as good
as the men carrying it out.

246
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:37,217
Now, the first time they tried,
they failed.

247
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:40,051
The second time they tried,
they failed.

248
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:42,801
The third time they tried,
they failed.

249
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:45,885
The fourth time they tried

250
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:50,134
was April 26th, 1986.

251
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,843
Comrade Khomyuk.

252
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,259
To understand
what happened that night,

253
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:31,343
we have to go back
ten hours earlier...

254
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:34,926
April 25th, the day the test
was meant to take place.

255
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:36,259
By two in the afternoon,

256
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:38,384
the reactor has been
lowered by half

257
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:41,635
from its normal output level
of 3200 megawatts

258
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,926
to 1600 megawatts
and is stable

259
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,134
and ready to be reduced to its
final output level for the test:

260
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:49,134
700 megawatts.

261
00:21:49,217 --> 00:21:53,176
But before they can proceed,
there is a phone call.

262
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:57,217
Power grid officials in Kiev
say that they cannot afford

263
00:21:57,301 --> 00:22:00,676
a further reduction in the
electricity until after midnight.

264
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,384
They are asking
for a ten-hour delay.

265
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:06,301
This is the first
critical moment,

266
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:08,843
the first link
in the chain of disaster.

267
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:13,509
Competent management would have
insisted on canceling the test.

268
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:16,593
These three men
allowed it to proceed.

269
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:20,301
Why was this delay
so dangerous?

270
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:23,051
It created two problems:

271
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:26,092
One of them is
scientific in nature...

272
00:22:27,217 --> 00:22:29,843
and the other is very human.

273
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:32,051
This is the one
we will consider first.

274
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:37,092
At midnight,
there is a shift change.

275
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,343
Hey.

276
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:54,676
- Khodemchuk...
- Forget it. Find another fool.

277
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,718
Toptunov, want to buy
a motorcycle?

278
00:22:57,801 --> 00:23:00,176
- Toptunov?
- He's just a little boy.

279
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:02,179
He's got more hair on his face
than on his balls.

280
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:04,551
Hair? Is that
what's on his lip?

281
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,217
Leonid Fedorovych.

282
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:10,885
Akimov says to come to the
control room as soon as you can.

283
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:12,718
- Is he already here?
- He came in early.

284
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:14,801
Something about a test.

285
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:19,967
You see? Desperate.

286
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,468
Sasha?

287
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:34,217
Ah. You know the test
they were supposed to run?

288
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:36,885
The turbine rundown,
they tried it last year.

289
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:40,384
They couldn't do it on the day shift,
so they've given it to us.

290
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:41,509
To us?

291
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:43,176
- We don't know what...
- Shh.

292
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:46,885
We don't know what it is.
- It's fine.

293
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,092
We take it down to 700,
hold it there,

294
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:51,926
the rest is Stolyarchuk
and Kirschenbaum, but...

295
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:54,259
Dyatlov is gonna be supervising.

296
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:56,843
I have to do something
I've never done before

297
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:58,277
with Dyatlov looking
over my shoulder?

298
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:01,176
Yeah, well, don't worry,
we'll do it together.

299
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:03,843
I'm looking at
the instructions now.

300
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:07,468
Are we supposed to do
those or not?

301
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:17,926
Yes, this is Akimov in 4.

302
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:21,593
I have the manual
for the rundown test.

303
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:24,509
You did it last year.

304
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:26,967
Yes, in the program there's
instructions of what to do,

305
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:29,509
and then, well, there's
a lot of things crossed out.

306
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,051
What should I...?

307
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:34,718
Well, what should I...?

308
00:24:36,551 --> 00:24:38,092
Are you sure?

309
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,885
Right. Thank you.

310
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:45,051
He says to follow
the crossed-out instructions.

311
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:47,343
So then why are
they crossed out?

312
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,468
We've been cleared
to run the test.

313
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:58,301
1600. Good.

314
00:24:58,384 --> 00:25:01,551
Now, is it too much to ask that
you all know what you're doing?

315
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:03,676
- Well...
- Yes. Absolutely.

316
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:06,468
- Stolyarchuk?
- Yes.

317
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:09,593
- Kirschenbaum?
- Uh, I haven't reviewed.

318
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,551
We only just
found out really...

319
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,926
There, review it.

320
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:14,843
Or you can just
do what I tell you.

321
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:17,967
I think even you,
stupid as you are, can manage that.

322
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:20,551
Well, let's go.

323
00:25:23,593 --> 00:25:26,110
I'm supposed to switch the turbine off
while the reactor's still running?

324
00:25:26,134 --> 00:25:30,426
- This is not good...
- Shut the fuck up and do your job!

325
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:34,301
Toptunov, reduce power to 700.

326
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:38,611
I've never done this with
the power so low before.

327
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:40,885
It's okay. I'm with you.

328
00:25:45,926 --> 00:25:47,718
Reducing power to 700.

329
00:25:48,926 --> 00:25:51,468
I want you to think
of Yuri Gagarin.

330
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:55,885
I want you to imagine that
he has been told nothing

331
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:59,718
of his mission into space until the
moment that he is on the launch pad.

332
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:01,885
I want you to imagine
that all he has

333
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:04,676
is a list of instructions
that he has never seen before,

334
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,217
some of which
have been crossed out.

335
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:09,217
This is exactly
what was happening

336
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,926
in the control room
of Reactor 4.

337
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:14,384
The night shift had not been
trained to perform the experiment.

338
00:26:14,468 --> 00:26:17,217
They hadn't even been
warned it was happening.

339
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,092
Leonid Toptunov,

340
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:22,718
the operator responsible
for controlling and stabilizing

341
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:27,967
the reactor that night was...
all of 25 years old.

342
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:32,343
And his total experience
on the job?

343
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,134
Four months.

344
00:26:35,217 --> 00:26:38,176
This is the human problem
created by the delay.

345
00:26:39,092 --> 00:26:41,885
But inside the reactor core,

346
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,092
in the space between
the atoms themselves,

347
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:47,426
something far more
dangerous is forming.

348
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:48,967
A poison.

349
00:26:50,635 --> 00:26:52,843
The time is 28 past midnight.

350
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:13,343
Comrade Legasov.

351
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:52,801
I'm pleased to see some
of my colleagues here

352
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:56,635
from the Kurchatov Institute
and Minenergo.

353
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,092
But you don't need
to be a nuclear scientist

354
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:02,217
to understand what
happened at Chernobyl.

355
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:04,301
You only need to know this:

356
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:06,967
there are essentially
two things that happen

357
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:09,676
inside a nuclear reactor.

358
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,301
The reactivity
which generates power

359
00:28:12,384 --> 00:28:16,259
either goes up,
or it goes down.

360
00:28:16,343 --> 00:28:17,760
That's it.

361
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:22,092
All the operators do
is maintain balance.

362
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,885
Uranium fuel.

363
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:30,760
As uranium atoms
split apart and collide,

364
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,384
reactivity goes up.

365
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:34,676
But if you don't
balance the reactivity,

366
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,967
it never stops rising. So...

367
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,217
Boron control rods.

368
00:28:41,301 --> 00:28:45,926
They reduce reactivity
like brakes on a car.

369
00:28:47,468 --> 00:28:51,468
But there's a third factor
to consider: water.

370
00:28:52,843 --> 00:28:55,343
Cool water takes heat
out of the system.

371
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:58,760
As it does, it turns to steam,
or what we call a "void."

372
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:02,259
In an RBMK reactor of
the type used at Chernobyl,

373
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:06,384
there's something called
a "positive void coefficient."

374
00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:08,217
What does that mean?

375
00:29:08,301 --> 00:29:12,760
It means that the more steam
present within the system,

376
00:29:12,843 --> 00:29:14,843
the higher the reactivity,

377
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:17,967
which means more heat,
which means more steam,

378
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:19,593
which means...

379
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:23,593
It would appear we have
a vicious cycle on our hands.

380
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:26,551
And we would,
were it not for this...

381
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:37,967
And we would,
were it not for this:

382
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:41,468
the negative temperature
coefficient.

383
00:29:41,551 --> 00:29:47,551
When nuclear fuel gets hotter,
it gets less reactive, so...

384
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:51,176
fuel increases reactivity.

385
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:54,217
Control rods and water
reduce it.

386
00:29:54,301 --> 00:29:56,593
Steam increases it,

387
00:29:56,676 --> 00:29:59,967
and the rise in
temperature reduces it.

388
00:30:00,051 --> 00:30:03,676
This is the invisible dance

389
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,593
that powers entire cities
without smoke or flame.

390
00:30:07,676 --> 00:30:10,967
And it is beautiful

391
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:13,051
when things are normal.

392
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:17,217
As uranium splits apart
to release energy,

393
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:20,801
it breaks down
into a new element, xenon.

394
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,760
Xenon reduces reactivity.

395
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:27,259
This is the poison
Comrade Khomyuk mentioned.

396
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:29,301
When the core is
running at full power,

397
00:30:29,384 --> 00:30:32,384
it burns the xenon away
before it can cause a problem.

398
00:30:32,468 --> 00:30:34,593
But because of the delay,

399
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:38,551
Chernobyl Reactor 4 has
been held at half power

400
00:30:38,635 --> 00:30:40,217
for ten hours.

401
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:43,051
The xenon did not burn away.

402
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:48,760
It built up, poisoning the core.

403
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:50,509
We're starting to lose balance.

404
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:54,676
At 28 minutes past midnight,

405
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,176
the reactor is now
primed to slow down.

406
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:01,760
And yet, in less than an hour,
it will explode.

407
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:05,635
If you can't understand
how a stalled nuclear reactor

408
00:31:05,718 --> 00:31:08,426
could lead to an explosion,
I don't blame you.

409
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:10,551
After all, you don't work
in the control room

410
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,384
of a nuclear power plant.

411
00:31:12,468 --> 00:31:17,885
But as it turned out,
the men who did

412
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:20,176
didn't understand it either.

413
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,635
Easy now.

414
00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:29,718
Take it down.

415
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:31,885
Good. Like that.

416
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,485
You should have
finished by now.

417
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:35,551
We're following protocol
for reduction rate.

418
00:31:35,635 --> 00:31:37,259
You're procrastinating.

419
00:31:37,343 --> 00:31:39,943
There are ten other men in this
plant who would've done it already.

420
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:42,635
Keep working.
You're doing fine.

421
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:55,343
Kirschenbaum, come get me
when these old women are ready.

422
00:31:55,426 --> 00:31:56,843
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

423
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,718
Okay, very slow now.

424
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:20,718
Let's ease it down to 700.

425
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,676
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow.
- I-I didn't move any rods there.

426
00:32:36,718 --> 00:32:40,384
- What is this?
- I'm not even touching it.

427
00:33:05,092 --> 00:33:07,760
We did everything right.
I think that maybe the core is poisoned.

428
00:33:07,843 --> 00:33:09,360
Well, if you thought
the core was poisoned,

429
00:33:09,384 --> 00:33:10,611
then you didn't
do everything right,

430
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:12,009
because you're
choking my reactor!

431
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:12,967
Get it back up!

432
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:15,343
Uh, I think
if we turn off LAC,

433
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,259
it may be possible
to get more control.

434
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:20,176
- Do it. Go.
- Switch off local automatic control.

435
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:23,051
Go to global.
Leonid.

436
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,843
LAC disabled.
Global control activated.

437
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,426
What did you do?

438
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:37,092
I-I did what you said.
I switched... Look at it!

439
00:33:38,176 --> 00:33:40,551
- I don't understand.
- Fucking amateurs.

440
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:42,426
You stalled the reactor.

441
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:44,343
How the fuck did
you get this job?

442
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:47,110
- Comrade Dyatlov...
- You're gonna tell me you did everything right again,

443
00:33:47,134 --> 00:33:48,635
you incompetent asshole?

444
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:52,092
I apologize for this
unsatisfactory result.

445
00:33:56,885 --> 00:34:00,593
- What are you doing?
- We have to shut all the way down.

446
00:34:00,676 --> 00:34:03,134
- No.
- We could be in a xenon pit.

447
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:04,652
We have to shut down
and wait for 24 hours.

448
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,801
No. We're doing the test
tonight. Raise power to 700.

449
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:08,235
We can't raise
the power from here.

450
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:09,902
- The rules...
- Don't talk to me about rules.

451
00:34:09,926 --> 00:34:12,092
- If we fall from 80%...
- No, no. We fell from 50%.

452
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,496
- Fifty percent is worse!
- The rules don't say 50!

453
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:17,718
- There is no rule!
- Comrade Dyatlov,

454
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:19,843
I apologize, but what you're
saying makes no sense.

455
00:34:19,926 --> 00:34:22,551
- Raise the power.
- No.

456
00:34:22,635 --> 00:34:25,593
I won't do it.
It isn't safe.

457
00:34:34,426 --> 00:34:37,301
Safety first. Always.

458
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:40,384
I've been saying that
for 25 years.

459
00:34:40,468 --> 00:34:42,509
That's how long I've
done this job, 25 years.

460
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:44,051
Is that longer
than you, Akimov?

461
00:34:44,134 --> 00:34:45,051
Yes.

462
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:47,217
- Is it much longer?
- Yes.

463
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:50,426
And you with your mother's
tit barely out of your mouth?

464
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:54,718
So if I say it's safe,
it's safe.

465
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,134
And if the two
of you disagree,

466
00:34:56,217 --> 00:34:58,134
then you don't have to work
here and you won't.

467
00:34:58,217 --> 00:35:00,092
But not just here.
You won't work at Kursk

468
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:02,760
or Ignalina or Leningrad
or Novo-Voronezh.

469
00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:06,217
You won't work anywhere ever again.
I'll see to it.

470
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:09,051
I think you know
I will see to it.

471
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:12,009
Raise the power.

472
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:17,176
I would like you
to record your command.

473
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:19,676
Raise the power.

474
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:36,635
Together, then.

475
00:35:40,217 --> 00:35:41,885
I wasn't even there.

476
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:44,217
What?

477
00:35:46,092 --> 00:35:48,593
I wasn't in the room
when they raised the power.

478
00:35:48,676 --> 00:35:50,635
If you weren't there,
then where were you?

479
00:35:50,718 --> 00:35:53,718
Comrade Legasov, you are a witness,
not a prosecutor.

480
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:56,301
I will ask the questions here.

481
00:35:56,384 --> 00:35:59,551
If you weren't in the room,
then where were you?

482
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,051
The toilet.

483
00:36:04,885 --> 00:36:06,760
The toilet?

484
00:36:07,718 --> 00:36:09,509
Comrade Khomyuk
interviewed everyone

485
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:11,110
who was in the control
room that night.

486
00:36:11,134 --> 00:36:13,092
They all told the same story.

487
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:19,176
"I knew what Dyatlov
ordered was wrong,

488
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:22,134
but if I didn't do what
he said, I would be fired."

489
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:24,259
Leonid Toptunov.

490
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:27,843
One day before he died.

491
00:36:27,926 --> 00:36:29,843
No, Comrade Dyatlov,
you were in the room.

492
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:31,676
You ordered them
to raise the power.

493
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,301
This is a fact.

494
00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:44,718
Court is now in recess.

495
00:36:44,801 --> 00:36:46,301
Thirty minutes.

496
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:32,635
Do you know anything
about this town, Chernobyl?

497
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:35,635
Not really, no.

498
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:39,468
It was mostly Jews and Poles.

499
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,593
The Jews were
killed in pogroms,

500
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:45,176
and Stalin forced
the Poles out.

501
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:48,760
And then the Nazis came
and killed whoever was left.

502
00:37:48,843 --> 00:37:50,885
But after the war...

503
00:37:52,134 --> 00:37:54,343
people came to live
here anyway.

504
00:37:55,384 --> 00:37:59,092
They knew the ground under
their feet was soaked in blood,

505
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,885
but they didn't care.

506
00:38:02,217 --> 00:38:05,343
Dead Jews, dead Poles.

507
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:07,009
But not them.

508
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:13,176
No one ever thinks it's going
to happen to them.

509
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:16,009
And here we are.

510
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:27,593
How much time?

511
00:38:27,676 --> 00:38:29,051
Maybe a year.

512
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:32,468
They call it a...

513
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:34,760
They call it a "long illness."

514
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:37,635
It doesn't seem very long to me.

515
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:40,259
I know you told me,
and I believed you.

516
00:38:41,343 --> 00:38:43,134
But time passed,
and I thought,

517
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:45,843
it wouldn't happen to me.

518
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,718
I wasted it.

519
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:51,593
I wasted it all for nothing.

520
00:38:53,217 --> 00:38:54,885
For nothing?

521
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,718
Do you remember that morning
when I first called you,

522
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:00,593
how unconcerned I was?

523
00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:02,611
I don't believe much that
comes out of the Kremlin,

524
00:39:02,635 --> 00:39:04,593
but when they told me
they were putting me

525
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,843
in charge of the cleanup

526
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:10,885
and they said it wasn't serious,
I believed them.

527
00:39:12,468 --> 00:39:14,217
You know why?

528
00:39:15,259 --> 00:39:17,509
Because they put
you in charge.

529
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:19,092
Yeah.

530
00:39:22,051 --> 00:39:25,134
I'm an inconsequential man,
Valera.

531
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:27,092
That's all I've ever been.

532
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:31,384
I hoped that one day
I would matter, but I didn't.

533
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:36,635
I just stood
next to people who did.

534
00:39:38,718 --> 00:39:41,092
There are other
scientists like me.

535
00:39:41,176 --> 00:39:43,676
Any one of them could
have done what I did.

536
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,092
But you...

537
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,926
Everything we asked for,
everything we needed.

538
00:39:51,343 --> 00:39:55,134
Men, material, lunar rovers.

539
00:39:57,468 --> 00:39:59,635
Who else could have
done these things?

540
00:40:01,718 --> 00:40:05,051
They heard me,
but they listened to you.

541
00:40:05,134 --> 00:40:09,092
Of all the ministers
and all the deputies...

542
00:40:09,176 --> 00:40:13,718
entire congregation
of obedient fools...

543
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:17,843
they mistakenly sent
the one good man.

544
00:40:17,926 --> 00:40:19,926
For god's sake, Boris,

545
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:23,468
you were the one
who mattered most.

546
00:40:46,509 --> 00:40:48,343
Ah, it's beautiful.

547
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:32,217
Comrade Legasov.

548
00:41:44,551 --> 00:41:47,551
The time is 38 past midnight.

549
00:41:47,635 --> 00:41:49,635
The reactor is nearly shut down.

550
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:52,343
The operators of Reactor 4
are locked on a path

551
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,384
that leads directly to disaster.

552
00:41:54,468 --> 00:41:56,676
There's no way to turn back.

553
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,426
They do not yet know it,
but the die is cast.

554
00:41:59,509 --> 00:42:03,760
At 30 megawatts,
xenon is still being created,

555
00:42:03,843 --> 00:42:06,092
but none of it is burning away.

556
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:09,676
The reactor is
drowning in poison.

557
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,176
To make matters worse,
the reactor isn't hot enough

558
00:42:14,259 --> 00:42:17,051
to produce sufficient steam.

559
00:42:18,676 --> 00:42:21,509
The only way to safely raise
power from this state

560
00:42:21,593 --> 00:42:23,885
is to do it very, very slowly

561
00:42:23,967 --> 00:42:26,760
over the course of 24 hours.

562
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:29,384
But Dyatlov wants it done now.

563
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:33,843
Akimov and Toptunov have
only one course of action.

564
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:36,718
They begin pulling
control rods out.

565
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:37,926
Dozens at a time.

566
00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:41,051
Halfway out,
three-quarters of the way out,

567
00:42:41,134 --> 00:42:43,885
still, the power does not budge.

568
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:46,676
So they begin pulling
them all the way out.

569
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,551
There were 211 control rods
in Reactor 4.

570
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:55,259
Akimov and Toptunov
completely withdrew 205.

571
00:42:55,343 --> 00:43:00,009
Remember... control rods are
the brakes on this car.

572
00:43:00,092 --> 00:43:06,843
Of 211 rods, only six
now remain in the reactor.

573
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:10,885
As for the fuel,
it's gone cold,

574
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:13,051
so the negative
temperature coefficient

575
00:43:13,134 --> 00:43:15,593
is no longer weighing
down the reactivity.

576
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:19,593
But even still, the xenon
poisoning is so strong,

577
00:43:19,676 --> 00:43:23,843
the best they can do is raise
the power to 200 megawatts.

578
00:43:23,926 --> 00:43:26,885
The control rods are out.

579
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:29,426
The emergency system
has been disconnected.

580
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:31,760
The only thing keeping
the reactor in check

581
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:34,301
is water and xenon.

582
00:43:34,384 --> 00:43:38,635
It's one in the morning.
The test is minutes away.

583
00:44:12,926 --> 00:44:15,384
I'm sorry, this is
all we can get.

584
00:44:15,468 --> 00:44:18,426
It's 200 megawatts.
We've pulled almost everything out.

585
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:20,068
If that's all we have,
that's all we have.

586
00:44:20,092 --> 00:44:23,967
- But the test requires 700.
- Stolyarchuk, let's get ready.

587
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:25,694
- Switch on pump 4.
- No, wait a second.

588
00:44:25,718 --> 00:44:27,569
Stolyarchuk...
- We have barely enough steam as it is.

589
00:44:27,593 --> 00:44:30,193
The turbine is going too slow for the
test to deliver any valid results.

590
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:32,152
- It's enough.
- And if we add more water, there will be even less...

591
00:44:32,176 --> 00:44:34,134
I said it's enough.
I know what I'm doing.

592
00:44:34,217 --> 00:44:35,676
Stolyarchuk.

593
00:44:41,217 --> 00:44:42,760
Main Pump 4,
connected.

594
00:44:42,843 --> 00:44:44,694
We should warn Khodemchuk.
The pipes are gonna be...

595
00:44:44,718 --> 00:44:46,426
Never mind him.
Kirschenbaum?

596
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:52,176
The steam in the separator drum
is too low... five atmospheres.

597
00:44:52,259 --> 00:44:55,092
All right, let's all help him.
Get it up as best you can.

598
00:44:59,134 --> 00:45:01,009
We should stop.

599
00:45:01,092 --> 00:45:02,760
Turn that fucking
thing off.

600
00:45:02,843 --> 00:45:05,760
You have 15 minutes.

601
00:45:07,593 --> 00:45:09,718
Fifteen minutes.

602
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:12,468
They may as well
have had 15 days.

603
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:15,384
The problem they were facing
was not solvable.

604
00:45:15,468 --> 00:45:18,176
The power was too low,
the water was too high.

605
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:19,843
The test was already ruined.

606
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,551
The results would
have been useless,

607
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,134
but Dyatlov didn't care.

608
00:45:23,217 --> 00:45:26,593
All he wanted to do was
report a completed test.

609
00:45:27,509 --> 00:45:29,551
1:22 a.m.

610
00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:32,593
Less than two minutes remain.

611
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:38,176
Yuvchenko, a mechanical
engineer, is in his office.

612
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:43,885
Perevozchenko,
reactor section foreman,

613
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:45,593
is in the refueling hall,

614
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:50,301
high above the 1,000-ton
steel reactor cover.

615
00:45:50,384 --> 00:45:53,676
Degtaryenko and Khodemchuk,

616
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,843
circulation operators,
are in the pump room.

617
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:00,718
None of them have been told

618
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,092
about the test.

619
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,134
None of them know
what is about to happen.

620
00:46:04,217 --> 00:46:08,509
At 1:22 and 30 seconds,

621
00:46:08,593 --> 00:46:10,635
Toptunov sees a report

622
00:46:10,718 --> 00:46:14,676
from the reactor's
SKALA computer system.

623
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,051
Based on the absence
of sufficient control rods,

624
00:46:18,134 --> 00:46:21,676
the computer is recommending
that the reactor be shut down.

625
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:28,551
Well, of course
it's saying that.

626
00:46:28,635 --> 00:46:30,635
It doesn't know
we're running a test.

627
00:46:32,009 --> 00:46:33,301
All right, comrades.

628
00:46:34,843 --> 00:46:37,426
Another few minutes,
it will all be over.

629
00:46:37,509 --> 00:46:39,051
Kirschenbaum, when you're ready.

630
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:41,635
We did everything right.

631
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,176
Oscillograph on.

632
00:46:47,426 --> 00:46:49,967
Closing Number 8
throttle valve.

633
00:46:50,051 --> 00:46:51,736
Generator rotor
beginning rundown.

634
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,635
1:23 and four seconds.

635
00:46:55,718 --> 00:46:57,051
With every decision,

636
00:46:57,134 --> 00:46:59,551
they have pulled this reactor
back like a slingshot,

637
00:46:59,635 --> 00:47:01,885
further than anyone
has ever pulled,

638
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:04,301
now the test begins.

639
00:47:04,384 --> 00:47:08,051
The pumps are shut down,
and they've let go.

640
00:47:10,509 --> 00:47:13,760
The pumps stop moving water
through the reactor.

641
00:47:13,843 --> 00:47:17,009
Uranium fuel is now
unchecked by fresh coolant,

642
00:47:17,092 --> 00:47:18,926
unchecked by control rods.

643
00:47:19,009 --> 00:47:22,134
The balance immediately swings
in the opposite direction.

644
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:23,635
In less than a second,

645
00:47:23,718 --> 00:47:25,551
reactivity increases.

646
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,009
Inside the core,

647
00:47:28,092 --> 00:47:30,551
the remaining water is
quickly converting to steam.

648
00:47:30,635 --> 00:47:32,718
A void is being created.

649
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:35,426
There is no fresh water
to replace it.

650
00:47:35,509 --> 00:47:38,426
Steam increases reactivity,

651
00:47:38,509 --> 00:47:41,843
increases heat, increases steam,

652
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:44,676
increases reactivity.

653
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,051
The remaining xenon decays away.

654
00:47:49,384 --> 00:47:51,468
The power is rising.

655
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:54,885
There's nothing left to stop it.

656
00:47:54,967 --> 00:47:59,551
1:23 and 35 seconds.

657
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,092
We have a power surge! Sasha!

658
00:48:10,343 --> 00:48:11,468
What did you do?!

659
00:48:11,551 --> 00:48:16,301
1:23 and 40 seconds.

660
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:25,843
In every control room of every
nuclear reactor in the world,

661
00:48:25,926 --> 00:48:29,092
there is a button
with one single purpose...

662
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:32,551
to "scram," or instantly
shut down, the reaction.

663
00:48:32,635 --> 00:48:36,176
In Soviet reactors,
that button is called AZ-5.

664
00:48:36,259 --> 00:48:41,217
You press AZ-5,
all of the control rods insert at once,

665
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:45,384
and the reaction
is stopped dead.

666
00:48:45,468 --> 00:48:47,301
But...

667
00:48:53,176 --> 00:48:56,843
What are you waiting for,
Legasov? Tell your lies.

668
00:48:56,926 --> 00:48:59,217
Comrade Dyatlov, you will
not be warned again.

669
00:48:59,301 --> 00:49:01,551
- Or what?
- For god's sake, Dyatlov.

670
00:49:01,635 --> 00:49:03,509
Legasov's already
given it away.

671
00:49:03,593 --> 00:49:06,635
- He said before, there was no way to avoid what was coming.
- Comrade Dyatlov.

672
00:49:06,718 --> 00:49:09,718
- He knows something. She knows something.
- Comrade Dyatlov.

673
00:49:09,801 --> 00:49:13,426
I know what you are,
Valery Alexeyevich.

674
00:49:13,509 --> 00:49:16,468
- You're a liar.
- We've heard enough for today.

675
00:49:16,551 --> 00:49:20,426
The defendants will be
remanded in custody.

676
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:23,509
- Court will...
- I... I haven't finished.

677
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,635
I still have more
evidence to give.

678
00:49:25,718 --> 00:49:29,092
It's not necessary.
Your testimony is concluded.

679
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:32,301
- Your Honor.
- Court is now adjourned.

680
00:49:32,384 --> 00:49:34,777
- We will resume tomorrow with...
- Let him finish.

681
00:49:37,384 --> 00:49:39,384
Comrade Shcherbina...

682
00:49:41,551 --> 00:49:43,885
Let him finish.

683
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,176
Dyatlov broke
every rule we have.

684
00:50:14,009 --> 00:50:17,426
He pushed a reactor
to the brink of destruction.

685
00:50:21,593 --> 00:50:24,217
He did these things believing
there was a failsafe.

686
00:50:24,301 --> 00:50:27,551
AZ-5, a simple button
to shut it all down.

687
00:50:27,635 --> 00:50:32,217
But in the circumstances
he created, there wasn't.

688
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:35,760
The shutdown system
had a fatal flaw.

689
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,259
At 1:23:40, Akimov engages AZ-5.

690
00:50:50,718 --> 00:50:52,468
The fully-withdrawn
control rods

691
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:54,676
begin moving back
into the reactor.

692
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,635
These rods are made of boron,
which reduces reactivity,

693
00:50:57,718 --> 00:50:59,384
but not their tips.

694
00:50:59,468 --> 00:51:04,426
The tips are made of graphite,
which accelerates reactivity.

695
00:51:04,509 --> 00:51:06,301
Why?

696
00:51:10,176 --> 00:51:12,134
Why?

697
00:51:13,509 --> 00:51:16,009
For the same reason
our reactors

698
00:51:16,092 --> 00:51:19,176
do not have containment
buildings around them,

699
00:51:19,259 --> 00:51:20,301
like those in the West.

700
00:51:20,384 --> 00:51:22,718
For the same reason
we don't use

701
00:51:22,801 --> 00:51:25,343
properly enriched fuel
in our cores.

702
00:51:25,426 --> 00:51:27,718
For the same reason
we are the only nation

703
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:32,092
that builds water-cooled,
graphite-moderated reactors

704
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:35,301
with a positive
void coefficient.

705
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,760
It's cheaper.

706
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,967
The first part of the rods
that enter the core

707
00:51:47,051 --> 00:51:48,301
are the graphite tips.

708
00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:50,760
And when they do,
the reaction in the core,

709
00:51:50,843 --> 00:51:53,509
which had been rising,
skyrockets.

710
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:57,009
Every last molecule
of liquid water

711
00:51:57,092 --> 00:51:58,718
instantly converts to steam,

712
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:02,092
which expands and ruptures
a series of fuel rod channels.

713
00:52:02,176 --> 00:52:06,301
The control rods in those
channels can move no further.

714
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:08,926
The graphite tips are
fixed in position,

715
00:52:09,009 --> 00:52:11,801
endlessly accelerating
the reaction.

716
00:52:11,885 --> 00:52:15,885
Chernobyl Reactor 4
is now a nuclear bomb.

717
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:18,509
1:23:42.

718
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,343
Perevozchenko looks down

719
00:52:20,426 --> 00:52:22,967
on the enormous steel lid
of the reactor...

720
00:52:23,051 --> 00:52:24,967
...and sees the impossible.

721
00:52:25,051 --> 00:52:26,926
The control rod
and fuel channel caps,

722
00:52:27,009 --> 00:52:29,092
which each weigh 350 kilograms,

723
00:52:29,176 --> 00:52:30,760
are jumping up and down.

724
00:52:30,843 --> 00:52:33,426
He runs to warn
the control room.

725
00:52:33,509 --> 00:52:36,967
But there's nothing he can do
to stop what is coming.

726
00:52:37,051 --> 00:52:39,468
1:23 and 44 seconds.

727
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:43,635
The steam blows more
fuel channels apart.

728
00:52:43,718 --> 00:52:45,801
We do not know
how high the power went.

729
00:52:45,885 --> 00:52:48,176
We only know the final reading.

730
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,801
Reactor 4,

731
00:52:50,885 --> 00:52:54,967
designed to operate
at 3200 megawatts,

732
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:58,718
went beyond 33,000.

733
00:53:03,217 --> 00:53:07,009
The pressure inside the core
can no longer be held back.

734
00:53:07,092 --> 00:53:14,801
At long last, we have arrived.
1:23:45, explosion.

735
00:53:14,885 --> 00:53:19,051
In the instant the lid is thrown
off the reactor, oxygen rushes in.

736
00:53:19,134 --> 00:53:23,593
It combines with hydrogen
and super-heated graphite.

737
00:53:25,343 --> 00:53:28,426
The chain of disaster
is now complete.

738
00:53:50,384 --> 00:53:52,509
Comrade Dyatlov!

739
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,134
Comrade Dyatlov!

740
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:12,718
No one in the room
that night knew

741
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:16,259
the shutdown button
could act as a detonator.

742
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:19,551
They didn't know it,

743
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:22,551
because it was kept from them.

744
00:54:22,635 --> 00:54:25,092
Comrade Legasov,
you're contradicting

745
00:54:25,176 --> 00:54:27,509
your own testimony in Vienna.

746
00:54:27,593 --> 00:54:30,301
My testimony in Vienna
was a lie.

747
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:34,384
I lied to the world.

748
00:54:34,468 --> 00:54:36,801
I'm not the only one
who kept this secret.

749
00:54:36,885 --> 00:54:39,092
There are many.

750
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:41,885
We were following orders,

751
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:43,567
from the KGB,
from the Central Committee.

752
00:54:43,635 --> 00:54:46,301
And right now, there are 16
reactors in the Soviet Union

753
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:48,843
with the same fatal flaw.

754
00:54:48,926 --> 00:54:50,760
Three of them are still running

755
00:54:50,843 --> 00:54:53,134
less than 20 kilometers
away at Chernobyl.

756
00:54:53,217 --> 00:54:57,259
Professor Legasov, if you mean
to suggest the Soviet State

757
00:54:57,343 --> 00:54:59,092
is somehow responsible
for what happened,

758
00:54:59,176 --> 00:55:01,926
then I must warn you, you are
treading on dangerous ground.

759
00:55:02,009 --> 00:55:04,343
I've already trod
on dangerous ground.

760
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,468
We're on dangerous
ground right now,

761
00:55:06,551 --> 00:55:09,301
because of our secrets
and our lies.

762
00:55:09,384 --> 00:55:12,468
They're practically
what define us.

763
00:55:12,551 --> 00:55:15,676
When the truth offends,
we lie and lie

764
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,134
until we can no longer
remember it is even there.

765
00:55:18,217 --> 00:55:21,217
But it is still there.

766
00:55:23,384 --> 00:55:27,718
Every lie we tell incurs
a debt to the truth.

767
00:55:29,843 --> 00:55:32,718
Sooner or later,
that debt is paid.

768
00:55:36,885 --> 00:55:42,426
That is how an RBMK
reactor core explodes.

769
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,635
Lies.

770
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:54,635
Valery Alexeyevich Legasov,

771
00:57:54,718 --> 00:57:57,760
son of Alexei Legasov,

772
00:57:57,843 --> 00:58:01,301
Head of Ideological Compliance,
Central Committee.

773
00:58:01,384 --> 00:58:03,384
Do you know what
your father did there?

774
00:58:03,468 --> 00:58:04,926
Yes.

775
00:58:05,009 --> 00:58:08,967
As a student, you had a
leadership position in Komsomol.

776
00:58:09,051 --> 00:58:11,384
Communist Youth, correct?

777
00:58:12,384 --> 00:58:14,801
- You already know.
- Answer the question.

778
00:58:14,885 --> 00:58:16,051
Yes.

779
00:58:17,843 --> 00:58:19,967
At the Kuchartov Institute,

780
00:58:20,051 --> 00:58:22,676
you were the Communist
Party secretary.

781
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,176
In the position,
you limited

782
00:58:24,259 --> 00:58:27,176
the promotion
of Jewish scientists.

783
00:58:31,635 --> 00:58:33,009
Yes.

784
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:36,760
To curry favor
with Kremlin officials.

785
00:58:41,426 --> 00:58:43,718
You're one of us, Legasov.

786
00:58:45,134 --> 00:58:47,551
I can do anything
I want with you.

787
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,843
But what I want most is
for you to know that I know.

788
00:58:52,926 --> 00:58:55,301
You're not brave.

789
00:58:55,384 --> 00:58:57,593
You're not heroic.

790
00:58:59,092 --> 00:59:02,343
You're just a dying man
who forgot himself.

791
00:59:02,426 --> 00:59:06,134
I know who I am,
and I know what I've done.

792
00:59:08,718 --> 00:59:11,092
In a just world,
I'd be shot for my lies,

793
00:59:11,176 --> 00:59:14,343
but not for this,
not for the truth.

794
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:16,551
Scientists...

795
00:59:16,635 --> 00:59:20,384
and your idiot obsessions
with reasons.

796
00:59:20,468 --> 00:59:22,718
When the bullet
hits your skull,

797
00:59:22,801 --> 00:59:25,343
what will it matter why?

798
00:59:32,593 --> 00:59:35,134
No one's getting shot,
Legasov.

799
00:59:36,635 --> 00:59:38,967
The whole world
saw you in Vienna.

800
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:41,217
It would be embarrassing
to kill you now.

801
00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:42,760
And for what?

802
00:59:42,843 --> 00:59:46,635
Your testimony today will not
be accepted by the State.

803
00:59:46,718 --> 00:59:49,760
It will not be
disseminated in the press.

804
00:59:49,843 --> 00:59:51,801
It never happened.

805
00:59:53,092 --> 00:59:56,051
No, you will live,

806
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,926
however long you have,

807
00:59:58,009 --> 01:00:01,718
but not as a scientist,
not anymore.

808
01:00:01,801 --> 01:00:06,343
You'll keep your title
and your office,

809
01:00:06,426 --> 01:00:11,343
but no duties,
no authority, no friends.

810
01:00:11,426 --> 01:00:13,509
No one will
talk to you.

811
01:00:13,593 --> 01:00:15,509
No one will
listen to you.

812
01:00:17,468 --> 01:00:21,760
Other men,
lesser men,

813
01:00:21,843 --> 01:00:25,509
will receive credit for
the things you have done.

814
01:00:25,593 --> 01:00:27,885
Your legacy is
now their legacy.

815
01:00:27,967 --> 01:00:30,718
You'll live long enough
to see that.

816
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:36,551
What role did
Shcherbina play in this?

817
01:00:36,635 --> 01:00:37,760
None.

818
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:40,384
He didn't know
what I was gonna say.

819
01:00:41,676 --> 01:00:44,760
What role did
Khomyuk play in this?

820
01:00:44,843 --> 01:00:46,301
None.

821
01:00:46,384 --> 01:00:48,885
She didn't know either.

822
01:00:50,259 --> 01:00:52,635
After all you've said
and done today,

823
01:00:52,718 --> 01:00:58,676
it would be curious
if you chose this moment to lie.

824
01:01:01,593 --> 01:01:03,468
I would think a man
of your experience

825
01:01:03,551 --> 01:01:05,885
would know a lie
when he hears one.

826
01:01:10,051 --> 01:01:11,343
You will not meet
or communicate

827
01:01:11,426 --> 01:01:13,593
with either one
of them ever again.

828
01:01:13,676 --> 01:01:16,176
You will not communicate
with anyone

829
01:01:16,259 --> 01:01:18,384
about Chernobyl ever again.

830
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,843
You will remain so immaterial
to the world around you

831
01:01:21,926 --> 01:01:23,718
that when you
finally do die,

832
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:28,092
it will be exceedingly hard to
know that you ever lived at all.

833
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:34,259
What if I refuse?

834
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:40,509
Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?

835
01:01:41,926 --> 01:01:45,926
"Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?"

836
01:01:46,009 --> 01:01:48,259
Oh, that's perfect.

837
01:01:48,343 --> 01:01:51,426
They should put that
on our money.

838
01:03:00,509 --> 01:03:04,593
To be a scientist
is to be naive.

839
01:03:04,676 --> 01:03:06,926
We are so focused on
our search for truth,

840
01:03:07,009 --> 01:03:11,635
we fail to consider how few
actually want us to find it.

841
01:03:11,718 --> 01:03:16,092
But it is always there,
whether we see it or not,

842
01:03:16,176 --> 01:03:18,009
whether we choose to or not.

843
01:03:18,092 --> 01:03:20,843
The truth doesn't care
about our needs or wants.

844
01:03:20,926 --> 01:03:22,635
It doesn't care
about our governments,

845
01:03:22,718 --> 01:03:26,426
our ideologies,
our religions.

846
01:03:26,509 --> 01:03:30,134
It will lie in wait
for all time.

847
01:03:30,217 --> 01:03:34,134
And this, at last,
is the gift of Chernobyl.

848
01:03:34,217 --> 01:03:36,843
Where I once would fear
the cost of truth,

849
01:03:36,926 --> 01:03:39,718
now I only ask:

850
01:03:40,718 --> 01:03:43,551
What is the cost of lies?

162
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,909
If I'm right, this fireman
was holding the equivalent

163
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:55,033

Professor Legasov,
there's no place

165
00:11:57,575 --> 00:11:59,533
It's not alarmist
if it's a fact!

166
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:02,909
Well, I don't hear
any facts at all.

167
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:05,533
All I hear is
a man I don't know

168
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:08,700
engaging in conjecture
in direct contradiction

169
00:12:08,784 --> 00:12:10,909

by party officials.

Please, may I express my concern

173
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:23,659
as calmly and as
respectfully as I--

174
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,825
-Professor Legasov--
-Gorbachev: Boris.

175
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:29,700
I will allow it.

176
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:40,659
Legasov:
Um...

177
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:44,950
An RBMK reactor

178
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:49,241
uses uranium 235 as fuel.

179
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:54,116
Every atom of U-235
is like a bullet

180
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,325
traveling at nearly
the speed of light,

181
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,909
penetrating everything
in its path:

182
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:02,116
woods, metal, concrete, flesh.

183
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,283
Every gram of U-235 holds

184
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,241
over a billion trillion
of these bullets.

185
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:09,784
That's in one gram.

186
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:13,158
Now, Chernobyl holds
over three million grams,

187
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:15,867
and right now, it is on fire.

188
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,283
Winds will carry
radioactive particles
across the entire continent,

189
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,283
rain will bring them down on us.

190
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:25,450
That's three million
billion trillion bullets

191

in the... in the air we breathe,

Most of these bullets
will not stop firing
for 100 years.

194

Yes, and, uh, this concern

How does a nuclear reactor work?

-What?
-Shcherbina:
It's a simple question.

216
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:40,325
It's hardly
a simple answer.

217
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:44,325
Of course, you presume
I'm too stupid to understand.

218
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:47,700
So I'll restate: Tell me
how a nuclear reactor works,

219
00:15:47,784 --> 00:15:50,659
or I'll have one of these
soldiers throw you out

220
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:04,617
A nuclear reactor makes
electricity with steam.

221
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,241
The steam turns a turbine
which generates electricity.

222
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:10,283
Where a typical power plant

223
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:12,241
makes steam by burning coal,

224
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:14,659
a nuclear plant...

225
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:24,408
In a nuclear plant, we use
something called fission.

226
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:30,450
We take an unstable element
like uranium 235,

227
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:32,492
which has too many neutrons.

228
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,408
-A neutron is, uh--
-The bullet.

229
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:39,200
Yes, the bullet.

230
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,867
So, bullets are flying
off of the uranium.

231
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,283
Now...

232
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:49,200
if we put enough
uranium atoms close together,

233
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:53,659
the bullets from one atom will
eventually strike another atom.

234
00:16:53,742 --> 00:16:56,825
The force of this impact
splits that atom apart,

235
00:16:56,909 --> 00:17:00,200
releasing a tremendous
amount of energy, fission.

236
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:03,033
-And the graphite?
-Ah, yes.

237
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:06,991
The neutrons are
actually traveling so fast--
we call this "flux"--

238
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:11,867
it's relatively unlikely
that the uranium atoms
will ever hit one another.

239
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:16,909
In RBMK reactors, we surround
the fuel rods with graphite

240
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:21,991
to moderate, slow down,
the neutron flux.

241
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,158
Good.

242

00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:32,617
Before you were
Deputy Secretary,

319
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,367
you worked
in a shoe factory.

320
00:22:35,492 --> 00:22:39,075
Yes, I worked
in a shoe factory.

321
00:22:40,116 --> 00:22:42,241
And now I'm in charge.

322
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:47,241
"To the workers of the world."

323
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,492
Stable iodine will keep
your thyroid

324
00:23:11,575 --> 00:23:13,950
from absorbing
radioactive iodine.

325
00:23:15,116 --> 00:23:17,909
Take one a day
for as long as they last.

326
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:19,700
And go east.

327
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:22,241
Get as far from Minsk
as you can.

328
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:57,492
Fomin:
It's overkill.

329
00:23:57,575 --> 00:23:59,492
Pikalov's showing off
to make us look bad.

330
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:02,617
Bryukhanov:
It doesn't matter
how it looks.

331
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,991
Shcherbina is
a pure bureaucrat,

332
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:07,075
as stupid as
he is pigheaded.

333
00:24:07,158 --> 00:24:09,492
We'll tell him the truth in
the simplest terms possible.

334
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:11,283
We'll be fine.

335
00:24:14,825 --> 00:24:16,367
Pikarov!

336
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,575
Comrade Shcherbina,
Chief Engineer Fomin,

337
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:46,617
Colonel General Pikalov, and I

338
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,950
are honored
at your arrival.

339
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:49,283
Deeply, deeply honored.

340
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:52,325
Naturally, we regret
the circumstances of your visit,

341
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,575
but, as you can see, we are
making excellent progress

342
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,200
in containing the damage.

343
00:24:56,283 --> 00:25:01,450
We have begun our own inquiry
into the cause of the accident,

344
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,533
and I have a list of individuals

345
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:07,408
who we believe are accountable.

346
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,950
Bryukhanov:
Professor Legasov,
I understand

347
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:33,367
you've been saying
dangerous things.

348
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,241
Fomin:
Very dangerous things.

349
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,659
Apparently,
our reactor core exploded.

350
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:42,575
Please, tell me how an RBMK
reactor core explodes.

351
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,784
I'm not prepared to explain it
at this time.

352
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:49,742
As I presumed,
he has no answer.

353
00:25:49,825 --> 00:25:52,325
It's disgraceful, really.

354
00:25:52,408 --> 00:25:55,909
To spread disinformation
at a time like this.

355
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,659
Why did I see graphite
on the roof?

356
00:26:04,742 --> 00:26:06,867
Graphite is only
found in the core,

357
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,408
where it's used as
a neutron flux moderator.

358
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:11,909
Correct?

359
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:16,325
Fomin, why did
the Deputy Chairman
see graphite on the roof?

360
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,367
Well, that... that can't be.

361
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:22,909
Comrade Shcherbina,
my apologies, but graphite...

362
00:26:22,991 --> 00:26:24,200
that's not possible.

363
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:26,533
Perhaps you saw
burnt concrete.

364
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:28,408
Now there you made a mistake,

365
00:26:28,492 --> 00:26:31,116
because I may not know much
about nuclear reactors,

366
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,825
but I know a lot
about concrete.

367
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,158
-Comrade, I assure you--
-I understand.

368
00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:39,617
You think Legasov is wrong.

369
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,659
How shall we prove it?

370
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:46,200
Our high-range dosimeter
just arrived.

371
00:26:46,283 --> 00:26:49,241
We could cover one of our
trucks with lead shielding,

372
00:26:49,325 --> 00:26:51,659
mount the dosimeter
on the front.

373
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,659
Have one of your men
get as close to the fire
as he can.

374
00:27:00,742 --> 00:27:02,408
Give him every bit
of protection you have.

375
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:04,784
But understand that
even with lead shielding,

376
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:06,867
it may not be enough.

377
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,575
Then I'll do it myself.

378
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:17,200

What does that number mean?

390
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:56,325
It means the core is open.

391
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:58,867
It means the fire we're

-No, no. You don't understand.

This isn't a fire.

410
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:43,950
This is a fissioning
reactor core

411
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:46,325
burning at over
2,000 degrees.

412
00:30:46,408 --> 00:30:47,991
The heat will instantly
vaporize the water--

You are dealing

416

Boron.

417
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:05,825
Boron and sand.

418
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:08,533
Well, that'll create
problems of its own,

419
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,700
but I-I don't see
any other way.

420
00:31:10,784 --> 00:31:12,867
Of course, it's going to take
thousands of drops,

421
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:15,533
because you can't fly
the helicopters directly
over the core,

422
00:31:15,617 --> 00:31:16,991
so most of it
is going to miss.

423
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,200
-How much sand and boron?
-(scoffs) Well, I can't be--

424

-For God's sake, roughly!
-Five thousand tons.

425
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:26,158
And obviously,
we're going to need
to evacuate an enormous area--

426
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:28,158
Never mind that.
Focus on the fire.

at the Chernobyl Atomic Power
Plant near the city of Kiev

that people were injured
and may have died.

00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:26,116
Do you understand
the damage this has done?

638
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,408
Do you understand
what's at stake?

639
00:49:31,033 --> 00:49:32,367
Boris.

640
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:38,867
Professor Legasov
will deliver our briefing.

641
00:49:40,533 --> 00:49:42,033
There is some good news.

642
00:49:42,116 --> 00:49:44,784
The air drops are working
to douse the fire.

643
00:49:44,867 --> 00:49:48,617
There's been a reduction
in radionuclide emissions,

644
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,533
but the fire will not
be extinguished

645
00:49:50,617 --> 00:49:53,492
for at least
another two weeks.

646
00:49:55,408 --> 00:49:58,408
There is also
an additional problem.

647
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,700
Nuclear fuel doesn't turn cold

648
00:50:01,784 --> 00:50:04,450
simply because
it is not on fire.

649
00:50:04,533 --> 00:50:06,158
In fact, the temperature
will likely rise

650
00:50:06,241 --> 00:50:08,950
as a result of the blanket
of sand we've dropped.

651
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:11,825
The uranium will melt the sand,

652
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,617
creating a kind of lava

653
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,991
which will begin to melt down
through the shield below.

654
00:50:17,075 --> 00:50:18,617
You have made lava?

655
00:50:21,283 --> 00:50:23,408
I anticipated this.

656
00:50:24,909 --> 00:50:27,200
I believed there was
time to reinforce

657
00:50:27,283 --> 00:50:29,325
this lower concrete pad

658
00:50:29,408 --> 00:50:30,867
before the lava
reached the earth

659
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:32,492
and contaminated
the groundwater.

660
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:35,659
But as it turned out, I was
worried about the wrong thing.

661
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:37,617
Uh, um...

662
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,283
It was my understanding
that these large water tanks

663
00:50:41,367 --> 00:50:43,950
under the reactor were
essentially empty.

664
00:50:44,033 --> 00:50:47,116
This is Ulana Khomyuk
of the Byelorussian Institute.

665
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,492
Thanks to her insight,
we are now aware

666
00:50:49,575 --> 00:50:52,867
that the tanks are,
in fact, full.

667
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:56,825
Of water. Why is that
a problem, professor?

668
00:50:58,033 --> 00:50:59,492
(clears throat)

669
00:51:01,116 --> 00:51:02,784
When the lava
enters these tanks,

670
00:51:02,867 --> 00:51:05,200
it will instantly
superheat and vaporize

671
00:51:05,283 --> 00:51:08,950
approximately 7,000
cubic meters of water,

672
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:12,533
causing a significant
thermal explosion.

673
00:51:12,617 --> 00:51:14,575
How significant?

674
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:18,533
We estimate between
two and four megatons.

675
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,909
Everything within
a 30-kilometer radius

676
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:23,659
will be completely destroyed,

677
00:51:23,742 --> 00:51:27,075
including the three remaining
reactors at Chernobyl.

678
00:51:27,158 --> 00:51:30,659
The entirety of the radioactive
material in all of the cores

679
00:51:30,742 --> 00:51:33,825
will be ejected at force

680
00:51:33,909 --> 00:51:36,950
and dispersed by
a massive shock wave,

681
00:51:37,033 --> 00:51:42,241
which will extend
approximately 200 kilometers

682
00:51:42,325 --> 00:51:45,617
and likely be fatal
to the entire population of Kiev

683
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,742
as well as a portion of Minsk.

684
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:50,742
The release of radiation
will be severe

685
00:51:50,825 --> 00:51:54,075
and will impact
all of Soviet Ukraine,

686
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:57,784
Latvia, Lithuania,
Byelorussia,

687
00:51:57,867 --> 00:52:01,116
as well as Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

688
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,867
Romania,
and most of East Germany.

689
00:52:07,533 --> 00:52:10,408
What do you mean "impact"?

690
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,742
For much of the area,
a nearly permanent disruption

691
00:52:13,825 --> 00:52:16,367
of the food and water supply,

692
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:19,450
a steep increase in the rates
of cancer and birth defects.

693
00:52:19,533 --> 00:52:22,991
I don't know how many deaths
there will be, but many.

694
00:52:23,075 --> 00:52:24,950
For Byelorussia and the Ukraine,

695
00:52:25,033 --> 00:52:27,367
"impact" means
completely uninhabitable

696
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:30,867
for a minimum of 100 years.

697
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,116
There are more
than 50 million people

698
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,950
living in Byelorussia
and Ukraine.

699
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,867
Sixty, yes.

700
00:52:47,241 --> 00:52:48,991
And how long
before this happens?

701
00:52:49,075 --> 00:52:52,950
Approximately 48 to 72 hours.

702
00:52:56,408 --> 00:52:58,825
But we may have a solution.

703
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,700
We can pump the water
from the tanks.

704
00:53:00,784 --> 00:53:04,200
Unfortunately, the tanks are
sealed shut by a sluice gate,

705
00:53:04,283 --> 00:53:06,408
and the gate can only
be opened manually

706
00:53:06,492 --> 00:53:08,033
from within
the duct system itself.

707
00:53:08,116 --> 00:53:11,283
So we need to find
three plant workers

708
00:53:11,367 --> 00:53:12,950
who know the facility
well enough

709
00:53:13,033 --> 00:53:14,659
to enter the basement here,

710
00:53:14,742 --> 00:53:18,991
find their way through
all these duct ways,

711
00:53:19,075 --> 00:53:21,158
get to the sluice gate
valve here,

712
00:53:21,241 --> 00:53:25,700
and give us the access we need
to pump out the tanks.

713
00:53:25,784 --> 00:53:28,533
Of course, we will need
your permission.

714
00:53:28,617 --> 00:53:30,659
My permission for what?

715
00:53:30,742 --> 00:53:33,200
Uh, the water in these ducts,

716
00:53:33,283 --> 00:53:36,116
the level of radioactive
contamination--

717
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,617
They'll likely be
dead in a week.

718
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:44,116
We're asking for your
permission to kill three men.

The valve will be
difficult to operate,

ULANA KHOMYUK: I've worked
the numbers over and over,

798
01:06:05,158 --> 01:06:06,991
and I always get the same
answer.

799
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:10,033
It's not possible.

800
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:14,367
LEGASOV: We have to pursue
every possibility.

801
01:06:15,533 --> 01:06:18,283
No matter what
or who is to blame.

802
01:06:18,991 --> 01:06:22,241
Because if we don't find out
what happened that night...

803
01:06:24,116 --> 01:06:25,200
it will happen again.

804
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,241
The valve will be difficult
to operate,

805
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:36,617
so we'll need three men.

806
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:39,450
Ananenko.

807
01:06:40,408 --> 01:06:41,450
Bezpalov.

808
01:06:43,158 --> 01:06:44,075
Baranov.

809
01:06:45,241 --> 01:06:47,617
CRAIG MAZIN:
The water was very irradiated.

810
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,033
And there was no expectation
that they would survive.

811
01:06:50,367 --> 01:06:51,909
And they did it nonetheless.

812
01:06:55,325 --> 01:06:56,575
JOHAN RENCK:
For me to shoot that,

813
01:06:56,659 --> 01:06:59,367
I really didn't want
some kind of big ambient light

814
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:01,492
so that you can see everything
that's going on

815
01:07:01,575 --> 01:07:04,075
and you kind of make it
into some spectacle.

816
01:07:04,408 --> 01:07:06,991
But for me, it was always
about authenticity,

817
01:07:07,075 --> 01:07:09,575
and the visceral feel of being
with these divers

818
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:11,991
in this pitch-darkness,
not really seeing anything else

819
01:07:12,075 --> 01:07:13,784
but what's being lit
by the flashlights

820
01:07:13,867 --> 01:07:17,075
and the reflections in the water
from those flashlights.

821
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:21,575
I'm a nuclear physicist.

822
01:07:23,283 --> 01:07:25,241
EMILY WATSON: Ulana Khomyuk
is not a real person.

823
01:07:25,325 --> 01:07:26,617
She's an invented character.

824
01:07:26,825 --> 01:07:30,867
An amalgam of the scientists
at the time in the Soviet Union

825
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:32,659
who worked together.

826
01:07:32,742 --> 01:07:34,241
I'm here about Chernobyl.

827
01:07:34,909 --> 01:07:36,241
MAZIN: One of the challenges
of...

828
01:07:36,325 --> 01:07:37,742
creating any kind
of historical fiction

829
01:07:37,825 --> 01:07:39,867
is compressing the amount
of people involved.

830
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:42,742
I needed a character
to represent the hundreds

831
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:46,408
of scientists who came together
to try and figure out

832
01:07:46,492 --> 01:07:48,909
how to stop Chernobyl
from getting worse,

833
01:07:48,991 --> 01:07:50,367
to clean it up, and then

834
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:52,283
to determine how it happened
in the first place.

835
01:07:52,575 --> 01:07:54,950
Smothering the coal
will put the fire out,

836
01:07:55,033 --> 01:07:56,617
but... you've made a mistake.

837
01:07:57,867 --> 01:07:59,158
MAZIN:
These were scientists

838
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:02,325
that understood that they were
trying to solve a mystery

839
01:08:02,408 --> 01:08:05,450
in a system that did not
want them to solve the mystery.

840
01:08:05,533 --> 01:08:07,075
They were put on trial.

841
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,033
Scientists involved in this
were threatened,

842
01:08:09,492 --> 01:08:12,909
their families were threatened,
and yet, they did it anyway.

843
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:16,492
Because, I think,
they understood as scientists,

844
01:08:16,575 --> 01:08:19,742
that the truth was no longer
something that could be

845
01:08:19,825 --> 01:08:22,325
hidden away,
that it was now too late.

846
01:08:22,909 --> 01:08:24,533
I prefer my opinion to yours.

847
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:27,241
Before you were
deputy secretary,

848
01:08:27,325 --> 01:08:28,867
you worked in a shoe factory.

849
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,575
JARED HARRIS: Because Legasov
has the scientific understanding

850
01:08:35,659 --> 01:08:36,659
of what has happened,

851
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:39,241
he immediately is given
the responsibility

852
01:08:39,325 --> 01:08:41,325
of trying to figure out,
"Well, what do they do next?"

853
01:08:41,533 --> 01:08:45,033
He hasn't owned it yet,
as in terms of it's his problem.

854
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:47,700
Anything we should be
worried about?

855
01:08:48,367 --> 01:08:50,075
HARRIS:
He has a choice at that point,

856
01:08:50,367 --> 01:08:52,408
to tell them the truth
or to lie.

857
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,700
(SIGHS) No.

858
01:08:56,033 --> 01:08:58,825
That's sort of the point
that he steps into the story.

859
01:09:00,033 --> 01:09:00,909
Up until that point,

860
01:09:01,241 --> 01:09:03,283
he was an innocent
who was plucked from his life

861
01:09:03,367 --> 01:09:04,909
and plunked into this situation.

862
01:09:04,991 --> 01:09:06,533
But the moment that he lies,

863
01:09:06,784 --> 01:09:09,991
he now owns responsibility
for the outcome.

864
01:09:10,533 --> 01:09:12,700

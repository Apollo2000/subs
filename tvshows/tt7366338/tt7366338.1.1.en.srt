2
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:46,062
What is the cost of lies?

3
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,021
It's not that we'll mistake
them for the truth.

4
00:00:49,104 --> 00:00:52,979
The real danger is that
if we hear enough lies,

5
00:00:53,062 --> 00:00:56,104
then we no longer
recognize the truth at all.

6
00:00:57,605 --> 00:00:59,271
What can we do then?

7
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:02,021
What else is left
but to abandon even
the hope of truth

8
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:06,688
and content
ourselves instead
with stories?

9
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:10,896
In these stories,
it doesn't matter
who the heroes are.

10
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,521
All we want to know is:
who is to blame?

11
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:17,187
In this story,
it was Anatoly Dyatlov.

12
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:18,979
He was the best choice.

13
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:21,062
An arrogant, unpleasant man,

14
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:24,354
he ran the room that night,
he gave the orders...

15
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:26,354
and no friends.

16
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:30,104
Or, at least,
not important ones.

17
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:35,438
And now Dyatlov will spend
the next ten years

18
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:37,563
in a prison labor camp.

19
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:41,021
Of course, that sentence
is doubly unfair.

20
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,187
There were far greater
criminals than him at work.

21
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,896
And as for what Dyatlov did do,

22
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,354
the man doesn't deserve prison.

23
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:57,354
He deserves death.

24
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:15,104
But instead, ten years
for "criminal mismanagement."

25
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:17,187
What does that mean?

26
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:21,021
No one knows.
It doesn't matter.

27
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:26,688
What does matter
is that, to them,

28
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,979
justice was done.

29
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:32,646
Because, you see, to them

30
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,438
a just world is a sane world.

31
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:41,896
There was nothing sane
about Chernobyl.

32
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:45,771
What happened there,
what happened after,

33
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:49,187
even the good we did,
all of it...

34
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:55,187
all of it... madness.

35
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:03,730
Well, I've given you
everything I know.

36
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,271
They'll deny it, of course.

37
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,104
They always do.

38
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:17,937
I know you'll try your best.

39
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:42,646
Lyudmilla?

40
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:09,855
Comrade Dyatlov!

41
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:17,396
Comrade Dyatlov!
Comrade Dyatlov!

42
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:24,646
Comrade Dyatlov!
Comrade Dyatlov!

43
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,438
What just happened?

44
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:30,605
I don't know.

45
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:32,896
There's a fire
in the turbine hall.

46
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:35,771
The turbine hall.

47
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:39,896
The control system tank.
Hydrogen.

48
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,937
You and Toptunov,
you morons blew the tank!

49
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,271
- No, that's not--
- This is an emergency.

50
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:46,313
Everyone stay calm.
Our first priority is--

51
00:08:46,396 --> 00:08:47,855
- It's exploded!
- We know.

52
00:08:47,937 --> 00:08:49,396
Akimov, are we cooling
the reactor core?

53
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,313
We shut it down,
but the control rods
are still active.

54
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,187
They're not all the way in,
I disengaged the clutch.

55
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,855
Try and disconnect the servos
from the standby console.

56
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:57,354
You two, get
the backup pumps running.

57
00:08:57,438 --> 00:08:59,146
We need water moving
through the core.

58
00:08:59,229 --> 00:09:02,187
- That is all that matters.
- There is no core.

59
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:04,605
It exploded, the core exploded.

60
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:10,271
He's in shock.
Get him out of here.

61
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:11,605
The lid is off!

62
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:13,479
The stack is burning.
I saw it.

63
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:16,438
You're confused.
RBMK reactor cores
don't explode.

64
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:17,855
- Akimov...
- Sasha.

65
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:19,146
Don't worry,
we did everything right.

66
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:21,187
Something...
something strange has happened.

67
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:23,396
- Do you taste metal?
- Akimov!

68
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,396
Comrade Perevozschenko,
what you're saying is
physically impossible.

69
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:29,813
The core can't explode.
It has to be the tank.

70
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:32,187
We're wasting time.
Let's go.

71
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,062
Get the hydrogen
out of the generators
and pump water into the core.

72
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:39,313
- What about the fire?
- Call the fire brigade.

73
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,354
You're not on call tonight.

74
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:19,521
They're bringing everybody in,
military and civil.

75
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:23,646
Pripyat, Polesskoe, Kiev.

76
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,605
This is a big one.

77
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:29,229
But it doesn't look right,
the color.

78
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,855
Pravik says
he thinks they're shining
floodlights or something.

79
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:34,313
And what if there are chemicals?

80
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:36,730
Chemicals?

81
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:39,313
The problem's the roof.

82
00:11:39,396 --> 00:11:42,187
It's covered in tar,
so it's gonna burn all night,

83
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:44,855
and it'll stink like hell.
That's it.

84
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,771
That's the worst of it.

85
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,021
Go back to bed.

86
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:28,855
- Is it war?
- Where's the dosimeter?

87
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:32,021
Here... Here.

88
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:39,479
Are they bombing?

89
00:12:42,104 --> 00:12:45,062
What the fuck is this?
It's 3.6 roentgen.

90
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:47,688
That's as high as it goes.
The good one's locked in a safe.

91
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:49,187
I don't have a key.

92
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:53,521
Valera... your face.

93
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:56,396
Come on.

94
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:59,354
I'm going to find Khodemchuk
in the pump room.

95
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:01,396
You... here.

96
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:05,104
Get Shashenok.
He's in 604. Go.

97
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:06,855
We need to get everyone out!

98
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:21,396
Shit.

99
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:23,855
Hey! We need to get
to the reactor hall.

100
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,937
- The lift's destroyed.
- Up two flights and across.

101
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:30,438
- Right.
- Why are you going there?

102
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:51,730
Have you seen Khodemchuk?

103
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:54,271
- No. Where's Viktor?
- Still in the pump room.

104
00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:58,688
Stay here. I'll come back.

105
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:03,271
Viktor!

106
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:22,605
Viktor.

107
00:14:22,688 --> 00:14:25,813
Viktor.

108
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:29,730
Viktor. I'm gonna get
you out of here.

109
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:31,688
Can you stand?

110
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,979
Khodemchuk...

111
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:35,730
Where?

112
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:40,313
Get Khodemchuk.

113
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:25,438
I dropped the control rods
from the other panel.

114
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:27,229
- They're still up.
- What?

115
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:29,730
They're still only
a third of the way in,
I don't know why.

116
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:32,271
I already sent the trainees
down to the reactor hall
to lower them by hand.

117
00:15:32,354 --> 00:15:34,313
- What about the pumps?
- I can't get through to Khodemchuk.

118
00:15:34,396 --> 00:15:37,021
- The lines are down.
- Fuck the phones
and fuck Khodemchuk.

119
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,521
- Are the pumps on or not?
- Stolyarchuk?

120
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,104
My control panel's not working.

121
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:41,605
I tried calling
for the electricians.

122
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:43,313
I don't give a shit
about the panel!

123
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:45,937
I need water in my reactor core!

124
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:48,563
Get down there and make sure
those pumps are on.

125
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,313
Now!

126
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,396
- What does the dosimeter say?
-3.6 roentgen, but that's
as high as the meter--

127
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:05,229
3.6-- not great,
not terrible.

128
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:15,354
We did everything right.

129
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,021
You, connect those hooks!

130
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:08,479
Get the pumps going!

131
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:10,813
Yeah, over here!

132
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:17,563
We're working bottom to top. Go in fast.

133
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,062
Vasily...

134
00:17:41,438 --> 00:17:44,104
- Hey, Vasily, what's this?
- I don't know, Misha.

135
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:46,688
Don't fuck around with it.
Hook these up, come on.

136
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,730
Do you taste metal?

137
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:57,021
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.

138
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:00,313
The valves, Misha!
The valves, let's go!

139
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:02,021
The valves! Come on!

140
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:35,563
What do you need?

141
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:37,896
We need to get
into the reactor hall

142
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:40,396
to lower the control rods,
but the door is jammed.

143
00:18:41,646 --> 00:18:43,605
I don't think there are
control rods.

144
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:45,354
I don't think there's a core.

145
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,396
No, you're-- you're mistaken.

146
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:51,646
Akimov said.

147
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:10,396
Let's go.

148
00:19:23,354 --> 00:19:24,979
No!

149
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:28,813
Ignatenko, get on his hose!

150
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:30,730
It's all right. Breathe.

151
00:19:30,813 --> 00:19:32,479
Misha.

152
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:34,563
All right, all right.
Easy, Misha.

153
00:20:11,438 --> 00:20:13,271
Are you sure?

154
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,062
Akimov...

155
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,979
Move.

156
00:20:41,313 --> 00:20:42,979
Come on, go!

157
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:23,605
Let's go!

158
00:21:23,688 --> 00:21:25,021
Let's go!

159
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:27,896
Hey!

160
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:35,813
Hey!

161
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:58,646
Lyudmilla! Do you
want to come with us?

162
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,021
Come where?

163
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:02,187
We're going to the railroad
bridge to get a better look.

164
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:04,646
It's not like anyone
can sleep with all the sirens.

165
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,896
I don't think you should go.
It could be dangerous.

166
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:10,146
What do you mean dangerous?
It's a fire. It's over there,
we're over here.

167
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,855
- Mikhail.
- What?

168
00:22:13,396 --> 00:22:15,354
Oh, sorry.

169
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:17,021
Oh.

170
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,313
- Is Vasily...?
- Yeah.

171
00:22:22,396 --> 00:22:23,979
Did he say it was bad?

172
00:22:24,062 --> 00:22:25,979
No. No, he said it was
just the roof.

173
00:22:26,062 --> 00:22:27,396
Well, he's never
gotten hurt before.

174
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,104
None of the boys have.

175
00:22:30,187 --> 00:22:31,855
He'll be fine.

176
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:34,563
Get some rest.

177
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:48,021
The tank, it's big enough.

178
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:52,354
This kind of explosion,
the control tank on 71,
it's 100 cubic meters.

179
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:53,771
One hundred and ten.

180
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:56,605
Hundred and ten.
It could do this, definitely.

181
00:22:56,688 --> 00:23:00,021
It's gone.

182
00:23:00,104 --> 00:23:02,187
I looked right into it.

183
00:23:02,271 --> 00:23:03,979
I looked into the core.

184
00:23:05,104 --> 00:23:07,855
Did you lower
the control rods or not?

185
00:23:10,396 --> 00:23:12,771
Take him to the infirmary.

186
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:15,979
Toptunov, take him!

187
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:23,104
- Where's Kudryavstev?
- He fell.

188
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:26,229
- I need a medic! Anyone!
- He's delusional.

189
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:28,730
- His face...
- Ruptured condenser lines.

190
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:30,730
The feedwater is
mildly contaminated.

191
00:23:30,813 --> 00:23:32,479
He'll be fine.
I've seen worse.

192
00:23:32,563 --> 00:23:34,979
Do we still have
a phone line to the outside?

193
00:23:36,813 --> 00:23:39,521
Akimov?

194
00:23:39,605 --> 00:23:41,646
Call in the day shift.

195
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,229
- But if the--
- We have to keep water
flowing into the core.

196
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:48,646
We need electricians,
mechanics, we need bodies.

197
00:23:49,438 --> 00:23:52,021
How many times
do I have to say it?

198
00:23:59,937 --> 00:24:02,104
I'm going to
the Administration Building now

199
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:04,730
to call Bryukhanov and Fomin.

200
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:07,229
They're gonna want
a full report.

201
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:12,104
Now, I don't know if I can
make things better for you,

202
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:15,021
but I can certainly
make them worse.

203
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:19,646
Call in the day shift,
Comrade Akimov.

204
00:24:23,187 --> 00:24:24,855
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

205
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,563
You're doing fine.

206
00:25:00,646 --> 00:25:02,563
Raise her up.

207
00:25:05,646 --> 00:25:07,313
That one, maybe an hour.

208
00:25:07,396 --> 00:25:09,563
This one, not until morning.

209
00:25:11,646 --> 00:25:15,605
- How's it
downstairs, doctor?
- Quiet.

210
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:17,396
Always is.

211
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:20,229
Nothing at this hour but babies.

212
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,979
You know, I once went
two days without sleep?

213
00:25:24,062 --> 00:25:26,688
Ten women went into labor
at the same time.

214
00:25:26,771 --> 00:25:29,146
- Did I ever tell
you that story?
- Yes.

215
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:33,021
Well, I won't need you
in here for a while.

216
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:35,896
If you want, get some rest
in the break room.

217
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:38,937
They haven't brought
anyone in from the fire.

218
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:42,104
- What fire?
- The power plant.

219
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:45,771
Oh. Then it
mustn't be too bad.

220
00:25:47,021 --> 00:25:48,771
Do we stock iodine?

221
00:25:48,855 --> 00:25:50,771
- Hmm?
- Iodine.

222
00:25:51,937 --> 00:25:56,062
- You mean disinfectant?
- No, pills. Does the hospital
stock iodine pills?

223
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:59,104
Iodine pills?
Why would we have
iodine pills?

224
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:13,605
Hello?

225
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:16,104
Hello?

226
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:25,146
Who else knows this?

227
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:28,688
Have you called Fomin?

228
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:31,896
Of course I want you
to call him.

229
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:34,187
If I'm up, he's up.

230
00:27:12,521 --> 00:27:14,438
Whatever the cause,
the important thing is

231
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:16,229
that neither you nor I--

232
00:27:57,354 --> 00:27:59,354
I take it the safety test
was a failure?

233
00:27:59,438 --> 00:28:02,688
- We have the situation
under control.
- Under control?

234
00:28:02,771 --> 00:28:05,563
- It doesn't look like
it's under control.
- Shut up, Fomin.

235
00:28:06,896 --> 00:28:09,521
I have to tell the Central
Committee about this.
Do you realize that?

236
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,896
I have to get on the phone
and tell Maryin,

237
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:13,438
or God forbid Frolyshev,

238
00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:15,229
that my power plant is on fire.

239
00:28:15,313 --> 00:28:17,730
No one can blame you for this,
Director Bryukhanov.

240
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:19,521
Of course no one can
blame me for this.

241
00:28:19,605 --> 00:28:22,771
How can I be responsible?
I was sleeping.

242
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:25,937
Tell me what happened, quickly.

243
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:31,104
We ran the test exactly as
Chief Engineer Fomin approved.

244
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:33,813
Unit Shift Chief Akimov
and Engineer Toptunov

245
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:36,354
encountered technical
difficulties leading

246
00:28:36,438 --> 00:28:39,771
to an accumulation of hydrogen
in the control system tank.

247
00:28:39,855 --> 00:28:41,396
It regrettably ignited,

248
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:44,104
damaging the plant,
setting the roof on fire.

249
00:28:46,354 --> 00:28:48,229
The tank is quite large.

250
00:28:48,313 --> 00:28:50,354
It's the only
logical explanation.

251
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:53,896
Of course, Deputy Chief
Engineer Dyatlov

252
00:28:53,979 --> 00:28:56,605
was directly
supervising the test,

253
00:28:56,688 --> 00:28:58,104
so he would know best.

254
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:00,479
- A hydrogen tank, fire...

255
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:04,563
- Reactor?
- We're taking
measures to ensure

256
00:29:04,646 --> 00:29:07,062
a steady flow of water
through the core.

257
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:10,104
- What about radiation?
- Obviously, down here
it's nothing.

258
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:12,896
But in the reactor building,
I'm being told

259
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:15,021
3.6 roentgen per hour.

260
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:17,271
Well, that's not great,
but it's not horrifying.

261
00:29:17,354 --> 00:29:18,937
Not at all.

262
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:22,062
- From the feedwater,
I assume?
- Mm-hmm.

263
00:29:22,146 --> 00:29:24,438
We'll have to limit shifts

264
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:26,605
to six hours at a time,
but otherwise...

265
00:29:26,688 --> 00:29:29,271
The dosimetrists
should be checking regularly.

266
00:29:30,146 --> 00:29:34,062
Have them use
the good meter from the safe.

267
00:29:35,146 --> 00:29:38,313
Right.
I'll call Maryin.

268
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:41,521
Have them wake up the local
executive committee.

269
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:43,771
There'll be orders coming down.

270
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,979
- Here.
- No.

271
00:29:51,062 --> 00:29:53,688
You sure? Okay.

272
00:29:56,688 --> 00:29:59,354
- What do you think
makes the colors?
- Oh...

273
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:03,396
- It's the fuel for sure.
- "Oh. It's the fuel for sure"?

274
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:06,896
What do you know about it?
You clean floors
at a train station.

275
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:08,688
My friend, Yuri, works
at the power plant.

276
00:30:08,771 --> 00:30:10,354
He says it runs cold.

277
00:30:10,438 --> 00:30:12,229
No gas, no fire. Just atoms.

278
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:15,479
Yuri says the only thing is,
you can't walk right up
to the fuel.

279
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,438
If you do, a glass of vodka
an hour for four hours.

280
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:21,438
Isn't Yuri a plumber?

281
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:23,937
At the nuclear
power plant, yeah.

282
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,062
It is beautiful.

283
00:30:33,104 --> 00:30:34,730
Yeah.

284
00:32:26,354 --> 00:32:28,354
Do you have a cigarette?

285
00:32:53,646 --> 00:32:55,646
Do you need help?

286
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,730
It's over.

287
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,521
We've done all we can
from the perimeter.

288
00:34:09,605 --> 00:34:12,438
We need to start making
our way to the roof.

289
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:21,771
Vasily!
You've gotta put it out.

290
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,187
That's enough, comrades.
We're pushing ahead.

291
00:34:34,313 --> 00:34:35,937
Come on, boys.

292
00:34:41,605 --> 00:34:43,479
Vasily, it's just past,
straight up.

293
00:34:43,563 --> 00:34:45,479
All the way up, all the way in.

294
00:34:47,521 --> 00:34:49,021
Come on!

295
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:03,313
Yeah. Going in now.

296
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:52,730
What about the auxiliary?

297
00:35:52,813 --> 00:35:56,229
The pumps are gone,
electrical's gone.

298
00:35:56,313 --> 00:36:00,229
- The core?
- I didn't go in there,
and I won't.

299
00:36:02,229 --> 00:36:04,479
- I think it's time we faced--
- No, we have to get water
into the core.

300
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:06,313
Otherwise,
there'll be a meltdown.

301
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:08,313
We have to open the valves.

302
00:36:08,396 --> 00:36:10,605
- Sasha...
- What do you want, Boris?

303
00:36:10,688 --> 00:36:12,479
If it's true, then we're dead,
a million people are dead.

304
00:36:12,563 --> 00:36:14,730
Is that what you need to hear?

305
00:36:16,187 --> 00:36:18,146
We have to open the valves.

306
00:36:18,229 --> 00:36:20,354
- By hand.
- By hand?

307
00:36:20,438 --> 00:36:22,979
You know, the number of valves,
the amount of time
to turn them,

308
00:36:23,062 --> 00:36:24,688
you're talking
about hours in there!

309
00:36:24,771 --> 00:36:26,313
- Then help us.
- Help you do what?

310
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:29,730
Pump water into a ditch?
There's nothing there!

311
00:36:38,937 --> 00:36:40,896
Leonid, I'm begging you.

312
00:36:54,271 --> 00:36:55,937
Watch the panel
while we're gone.

313
00:36:56,021 --> 00:36:57,479
It's not working.

314
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:00,396
Just watch it.

315
00:37:22,062 --> 00:37:23,813
I guess we know why
they called us in early.

316
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:26,563
Is anyone saying what happened?

317
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:28,896
They were running the safety
test on the turbines,

318
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:31,104
blew the control system tank.

319
00:37:32,229 --> 00:37:33,646
It doesn't make sense
to me either.

320
00:37:35,396 --> 00:37:37,521
What about sabotage?

321
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:39,146
A bomb?

322
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:43,479
Sitnikov! Bryukhanov wants us
to use the good dosimeter,

323
00:37:43,563 --> 00:37:46,354
but it's in the safe,
and we can't find the key.

324
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:49,771
It's in Building 2.
Hasn't--?

325
00:37:49,855 --> 00:37:51,521
Follow me.

326
00:38:02,937 --> 00:38:04,438
Gentlemen, welcome.

327
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:07,688
Please, uh, find a seat.
Plenty of room.

328
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:11,271
I apologize for
the lateness of the hour.

329
00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:15,438
Rest assured, we are all
very safe down here.

330
00:38:15,521 --> 00:38:18,187
We built this shelter
to withstand a nuclear attack

331
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:21,563
by the Americans,
so I think we'll be fine.

332
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:25,605
As you can see, we have
experienced an accident.

333
00:38:25,688 --> 00:38:28,271
A large control tank
malfunctioned,

334
00:38:28,354 --> 00:38:32,229
damaging reactor Building 4
and starting a fire.

335
00:38:32,313 --> 00:38:35,979
Now, I have spoken directly
to Deputy Secretary Maryin.

336
00:38:36,062 --> 00:38:38,313
Maryin spoke
to Deputy Chief Frolyshev,

337
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:41,605
Frolyshev to Central Committee
member Dolgikh,

338
00:38:41,688 --> 00:38:44,979
and Dolgikh to
General Secretary Gorbachev.

339
00:38:45,062 --> 00:38:46,896
Now...

340
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:52,229
Because the Central Committee
has the greatest respect

341
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:56,271
for the work of the Pripyat
Executive Committee,

342
00:38:56,354 --> 00:39:00,354
they have asked me to brief you
on matters as they stand, so...

343
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:05,646
- First, the accident...
- is well under control.

344
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:10,979
And second, because the efforts
of the Soviet nuclear industry

345
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:14,771
are considered key state
secrets, it is important

346
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:18,187
that we ensure
that this incident

347
00:39:18,271 --> 00:39:20,354
has no adverse consequences.

348
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:24,563
Now, to prevent a panic,
the Central Committee
have ordered

349
00:39:24,646 --> 00:39:27,521
a detachment of military
police to Pripyat.

350
00:39:27,605 --> 00:39:29,438
How large of a detachment?

351
00:39:30,855 --> 00:39:32,896
Between two
and four thousand men.

352
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:38,937
What's really going on here?
How dangerous is this?

353
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:43,021
There's mild radiation,
but it's limited
to the plant itself.

354
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:46,187
- No, it isn't.
- Excuse me?

355
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:50,187
You saw men outside vomiting.

356
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:52,104
You saw men with burns.

357
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:55,563
There's more radiation
than they're saying.

358
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:57,937
We have wives here,
we have children.

359
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:00,730
I say we evacuate the town.

360
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:02,563
Gentlemen--

361
00:40:02,646 --> 00:40:06,855
Please, please.
My wife is here.

362
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,979
Do you think I would
keep her in Pripyat

363
00:40:09,062 --> 00:40:10,396
if it wasn't safe?

364
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:14,104
Bryukhanov, the air is glowing.

365
00:40:14,187 --> 00:40:17,229
The Cherenkov effect.
Completely normal phenomenon.

366
00:40:17,313 --> 00:40:19,187
It can happen
with minimal radiation.

367
00:40:29,605 --> 00:40:33,646
I wonder how many of you
know the name of this place.

368
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:39,396
We all call it
"Chernobyl," of course.

369
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,813
What is its real name?

370
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:46,730
The Vladimir I. Lenin
Nuclear Power Station.

371
00:40:46,813 --> 00:40:48,855
Exactly.

372
00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:54,855
Vladimir I. Lenin.

373
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:05,688
And how proud he would be
of you all tonight.

374
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,021
Especially you, young man,

375
00:41:10,021 --> 00:41:12,896
and the passion you have
for the people.

376
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:17,896
For is that not the sole purpose
of the apparatus of the State?

377
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:21,646
Sometimes, we forget.

378
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,521
Sometimes, we fall prey to fear.

379
00:41:27,396 --> 00:41:31,187
But our faith in
Soviet socialism

380
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:34,187
will always be rewarded.

381
00:41:36,354 --> 00:41:40,605
Now, the State tells us
the situation here is
not dangerous.

382
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:43,229
Have faith, comrades.

383
00:41:44,855 --> 00:41:48,313
The State tells us
it wants to prevent a panic.

384
00:41:48,396 --> 00:41:50,605
Listen well.

385
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:57,271
It's true, when the people see
the police, they will be afraid.

386
00:41:58,605 --> 00:42:00,730
But it is my experience

387
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:03,979
that when the people
ask questions

388
00:42:04,062 --> 00:42:07,354
that are not in their
own best interest,

389
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:09,354
they should simply be told

390
00:42:09,438 --> 00:42:11,605
to keep their minds
on their labor

391
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:17,479
and leave matters
of the State to the State.

392
00:42:19,146 --> 00:42:21,229
We seal off the city.

393
00:42:22,396 --> 00:42:24,062
No one leaves.

394
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:26,896
And cut the phone lines.

395
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:29,771
Contain the spread
of misinformation.

396
00:42:32,438 --> 00:42:35,229
That is how we keep the people

397
00:42:35,313 --> 00:42:38,479
from undermining the fruits
of their own labor.

398
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:43,313
Yes, comrades...

399
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:48,646
we will all be rewarded
for what we do here tonight.

400
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:55,479
This is our moment to shine.

401
00:43:07,646 --> 00:43:08,855
Thank you.

402
00:43:21,313 --> 00:43:24,313
Comrade Sitnikov to see
the Chief Engineer.

403
00:43:37,187 --> 00:43:38,354
Well?

404
00:43:44,979 --> 00:43:48,187
I sent my dosimetrists
into the reactor building.

405
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:50,979
The large dosimeter
from the safe,

406
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,896
the one with
the 1,000-roentgen capacity--

407
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:54,313
What was the number?

408
00:43:57,563 --> 00:43:58,771
There was none.

409
00:43:58,855 --> 00:44:01,730
The meter burned out
the second it was turned on.

410
00:44:02,563 --> 00:44:04,438
- It's typical.
- See? This is
what Moscow does.

411
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:07,646
Sends us shit equipment, then
wonders why things go wrong.

412
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:09,937
We found another dosimeter

413
00:44:10,021 --> 00:44:11,979
from the military
fire department.

414
00:44:12,062 --> 00:44:15,021
It only goes
to 200 roentgen, but it's
better than the small ones.

415
00:44:15,104 --> 00:44:16,229
And?

416
00:44:17,479 --> 00:44:19,354
It maxed out.

417
00:44:19,438 --> 00:44:21,021
Two hundred roentgen.

418
00:44:23,521 --> 00:44:25,605
What game are you playing?

419
00:44:25,688 --> 00:44:27,104
No, I--I--

420
00:44:27,187 --> 00:44:30,813
I asked him, he took
multiple measurements,
he's my best man.

421
00:44:30,896 --> 00:44:33,563
It's another faulty meter.
You're wasting our time.

422
00:44:33,646 --> 00:44:35,396
I checked the meter
against the control.

423
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:37,730
What's wrong with you?
How'd you get that number

424
00:44:37,813 --> 00:44:40,062
from feedwater leaking
from a blown tank?

425
00:44:43,563 --> 00:44:47,104
- You don't.
- Then what the fuck
are you talking about?

426
00:44:51,229 --> 00:44:53,104
I, um...

427
00:44:54,937 --> 00:44:58,438
I walked around
the exterior of Building 4.

428
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:02,937
I think there's graphite
on the ground in the rubble.

429
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:05,730
You didn't see graphite.

430
00:45:06,646 --> 00:45:08,563
- I did.
- You didn't.

431
00:45:09,479 --> 00:45:13,271
You didn't!
Because it's not there!

432
00:45:14,146 --> 00:45:15,771
What?

433
00:45:15,855 --> 00:45:19,354
Are you suggesting
the core... what?

434
00:45:19,438 --> 00:45:21,605
Exploded?

435
00:45:23,271 --> 00:45:24,605
Yes.

436
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,313
Sitnikov.

437
00:45:35,563 --> 00:45:38,104
You're a nuclear
engineer, so am I.

438
00:45:38,187 --> 00:45:44,396
Please tell me how an RBMK
reactor core explodes.

439
00:45:44,479 --> 00:45:48,146
Not a meltdown, an explosion.

440
00:45:48,229 --> 00:45:49,979
I'd love to know.

441
00:45:51,146 --> 00:45:52,479
I can't.

442
00:45:53,354 --> 00:45:54,855
Are you stupid?

443
00:45:55,979 --> 00:45:58,771
- No.
- Then why can't you?

444
00:46:00,104 --> 00:46:01,688
I...

445
00:46:03,646 --> 00:46:06,271
I don't see how
it could explode.

446
00:46:08,646 --> 00:46:10,396
- But it did.
- Enough!

447
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:12,271
I'll go up
to the vent block roof.

448
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:15,730
From there you can look right
down into reactor Building 4.

449
00:46:15,813 --> 00:46:19,479
I'll see it with my own...
my own eyes.

450
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,313
I apologize.

451
00:46:28,813 --> 00:46:30,563
Guards! Guards!

452
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:34,855
Get him to the medic
or the hospital!
Whatever he needs!

453
00:46:50,937 --> 00:46:54,187
It's the feedwater.
Been around it all night.

454
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,896
You go then.

455
00:47:00,896 --> 00:47:02,396
What?

456
00:47:02,479 --> 00:47:06,855
- Go to the vent block roof
and report back what you see.
- No.

457
00:47:10,438 --> 00:47:14,271
- No, I won't do that.
- Of course you will.

458
00:47:19,396 --> 00:47:22,730
You'll be fine. You'll see.

459
00:47:24,062 --> 00:47:25,563
Come on.

460
00:48:06,896 --> 00:48:08,271
Okay.

461
00:48:09,937 --> 00:48:11,438
Let's begin.

462
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,021
Leonid.

463
00:48:24,646 --> 00:48:26,021
Leonid.

464
00:48:27,146 --> 00:48:28,479
Oh...

465
00:48:34,438 --> 00:48:36,563
It's all the way, okay?

466
00:48:36,646 --> 00:48:38,771
All the way open.

467
00:48:47,479 --> 00:48:48,813
I'm sorry.

468
00:48:52,813 --> 00:48:54,730
There's nothing to be sorry for.

469
00:48:54,813 --> 00:48:58,146
I told you,
we did nothing wrong.

470
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,187
But we did.

471
00:52:50,271 --> 00:52:51,396
Hello?

472
00:52:51,479 --> 00:52:53,187
- Valery Legasov?
- Yes.

473
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:55,813
You are the Legasov who is
the First Deputy Director

474
00:52:55,896 --> 00:52:58,396
of the Kurchatov Institute
of Atomic Energy?

475
00:52:58,479 --> 00:53:00,979
- I am. Who am I--?
- This is Boris Shcherbina,

476
00:53:01,062 --> 00:53:03,062
Deputy Chairman of
the Council of Ministers

477
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:05,771
and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.

478
00:53:05,855 --> 00:53:10,605
There's been an accident
at the Chernobyl Nuclear
Power Plant.

479
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:11,855
How bad is it?

480
00:53:11,937 --> 00:53:14,104
No. No need to panic.
There was a fire.

481
00:53:14,187 --> 00:53:17,146
It's mostly put out.
The system control
tank exploded.

482
00:53:17,229 --> 00:53:20,771
Control system tank.
And the core?

483
00:53:20,855 --> 00:53:24,021
We've ordered them to
continuously pump water.

484
00:53:24,104 --> 00:53:26,771
Yes, I see.
Any contamination?

485
00:53:26,855 --> 00:53:29,688
It's mild. The plant manager,
Bryukhanov, is reporting

486
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:31,271
3.6 roentgen per hour.

487
00:53:31,354 --> 00:53:33,521
That's actually significant.
You should evacuate the sur--

488
00:53:33,605 --> 00:53:38,021
You're an expert on
RBMK reactors, correct?

489
00:53:38,104 --> 00:53:42,313
- Yes, I've studied--
- General Secretary Gorbachev
has appointed a committee

490
00:53:42,396 --> 00:53:46,021
to manage the accident.
You're on it.

491
00:53:46,104 --> 00:53:48,271
We'll convene
at two this afternoon.

492
00:53:48,354 --> 00:53:51,438
That late? Forgive me,
but don't you think

493
00:53:51,521 --> 00:53:53,271
given the amount of radiation
that it would be--

494
00:53:53,354 --> 00:53:56,146
Legasov, you're on this
committee to answer
direct questions

495
00:53:56,229 --> 00:53:59,062
about the function
of an RBMK reactor

496
00:53:59,146 --> 00:54:02,104
if they should happen
to arise. Nothing else.

497
00:54:02,187 --> 00:54:04,896
Certainly not policy.
Do you understand?

498
00:54:04,979 --> 00:54:07,896
- Yes, of course.
- I didn't mean to--

499
00:58:58,354 --> 00:58:59,855
I'm pleased to report that

500
00:58:59,937 --> 00:59:01,937
the situation
in Chernobyl is stable.

501
00:59:04,271 --> 00:59:05,479
In terms of radiation,

502
00:59:05,563 --> 00:59:08,146
I'm told it's the equivalent
of a chest X-ray.

503
00:59:11,438 --> 00:59:12,313
No!

504
00:59:12,771 --> 00:59:15,104
The fire is giving off
nearly twice the radiation

505
00:59:15,187 --> 00:59:16,979
released by the bomb
in Hiroshima.

506
00:59:18,062 --> 00:59:19,563
It will burn
and spread its poison

507
00:59:19,646 --> 00:59:21,855
until the entire continent
is dead.

508
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,521
Tell our soldiers,

509
00:59:28,813 --> 00:59:29,896
"You will need to move quickly,

510
00:59:29,979 --> 00:59:32,021
and you will need to move
carefully.

511
00:59:33,605 --> 00:59:36,688
These are the most important
90 seconds of your lives.

512
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:40,688
I wish you good health
and long life."

513
00:59:41,896 --> 00:59:43,479
I serve the Soviet Union.

514
00:59:44,062 --> 00:59:45,730
I serve the Soviet Union.

515
00:59:46,438 --> 00:59:48,104
I serve the Soviet Union.

516
00:59:56,855 --> 00:59:58,937
The official position
of the state

517
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:01,688
is that
a global nuclear catastrophe

518
01:00:01,771 --> 01:00:03,771
is not possible
in the Soviet Union.

1
00:00:08,118 --> 00:00:09,451
Where are you going?

2
00:00:10,702 --> 00:00:11,743
Chernobyl.

3
00:00:15,577 --> 00:00:18,660
Ignatenko, fire and rescue unit.
I need to find him!

4
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:20,868
Moscow.
Hospital number six.

5
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:22,909
Are you here
because of the fire?

6
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:25,285
Anything we should be
worried about?

7
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,243
No.

8
00:00:28,827 --> 00:00:30,743
It cannot go over the core.

9
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,034
The nuclear plant in Sweden
has detected radiation.

10
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:40,451
At least evacuate Pripyat.

11
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:43,201
When the lava enters
these tanks,

12
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:44,785
it will instantly superheat,

13
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:48,201
causing a significant
thermal explosion.

14
00:00:48,577 --> 00:00:50,034
And how long before
this happens?

15
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:52,451
Approximately 48 to 72 hours,

16
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,410
but we may have a solution.

18
00:03:24,785 --> 00:03:27,868
Is it possible that the water
has already killed them?

19
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:30,201
Yes.

20
00:03:30,285 --> 00:03:31,951
Then what?

21
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:34,993
If it doesn't work?

22
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:09,951
Get them in the truck.

23
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:12,368
Get the hoses in!
Start pumping!

24
00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:31,326
Uh, I'm here to see my
husband, Vasily Ignatenko.

25
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,159
He's a firefighter from Chernobyl.
I have permission.

26
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:37,118
Chernobyl?
I'm sorry, no visitors.

27
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:41,493
Well, but Major Burov told me,

28
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:42,951
- he said--
- No exceptions.

29
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:45,785
Please. I've come all the way
from Kievskaya Oblast.

30
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,451
Excuse me.

31
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,034
Excuse me, excuse me.

32
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:17,827
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

33
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:20,535
- I have a pass.
- You can't be here. It's not safe.

34
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:22,201
I am here to see my husband.

35
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:23,535
Vasily Ignatenko.

36
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:25,201
He's a firefighter
from Chernobyl.

37
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,868
I know who Ignatenko is,
but you can't.

38
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:29,993
I have permission.
I-I've...

39
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:39,201
You can see him for 30
minutes, not a minute more.

40
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:42,535
And you cannot touch him in any way.
Do you understand?

41
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:44,451
- Yeah.
- Room 15.

42
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:48,118
Thank you.

43
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,118
- You're not pregnant, are you?
- No.

44
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,660
I won't have to give
that to you.

45
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:00,993
There they are.

46
00:07:01,076 --> 00:07:02,909
No, wait, wait, wait.
I haven't finished yet.

47
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:04,285
No, he hasn't.

48
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:06,243
Yeah, that's good.

49
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:10,660
Yeah, better.

50
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:15,159
Look who the cat dragged in.

51
00:07:16,993 --> 00:07:18,993
What did I tell you?

52
00:07:20,034 --> 00:07:22,868
- There's no hiding
from you, is there?

53
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:27,660
Easy, easy. It's okay.

54
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,076
We're all okay.
Yeah, we're okay.

55
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:44,535
How, how, how did this happen?
Who gave them the idea?

56
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:46,493
- Are you suggesting I did?
- Someone did.

57
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:50,034
Someone decided
that the evacuation zone

58
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:53,326
should be 30 kilometers,
when we know, here,

59
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,076
Cesium-137
in the Gomel district.

60
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,535
- That's 200 kilometers away!
- It was decided.

61
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:01,118
- Based on what?
- I don't know!

62
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:06,368
Forgive me. Maybe I've just
spent too much time in my lab.

63
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:08,201
Or maybe I'm just stupid.

64
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:11,493
Is this really the way
it all works?

65
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:13,493
An uninformed,
arbitrary decision

66
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:15,827
that will cost who knows
how many lives

67
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:19,868
made by some apparatchik,
some career party man?

68
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:24,326
I'm a career party man.

69
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:27,993
You should watch your tone,
Comrade Legasov.

70
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:31,034
Comrades...

71
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:33,702
We have visual confirmation that
the fire is nearly extinguished.

72
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:35,993
There has also been
a reduction in iodine 131

73
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,076
and cesium-137 emissions.

74
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,076
Good. Yes?

75
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,076
But the temperature is rising.

76
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,660
And, uh...

77
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:54,827
There's a spike in zirconium-95.

78
00:09:55,993 --> 00:09:59,285
It's from the cladding
on the fuel rods.

79
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:01,743
Meaning what?

80
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:04,368
The meltdown has begun.

81
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:44,451
Get it off me!

82
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:49,410
Get it off me!

83
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:58,285
Stop moving!

84
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:01,034
- Get off him!
You're hurting him!

85
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,909
- You can't be in here.
- What's happening to him?

86
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:06,159
Get out!

87
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:08,243
You can't be in here!

88
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:53,159
- Yes?
- Comrade Shcherbina is on the phone.

89
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:54,660
Put him through.

90
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:57,285
Well?

91
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:58,993
The fire's nearly out.

92
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:00,743
The bubbler tanks
are being drained.

93
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:03,951
We have successfully eliminated
the risk of a thermal explosion.

94
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,201
And?

95
00:12:09,702 --> 00:12:11,201
The situation inside the core

96
00:12:11,285 --> 00:12:14,076
is deteriorating
faster than anticipated.

97
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,034
The concrete pad will last
for six to eight weeks,

98
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:20,326
but after that,
Legasov estimates a 50% chance

99
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,493
that the fuel will
breach the pad

100
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:24,993
and melt down into
the groundwater itself.

101
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:28,368
And where does this
groundwater go?

102
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:30,410
The Pripyat River,

103
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:33,410
which feeds into the Dnieper.

104
00:12:33,493 --> 00:12:37,034
The primary water supply for
approximately 50 million people,

105
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:38,868
not to mention crops
and livestock,

106
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:40,993
would be... unusable.

107
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:43,951
We're recommending we install
a heat exchanger under the pad

108
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:47,034
to lower to core temperature
and halt the meltdown.

109
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:51,201
And in order to do that,
I'm told that we will need...

110
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,702
all of the liquid nitrogen
in the Soviet Union.

111
00:12:58,618 --> 00:12:59,827
Oh.

112
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:03,535
- All right.
- Yeah, and of course, we'll also need--

113
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:05,159
Whatever you need, you have it.

114
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,660
- That should be clear by now.
- Yes.

115
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:08,285
- Anything else?
- No, no, no. Thank you.

116
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:11,285
Yes. I'd like to address the
30-kilometer exclusion zone.

117
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:14,451
Wait, what?
Professor Legasov, is that you?

118
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:15,535
What exclusion zone?

119
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:17,702
Minor details,
General Secretary.

120
00:13:17,785 --> 00:13:20,285
Um, Premier Ryzhkov
has determined that--

121
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:22,451
If he determined,
then he determined.

122
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,201
Look, Professor Legasov,

123
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:26,285
you are there
for one reason only.

124
00:13:26,368 --> 00:13:28,451
Do you understand?
To make this stop.

125
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:29,827
I don't want questions.

126
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,618
I want to know when
this will be over.

127
00:13:31,702 --> 00:13:33,868
If you mean when will
Chernobyl be completely safe,

128
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:37,076
the half-life of plutonium-239
is 24,000 years.

129
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:40,368
So perhaps we should just say,
"Not within our lifetimes."

130
00:13:52,702 --> 00:13:54,618
I think you and I
should take a walk.

131
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:56,743
It's late. I'm tired.

132
00:13:57,743 --> 00:14:00,285
We're taking a walk.

133
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:09,326
Was it it you want?
An apology?

134
00:14:10,702 --> 00:14:12,368
Not gonna sit back and...

135
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:17,493
What will happen to our boys?

136
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:19,868
Which boys?
The divers?

137
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:23,285
The divers, the firefighters,
the men in the control room.

138
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:26,951
What does the radiation
do to them precisely?

139
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,285
At the levels some
of them were exposed?

140
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:35,201
Ionizing radiation tears
the cellular structure apart.

141
00:14:35,285 --> 00:14:38,868
The skin blisters,
turns red, then black.

142
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:42,702
This is followed
by a latency period.

143
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:45,577
The immediate effects subside.

144
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,702
The patient appears
to be recovering.

145
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:51,201
Healthy, even.
But they aren't.

146
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:56,326
This usually only lasts
for a day or two.

147
00:14:58,702 --> 00:14:59,993
Continue.

148
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:04,868
Then the cellular damage
begins to manifest.

149
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:10,285
The bone marrow dies,
the immune system fails,

150
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:14,159
the organs and soft tissue
begin to decompose.

151
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:18,243
The arteries and veins
spill open like sieves,

152
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:20,785
to the point where you can't
even administer morphine

153
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:25,118
for the pain,
which is... unimaginable.

154
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:28,702
And then three days
to three weeks, you are dead.

155
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:33,368
That is what will happen
to those boys.

156
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:36,993
And what about us?

157
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:41,909
Well, we've...

158
00:15:41,993 --> 00:15:46,159
We've gotten a steady dose,
but not as much of it.

159
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:48,243
Not strong enough
to kill the cells,

160
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:51,368
but consistent enough
to damage our DNA.

161
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,118
So, in time... cancer.

162
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:59,410
Or aplastic anemia.
Either way, fatal.

163
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:03,743
Well...

164
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:11,243
in a sense, it would seem we've
gotten off easy then, Valery.

165
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,785
I've seen them before.

166
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:34,785
Now you know why
I wanted to take a walk.

167
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:37,410
We can presume
the work site is bugged.

168
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:41,993
And our rooms,
even our bathrooms.

169
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:44,493
They've been here
the whole time.

170
00:16:44,577 --> 00:16:46,660
Of course they've been
here the whole time.

171
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:51,493
But if we're seeing them
out in the open now,

172
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,410
it's because
they want us to know.

173
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:37,660
You've seen that?

174
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:42,034
The fuel is melting
faster than we expected.

175
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:45,159
I know. I have a plan.

176
00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:47,868
Heat exchanger, I hope.

177
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:49,451
Yes.

178
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:54,368
There's something I've wanted
to ask you, comrade,

179
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:57,868
but I see you're already asking
yourself the same question.

180
00:18:01,868 --> 00:18:04,243
Why did it explode?

181
00:18:05,743 --> 00:18:07,951
I've worked the numbers
over and over,

182
00:18:08,034 --> 00:18:11,909
presuming the worst possible
conditions in an RBMK reactor.

183
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,243
And I always get
the same answer.

184
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:17,827
Which is?

185
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:21,410
It's not possible.

186
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:22,993
And yet...

187
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:28,326
You're not going
to solve this here.

188
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:31,493
Not on paper.

189
00:18:32,993 --> 00:18:34,868
Everyone who was
in the control room,

190
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:37,243
Dyatlov, Akimov, Toptunov,

191
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:41,493
they're all in Moscow,
Hospital Number 6.

192
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:44,785
We need to find out exactly
what happened that night,

193
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:48,410
moment by moment,
decision by decision.

194
00:18:49,618 --> 00:18:51,909
Go now while
they're still alive.

195
00:18:51,993 --> 00:18:53,868
Talk to them.

196
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:56,827
Because if we don't find out
how this happened,

197
00:18:56,909 --> 00:18:59,243
it will happen again.

198
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:03,951
And, Khomyuk...

199
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,743
be careful.

200
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:32,951
Well, fuck you!

201
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:38,076
Hey, here's one, here's one.

202
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:40,076
What's as big as a house,

203
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,034
burns 20 liters
of fuel every hour,

204
00:19:43,118 --> 00:19:44,993
puts out a shit-load
of smoke and noise,

205
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:48,993
and cuts an apple
into three pieces?

206
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:54,451
A Soviet machine made to cut
apples into four pieces!

207
00:20:33,785 --> 00:20:36,951
- Who's in charge here?
- I'm the crew chief.

208
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:41,034
I am Shadov,
minister of coal industries.

209
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:42,785
We know who you are.

210
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:46,410
How many men do you have?

211
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:50,618
On this shift, 45 here,
a hundred in total.

212
00:20:50,702 --> 00:20:55,076
I need all 100 men to gather their
equipment and get in the trucks.

213
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:58,660
Do you? To where?

214
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,493
That's classified.

215
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:08,993
Come on, then.

216
00:21:09,076 --> 00:21:10,702
Start shooting.

217
00:21:10,785 --> 00:21:13,993
You haven't got enough
bullets for all of us.

218
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:16,076
Kill as many as you can,
whoever's left,

219
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,993
they'll beat the living piss
out of each of you.

220
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:21,410
- You can't talk to us like that!
- Shut the fuck up!

221
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:24,326
This is Tula.
This is our mine.

222
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,410
We don't leave
unless we know why.

223
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:30,577
Mm.

224
00:21:34,451 --> 00:21:36,535
You're going to Chernobyl.

225
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:40,951
Do you know
what's happened there?

226
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:43,285
We dig up coal, not bodies.

227
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,535
The reactor fuel is going
to sink into the ground

228
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:49,868
and poison the water
from Kiev to the Black Sea.

229
00:21:49,951 --> 00:21:51,410
All of it.

230
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:53,909
Forever, they say.

231
00:21:55,827 --> 00:21:59,118
They want you to stop
that from happening.

232
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:01,451
And how are
we supposed to do that?

233
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:06,118
They didn't tell me,
because I don't need to know.

234
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,118
Do you need to know,
or have you heard enough?

235
00:22:50,993 --> 00:22:53,993
Now you look like
the minister of coal.

236
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:16,951
Vasya?

237
00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:19,785
Vasya?

238
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:27,785
No, no, no.

239
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:30,118
They told you no touching.

240
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,451
It's not safe.

241
00:23:32,535 --> 00:23:34,827
They touch you.

242
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:37,993
If it's safe for them,
it's safe for me.

243
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,909
Where are the others?

244
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:52,493
They took them
to a special room.

245
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:55,201
They won't tell me where.

246
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:01,951
Will you open the curtains?

247
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:05,326
- Hmm?
- Open the curtains.

248
00:24:08,743 --> 00:24:10,410
Aah.

249
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,326
Please, tell me
what you see outside.

250
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,951
Tell me everything.

251
00:24:39,535 --> 00:24:40,868
Huh.

252
00:24:42,451 --> 00:24:44,535
I can see the Red Square.

253
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,326
And...

254
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,118
the Kremlin.

255
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:55,827
Spasskaya Tower, the Mausoleum.

256
00:24:58,201 --> 00:25:00,702
You see St. Basil's?

257
00:25:00,785 --> 00:25:02,909
Yeah.

258
00:25:02,993 --> 00:25:04,868
Ah.

259
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:06,743
Yes, it's beautiful.

260
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:10,159
I told you.

261
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:13,577
I told you I'd show
you Moscow, remember?

262
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,618
- Huh?
- Yeah. Yes.

263
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,243
Thank you.

264
00:26:11,368 --> 00:26:14,201
I'm not eating that.
It's shit.

265
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:17,201
Get me something else.

266
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:20,034
I'm not a nurse,
Comrade Dyatlov.

267
00:26:20,118 --> 00:26:22,076
I'm a nuclear physicist.

268
00:26:22,785 --> 00:26:25,410
Well, then, Comrade
Nuclear Physicist...

269
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:31,159
unless you happen to have a
butter and caviar sandwich on you,

270
00:26:31,243 --> 00:26:34,493
you can get the fuck
out of my room.

271
00:27:52,243 --> 00:27:53,577
What?

272
00:27:55,076 --> 00:27:57,577
I'm not good at this, Boris.

273
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,410
The lying.

274
00:28:03,868 --> 00:28:06,785
Have you ever spent
time with miners?

275
00:28:08,451 --> 00:28:09,743
No.

276
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:12,368
My advice: tell the truth.

277
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:16,076
These men work in the dark.
They see everything.

278
00:28:17,451 --> 00:28:19,951
Andrei Glukhov, crew chief.

279
00:28:35,368 --> 00:28:37,285
Do these work?

280
00:28:38,201 --> 00:28:39,993
To an extent.

281
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,660
Of course.

282
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:58,618
So what's the job?

283
00:28:59,827 --> 00:29:03,410
We need to install a liquid
nitrogen heat exchanger

284
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:06,618
underneath this concrete pad.

285
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:10,618
There's no way to approach from
the interior of the building,

286
00:29:10,702 --> 00:29:12,743
so you have to get at it
from underground.

287
00:29:12,827 --> 00:29:16,618
- And what's above the pad?
- The core of the nuclear reactor,

288
00:29:16,702 --> 00:29:19,660
which is melting down.

289
00:29:19,743 --> 00:29:22,326
What? Like...

290
00:29:23,868 --> 00:29:25,076
Essentially.

291
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:28,243
Is it gonna fall on top of us?

292
00:29:28,326 --> 00:29:30,326
Not if you're done
within six weeks.

293
00:29:32,285 --> 00:29:34,159
Dimensions?

294
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:39,076
Break ground here,

295
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:41,451
dig a tunnel 150 meters to here,

296
00:29:41,535 --> 00:29:44,660
excavate a space 30 by 30 meters

297
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,368
for the heat exchanger.

298
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,618
And because we need to keep disruption
of the ground above to a minimum,

299
00:29:49,702 --> 00:29:51,577
you can't use
any heavy machinery.

300
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,034
It has to be done by hand.

301
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:55,410
Then I need more men.

302
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:58,285
Four hundred at least.

303
00:29:58,368 --> 00:30:00,868
We'll have to work
around the clock.

304
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:02,785
How deep do you want
this tunnel? Six meters?

305
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,785
- Twelve.
- Twelve? Why?

306
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:08,368
For your protection.

307
00:30:08,451 --> 00:30:12,285
At that depth, you'll be shielded
from much of the radiation.

308
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:16,618
The entrance to the tunnel
won't be 12 meters below ground.

309
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:19,743
No.

310
00:30:19,827 --> 00:30:22,868
And we're not 12 meters
below ground now.

311
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:30,451
No. We're not.

312
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:35,201
We have some equipment
here on site.

313
00:30:35,285 --> 00:30:38,451
More will arrive by midnight.

314
00:30:39,951 --> 00:30:41,451
You can start in the morning.

315
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:43,034
No. We start now.

316
00:30:43,118 --> 00:30:47,076
I don't want my men here one
more second than they need to be.

317
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:52,577
If these worked,
you'd be wearing them.

318
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,201
Are they all like that?

319
00:31:04,285 --> 00:31:06,660
They're all like that.

320
00:32:30,827 --> 00:32:32,034
Yes?

321
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:34,702
- What's it up to?
- Uh, 50 degrees.

322
00:32:39,034 --> 00:32:40,285
Fuck!

323
00:32:44,577 --> 00:32:46,451
Hey!

324
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:47,909
Hey you!

325
00:32:57,285 --> 00:33:00,285
- We need fans.
- For what purpose?

326
00:33:00,368 --> 00:33:02,201
What do you mean,
"For what purpose?"

327
00:33:02,285 --> 00:33:03,993
To dig your fucking tunnel,
that's why.

328
00:33:04,076 --> 00:33:06,951
- Who's talking to you?
- Whoa, whoa. Comrades.

329
00:33:07,034 --> 00:33:09,410
It's 50 degrees down there.

330
00:33:09,493 --> 00:33:11,118
We can't breathe
without the masks,

331
00:33:11,201 --> 00:33:12,660
we can't breathe with the masks.

332
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:15,618
It's like a fucking oven.
We need ventilation.

333
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,827
Fans will put dust in the air,
the dust will go in your lungs.

334
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:21,577
I've been breathing dust
in my lungs for 20 years.

335
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,285
Not this dust.
I'm sorry.

336
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:27,577
For your own good, no fans.

337
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:57,702
My name is Ulana Khomyuk.

338
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:01,285
I'm a nuclear physicist
with the Chernobyl Commission.

339
00:34:03,118 --> 00:34:05,243
I want you to tell me
everything that happened

340
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:07,451
on the night of the accident.

341
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:10,118
Is that all right?

342
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:14,159
Yes.

343
00:34:16,285 --> 00:34:17,868
I want to tell.

344
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:20,493
All right.

345
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:35,951
Your official title was?

346
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:43,243
My name is Leonid
Fedorovych Toptunov.

347
00:34:43,326 --> 00:34:49,493
I am the senior reactor
control chief engineer

348
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:52,201
at Chernobyl Nuclear
Power Plant.

349
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,201
Senior engineer?

350
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,993
How old are you?

351
00:35:06,618 --> 00:35:08,743
I'm 25.

352
00:35:56,493 --> 00:35:58,368
Lyusya? Lyusya?

353
00:35:58,451 --> 00:36:00,868
Yes, I'm here,
I'm here. I'm...

354
00:36:15,868 --> 00:36:17,951
Have you been here
this whole time?

355
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:20,577
No one said I should leave.

356
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,993
I did.

357
00:36:22,076 --> 00:36:23,326
Thirty minutes, I said!

358
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,909
Well, where have you been?
When he's in pain?

359
00:36:26,993 --> 00:36:28,243
When his sores
stick to his gown?

360
00:36:28,326 --> 00:36:29,951
When he soils himself
five times a night?

361
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:31,827
I've been looking after him.
Where have you been?

362
00:36:31,909 --> 00:36:33,743
I've been In the north
and west wing,

363
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:37,326
where there are dozens of patients
from Chernobyl exactly like him.

364
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,076
- It isn't safe for you here.
- He's my husband.

365
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,201
Not anymore.

366
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:42,159
He's something else now.
Do you understand?

367
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:44,993
He's dangerous to you.

368
00:36:45,076 --> 00:36:47,618
He's burned.

369
00:36:47,702 --> 00:36:49,368
Go home.

370
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,535
Please.

371
00:36:54,618 --> 00:36:57,493
It won't take much longer.
I, uh...

372
00:37:00,993 --> 00:37:03,951
I don't want him to die alone.

373
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:08,493
Stay on the other side
of the plastic.

374
00:37:10,076 --> 00:37:11,951
Or I'll have you
removed by security.

375
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:13,368
- Lyusya?
- Yes, my love.

376
00:38:16,368 --> 00:38:19,118
Is it day?

377
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:21,451
No, it's nighttime now.

378
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,285
I think I had a dream,

379
00:38:27,368 --> 00:38:29,285
it's just gone.

380
00:38:30,951 --> 00:38:32,535
Vasya.

381
00:38:38,201 --> 00:38:40,201
We're going to have a baby.

382
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:18,410
The fire's out.

383
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:22,660
It's out, Valera.

384
00:39:23,785 --> 00:39:26,410
The miners are making
incredible progress.

385
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,618
They say the whole job
will be finished in four weeks.

386
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:34,243
Four weeks.

387
00:39:34,326 --> 00:39:36,451
Can you believe that?

388
00:39:42,243 --> 00:39:44,451
I know the job isn't over.

389
00:39:45,993 --> 00:39:47,993
But it's the beginning
of the end.

390
00:39:53,577 --> 00:39:56,451
I'm sorry to bother you,
Deputy Minister, but...

391
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,785
it is the miners.

392
00:40:47,993 --> 00:40:49,243
What?

393
00:40:49,326 --> 00:40:51,909
You wouldn't give us fans,
it's too hot for clothes.

394
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:55,034
So we're digging the old way.
This is how our fathers mined.

395
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:58,827
We're still wearing
the fucking hats.

396
00:40:58,909 --> 00:41:00,702
What do you want?

397
00:41:03,702 --> 00:41:06,451
You're not as protected now.

398
00:41:06,535 --> 00:41:09,243
Are you telling me
it will make a difference?

399
00:41:14,493 --> 00:41:16,577
When this is over,

400
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,577
will they be looked after?

401
00:41:22,076 --> 00:41:23,868
I don't know.

402
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:36,410
You don't know.

403
00:41:55,076 --> 00:42:00,159
So the power level jumped
from 200 to 400 megawatts?

404
00:42:00,243 --> 00:42:02,076
Yes.

405
00:42:02,993 --> 00:42:04,743
Very fast.

406
00:42:06,076 --> 00:42:09,618
Why didn't you initiate
an emergency shutdown?

407
00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:12,410
Why didn't you press
the AZ-5 button?

408
00:42:13,993 --> 00:42:15,285
We did.

409
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:18,951
I reported the increase
to Akimov,

410
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:21,118
and he pressed the button.

411
00:42:22,118 --> 00:42:25,535
Leonid, that's...
that's not possible.

412
00:42:26,993 --> 00:42:28,785
He did.

413
00:42:28,868 --> 00:42:30,827
I s-swear.

414
00:42:30,909 --> 00:42:33,034
I saw him do it.

415
00:42:36,618 --> 00:42:38,868
And that's when it exploded.

416
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,118
What?

417
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:58,159
Um...

418
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,368
- Which room is Akimov?
- Twenty-seven.

419
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:21,076
I pressed it...
before the explosion.

420
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:22,868
Before.

421
00:43:24,993 --> 00:43:27,618
But why?

422
00:43:27,702 --> 00:43:29,743
Why would that happen?

423
00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:34,660
I shut it down.
I pressed AZ-5.

424
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,410
Thank you, Comrade Akimov.

425
00:43:47,243 --> 00:43:49,285
I did everything right.

426
00:43:50,743 --> 00:43:52,868
I did everything right.

427
00:44:23,909 --> 00:44:25,451
Get out.

428
00:44:25,535 --> 00:44:27,076
Get out. Get out of here.

429
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:29,493
Let me go! Let me go!

430
00:44:29,577 --> 00:44:32,118
Stop it! Stop it!

431
00:44:34,743 --> 00:44:37,368
You let her in that room?
Inside the plastic, touching him?

432
00:44:37,451 --> 00:44:39,993
- Did you know she's pregnant?
- It's not true!

433
00:44:40,076 --> 00:44:43,785
- What have you done?
- What kind of place is this? Where is her protection?

434
00:44:43,868 --> 00:44:46,827
- Do you have any idea what you're dealing with?
- Of course I do.

435
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:48,368
- Please, I do not--
- No.

436
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:50,660
- People are going to hear about this.
- Wait.

437
00:44:50,743 --> 00:44:52,493
People are going to hear.
Do you understand?

438
00:44:52,577 --> 00:44:54,493
Everyone is going to hear.

439
00:44:54,577 --> 00:44:56,618
What is everyone gonna hear?

440
00:45:02,785 --> 00:45:04,660
I am with the official
Chernobyl Commission,

441
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,868
and I've been authorized
by Valery Legasov.

442
00:45:06,951 --> 00:45:10,201
- You can check this. My name is Ulana--
- We know who you are.

443
00:45:13,618 --> 00:45:16,535
What is everyone gonna hear?

444
00:45:36,493 --> 00:45:38,451
Shcherbina;
You have your notes?

445
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:40,118
Yes.

446
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:44,076
Khomyuk was arrested last night.

447
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,868
What? Why?

448
00:45:46,951 --> 00:45:48,410
I don't know.

449
00:45:49,577 --> 00:45:52,909
- Was it--?
- Of course it was.

450
00:45:54,326 --> 00:45:55,451
I'm working on it.

451
00:45:55,535 --> 00:45:58,368
- Boris--
- I'm working on it.

452
00:45:59,618 --> 00:46:01,743
What more do you want from me?

453
00:46:01,827 --> 00:46:03,326
Fix your tie.

454
00:46:09,827 --> 00:46:11,243
They'll see you now.

455
00:46:21,326 --> 00:46:24,909
After thousands of sorties,
our brave helicopter crews

456
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:26,410
successfully
extinguished the fire.

457
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:29,118
The miners are working
heroically to ensure

458
00:46:29,201 --> 00:46:31,326
that the fuel does not
reach the groundwater.

459
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,577
And furthermore,
there is no longer

460
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,201
a threat of
additional explosion.

461
00:46:35,285 --> 00:46:40,118
The Soviet people have faced the
challenge and risen to the task,

462
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:42,785
and they and everyone in this
room are to be commended.

463
00:46:47,993 --> 00:46:50,618
Lastly, Professor Legasov
and I have been vigilant

464
00:46:50,702 --> 00:46:53,076
to protect the security
interests of the State.

465
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:55,743
And since the unfortunate
release of information

466
00:46:55,827 --> 00:46:57,118
directly following the accident,

467
00:46:57,201 --> 00:47:00,159
we believe that there
has been no further lapse.

468
00:47:00,243 --> 00:47:02,660
Comrade Charkov,

469
00:47:02,743 --> 00:47:06,702
we hope we have lived up to the
highest standards of the KGB.

470
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:07,827
You have.

471
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,577
Thank you.

472
00:47:10,743 --> 00:47:14,118
Professor Legasov
will now speak about

473
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:15,660
the work that remains.

474
00:47:17,785 --> 00:47:19,451
Thank you.

475
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:25,827
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina
has given you the good news,

476
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,827
and it is good.

477
00:47:27,909 --> 00:47:30,451
The immediate danger is over.

478
00:47:30,535 --> 00:47:33,660
Now, I'm afraid,
a long war must begin.

479
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:37,535
There is an enormous amount
of radioactive debris

480
00:47:37,618 --> 00:47:39,743
and contamination
spread out across a zone

481
00:47:39,827 --> 00:47:42,285
of approximately
2600 square kilometers.

482
00:47:42,368 --> 00:47:47,743
This entire region must be
completely evacuated.

483
00:47:47,827 --> 00:47:51,951
We must go to every town,
every village to ensure this.

484
00:47:52,034 --> 00:47:57,868
And all animals still
surviving within the zone,

485
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:00,577
whether domesticated or wild,

486
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:04,909
must be presumed contaminated
and will have to be destroyed

487
00:48:04,993 --> 00:48:08,368
to prevent the spread
of radiation and disease.

488
00:48:08,451 --> 00:48:11,868
In the immediate area
surrounding Chernobyl,

489
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:17,410
uh, every rock, every tree,
the very ground itself,

490
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:21,368
has absorbed a dangerous
amount of radionuclides,

491
00:48:21,451 --> 00:48:24,451
which will be carried by the wind
and the rain if left exposed.

492
00:48:24,535 --> 00:48:26,868
So we will have to raze
entire forests.

493
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:29,034
We will have to rip up
the top layer of earth

494
00:48:29,118 --> 00:48:30,410
and bury it under itself,

495
00:48:30,493 --> 00:48:34,034
approximately,
100 square kilometers.

496
00:48:35,743 --> 00:48:39,076
Um, and finally,
we will need to construct

497
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:44,118
a containment structure
around the power plant itself,

498
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:47,743
which will, of course,
still be extremely...

499
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,326
There will be deaths.

500
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,451
What amount of time,

501
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:59,159
and how many men do you require?

502
00:48:59,243 --> 00:49:02,993
We expect this liquidation
effort to take three years

503
00:49:03,076 --> 00:49:05,410
and approximately 750,000 men,

504
00:49:05,493 --> 00:49:10,868
including a number of doctors
and structural engineers.

505
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:13,410
How many deaths?

506
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:15,451
Thousands.

507
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,076
Perhaps tens of thousands.

508
00:49:25,493 --> 00:49:27,201
Begin at once.

509
00:49:32,618 --> 00:49:35,201
- Comrade Charkov.
- Valery!

510
00:49:36,868 --> 00:49:38,201
Yes, Professor?

511
00:49:39,243 --> 00:49:42,118
My associate was
arrested last night.

512
00:49:42,201 --> 00:49:43,535
Oh?

513
00:49:44,535 --> 00:49:47,743
I mean no disrespect, but I was
wondering if you could tell me why.

514
00:49:47,827 --> 00:49:50,118
I assure you, I don't know
who you're talking about.

515
00:49:50,201 --> 00:49:52,993
She was arrested by the KGB.

516
00:49:53,076 --> 00:49:56,118
You are the first deputy
chairman of the KGB.

517
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,660
I am.

518
00:49:57,743 --> 00:50:00,660
That's why I don't have to bother
with arresting people anymore.

519
00:50:00,743 --> 00:50:03,159
But you are bothering
with having us followed.

520
00:50:04,493 --> 00:50:06,951
I think the deputy
chairman is busy.

521
00:50:07,034 --> 00:50:09,159
No, no. It's perfectly
understandable.

522
00:50:09,243 --> 00:50:13,159
Comrade, I know you've heard
the stories about us.

523
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:15,577
When I hear them,
even I am shocked.

524
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,577
But we are not what people say.

525
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,410
Yes, people are following you.

526
00:50:20,493 --> 00:50:22,909
People are following
those people.

527
00:50:22,993 --> 00:50:24,243
You see them?

528
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,368
They follow me.

529
00:50:28,451 --> 00:50:32,535
The KGB is a circle
of accountability.

530
00:50:32,618 --> 00:50:33,827
Nothing more.

531
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:36,326
You know the work
we're doing here.

532
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:40,451
- You really don't trust us?
- Of course I do.

533
00:50:40,535 --> 00:50:43,743
But you know the old Russian proverb:

534
00:50:43,827 --> 00:50:45,868
"Trust but verify."

535
00:50:47,785 --> 00:50:51,368
And the Americans think that
Ronald Reagan thought that up.

536
00:50:51,451 --> 00:50:52,785
Can you imagine?

537
00:50:53,909 --> 00:50:56,368
It was very nice
speaking with you.

538
00:50:56,451 --> 00:50:58,034
I need her.

539
00:51:00,618 --> 00:51:03,201
So you will be
accountable for her?

540
00:51:07,785 --> 00:51:09,326
Then it's done.

541
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:13,201
- Her name is--
- I know who she is.

542
00:51:13,285 --> 00:51:15,118
Good day, Professor.

543
00:51:24,827 --> 00:51:28,410
No, that went surprisingly well.

544
00:51:28,493 --> 00:51:30,660
You came off like a naive idiot.

545
00:51:32,034 --> 00:51:34,827
And naive idiots
are not a threat.

546
00:51:50,326 --> 00:51:52,993
I'll come back when
the paperwork is complete.

547
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,577
- Are you all right?
- They didn't hurt me.

548
00:52:05,368 --> 00:52:07,868
They let a pregnant woman
into a room with a...

549
00:52:07,951 --> 00:52:11,118
It doesn't matter.

550
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:13,868
They were stupid.
I was stupid.

551
00:52:15,285 --> 00:52:17,285
Dyatlov won't talk to me.

552
00:52:18,493 --> 00:52:22,076
Akimov, yes,
Toptunov, yes, but...

553
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:24,785
Valery,

554
00:52:24,868 --> 00:52:26,368
Akimov...

555
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,285
his face was gone.

556
00:52:32,034 --> 00:52:33,702
You want to stop?

557
00:52:35,577 --> 00:52:38,034
Is that a choice I even have?

558
00:52:45,868 --> 00:52:49,660
Do you think the fuel will actually
melt through the concrete pad?

559
00:52:49,743 --> 00:52:53,243
I don't know.
A 40% chance maybe.

560
00:52:55,743 --> 00:52:58,535
I said 50.

561
00:52:58,618 --> 00:53:00,909
Either way, the numbers
mean the same thing:

562
00:53:00,993 --> 00:53:03,034
"Maybe."

563
00:53:04,909 --> 00:53:08,201
Maybe the core will melt
through to the groundwater.

564
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,660
Maybe the miners who I've told
to dig under the reactor

565
00:53:10,743 --> 00:53:13,159
will save millions of lives.

566
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:16,909
Maybe I'm killing them
for nothing.

567
00:53:20,743 --> 00:53:22,785
I don't want to do this anymore.

568
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,827
I want to stop.

569
00:53:27,535 --> 00:53:29,034
But I can't.

570
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:33,285
I don't think you have
a choice any more than I do.

571
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:38,034
I think, despite the stupidity,

572
00:53:38,118 --> 00:53:40,868
the lies, even this...

573
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,034
you are compelled.

574
00:53:43,118 --> 00:53:45,535
The problem has been assigned,
and you will stop at nothing

575
00:53:45,618 --> 00:53:47,034
until you find an answer.

576
00:53:47,118 --> 00:53:50,285
Because that is who you are.

577
00:53:52,118 --> 00:53:53,993
A lunatic, then.

578
00:53:55,827 --> 00:53:58,076
A scientist.

579
00:54:19,034 --> 00:54:21,993
Did you know that they were
running a safety test?

580
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:25,993
- Yeah.
- There's something else.

581
00:54:27,326 --> 00:54:30,493
Akimov says
they shut the reactor down,

582
00:54:30,577 --> 00:54:32,909
and Toptunov confirms it.

583
00:54:32,993 --> 00:54:36,827
- They pressed AZ-5.
- Apparently not soon enough.

584
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:38,451
No.

585
00:54:38,535 --> 00:54:43,159
They say Akimov pressed AZ-5,

586
00:54:43,243 --> 00:54:45,868
and then the reactor exploded.

587
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:50,201
If it had been just one of them,
I would have put it under

588
00:54:50,285 --> 00:54:52,535
faulty memory or delusion even,

589
00:54:52,618 --> 00:54:56,410
but they both agreed.
They were adamant.

590
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:02,410
Comrade?

591
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:08,118
- Do you think it's possible?
- I think it makes no sense.

592
00:55:08,201 --> 00:55:11,660
I think it's what I would say if I
was trying to cover my own mistakes.

593
00:55:11,743 --> 00:55:13,368
But?

594
00:55:14,493 --> 00:55:16,201
I believed them.

595
00:55:18,326 --> 00:55:19,785
Then you should pursue it.

596
00:55:19,868 --> 00:55:23,868
We have to pursue
every possibility,

597
00:55:23,951 --> 00:55:26,535
no matter how unlikely,

598
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:29,577
no matter what
or who's to blame.

599
00:55:31,076 --> 00:55:35,410
I'll go back to the hospital and
reinterview Akimov and Toptunov.

600
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:39,660
If they're still awake.

601
00:55:41,034 --> 00:55:42,618
They're not.

602
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:45,827
Khomyuk.

603
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,410
To hell with our lives.

604
01:03:12,076 --> 01:03:14,034
Someone has to start
telling the truth.

605
01:03:15,076 --> 01:03:16,535
You think the right question

606
01:03:16,618 --> 01:03:17,702
will get you the truth?

607
01:03:18,577 --> 01:03:19,951
I know they're listening.

608
01:03:20,535 --> 01:03:22,076
There is no truth.

608
01:03:23,305 --> 01:04:23,769

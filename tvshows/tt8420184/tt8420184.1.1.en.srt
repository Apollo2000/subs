if you guys remember in 1984

by the time I leave.</i>

- [man] Here they are.
- [Jordan] This is what you're looking for.

<i>Well, we are five-time champions,

It's very hard for something like that

I was a little more eccentric for them.

[Reinsdorf] After the fifth championship,
which was '96-'97,

76
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:32,123
we were looking at this team
and we realized, other than Michael,

77
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:36,878
the rest of the guys were probably
at the end of their high-productive years.

78
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,257
We had to decide
whether we keep the team together or not,

79
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,677
and we realized
maybe this was the time to do a rebuild

80
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,387

the Bulls have won five championships.

104
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,266
There's drama that summer

105
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,602
as to whether they're gonna come back,
although I think most of us

106
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,606
who are from Chicago and call Chicago home
knew somehow they'd be back.

107
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,944
Jerry Reinsdorf, the majority owner...

108
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,239
would have to leave town
if they didn't come back.

109
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,951
You can't argue with championship
after championship after championship.

110
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,037
They were still the best team in the NBA.

111
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,500
You have Scottie Pippen,
an incredibly talented athlete,

112
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,960
very skilled scorer.

113
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,172
His mental sharpness
and his court awareness

114
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,592
and his basketball savvy made him
the greatest number-two player ever.

115
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,972
Dennis Rodman was the defensive presence,
the rebounder,

116
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,309
someone who, on a team with big egos,
didn't need the ball.

117
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,270
And he never ran out of energy,
that was the thing.

118
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,897
Whoo!

119
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,818
[Wilbon] At that point, Michael Jordan's
already the ultimate sports alpha male.

120
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:10,114
I mean, the only comparisons
that I can recall being apt

121
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,326
were to Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali.

122
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,662
That's it. That's the list.
There's nobody else on it.

123
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,664
[reporter] Michael, obviously,

124
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,626
in the wake of this
incredible celebration,

125
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,504
there'll be some
very difficult business decisions.

126
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,133
We are entitled to defend what we have
until we lose it.

127
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,762
If we lose it, then you look at it
and say, "Okay, let's change.

128
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,556
Let's just go through a rebuilding."

129
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,311
No one's guaranteeing rebuilding's
gonna be two or three, four, five years.

130
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,231
Cubs have been rebuilding for 42 years.

[people laughing]

132
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,029
If you wanna look at this
from a business thing,

133
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,408
have a sense of respect for the people
who have laid the groundworks

00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,036

general manager of the Bulls,

149
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,853
and he was certainly at the root of

150
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,231
what made the tension
of that season so severe.

151
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,738
[Reinsdorf] Jerry Krause was a scout
for the White Sox.

152
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,491
He was there
when I bought the White Sox in 1981.

153
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,827
And after I bought the Bulls,
he came to see me.

154
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,372
<i>Said he'd like to be
general manager of the Bulls.</i>

155
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,791
If everybody's ready, we can get started.

156
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,394
[Reinsdorf] <i>I asked around the league,</i>

157
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,003
<i>and everybody I talked to said,
"Don't touch the guy."</i>

158
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,422
Yeah, he had a way of alienating people.

159
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,760
But I wasn't hiring somebody
to win a personality contest.

160
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,097
I wanted somebody who
truly believed in building a team

161
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,432
the way I wanted to,
and Krause was the guy.

162
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,895
[Vancil] To his credit, he did his job.

163
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:29,979
But...

164
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,066
Jerry had the "little man" problem.

165
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,944
He grew up a little fat kid.

166
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,488
Not a lot of money.
He was always the underdog,

167
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:42,076
and he just couldn't control
that part of him that needed...

168
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,911
credit.

169
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,787
[man] Michael!

170
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,258
[Smith] All the attention
is going to Michael

171
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,627
and Scottie and Dennis and Phil.

172
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,797
And Krause was growing resentful
about this.

173
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,718
[Vancil] He was good,
but he wasn't good enough

174
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,428
to do it without Michael Jordan.

175
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,847
You could argue that Michael Jordan
was as good at his job

176
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,808
as anyone has ever been at their job,
ever, in anything.

177
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,185
And Krause wants to make the point,

178
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,063
organizations win championships,
not players.

179
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:16,527
Jerry Krause, Bulls general manager, says,
"Organizations win titles, not players."

180
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,780
Funny thing, I've never seen him post up
and hit a short jump shot.

181
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,491
[reporter] This quote
that was attributed to you...

182
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,660
Well, as you know, David,
it was a misquote.

183
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,914
What I said was that players and coaches
alone don't win championships,

184
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,040
that organizations do.

185
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,169
I do sincerely believe that organizations,
as a whole, win.

186
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,254
One part of it can't win alone.

187
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,465
The guy left the word "alone"
out of there.

188
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,359
- [scoffs]
- [reporter] Right.

189
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,469
He admitted it later on.
"Yeah, I left a word out."

190
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,305
You dumb son of a bitch,
that's what killed the quote.

191
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,768
It sounded like he was making
a very specific point

192
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,519
to a very specific person.

193
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,190
We know that the team is much bigger
than the 15 players.

194
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,486
Those guys who work in the front office,
they were good people,

195
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,949
but the most important part
of the process is the players.

196
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:09,205
So, for him to say that is offensive
to the way that I approach the game.

197
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:14,960
[Wilbon] <i>Krause was picked on an awful lot
during this by Michael and Scottie.</i>

198
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,297
I mean, they made fun of him.
They mocked him. They mocked him openly.

199
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,008
So those are the pills you take
to keep you short.

200
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,511
Or are those diet pills?

201
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,599
Was Jerry Krause a bad guy? No.

202
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,976
He was a good guy. He was fun.

203
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,064
If you saw him interact with your kids,
and saw him, you knew he was a good man.

204
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:40,194
Jerry Krause was one of the nicest,
kindest, sweetest men I've ever known.

205
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:45,407
But sometimes, he would love people
who really didn't love him back,

206
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,909
and it would disappoint him.

207
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,661
[reporter] Did he love Phil?

208
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,205
Well, he loved Phil in the beginning,

209
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:55,459
but then, you know, they developed
a tension between the two of 'em.

210
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,543
Phil,

211
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,171
from a contract standpoint,

212
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,048
wanted to be compensated,

213
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:06,554
like the other coaches that he had beaten,
and Jerry wasn't going to do that.

214
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,431
In Jerry's mind,
you moved pieces in and out.

215
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,141
You didn't move Michael Jordan pieces.

216
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:15,229
Phil Jackson? You can move him in and out.
And he was wrong about that.

217
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,191
[Jordan] I said from day one,

218
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,361
if Phil's not coaching,
I'm not gonna be a part of rebuilding.

219
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:26,156
Phil should be the head coach,
and I shouldn't be put in a position

220
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,369
to have to make a choice to play
for another coach other than Phil Jackson.

221
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,705
Sadly as it may be, I have choices.

222
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,625
You know, and I will not choose to play
for another coach.

223
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:42,256
I think Jerry was looking forward
to having a clean slate

224
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,592
and going out and, you know, rebuilding.

225
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:49,054
His relationship with me
had become such a circus.

226
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,182
There was no chance for reconciliation.

227
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,437
All of a sudden, there's this guy from
Iowa State, Tim Floyd, the head coach.

228
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,857
He goes fishing with Jerry Krause,
and I'm like, "What?"

229
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,528
So, Krause clearly
is grooming the next guy.

230
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,240
He's gonna be the next Phil Jackson.

231
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,493
Krause's stepdaughter
gets married that summer.

232
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:16,373
He invites everybody from the team
and Tim Floyd...

233
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,794
and he doesn't invite Phil Jackson,
the head coach.

234
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,590
I recall that, and I think
that was bad form on Jerry's part.

235
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,342
I'm not sure it bothered Phil that much.

236
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,553
If somebody doesn't invite me
to a wedding, I'd like to thank 'em.

237
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,637
[chuckles]

238
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,891
It was sad that there was
such an acrimonious relationship

239
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,353
because Jerry Krause started
Phil Jackson's NBA coaching career.

240
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:42,024
Jerry Krause brought him to Chicago
as an assistant coach.

241
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,694
If that hadn't happened, you never
would have heard of Phil Jackson.

242
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,157
[Jackson] You know,
things evolve, people evolve.

243
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,035
They don't stay stagnant
and static in any position.

244
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,705
And more than anything else,
coaches' salaries went like this

245
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,500
and general managers' salaries
might have gone like this.

246
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,710
[Vecsey] Do you think
Jerry Krause resents that?

247
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,338
I'm not gonna speculate on that.

248
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,218
I have tremendous regard for Phil,
personally and professionally.

249
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,512
I really like Phil Jackson,

250
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,515
and I wanted Phil Jackson to come back
and coach the team.

251
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,769
And I just thought that the presence
of Jerry was counterproductive.

252
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,147
I just thought if Phil and I
would sit down and talk, we'd work it out.

253
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,524
And I flew out to Montana.

254
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,943
I offered him the opportunity
to come back.

255
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,778
After weeks of public debate,

256
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,782
many would argue that Bulls owner
Jerry Reinsdorf has come to his senses,

257
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:36,245
signing Phil Jackson to a one-year deal
to return as coach next season.

258
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,999
Phil is the coach, Jerry's the owner.
Those two needed to talk.

259
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,043
And we got it done,
and we're very happy to have it done.

260
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,713
This will be Phil's last year
as the coach of the Bulls.

261
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,590
At the conclusion of the year,
we'll look towards the future.

262
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,761
Jerry called me to his office and said,
"This is going to be your last year.

263
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,223
I don't care if you win 82 games in a row,
this will be your last year here."

264
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,101
So, I said, "Fine,"
and I walked out of the room.

265
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,062
And that was the only words
that were exchanged.

00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,149
[host] Michael Jordan!

297
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,611
Michael Jordan!

298
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,616
[Costas in English] <i>You couldn't make
a shortlist</i>

299
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,538
<i>of the most consequential
and successful teams in American sports,</i>

300
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,583
<i>and leave Michael Jordan
and the '90s Bulls out.</i>

301
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,628
But the Bulls who immediately preceded
the Michael Jordan era

302
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,381
could be characterized as mediocre.

303
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,475
Hi, I'm Bob Costas.
Join me and Johnny Kerr

304
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:51,231
for exciting Chicago Bulls basketball
action here on WGN Television, channel 9.

305
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:56,528
We weren't very good, uh,
during the time leading up to Michael.

306
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,991
The team was, you know,
on a downward keel, if you will.

307
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,035
[commentator] <i>They've obviously got
some problems.</i>

308
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,913
<i>The ball club has not been winning.</i>

309
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,876
Back then, in Chicago,
everyone was a Bears fan.

310
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:16,006
Northsiders were Cubs fans.
Southsiders were Sox fans.

311
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,259
Blackhawks had fans scattered throughout,

312
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,012
but there was no buzz about the Bulls.

313
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,074
[Reinsdorf] The Bulls were being outdrawn
at the Chicago Stadium

314
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,310
by an indoor soccer team,
the Chicago Sting.

315
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,396
Basically, the state of the team was...

316
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,233
It was Rodney Dangerfield,
it didn't get no respect.

317
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,818
The Bulls were in need
of a lot of reinforcements

318
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,502
if they were gonna be a contending team.

319
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:45,244
And here comes a young Michael Jordan,
brimming with charismatic talent.

320
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,764
[Falk] When he was in high school,

321
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,832
Michael was one of the top recruited
high school players in America.

322
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,627
He decided to play at Chapel Hill

323
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,963
for one of the great coaches
of all time, Dean Smith.

324
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,760
At the University of North Carolina,
Coach Smith ran a very tight ship.

325
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,431
[Peterson] He was a disciplinarian.
A tremendous teacher.

326
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,308
Michael had a ton of respect for him

327
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,519
and he knew he had
the best interest for Michael.

328
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,105
I think Mr. Jordan's vision and my vision,

329
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,942
who is going to help him continue to grow
as a young adult,

330
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,153
not just basketball, but his education.

331
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,781
Because for me, then,
the first priority was education.

332
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,369
- [indistinct chatter]
- [whistle blows]

333
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,333
Penetrate. Look at the basket. That's it.

334
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,878
Michael's parents
did a tremendous job with him.

335
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,798
He was a fine young man.

336
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,217
A very conscientious student,
a very good student.

337
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,888
[interviewer] This is your mom
reading aloud a letter home from you.

338
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:54,313
"Dear Mom. How has life been treating you?
Fine, I hope. I am doing just fine.

339
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,940
[over tablet] <i>I am sending you
my account number</i>

340
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,569
<i>so that you can deposit some money
in my account.</i>

341
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,654
<i>I have only $20 left.</i>

342
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,450
<i>Tell everyone I said hello and smile.</i>

343
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,952
<i>God and I love you.
Love, Michael.</i>

344
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:13,915
P.S. Sorry about the phone bill.
Please also send me some stamps."

345
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,293
[laughing]

346
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,839
Is that not a college student?
"Please send me some stamps."

347
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,761
[Smith] <i>He was very inconsistent
as a freshman,</i>

348
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,348
<i>but he's one of the most competitive ones
we've ever had in our drills.</i>

349
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,851
<i>He wanted to get better,
and then he had the ability to get better.</i>

350
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:38,523
[Williams] Michael Jordan told me he wants
to be the best player to ever play here.

351
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,985
I said, "You gotta work harder
than you did in high school."

352
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,197
He said, "I worked as hard as everybody."
I said, "Excuse me.

353
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,075
I thought you wanted to be
the best player to ever play here."

354
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,578
He said, "I'm gonna show you.
Nobody will ever work as hard as I work."

355
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,877
After about two and a half hours
of hard practice,

356
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,838
I'm walking off the floor,
drenched sweat, tired,

357
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,591
and here comes Michael,
pushing me back on the floor,

358
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:08,220
wanting to play a little one-on-one,
wanting to see where his game was.

359
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,722
I was better than he was

360
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,058
for about two weeks.

361
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,268
[commentator] <i>Watch out!</i>

362
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,315
[Worthy] <i>He wanted to learn,
he wanted to grow quickly.</i>

363
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,067
[commentator] <i>He's on a tear right now...</i>

364
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,920
[Worthy] <i>From month to month,
from game to game,</i>

365
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,821
<i>he was soaking up information.</i>

366
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:31,910
<i>Once he got something and added it
to the raw talent that he already had,</i>

367
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,079
<i>it was really explosive to see.</i>

368
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,878
<i>And by the time we got to
the national championship game,</i>

369
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,839
<i>he was a great player.</i>

370
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,760
[commentator] <i>Forty-fourth NCAA
Division One</i>

371
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,470
<i>Men's Basketball Championship.</i>

372
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,974
<i>The largest crowd ever
for a basketball game,</i>

373
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,143
<i>an electric atmosphere.</i>

374
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,938
[Jordan] We were getting out there
in front of 60-some thousand people.

375
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:04,025
I was young, but I had no time
to be nervous.

376
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,488
[Ewing] You had two great teams going
against each other, who were well coached.

377
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,241
Both teams were equally matched.

378
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:18,957
Michael had some big key buckets
and had some big shots.

379
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,334
[commentator] <i>Jordan on the... Oh!
What a lay-up!</i>

380
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,337
<i>He put that ball up about 12 feet!</i>

381
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,257
It was about as tightly contested a game

382
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,259
as you could ever want to see.

383
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,304
And then, for the ending
to be the way that it was,

384
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,223
was rather amazing, as well.

385
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,311
[commentator] <i>Thirty-two seconds to go.
A one-point lead for Georgetown.</i>

386
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,230
<i>Dean Smith has said that's timeout.</i>

387
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,734
[Worthy] Coach Smith called that timeout.
We're down one.

388
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,696
This was where Coach Smith
was extremely cool.

389
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,575
[Jordan] He was drawing up
a play for James.

390
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:57,621
And he says that, "When you get the ball,
swing it back, swing it around.

391
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,122
Michael should have a shot."

392
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,268
He looked at me and said,
"If you get the shot, take the shot."

393
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,960
He gave me the green light.

394
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:08,673
[commentator] <i>Thirty-two seconds to go.
A one-point lead for Georgetown.</i>

395
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,384
<i>They stay in the one-three-one,
with Ewing in the middle.</i>

396
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,011
<i>They've gotta look to get it in there.</i>

397
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,198
[Worthy] They knew they'd be
focusing on the internal.

398
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,599
That's where the defense was collapsing.

399
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:21,811
Our offense shifted to one side.
The whole defense went that way.

400
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,855
And Michael was on the left side,

401
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,025
- the ball was reversed...
- And Michael's wide open.

402
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,945
[Jordan] I caught it in total rhythm.

403
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,198
They had no clue
that I was gonna take that shot.

404
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,242
[commentator] <i>...shot. Jordan!</i>

405
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,079
<i>Three! It's over! It's over!</i>

<i>North Carolina has won
the 1982 NCAA Championship.</i>

407
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,510
[reporter] And the man who hit
the crucial shot down the stretch

408
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,805
for North Carolina, Michael Jordan.
Those points proved to be the game winner.

409
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,516
Michael, how did it feel
when the ball dropped through the net?

410
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,562
It felt really good, that I did something
to help out the whole team

411
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:08,358
and maybe win the game, and I just felt
very excited at the time.

412
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,112
That turned my name from Mike
to Michael Jordan.

413
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,906
It gave me the confidence that I needed

414
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,367
to start to excel
at the game of basketball.

415
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,952
[crowd cheering]

416
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,335
I'm just a freshman on the block,
and I enjoyed my freshman year.

417
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,920
[cheering continues]

418
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,303
And I hope in the next three years
that I'm here

419
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,597
that we can win
at least two or three more.

420
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,768
What Michael really did
was improve considerably

421
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,521
between his freshman and sophomore year.

422
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,541

<i>North Carolina turns it over.</i>

425
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,155
<i>I think he hit his head on the backboard.</i>

426
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:58,199
<i>I heard a little bang. And that's how high
that young man got up,</i>

427
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,784
<i>he hit the back of his head...</i>

428
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:04,039
I can't pick one moment. When I think of
Michael Jordan, yes, I think of the shot,

429
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,375
but I think of three years
of watching that youngster

430
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,628
get better and better and better.

431
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:13,173
Michael Jordan's the only player
that could ever turn it on and off,

432
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,550
and he never frickin' turned it off.

433
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:20,096
[commentator] <i>Jordan...
Look at that! Holy cow!</i>

What's up?

436
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,024
<i>What's up?</i>

437
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,570
<i>...but Coach Smith
recommended I go pro.</i>

438
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,032
[Peterson] He was very comfortable
in Chapel Hill.

439
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,202
But at the same time, he was hearing,

440
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,829
"You could be one of the top three
or four picks."

441
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,624
So, it was weighing heavy on him.

442
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,923
Well, to tell you the truth,
I really just decided,

443
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,801
uh, I guess, an hour and a half ago.

444
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,512
I didn't know, I was, you know, 50-50,

445
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,765
and I talked to Coach
this morning and, you know,

446
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,767
he helped me and my parents helped me,

447
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:11,773
and I felt that would be better for me
to start now, while I'm young.

448
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:21,408
[announcer] <i>The USA Network presents
the 1984 NBA college draft.</i>

449
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,994
<i>We are just about ready to go,
as we go to the podium</i>

450

of the NBA David Stern.</i>

451
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,543
The Houston Rockets select

452
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:36,131
Hakeem Olajuwon
of the University of Houston.

453
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,340
[crowd cheering]

454
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:42,512
Olajuwon would have been first
by anybody who picked, including me.

455
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,224
<i>- </i>Portland had Clyde Drexler...
- [commentator]<i> Clyde the Glide!</i>

456
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,727
...who played the same position
as Michael.

457
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,314
So, Portland's feeling was that
they needed a center.

458
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,210
[announcer] <i>Now, the second choice,
owned by the Portland Trail Blazers.</i>

<i>Let's go to the commissioner, David Stern.</i>

460
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:02,824
Portland selects Sam Bowie,
University of Kentucky.

461
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,079
So, I knew that, you know,
Jordan would be there for us.

462
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,249
[announcer] <i>Michael Jordan seems to be
the next one up.</i>

463
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,543
The Chicago Bulls

464
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:19,007
pick Michael Jordan
of the University of North Carolina.

465
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,093
[announcer] <i>The Chicago Bulls,
having the third pick in the draft,</i>

466
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,972
<i>and went with the sensational
Michael Jordan of North Carolina.</i>

467
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:30,185
<i>Jordan, who led North Carolina,
now looking to step in to lead the Bulls.</i>

468
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,395
[reporter] You've got a great opportunity
to step in

469
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,522
and win a city
that is crying for a winner.

470
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,983
Perhaps you can turn
that Bulls thing around.

471
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:40,528
Hopefully, I can go in and contribute
and maybe turn it around.

472
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,864
I'm looking forward to that.

473
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:51,706
The reality is we were lucky the draft
was before the Olympics.

474
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,962
Michael became the most popular
amateur basketball player in the world

475
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,422
because of the Olympics.

476
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,175
[commentator 1] <i>Jordan gets it,
puts it in the hole.</i>

477
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,802
[commentator 2] <i>Jordan...</i>

478
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,594
[commentator 3] <i>Jordan...</i>

479
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,990
[Knight] He's the best athlete,
one of the best competitors.

480
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,599
He's one of the most skilled players

481
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,812
and that makes him the best basketball
player that I've ever seen play.

482
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,858
[announcer] <i>US has its ninth gold medal,</i>

483
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:23,196
<i>but it's been an all-USA show
in this tournament.</i>

484
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,956
[Jordan] I came from a program in college.

485
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,459
It was about team game.
You know, it was a clean program.

486
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,838
It prepared me to go
into the Chicago situation,

487
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,422
which was totally different.

488
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:48,471
[man] <i>Before Michael Jordan got to the
Bulls in 1984, drugs were prevalent.</i>

489
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,724
<i>Cocaine and recreational drugs
of all types.</i>

490
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,893
<i>So, they had a lot of partiers.</i>

491
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,771
[interviewer] One of the articles I read,
they called it

492
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,773
"The Bulls' traveling cocaine circus."

493
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,316
[laughing]

494
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,866
I've never read that article.

495
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,788
- [interviewer] Accurate?
- Uh... Look...

496
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,292
Guys were doing things that I didn't see.

497
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,880
I had one event, preseason.
I think we were in Peoria.

498
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,424
It was in a hotel
so I'm trying to find my teammates.

499
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,467
So I start knocking on doors.

500
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,596
I get to this one door,
and I knock on the door,

501
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,348
and I can hear someone says, "Shh.

502
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,642
Someone's outside."

503
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:40,231
And then you hear this deep voice,
says, "Who is it?" I says, "MJ."

504
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,692
And then they all say,
"Oh, fuck, he's just a rookie.

505
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,069
Don't worry about it."
So they open up the door.

506
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:49,490
I walk in, and practically
the whole team was in there.

507
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:54,162
And it was like,
things I've never seen in my life,

508
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,289
you know, as a young kid.

509
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,167
You got all...
You got your lines over here.

510
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,170
You got your weed smokers over here.
You got your women over here.

511
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,175
So the first thing I said,
"Look, man, you know, I'm out,"

512
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,553
because all I can think about,
if they come and raid this place,

513
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:15,975
right about now, I am just as guilty
as everybody else that's in this room.

514
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,520
And from that point on,
I was more or less on my own.

515
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,733
[Telander] His townhouse
was just a regular place.

516
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,277
And at the start,
his mom would be there an awful lot.

517
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,238
And Jordan's buddies would come by,

518
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:33,451
players and what have you, but he was
just living like he was still in college.

519
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,413
[Jordan] <i>I enjoyed, you know,
just hanging out, playing cards,</i>

520
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,500
<i>watching movies, you know,
I wouldn't go into the clubs.</i>

521
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,045
Whatever somebody else
might've been doing off the court,

522
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:48,508
if it was partying or whatever,
that wasn't part of what he wanted to do.

523
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,843
Orange juice and 7-Up was his go-to.

524
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:56,641
I don't smoke, I don't do lines.
I didn't drink at the time.

525
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,811
I was looking just to get some rest,
get up and go play.

526
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,565
When Jordan first came to the Bulls,
he was the number-three pick

527
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,903
so a lot of people thought, "Well, he's
only 6'6". So how much can he really do?"

528
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,074
We wish he were 7'1", but he isn't.

529
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,284
Michael gotta realize he's not seven foot,

530
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,787
so he's not gonna carry a team in the NBA.

531
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,999
I really don't think that, uh,

532
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,544
in the NBA anymore, there's really not
any such thing as a one-man team.

533
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,588
And I don't think that you can
come in expecting one guy

534
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,048
to turn the whole thing around.

535
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:34,721
There was no one alive, not Coach Smith,
not Rod Thorn, who drafted him,

536
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:39,225
no one, none of the experts, thought
that he would become what he became.

537
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,437
[Jordan] When I first got to Chicago,

538
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,440
I went in considering myself
the lowest on the totem pole.

539
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,985
Whatever people had been saying about me,
I still had to earn my stripes.

540
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:54,657
[Higgins] When he arrived into the gym
on the first day of practice,

541
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,952
you can see that this guy
is the best player here.

542
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,955
This cat is different.

543
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,793
[Loughery] When we drafted Michael,
I did not know how good Michael was.

544
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,213
The strength he had,
the physical strength, was amazing.

545
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,719
[Thorn] The first day of practice,

546
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:19,557
I got a call from the assistant coach,
and he said to me,

547
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,894
"Congratulations," and I said, "For what?"

548
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:26,814
And he said,
"You did not screw this draft up.

549
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,108
This guy is really good."

550
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,780
[Jordan] From the first day in practice,
my mentality was

551
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,907
whoever is the team leader on that team,

552
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,492
I'm going after him

553
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,787
and I'm not gonna do it with my voice
because I had no voice.

554
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,914
I had no...
I had no status.

555
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,263
I have to do it with the way that I play.

556
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,001
[announcer] <i>Twenty-three, Michael Jordan!</i>

557
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,378
I felt like I earned my stripes
in the third game.

558
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,510
Milwaukee's always been
a nemesis for Chicago.

559
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,554
Every time we played 'em, they beat us.

560
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:04,310
They had Sidney Moncrief, who was
the reigning defensive player of the year,

561
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,395
and they had a tremendous defensive team.

562
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,898
I kind of thought I knew his potential

563
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:12,318
because I had played against
the best players in the NBA so far.

564
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,905
The Magics and the Birds and the Dr. J
and Kareem. There were some great players.

565
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,784
Then all of a sudden,
this rookie comes into the NBA,

566
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,912
and I watched the way he moved
on the court and his instincts,

567
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,248
I'm like, "Wow. That's going to be scary."

568
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,959
[commentator] <i>Milwaukee Bucks
have taken control here,</i>

569
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,627
<i>and they have a nine-point lead.</i>

570
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,255
[Jordan] We were losing,
going into the fourth quarter.

571
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:36,300
Before, guys would get down on themselves
and then they just kind of give up.

572
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,595
"Okay, we just chalk this up.
We look for the next game."

573
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,722
I'm saying, "The game's not over with."

574
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,809
And Kevin Loughery sensed that in me,

575
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,812
and he just started feeding me the ball,
and I just started going.

576
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,207
[commentator] <i>Jordan now has 24
and is keeping the Bulls in it.</i>

577
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,816
<i>Jordan goes for it! Gets it!</i>

578
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,527
<i>There's Jordan driving...</i>

579
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,155
<i>Whoa! Unbelievable!</i>

580
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:01,701
[Moncrief] Every time we went to trap him,
he would split, go down the lane,

581
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,327
make a really difficult shot.

582
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,246
He was so explosive.

583
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,040
I don't think there's anybody
that could defend Michael.

584
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,668
[Jordan] We come back and we win the game.

585
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,005
From that point on,
everybody on that team felt like,

586
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,215
"This young kid is not gonna let us lose."

587
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:20,219
Everybody on that Bull team,
within a two-week period,

588
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,430

[Riley] As a rookie, he was not a rookie.

596
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,998
He proved, right out of the gates,

597

there was none other like him.

When Michael first came to town,

622
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,959
I didn't have the money to buy tickets
for a Bulls game,

I was pretty broke. [chuckles]

and that everybody
was able to rally around.

When Michael came in '84,
we got an immediate shot in the arm.

633
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,163
The city was just beside herself.

634
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,541
The interest just grew,
and it grew dramatically.

635
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,294
It was just a phenomenal thing
to watch it.

636

He does some things
that I just never seen before.

639

[Telander] Scottie Pippen wasn't there.
He had an injury,

673

and you figure,
"Well, they don't need him."

Dennis Rodman wasn't there either,
he was holding up.

There was never a day off.

that never saw him play before.
That's what kept him going.

[Kerr] Phil always looked for a theme
for every season,

we were going to be together,

management had already made that decision.

In typical Phil fashion, you know,

719
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,131

724
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,854
I talked to the players about,

it was for us to really be together

1
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:19,987
There was a flu epidemic.

2
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:21,522
In the early '90s.

3
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,491
Seven percent of the population
was wiped out.

4
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:24,458
That's, like,
half a billion people.

5
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:25,859
We know that your world

6
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,662
had no part in the pandemic
that decimated our cities.

7
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,232
- Okay, Claude...
- Was the topic offlimits, Fancher?

8
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:32,842
I wonder if there'll ever
come a reckoning,

9
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,568
for what they did to us.

10
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,004
You know anything about this
group Pope is working with?

11
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:39,640
- Lambert's part of it, too.
- They're fanatics.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,385
It's a black operation.
They're called Indigo.

13
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:44,245
- A network of some kind?
- School.

14
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:49,283
And are placed here,
as sleeper agents.

15
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,885
After all the work
that they did to place you here,

16
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,521
would you really risk
this mission

17
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:55,556
when we're so close
to the big day?

18
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,201
These documents were stolen
from my department?

19
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,035
Whoever is getting information
from your floor,

20
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,961
they're getting it from you.

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,196
It's Quayle.

22
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:03,931
He's the perfect spy.

23
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,473
How was your day, birthday boy?

24
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:27,087
This is your mother?

25
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:30,758
Is this her?

26
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,860
Yes.

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,396
And is this your father?

28
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,534
I'm sorry, I have to ask.

29
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,540
Do you know
how to sign your name, Clare?

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,144
Or your initials?

31
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,380
Right here.

32
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,606
Listen up, everyone.

33
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:21,809
We have a new addition
to our family today.

34
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:26,780
She's a very brave little girl,
just like every one of you.

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,650
And I'm sure you all remember
your first day here,

36
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,254
so I expect you to extend her
the same kindness

37
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:36,190
you were shown.

38
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,859
Take a seat, Clare, over there.

39
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:48,402
Now, I would like for you
to open your books to page 12.

40
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,472
Spencer.

41
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,332
Please read the first sentence
of number one.

42
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,523
How come you're not outside
with the others?

43
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,672
I want to go home.

44
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:29,142
I'm afraid that's not possible.

45
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:32,846
I miss my mom and dad.

46
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:41,655
I wish I could tell you
they're coming back.

47
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:45,659
But you're old enough now
to understand death.

48
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,661
Its finality.

49
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,102
The world is not
a nice place, Clare.

50
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,938
You should know this by now.

51
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:09,116
It's time to shed the skin
of your past.

52
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:12,320
Grow a new one.

53
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,855
Thick with anger.

54
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,860
I don't know how.

55
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,296
I watched a nature program
recently.

56
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,865
It was very sad.

57
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,334
It was about a gazelle

58
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,769
who stayed on the fringes
of his pack,

59
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:32,239
who was the first to be eaten
when the lion attacked.

60
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,477
But the gazelle in the center,
who blended in,

61
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:40,481
she lived the longest.

62
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:43,216
And we need you, Clare,

63
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:46,587
to live a good, long life.

64
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:54,428
You're it!

65
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,770
Shut that off.

66
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,076
They'll never find us back here.

67
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,582
I'm Spencer.

68
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:18,118
I like your braces.

69
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,953
Really?

70
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,922
Yeah, they're shiny and cool.

71
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,458
I don't even need braces.

72
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,460
My teeth aren't so crooked.

73
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,095
So why do you wear them?

74
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,364
Because my shadow wears them.

75
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,333
What's a shadow?

76
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,503
They haven't told you?

77
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:37,905
You're it.

78
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,474
Come on, Clare.

79
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,943
On the other side of the door,

80
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,312
I can be a different me.

81
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:49,950
As smart and as brave,
as funny or as strong,

82
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,853
as a person could want to be.

83
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,860
Clare? Come with me, please.

84
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,448
Where are you taking me?

85
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:21,815
You'll be all right.

86
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,361
Prep the anesthesia.

87
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:36,029
No.

88
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,832
She must be kept conscious.

89
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,639
What's happening?

90
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,914
Listen to me, dear.

91
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,150
There's no easy way
to say this, but...

92
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,955
we're going to have to break
your legs, and it will hurt.

93
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,857
Badly.

94
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,601
Is it because I wrote
in that library book?

95
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,407
The hard part
will be over quickly.

96
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:23,210
I promise.

97
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,774
How do you feel?

98
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:58,646
I can't move my legs.

99
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,914
You'll need to eat something.

100
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,650
I'm not hungry.

101
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,618
It's not about
being hungry, dear.

102
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,654
I don't understand this.

103
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:09,523
I don't know
what you're doing to me.

104
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,932
Tell me what you see here.

105
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,936
Me.

106
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,641
My father.

107
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,745
I've never been skiing before.

108
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,448
How come I don't remember this?

109
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,252
Because that girl
in these photos is not you.

110
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,154
Of course it is, look at me.

111
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,836
Ten years ago, something
happened to the world.

112
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,639
And very few people
know about it.

113
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,043
It copied itself.

114
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,978
Split in two.

115
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,815
Think of it like a door
you can walk through,

116
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:10,450
and on the other side
is another world.

117
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,154
With another me, another you.

118
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,989
That's impossible.

119
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,658
I'm not stupid.

120
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,760
You said it yourself.
You've never been skiing.

121
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,162
The people on the other side
look like us,

122
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,931
act like us, sound like us,

123
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:28,068
but do not mistake any of them
for the people you love.

124
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:32,005
These people are the reason
your parents are dead.

125
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,575
They died from the flu.

126
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:40,313
They created that virus
to destroy us.

127
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,152
Now, Clare...

128
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,089
the reason
we had to break your legs

129
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:53,727
is because the other Clare
broke them, too.

130
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,896
And from this day forward,

131
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,565
it's very important
that everything you do

132
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:02,202
is very much the same
as everything she does.

133
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:05,105
Why?

134
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,574
Because someday, Clare,

135
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:10,343
I don't know when,
but someday in your future,

136
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,246
you will go to their world,

137
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,149
and you are going to hurt them

138
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,786
for everything they did
to your parents,

139
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:23,290
and for everything
they did to us.

140
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,554
I laid out your clothes
on the bed.

141
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,391
You should get in the shower.

142
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,597
Is everything okay?

143
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,100
You know how I feel
about birthdays.

144
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,501
Please.

145
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,870
You love being
center of attention.

146
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,932
Darling?

147
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:46,712
I just... mymy humidor
is completely empty.

148
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,403
- You have more in the basement.
- No.

149
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,673
Not the Montecristo No. 2s,
tthe ones your dad likes.

150
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,318
- Peter, I just put on the sauce.
- I'm sorry.

151
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,742
I just have all this work
to finish.

152
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,078
Would youwould you mind?

153
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,685
If she wakes up,
she's your problem.

154
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,821
Absolutely.

155
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,159
Thank you, darling.

156
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:15,362
Take the sauce off
in 30 minutes.

157
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,775
Maybe someone's been breaking in

158
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,234
and stealing the documents
at night.

159
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,770
Could be.

160
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,805
Could be the maids. Could be...

161
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,150
You know, it could be
the childcare.

162
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:28,451
I mean, ththethe leak
could be from...

163
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,342
there's a number of different
people who could...

164
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,345
You... CCould you be a bit
careful, please?

165
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,313
Look, we haven't got time
for this.

166
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,148
She could be back
within the hour.

167
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,951
- Bathroom in here?
- Yeah.

168
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,956
This hers?

169
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,995
Yeah, it's fish oil.
She's into that.

170
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,613
Smells like almonds.

171
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,648
Cyanide, Peter.

172
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:11,985
It's time we had a talk
about your wife.

173
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:17,590
On the 21st of August,
she lost her last baby to it.

174
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,193
Mr. and Mrs. Fancher placed
a silver heart necklace

175
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,363
under her pillow
in place of a coin.

176
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,933
Mrs. Fancher makes
Clare's lunch every morning.

177
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,735
During her lunch period,
Clare often trades

178
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,171
her potato crisp
for candy or sweets.

179
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,673
Her favorite subject
in school is art.

180
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:36,043
More specifically, watercolors.

181
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,211
Her favorite color is pink.

182
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:41,748
Villages on the
plateau were repeatedly assured

183
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,284
there was little risk
of infection

184
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,287
at their line of longitude,
but today's tragedy

185
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,924
is another sign of the Munchen
Virus' growing strength.

186
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,859
What's alarming about the spread

187
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,427
into the Balkan territories,

188
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,964
despite German
border quarantines,

189
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,432
is that every attempt
at containment

190
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,334
thus far has failed.

191
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,836
The death toll is rising
and continues to rise

192
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,406
amid fear and panic.

193
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,226
Meanwhile, the chancellor
is travelling back

194
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,310
from the Cologne Conference.

195
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,088
Her father is next
in line to run Diplomacy.

196
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,913
She's not ready.

197
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,283
We still have time.

198
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,421
If we make waste
of this opportunity,

199
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,391
it's on us, not the girl.

200
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,293
We'll do it right.

201
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,201
Can you tell me something

202
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,369
about her first week
back at school?

203
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:40,440
I ran two kilometers
in 11 minutes,

204
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,011
but then I ate too many
pretzels, so I threw up.

205
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,779
Jaco gave me his soda
because he felt bad.

206
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,349
And do you remember
Jaco's last name?

207
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:53,586
Abelo?

208
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,655
That's right.

209
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,491
Very good.

210
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,329
She doesn't do that.

211
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,312
Very nice.

212
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,915
Watch the line.

213
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,018
Your Os are dipping.

214
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:39,032
Clare.

215
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,306
What can I do for you?

216
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,341
Do you know where Spencer is?

217
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,778
Come. Sit.

218
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,165
He has been called up,

219
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:15,168
sent to the other side

220
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,737
on a journey much like the one
you will take someday.

221
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,743
When am I gonna see him again?

222
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,121
You miss him.

223
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,993
Those feelings are not yours
to have.

224
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,529
Do you understand me?

225
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,864
You're not some
stupid, little girl

226
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:48,335
who gets to make friends and
boyfriends and hopes and dreams.

227
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:54,207
You are a soldier.

228
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,042
If that makes you angry,

229
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:59,112
think of who took it from you
and focus on that.

230
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,623
Congratulations.

231
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,394
For what?

232
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,530
You're truly suffering now.

233
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,967
It's beautiful.

234
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,835
It means you are growing.

235
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:36,983
Hey, look what I got,
Terri. I found it in the yard.

236
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,552
Good night.

237
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,020
Good night.

238
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,491
Good night.

239
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,993
Can I borrow a copy
of Pride and Prejudice?

240
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,503
Does your shadow
have a brother and a sister?

241
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,605
Does your shadow have a
brother and a sister?

242
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,208
Does your shadow have a
brother and a sister?

243
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,013
Lights out, girls.

244
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,053
Where'd she go to college?

245
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:18,291
Berlin University of the Arts.

246
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,892
She studied architecture.

247
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,828
What year did she graduate?

248
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:26,233
Um... 2006, 2007?

249
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,967
Peter, come on. Focus.

250
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,436
Details matter.

251
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,207
Um...

252
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,809
all right, she, um,
she was 24 when we met.

253
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,678
My friend Toby introduced us.

254
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,813
Hhhe was in Diplomacy.

255
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,249
He used to work for her father.

256
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:45,051
He... could he be...?

257
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,053
Anything's possible.

258
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,222
I'm sorry. It's ju...

259
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:50,990
You don't know Clare.

260
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,326
She's not like, she's...

261
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,794
She wears cashmere.

262
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,396
She's...

263
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,873
She cooked poached salmon
for dinner.

264
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,375
I mean, look at this place.
Thisthis is her.

265
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,768
This whole thing. This is...

266
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,172
Okay.

267
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:09,642
If she is this...

268
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,846
spy that we've been
looking for...

269
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,906
- then she was raised on the other side...
- Yeah.

270
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,251
Inserted into this life.

271
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,820
So what happened
to my real wife?

272
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:28,160
They might have been swapped out
years before you met.

273
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,430
Howhow do I know
which one I married?

274
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,798
I guess you don't.

275
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,500
Not for now.

276
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:36,869
Does she know about your work?

277
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,547
You think I breached
my security clearance?

278
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,582
You think I've read her in?

279
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,708
You bring paperwork home.

280
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:44,311
Paperwork that every night
I put in my safe.

281
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,548
What?

282
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:53,185
The access code to my safe...

283
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,455
is the same as the password
to my mobile.

284
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,625
If she has access to the safe,
she has access to my phone.

285
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:01,694
Fuck. God.

286
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:05,164
She knows everywhere
you've been.

287
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,833
That's how they found
the butcher.

288
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,168
Yeah. Makes perfect sense
why they'd go to her.

289
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,505
I'm fucked.

290
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,974
I've had this job for years.

291
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,710
We've been compromised
the entire time because of me.

292
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,810
Listen.

293
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,414
She's burned, all right?

294
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:24,484
But she does not know
she's been burned.

295
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,185
We have the upper hand
right now, okay?

296
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,463
We can use this
to our advantage.

297
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,756
We can find out
about herher contacts,

298
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:32,091
- her network.
- Youyouyouyou want me,

299
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,427
you want me to play along
with this?

300
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:35,904
That's exactly what
we need to do, yeah.

301
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,530
Like nothing's changed.

302
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,232
Howard, I've got, I've got
guests about to come over.

303
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,403
I've got people
from the office...

304
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,905
You want me to knowingly
expose them to this?

305
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,173
She's your wife, Peter.

306
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:49,909
Just put on a smile

307
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,144
and play the game.

308
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:55,081
1996.

309
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:58,217
Can anyone tell me why this year
was most important?

310
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,853
Ethel?

311
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:03,322
How should I know?

312
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,625
I wasn't even born.

313
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,262
The Crossing

314
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:14,033
was first discovered
around 1987.

315
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,768
But for years,

316
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:19,972
our worlds were
almost identical.

317
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,575
It wasn't until 1996,

318
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:27,346
when their flu killed
millions of our people,

319
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:29,982
that everything
became different.

320
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:33,620
Now, who can tell me
some of these differences?

321
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,721
Isabel.

322
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,889
- Cigarettes.
- Good.

323
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:41,894
European countries outlawed
the sale of tobacco in 1999.

324
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,631
Their phones are better.

325
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,466
Yes, they've made
certain advancements

326
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:48,435
we've been unable to make.

327
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,470
And they still eat pork.

328
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,138
Ew.

329
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,073
That's true.

330
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:55,508
Their side didn't suffer
the virus

331
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,444
that was passed
through our swine.

332
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:00,413
In their world,
pigs still roam free.

333
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,214
Anything else?

334
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,921
Ethel, stay behind, please.

335
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:16,729
How are you?

336
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,566
Like a Little
fucking Orphan Annie.

337
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,869
I remember my first week here.

338
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,538
- I didn't think I'd make it.
- Yeah.

339
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:27,474
And look at you now.

340
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:39,686
Let me give you a survival tip.

341
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:42,889
Your attitude's gonna
drive people away.

342
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:47,159
There's this documentary
about zebras.

343
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:51,598
The ones protected by the pack
survive the migration,

344
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:55,434
but the ones who hang out alone,
they're eaten first.

345
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:57,369
Zebras?

346
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,872
What the fuck are you
talking about?

347
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,287
They're not always easy.

348
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,790
Give me some time with her.

349
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:23,229
What's wrong?

350
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:27,233
Apparently, he sprung it
on her during a vacation.

351
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,970
She's marrying him?

352
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,540
Her father put him on the
Director track in Strategy.

353
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,508
Didn't want his daughter
marrying down.

354
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:37,409
But they hardly know each other.

355
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,146
Clare, I don't think you realize
what a gift we've been handed.

356
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,682
A husband in Strategy.

357
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:45,585
We've never placed
an operative that high.

358
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:52,725
This has to happen now.

359
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,494
Once he's been promoted,
he'll be vetted and monitored.

360
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:58,230
It'll be harder
to place you then.

361
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:07,640
You are going to be the one
who changes everything.

362
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,446
There's a close friend of ours.

363
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:18,618
He handles all matters of
transition on the other side.

364
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,291
Hello, dear.

365
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:28,494
I've heard so much about you.

366
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:33,299
Mira tells me
you've been well prepared.

367
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,837
We've manufactured
an identity for you

368
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,139
under the name of Claudia Amin.

369
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,541
You will be part

370
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:45,745
of a diplomatic envoy.

371
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:47,880
Our people will get you
to the Crossing,

372
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,784
but once inside,
you'll be on your own.

373
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:55,454
Purpose of trip, Ms. Amin?

374
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,724
Embassy diplomatic support.

375
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,820
Once you've made it
to their side,

376
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,722
walk across the bridge,

377
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:07,293
follow the Spree River west
to the safe house.

378
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,865
There, you will meet
your contact.

379
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:17,336
The man who will be
your sole lifeline

380
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:19,538
during the time you're there.

381
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,841
His name is Claude Lambert.

382
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:25,778
Bit of a cad,
but you can trust him.

383
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,613
How was your journey?

384
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:30,116
When am I being inserted?

385
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,685
My dear.

386
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:35,187
Let us be clear about something.

387
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:39,692
Your friends and I,
we have a special arrangement.

388
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:42,528
But to you,
I'm just a messenger.

389
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:45,932
Understood?

390
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:48,600
Good.

391
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,502
How do I reach you?

392
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,704
If I need you.

393
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:54,106
Well, we don't need people.

394
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:56,275
We want them.

395
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,481
Here we are.

396
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:04,150
Hold onto this.

397
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,454
It needs to be replaced
every 12 months.

398
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,130
If you're found out, consider it
your means of escape.

399
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:23,169
No, just... just hear me out.

400
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:25,471
Okay, I know
the weather's not great,

401
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,740
but just grab your camera
and we'll go to the Spree.

402
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,541
We'll go on a lovely boat ride.

403
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,511
No, it's perfect; There are no
tourists this time of year.

404
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,480
Yes, we'll have a bite
afterwards.

405
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,849
Just meet me there, okay?

406
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,717
All right. See you soon.

407
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:43,375
Crap. I forgot milk.

408
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:47,479
Crap. I forgot milk.

409
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,982
Crap, I forgot milk.

410
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,626
Hi, baby.

411
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:39,031
No, I'm just getting ready
to sleep now.

412
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,435
You too, Peter.

413
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:44,770
Sweet dreams.

414
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,039
You too, Peter.

415
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,388
I ran into him
at the bank yesterday...

416
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:05,958
Well, make yourself at home.

417
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:07,169
- Joel.
- Thanks for the invitation.

418
00:32:07,193 --> 00:32:08,627
Glad you could make it.

419
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,229
Welcome.

420
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:12,598
It's been such a long time.

421
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:13,832
Mariel, Friedrich.

422
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,334
- Clare.
- Hello.

423
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,074
- Where's the birthday boy?
- Right there.

424
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:17,970
And he'll be very excited

425
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,238
- to see you.
- Thank you.

426
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:21,240
- Hey.
- Hi. Love your necklace.

427
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,074
Thank you.

428
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:23,242
It's from Croatia.

429
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:24,576
Hello, mate.

430
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:25,811
Happy birthday, mate.

431
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,046
What can I get you?

432
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:28,814
I'll just have one of these.

433
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,258
- Got your name on it.
- Thank you.

434
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,683
- Cheers.
- Daddy.

435
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,153
Give me your coat, darling.

436
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:35,787
Thank you, sweetie.

437
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,623
- Hey, darling.
- There he is.

438
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:40,692
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.

439
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,927
Another year?

440
00:32:42,028 --> 00:32:43,495
Another year closer to death.

441
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:46,732
Okay, that's,
one way to look at it.

442
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,300
Where's my grandchild?

443
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,436
We, we had to
put her down, didn't we?

444
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:53,872
No, I asked you to
keep her awake for me.

445
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,274
Daddy, it's past her bedtime.

446
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,376
I just...
Always hiding her from me.

447
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,454
You're always hiding... I'm gonna
just take a little peek.

448
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,946
- Take one little peek.
- Okay, go.

449
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:03,649
Just a little.

450
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:05,717
How many is that?

451
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:20,899
So, what are we drinking to?

452
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:25,071
To... new beginnings.

453
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:27,005
How about getting out
of this dump?

454
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:30,342
- Cheeky.
- Cheers.

455
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:36,082
I'm gonna miss this place.

456
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:39,085
- Yeah?
- Even Mrs. Kupferberg.

457
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:41,887
Have to say, I, for one,

458
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,523
will be pretty happy to never
see that cranky old bitch again.

459
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:47,393
She's a Holocaust survivor.

460
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:50,062
She's allowed to be
as cranky as she wants.

461
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:51,997
What's her first name?

462
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:53,365
Lillian.

463
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:54,465
Lilly.

464
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,402
But she prefers to be a missus.

465
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:59,205
You'll be a missus soon.

466
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:01,740
Mrs. Quayle.

467
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,041
Mrs. Quayle.

468
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:25,864
Peter, I think I'm ready.

469
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:27,266
Ready?

470
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:28,967
Yeah, I don't want to
wait anymore.

471
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,769
Are you sure?

472
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:32,438
I'm sure.

473
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:52,924
Is that... is that okay?

474
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,693
I... I think so.

475
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,062
Do you want to try
getting on top of me?

476
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:58,564
Yeah.

477
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:00,266
Okay.

478
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:09,941
Are you all right?

479
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:13,011
Yes, I promise.

480
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,547
How does it feel?

481
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,983
It feels good.

482
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:26,525
How anyone agrees to
spend their life with someone

483
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,361
they've never fucked,
I'll never know.

484
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,831
It's like buying a dress
you've never tried on.

485
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,236
What am I supposed to do?

486
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,342
Are you a virgin?

487
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:49,080
Well, that'll have to change.

488
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:52,050
If you want your replacement
to be authentic, that is.

489
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,653
One cannot have
their cherry popped twice.

490
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,424
It's a crude phrase, I know,

491
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:02,361
but it's quite illustrative.

492
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,468
I could be of service.

493
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:48,374
Whiskey.

494
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:03,422
Danke.

495
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,019
I want to be on top.

496
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,354
Okay.

497
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:56,007
Good evening, everybody.

498
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,378
I'd like to thank you all
very much indeed for coming.

499
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:01,447
I know how we all enjoy
our time spent apart,

500
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:03,349
so for you to come and pay honor

501
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:05,283
to my fastapproaching selinity...

502
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:07,886
Fucking... senility.

503
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,988
Jesus.

504
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:17,563
I'd like to thank
my wonderful wife Clare

505
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:19,398
for organizing this party.

506
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:21,232
Hear, hear!

507
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:23,502
Hear, hear!

508
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:24,836
Wine is divine, dear.

509
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,037
And so is the whiskey.

510
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,440
Speaking of alcohol...

511
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,709
- Could use some?
- Yeah.

512
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,015
Not done yet, actually.

513
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:39,017
Sorry, notnotnot quite done.

514
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,251
Almost there.

515
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:42,421
Almost.

516
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:45,323
How many birthdays
have we shared together, Clare?

517
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:49,294
Far too many.

518
00:38:49,395 --> 00:38:50,629
I remember that first one.

519
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:53,899
Food's getting cold, Peter.
Come on.

520
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:57,503
You wore that red dress.

521
00:38:57,603 --> 00:38:59,638
Your favorite one.

522
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:01,206
Your 26th.

523
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:03,008
25th, actually.

524
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,311
But it was before then,
actually,

525
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:08,146
that I knew
that Clare was the one for me.

526
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:11,349
Remember that rugby match,
darling?

527
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,151
The mighty Saracens.

528
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,553
No?

529
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:16,722
Wait, whowho were we playing
again?

530
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,493
I drank too much.

531
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:24,029
You don't remember?

532
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:26,832
But you were so into it.

533
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,037
Harlequins.

534
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:35,774
We won, 2313, right?

535
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,444
And you spilled your pint

536
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:40,211
on that very angry fan
in the row...

537
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,648
- in the row below ours.
- No, no, no, no. That was you.

538
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:45,417
I just took the blame 'cause he
was, like, four times your size.

539
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:51,222
That's the thing about my wife...

540
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,493
Always thinking on her feet.

541
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:01,366
To the one I fell in love with.

542
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:04,603
To Clare!

543
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,520
Elizabeth. Lizzy.

544
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,421
Family friend.

545
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:25,691
Works for the Bundestag.

546
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:30,496
Dating civil engineer
Gerard Andrès.

547
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,932
And... Laura.

548
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,433
Laura Fancher.

549
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:37,969
Laura. Third cousin.

550
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:39,938
Recently divorced.

551
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:41,473
No date.

552
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,477
- Wait!
- Stop following me.

553
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:47,679
Clare.
Clare, just don't do this.

554
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,816
- Get... out!
- Clare. Okay, Clare.

555
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,727
Just give me one minute.
Just give me one minute...

556
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,586
Why should
I believe a word you say?

557
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:57,589
You promised me you'd stop
talking to her. Months ago.

558
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,601
- She's a friend.
- Really? Is that something you text

559
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,560
all your friends?
"Thinking about your legs

560
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,395
- and everything between"?
- That doesn't mean anything.

561
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,732
Jesus, Peter,
how stupid do you think I am?

562
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:08,943
- You're obviously not stupid...
- Have you slept with her?

563
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,703
Since you slept with me,
after I gave myself to you.

564
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,205
- No. No, I would never do that.
- But before?

565
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,042
- Please, listen, I love you...
- I waited my entire life

566
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,344
to have sex, because it means
something to me.

567
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,046
Nowadays,
everyone fucks like animals,

568
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,081
- like nothing's special anymore.
- You are...

569
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:25,383
You're full of shit!

570
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,919
This is over.

571
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,155
I want you out.

572
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,234
They want to go through with it.

573
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,770
Patch it up, they said.

574
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:47,505
The wedding's been called off.

575
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:48,674
Patch it up quickly,

576
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:50,475
before it gets out of hand.

577
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:54,079
The girl was about to marry
a deputy director.

578
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,247
I don't suppose
you're naive enough to assume

579
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,317
you'll have any worth to
your operation if she doesn't.

580
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,820
You have enough operating cash.

581
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,455
Hire a team,
and you get to work.

582
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:05,957
Now.

583
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:38,223
It needs to look like a breakin.

584
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:43,962
Should it be painful?

585
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:49,367
Just sayin',

586
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:51,169
whoever this chick is,

587
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:53,471
you want to send her a message,
we can make it painful.

588
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,141
Did I say to send her a message?

589
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,747
All right.

590
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:15,345
- What do you want?!
- Be quiet, woman!

591
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,675
You okay?

592
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:31,076
She's got away.

593
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:32,811
Running downstairs.

594
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:36,447
The neighbor lady,
I think she saw us.

595
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:35,406
You two related or something?

596
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,975
Get rid of the body.

597
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:39,911
No means of identification.

598
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:44,515
We'll lift her wallet.

599
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:47,552
Teeth and fingers.

600
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:49,554
And there's one more thing.

601
00:44:49,654 --> 00:44:51,890
I need you to hurt me.

602
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:58,329
Badly.

603
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:15,446
You okay?

604
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:22,420
I'm sorry.

605
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,757
No. No, I'm sorry.

606
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,959
I'm so sorry.

607
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:38,503
I love you so much.

608
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:52,683
Roland, please,

609
00:45:52,784 --> 00:45:54,219
skip the gory part.

610
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,923
She broke both of her legs.

611
00:45:58,023 --> 00:46:00,591
Couldn't walk for six months.

612
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,660
My little girl was miserable.

613
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,629
He loves telling this story.

614
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:09,134
I do. I do.
Because I am so proud...

615
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,806
Could have ever imagined.

616
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,108
Thanks, Daddy.

617
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:31,422
Is he all right?

618
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,124
Yeah.

619
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:35,493
I don't think he likes
remembering his own mortality.

620
00:46:35,593 --> 00:46:38,029
Well, who does?

621
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:49,240
- Mariel.
- Thank you for having us.

622
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,741
Take care.

623
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:52,519
Would you like
to keep me company while I...

624
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,183
I think we should let
the happy couple get

625
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:56,447
- a good night's rest tonight,
- Okay.

626
00:46:56,547 --> 00:47:00,751
I suppose I could forgo this
for one night.

627
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:02,387
Yes, you really should.

628
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:05,957
Give this back to Peter
and tell him thanks anyway

629
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:08,459
and happy birthday.

630
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,095
Good night, sweetheart.

631
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:11,562
Good night.

632
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,432
Love you.

633
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:13,058
I think Mariel and Friedrich
are fighting.

634
00:48:13,158 --> 00:48:16,427
Barely said a word to her
all night.

635
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,666
That was some toast you gave.

636
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:23,601
Yeah, I was feeling nostalgic.

637
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:26,171
I could see that.

638
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:30,575
You ever like to look back,
Clare?

639
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:33,544
You like to...

640
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,513
reflect on your life?

641
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:36,814
Your family?

642
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,749
You're drunk.

643
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:39,951
But you're...

644
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,919
always very composed.

645
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,188
Aren't you?

646
00:48:45,023 --> 00:48:46,992
I go to all this trouble,

647
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:49,094
slave away to throw you
the perfect night...

648
00:48:49,194 --> 00:48:51,596
Perfect night in a perfect life.

649
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,036
You know everything about her,
don't you?

650
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:02,807
You know every little detail.

651
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:05,843
Or has it been you,

652
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,579
just playing me this whole time?

653
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,584
Tell me...

654
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,620
Clare.

655
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:19,457
Where did she end

656
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:22,493
and you begin?

657
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,565
Did I ever even fuck
my real wife?

658
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:28,899
You want to fuck me?

659
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,036
I said "my wife"!

660
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:43,981
This your way out, Clare?

661
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:45,850
You ever get caught,

662
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,390
one little swallow,
it all goes away?

663
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:49,820
- Fuck you!
- Take it, you fucking spy!

664
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,023
I'm giving you a way out.
Take it!

665
00:49:56,194 --> 00:49:58,963
It won't do anything, Peter.

666
00:49:59,064 --> 00:50:01,399
I let it go bad.

667
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:05,303
It expired.

668
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:09,140
Don't you understand?

669
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,176
All my life,

670
00:50:11,276 --> 00:50:14,645
I never had anything of my own.

671
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:18,349
But things are different now.

672
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:22,320
How?

673
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:40,638
Just give her a minute.

674
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:49,013
How'd she know how to...

675
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:52,517
'Cause, dear, she's yours.

676
00:50:55,086 --> 00:50:57,488
What will you call her?

677
00:50:57,588 --> 00:50:59,190
For the register.

678
00:51:03,628 --> 00:51:05,696
Spencer.

679
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:13,271
Call her Spencer.

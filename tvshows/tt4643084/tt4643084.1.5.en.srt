1
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:20,354
My side is expecting me home.
Meaning we're fucked.

2
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,256
Not if we send this one
back in my place.

3
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,297
You failed a drug test.

4
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:31,532
You know that's not
what this is.

5
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:34,235
Dad! I know you're
in there. Open the door.

6
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,413
You're phone's been off all day.
Mom's in the hospital.

7
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:39,006
- We've got to go. Come on.
- Mom?

8
00:00:39,107 --> 00:00:41,085
Perhaps it'll be simpler
if we introduce ourselves.

9
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,109
I'm Emily.

10
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,445
You're better than him.

11
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,448
Your assassin friend...
They want her removed.

12
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,583
She trusts me. Perhaps
it's time you actually

13
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,553
use that situation
to your advantage.

14
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,192
You know anything
about this group.

15
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,427
Pope is working with?

16
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:02,430
Fanatics. Inside our office.

17
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,466
He's been helping 'em
move illegals. A long time now.

18
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,302
They want to bring over our
guests earlier than expected.

19
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,205
Something's about to happen.
Something big.

20
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,129
Purpose of visit?

21
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,299
Maintenance for the embassy.

22
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:31,419
Enjoy your stay.

23
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,952
Howard.

24
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,009
Have you been taking lessons?

25
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,517
It's a redletter day.

26
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,085
You may actually have
your first win.

27
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,488
It only took you two months.

28
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,662
You got this.

29
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,834
Sequence is right there.

30
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,711
I'm afraid that was a mistake.

31
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,720
You were so close this time.

32
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,537
Is there a reason you're not

33
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:52,640
walking out into the hall
right now?

34
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,826
You couldn't just
drop some intel in a locker

35
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:16,096
or send a simple cipher, like
any other person, could you?

36
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:19,466
No, with you, I get...

37
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,702
these letters.

38
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,539
Like...

39
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,941
Rilke, here.

40
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,578
And I can't make heads or tails
of that guy.

41
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,118
All these years with you,

42
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,087
I'm still out in the cold.

43
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,197
Please sit.

44
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,442
Two men came to you recently.

45
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,178
Get a lot of customers here.

46
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,914
Not this kind.

47
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,583
One of these men
is an agent of this world,

48
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,185
the other's from ours.

49
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,587
His name's Howard Silk.

50
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,290
I'd like to know
what he was asking.

51
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,761
I don't remember.

52
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,798
Is this routine for you?

53
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,000
To betray your own kind?

54
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,773
You must be with the people

55
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,775
Alexander Pope's
consorting with.

56
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,944
What do they call it? Um...

57
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,980
the School.

58
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,289
Heard rumors about that place.

59
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,338
What'd you tell Howard Silk?

60
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,911
It won't make a difference,
will it?

61
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,579
If you somehow compromised me
or my associates,

62
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,682
there are things
that must be made right.

63
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,356
When I tell you...

64
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,759
what happens?

65
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:02,362
You've already chosen your side.

66
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,798
A decade here,

67
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,934
three at home...
Know what I know?

68
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,137
There are no sides.

69
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,842
We all go to the same hell.

70
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,331
You want Anna?

71
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,334
Yes. Yeah. Um...

72
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,303
- You know who I am?
- Yeah.

73
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,205
From pictures.

74
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,675
And you're... a boyfriend?

75
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,343
Living together?

76
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,380
- How long has that been...
- Anna's on a shift.

77
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,915
Okay.

78
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:58,651
Um... could you
tell me where, please?

79
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,420
I'dl'd really like
to speak with her.

80
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,389
Maybe leave her alone?

81
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,025
I'm her father.

82
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,795
That's not what I hear.

83
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,535
Okay.

84
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,704
Will you please tell her
I stopped by?

85
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:20,173
Okay.

86
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:21,068
What do you think of the view?

87
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,105
Different, I imagine,
where you come from.

88
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,044
There's no need
for pretense with me, Howard.

89
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,883
I know so much about you.

90
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,818
I know your other
sent you here in his place

91
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,421
as a result of his being...

92
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,590
grounded by the embassy.

93
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:52,332
He didn't tell you about me,
did he?

94
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,136
No.

95
00:13:56,236 --> 00:14:00,273
My name is Alexander Pope.

96
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,009
And you, dear boy,

97
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:05,845
are nothing like
our mutual friend.

98
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,715
You...

99
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,451
you work for the Office?

100
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,988
They call me a runner.

101
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,390
II don't know what that is.

102
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,693
It means that, some years ago,
I took a man like you

103
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:24,197
and made him into a man
like Howard Silk.

104
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,600
So...

105
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,369
I should say, what,

106
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,038
job well done?

107
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,607
I understand
you've been spending

108
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,577
some time with his family.

109
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,248
That's right.

110
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,683
Let me guess,

111
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,619
he didn't tell you
about them either.

112
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,058
It's in his nature.

113
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:54,394
Perhaps he didn't want you
mucking around in his affairs.

114
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:55,795
On that subject though,

115
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,298
if I may offer you
a word of advice,

116
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:03,370
you really shouldn't be placing
any trust in that woman.

117
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,973
Emily?

118
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,775
I can't speak for what
she's like on your side,

119
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:12,345
but this one ruined him.

120
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,815
And I wouldn't want
the same thing happening to you.

121
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,519
Maybe you don't really know her.

122
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,122
No.

123
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,493
Maybe you're right.

124
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:31,331
I just thought I'd warn you
as a gesture of good faith.

125
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,467
Don't be shy, Howard.

126
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:38,571
If you ever need anything, just
drop a letter on the lamppost.

127
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,375
You haven't the faintest idea
what I'm talking about,

128
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,910
have you?

129
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,446
He was right...

130
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,182
You're so plain.

131
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,653
Why don't you ask Emily
about my signal plan?

132
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,026
Might surprise you what
you don't know about that woman.

133
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,283
Working on a Saturday,
Mr. Quayle?

134
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,726
Just found
a few contraband items.

135
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,361
No alarms.

136
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,597
You're certain?

137
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,408
You know, it might be helpful
if you told me

138
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,801
exactly what we're looking for.

139
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:25,278
Before Silk left, he asked me
to follow up on a lead.

140
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:29,249
So I met a source.

141
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:33,052
A man who knows about the people
funding Baldwin.

142
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:36,189
And what did he say?

143
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,326
He mentioned a mole.

144
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,426
Here?

145
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
Third floor.

146
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:42,695
High level.

147
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,532
I know every point of exposure
from this floor.

148
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,700
If there's a leak,
it's controlled.

149
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,536
He said it was high clearance.

150
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,771
There's only a few people
that could be.

151
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,674
You, me,

152
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,809
any one of your boys.

153
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:08,655
How long did your source say
this mole has been in place?

154
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,324
He said years.

155
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:18,097
Come with me.
We're going for a drive.

156
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:30,697
I'm sorry to just
come over like this, but...

157
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:34,967
I met a man today
named Alexander Pope.

158
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,139
Yeah? What did he want?

159
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,576
He told me
I shouldn't trust you.

160
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,381
Well, that's rich,
coming from him.

161
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,152
Look, I...

162
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,888
got to be honest... II don't know

163
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,790
how this game is played,

164
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,392
but...

165
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:02,629
it's obvious
that things over here

166
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:06,132
with you are not exactly
as they are over there

167
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:09,936
with my Emily.

168
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:14,541
Look, Howard, I really don't
think you and I should discuss

169
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:15,842
your other life. I...

170
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,310
Please.

171
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,346
My Emily is a clerk.

172
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,348
It's pretty evident
that you're not.

173
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,049
I want to know

174
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,818
how you became so different.

175
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,920
Okay.

176
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,756
Go ahead.

177
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,824
Ask.

178
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:36,696
You do what he does?

179
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,966
I work in Strategy.

180
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,067
Counterintelligence.

181
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,769
It's a different department,

182
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,538
but it's close.

183
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,140
How long?

184
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,276
Since we met?

185
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:52,979
How long have you been married?

186
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,582
28 years.

187
00:21:58,418 --> 00:21:59,919
I don't know all the ways

188
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,321
our lives were different
back then, but...

189
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:06,793
the woman you married...

190
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:10,329
loved you very much.

191
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:14,233
Where is she now?

192
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,102
About six weeks ago,

193
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,070
she was walking
across the street

194
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,840
and she was hit by a car.

195
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,543
And a few days ago,

196
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:26,913
an assassin came
to try to finish the job.

197
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,216
Were you...

198
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:33,453
really hospitalized
for a drug overdose?

199
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,723
No.

200
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,326
Someone... did that to you.

201
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:41,894
Someone tried to kill you.

202
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,796
Yes. His name is

203
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,098
Alexander Pope.

204
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:50,136
The man your other trusts,
much to his detriment.

205
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:57,710
There's another name...
CClaude Lambert.

206
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,480
Does that name
mean anything to you?

207
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,482
Why do you ask?

208
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:06,486
My other said that he believes

209
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:08,988
he's involved in this, too.

210
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,560
The embassy's compromised.

211
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,098
How can I help?

212
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:24,403
Emily, please,
you said there are ways

213
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:27,039
we could help each other.

214
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:30,777
Somebody out there
is trying to kill my wife.

215
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,602
Toast and espresso.

216
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,138
Toast and espresso.

217
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:33,405
Easy.

218
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:36,075
Ein Espresso.

219
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,562
Espresso...

220
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:02,034
toast...

221
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,737
and soup of the day.

222
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,372
No, I...

223
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:08,007
I didn't order soup.

224
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,275
Yeah. Right.

225
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,744
My mistake.

226
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,513
Keep it.

227
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:17,216
Goes well with the toast.

228
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,387
A lot of security.

229
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,589
It's to keep eyes away.

230
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,124
Who exactly is this woman?

231
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,425
Her name is Alice.

232
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,728
She's a defector
from the other side.

233
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:03,863
Used to be a secretary
in Strategy.

234
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:06,065
What, you just let her
live here?

235
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,301
She had valuable information.

236
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,170
Well, we gave her a life.

237
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,205
I'll do the talking.

238
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:29,355
Mausi.

239
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,357
You didn't call.

240
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,126
They tried.

241
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:35,527
You didn't pick up.

242
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:36,829
The winter garden.

243
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,230
I was in the winter garden.

244
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,799
We have one now.

245
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,001
Herbert is terrible
with the planting,

246
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:45,104
but we have tomatoes
in the winter.

247
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,206
Red Tea.

248
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,175
Mausi, you didn't.

249
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,212
We should celebrate.

250
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,082
I already hear the kettle.

251
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:59,886
What's that, contraband?

252
00:27:10,897 --> 00:27:13,632
That smell.

253
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,768
I've almost forgotten.

254
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,837
You know, we took the seed,

255
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:21,607
tried to grow it here,
but you just can't.

256
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:24,811
The soil over here is so arid.

257
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,849
Thank you.

258
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:39,358
So how are things at the Office?

259
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,863
I miss it.

260
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:47,299
Said to her the other day,
"I miss the game."

261
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:50,636
- How is she?
- She's fine.

262
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:53,405
We're fine.

263
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,408
But you're not, I think.

264
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,911
Coming all this way.

265
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,849
Do you remember
when you came over,

266
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:04,717
what you said to my men

267
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:09,421
in Housekeeping, on our side?

268
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,191
Has something happened?

269
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,594
There have been
some developments.

270
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,864
Recently? Something new?

271
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,901
It's possible
we've been compromised.

272
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,305
A leak in Housekeeping?

273
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:29,441
Could be all of Strategy.

274
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,148
Mausi, are you certain
that it's so high up?

275
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:37,750
Yes.

276
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,153
Yes, we're quite certain.

277
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,355
You think that I was right.

278
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:47,293
That's why you've come to me.

279
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,061
I don't know.

280
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:51,663
I told your men, I swore on it.

281
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:54,133
It's important that we
don't make any conclusions

282
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,235
- just yet; We're just talking.
- No.

283
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:58,237
It must be them.

284
00:28:58,337 --> 00:28:59,738
If the leak is so high.

285
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,673
If there's a mole, it has to be.

286
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:03,442
Has to be who?

287
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:07,646
Welcome.

288
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,316
Try the mint. Fresh.

289
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,683
Dear.

290
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:13,652
- The roast?
- In the oven.

291
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,988
The heat, not too high.

292
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:19,358
Yes, yes.

293
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,063
He always burns the roast.

294
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:30,102
So handsome,
but a terrible cook.

295
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:34,540
Mausi, I tried
to believe your men.

296
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,408
I really did.

297
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,946
It would be better
if I was only fooling myself.

298
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:42,915
That they didn't really exist.

299
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:45,885
Who the hell
are we talking about?

300
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,690
If Lambert

301
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,225
is somehow involved in all this,

302
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,727
he must be receiving orders
from our side.

303
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:58,730
So we're looking for
Edgar Brandt, a courier,

304
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:00,833
who brings the embassy pouch
back and forth.

305
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:05,037
So how do we go about this?

306
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:09,441
You happen to be his role model.

307
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,944
So you want me to talk to him?

308
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,513
Well, you did offer to help.

309
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:20,920
Does nobody shop around here?

310
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,122
Ever since I got to this side,

311
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:25,724
public places, inside, outside,

312
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,594
the whole city seems so vacant.

313
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:30,829
He really didn't
tell you anything

314
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,165
about our world, did he?

315
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:37,103
There was a flu epidemic
in the early '90s.

316
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:40,406
It was a fever
that escalated quickly.

317
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,808
Within four years,

318
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:45,878
seven percent of the population
was wiped out.

319
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:49,081
Seven percent of your
world's population?

320
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,217
Yeah.

321
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:54,486
God. That'sthat's like
half a billion people.

322
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,224
Yeah, we almost lost Anna.

323
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:05,097
She was just a little girl,

324
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:09,435
and in the hospital for months.

325
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,637
Howard was a mess.

326
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:15,774
I just... I was paralyzed.

327
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,911
Couldn't even go
to the hospital.

328
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:22,048
Isis that when you started?

329
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:25,884
Just the pills at the beginning.

330
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:28,654
Anna got better,

331
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:33,059
but... everything else
got worse.

332
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:43,669
I can tell by the way
you look at me...

333
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:46,472
that you hold her
in high regard.

334
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:51,610
She, she had her rough times.

335
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,679
Edinburgh. Yes.

336
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,948
I remember some of it.

337
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:02,654
And what about, Ian?

338
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:07,226
Will you tell him
aboutabout this?

339
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:08,660
No.

340
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,262
He's not the sort of person

341
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:13,065
who would understand this,
believe me.

342
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,569
You two are happy?

343
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,976
That's him.

344
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:26,478
Okay, all you have to do

345
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,647
is to find out
the delivery address

346
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,216
of the pouch.

347
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:31,850
We find that, we find out

348
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,485
who Lambert's working with.

349
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,854
Right.

350
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,224
Don't worry.

351
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,959
You'll be fine.
I'll be, I'll be nearby.

352
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:43,329
Sure.

353
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:56,094
I tell you about this girl

354
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:57,663
I've been seeing over there?

355
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:58,997
She's a lawyer.

356
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,699
I know her on this side, too.

357
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,201
All buttonedup and quiet.

358
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:04,403
But over there...

359
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:06,272
You know, it's crazy
they both make

360
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:08,340
the same sound when they finish.

361
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,543
It's like kittens trapped in
a closet, you know?

362
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,917
I want to talk about
Claude Lambert.

363
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:22,588
And some people
he's working with.

364
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:26,825
You'reyou're moving pouches
for the embassy, right?

365
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:28,960
For Lambert?

366
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,630
Bringing them over to this sie

367
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:35,066
to a specific location?

368
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,002
Maybe it's best
we don't talk about

369
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,870
all kinds of shit, you know?

370
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,676
These people, they're connected
everywhere. Every floor.

371
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,945
Our side and theirs.

372
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,415
Could be you;
This could be a test.

373
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,019
I think I need another drink.

374
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,388
You need something?

375
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:39,231
Fuck.

376
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,066
Hello, Edgar.

377
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,735
You left without paying
for your drink.

378
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,875
You two are working together?

379
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:54,546
See how quiet he is?

380
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:57,559
I think he's afraid
for your safety, Edgar.

381
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:58,784
Now, look.

382
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,019
We both know

383
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,121
I have no fucking clue
what's going on.

384
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,190
There is no need
for that sort of language.

385
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:06,601
Someone tried to have me killed
the other night.

386
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,026
I'd like to know who that was.

387
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:10,996
Who's Lambert consorting with?

388
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:12,531
I don't know who
the pouch goes to.

389
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:13,932
It's just some fucking house.

390
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:16,101
- A house?
- Yes, a house.

391
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:17,869
A mansion, it's two hours
out of town.

392
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,847
- Who lives in the mansion?
- Are you kidding me?

393
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:23,509
Theythey don't even let us
pull up the driveway.

394
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:29,648
I need the address, Edgar.

395
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,186
Potsdam.

396
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:38,156
Five kilometers past town.
47 Linchstrasse.

397
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,959
Thank you. You may go.

398
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:59,311
You understand,
the Office where I come from,

399
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:01,613
we don't have the same
structure as you do.

400
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:04,249
In Strategy, there's a board
of directors.

401
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,984
They share power,

402
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,420
and they've been know to fight
from time to time.

403
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,564
Yeah, I'm familiar with it.

404
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:11,256
Just before I left,

405
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:12,997
there was a dispute among
these directors.

406
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,927
There was a man, very young,

407
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,730
had a proposal to exert

408
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,966
"quiet influence"

409
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:23,435
on your side.

410
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,671
What does that mean?

411
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:28,674
It's a black operation.

412
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:30,241
Low profile.

413
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:32,143
Long term in its impact.

414
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,979
They called this program
"Indigo."

415
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,146
And what is that?

416
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,848
It's a network of some kind?

417
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:37,983
No.

418
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,718
School.

419
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,086
A school?

420
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:42,954
For children. They're chosen,

421
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,223
trained,
soldiers for their side.

422
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,159
They grow up and are placed here

423
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,529
on your side, as sleeper agents.

424
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:52,498
And management on your side
approved this?

425
00:38:52,598 --> 00:38:54,032
Management never knew.

426
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:55,333
It came from private money.

427
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:57,936
- Whose?
- Fanatics.

428
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,705
Within the Office.

429
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:02,641
They hate your side
for what you've done to ours.

430
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,511
Wait, ththe flu?

431
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:08,246
Is she, is she talking about...?

432
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,615
This is ridiculous.

433
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:12,283
Your side knows
we had no part in that.

434
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,886
It's a conspiracy theory.
It's been disproven.

435
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:17,155
Not to them; Not to many.

436
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,015
There have been some
assassinations recently.

437
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:21,092
People of interest.

438
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,994
It seems strategic.

439
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,864
- Targeted.
- Mausi,

440
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:28,366
this is exactly something
Shadow would arrange.

441
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:30,536
Who's Shadow?

442
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,941
Tell me what you told my men,
exactly as you said it.

443
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:41,713
Five years ago,
I heard a discussion

444
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:45,851
aabout a vacancy in your
Office, one they had created.

445
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:47,919
- So, they created a vacancy.
- Yes.

446
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,422
A hightraffic position;
Director level.

447
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:51,857
They were going to expedite

448
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:54,092
the arrival of an agent
called Shadow.

449
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,561
So that's our mole?

450
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:57,929
- Which department?
- I don't know.

451
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,966
- YYou must know something, just anything, details.
- No.

452
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,034
I wish I did.

453
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:07,873
Mausi,

454
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:10,542
if Shadow is real,

455
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:13,879
everything is compromised.

456
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:16,247
All of our secrecy.

457
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,983
Even us.

458
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,722
Is that Mausi's car I see?

459
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:25,557
Hello, dear.

460
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:28,960
You didn't call.

461
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,030
He did. We were in
the winter garden.

462
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,031
How was your walk?

463
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:35,000
Good.

464
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,202
I saw an owl.

465
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:39,137
The smallest,
most beautiful owl.

466
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:40,472
Splendid.

467
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:42,007
Did you see the fox?

468
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:43,274
No, not today.

469
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,410
We've had a visitor lately.

470
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:48,279
Yeah. Small little fox tracks.

471
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,248
Dear, the roast.

472
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:51,617
Already in the oven.

473
00:40:51,717 --> 00:40:53,652
Yeah. The heat, not too high.

474
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,122
Yes, yes.

475
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:03,361
He always burns the roast.

476
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,231
So handsome but a terrible cook.

477
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,500
You stay for supper?

478
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,769
Can't. We should be going.

479
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:13,204
We've taken too much
of your time.

480
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,405
Please. Come on, stay.

481
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:15,574
Too much work.

482
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:17,008
But thank you.

483
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:22,113
Don't work too hard.

484
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,249
Mausi.

485
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,053
Are we safe?

486
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:31,990
Always.

487
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,869
Interesting setup.

488
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:47,305
When she crossed over,
she wanted to meet her other.

489
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:49,507
And they got along.

490
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:55,714
Shadow?

491
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:58,383
Your men knew about this
this whole time,

492
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:00,218
and they just sat on it.

493
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,087
If he exists,

494
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,289
I'll find him.

495
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:30,782
HHoward?

496
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,984
Sister in the hospital?
What a fucking load of shit.

497
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:35,587
Who do you work for? What floor?

498
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:37,155
You've been colluding
with Emily,

499
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:38,624
hiding her research here.

500
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:40,425
- Whatwhat is that?
- Please don't insult

501
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:43,261
my intelligence. I'm not the
fucking nobody you think I am.

502
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:44,730
Start talking.

503
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,232
I didn't know she was married.

504
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:53,238
I'm sorry, Howard, I...

505
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,209
By the time she told me,
I was...

506
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,779
already...

507
00:43:05,617 --> 00:43:08,086
How long?

508
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:15,894
We were seeing each other
ten months.

509
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:19,330
Then the accident happened.

510
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,399
I saw you at the hospital

511
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:24,903
and made up the story
about my sister.

512
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,508
You're a fucking civilian.

513
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,443
Howard,

514
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:35,246
why are you carrying a gun?

515
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:43,188
I'm despicable.

516
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,990
I'm sorry.

517
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:52,130
You love her?

518
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:57,268
Please don't hurt me.

519
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:02,908
And she loves you?

520
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:05,410
I'm sorry.

521
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,305
[ (door opens, closes ]

522
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:46,551
I hope your trip went smoothly.

523
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:48,386
These are your orders.

524
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:50,922
Relevant details.

525
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,691
Everything you need is in there.

526
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:06,037
What about the personal effects?

527
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:08,774
You'll get them
when your marks are dead.

528
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:10,876
They're still alive?

529
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:12,878
There have been complications.

530
00:45:12,978 --> 00:45:14,412
Problems with our assassin.

531
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:15,713
I'm working on it.

532
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:17,215
You'll have to be patient.

533
00:45:29,995 --> 00:45:31,629
I was in the year behind you.

534
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,231
We never met.

535
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:35,901
She talks about you
all the time.

536
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:41,773
It's an honor.

537
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:51,116
I'll be in touch
with additional instructions.

538
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:14,192
You know, it's probably best
if you don't stay another night.

539
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:16,527
Right. Yeah.

540
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,464
Probably best.

541
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,868
I'm not her, Howard.

542
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:27,172
I mean,
there's a lot we share, but...

543
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:30,141
there's a lot we don't.

544
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:34,012
Don't look for things
that aren't there.

545
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:38,749
Do you think it's possible to...

546
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:42,520
truly love someone

547
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:46,624
without ever knowing
who they really are?

548
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:51,362
Maybe we don't...

549
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:54,499
love someone
for who they really are.

550
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:58,836
Maybe love is seeing them...

551
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,040
for who they'd rather be.

552
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:08,179
Good night.

553
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,017
Good night.

554
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,761
So,

555
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:26,964
found your little stash.

556
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:29,867
That was a good idea,

557
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,603
hiding it
with the nerdy professor.

558
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:39,410
Would've been nice
to think he was just a mark,

559
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,979
but...

560
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,750
apparently it was more
than that.

561
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:57,462
I thought you were better.

562
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,538
Thanks for the intel.

563
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,638
Can I get you anything?

564
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:47,278
You get robbed lately?

565
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:51,382
It's a long story, but no.

566
00:50:53,118 --> 00:50:55,553
Have a seat.

567
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:08,166
Marko says you stopped by.

568
00:51:08,266 --> 00:51:10,067
Yeah. I, um...

569
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:13,171
just wanted to see
if you were all right.

570
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,741
What is this?

571
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:17,975
What?

572
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,744
Are you sick?

573
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:21,112
NNo.

574
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:22,680
Are you dying?

575
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,015
Just tell me that you have...

576
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:27,418
I don't give a shit.

577
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:30,755
Just tell me that's why
you've been acting this way,

578
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:32,089
so I can just understand.

579
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,492
No, Anna, no. No, I'm not...

580
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:35,860
I'ml'm not dying.

581
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,262
I'm not sick.

582
00:51:37,362 --> 00:51:39,930
Then why won't you leave us
alone?

583
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,032
After all these years, why now?

584
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:46,404
I'm sorry, I...

585
00:51:46,504 --> 00:51:49,207
I know I made mistakes
in the past.

586
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:51,776
And I'm so sorry.

587
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:55,446
III regret...

588
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:57,648
so much.

589
00:51:57,748 --> 00:52:01,386
And I know I can't just
suddenly fix everything. I'm...

590
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:02,953
I know that. Anna, please.

591
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:05,823
Just wait.

592
00:52:05,923 --> 00:52:07,625
For a few minutes,

593
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:09,960
can you...

594
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,797
I don't know, can you just...

595
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:15,433
pretend you don't know me

596
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:17,402
and I'm not
your negligent father,

597
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:20,171
not the guy who... left

598
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:22,106
andand hurt you

599
00:52:22,207 --> 00:52:23,874
and...

600
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,110
ruined everything.

601
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:30,881
Can we start over?

602
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,918
Just... tell me

603
00:52:34,018 --> 00:52:37,655
everything about you.

604
00:52:37,755 --> 00:52:39,023
And I'll just listen.

605
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:41,859
I won't say a word.

606
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:43,928
Please.

607
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:48,399
Tell me what I've missed.

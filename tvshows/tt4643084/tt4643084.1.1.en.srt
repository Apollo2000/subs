1
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:55,749
Police. Fuck off.

2
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,385
Fuck off.

3
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:16,704
How did he get away?

4
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,150
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

5
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,622
Yeah, it's me.
We have a problem.

6
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:37,858
Something went wrong
with the deal. Yeah.

7
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,193
Baldwin's gone.

8
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,128
We moved in as fast as we could.

9
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:43,364
The whole place is
fucking crawling with police.

10
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:46,400
Wait. Listen, listen,
he's not going anywhere.

11
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,302
'Cause I've got his visas
right here, yeah.

12
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,870
He didn't get them.

13
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,005
He can't get to their world.

14
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,141
No, there was a hooker
in the bathroom.

15
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:55,809
She might have seen something.

16
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,044
Yeah.

17
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,846
Bring her to you.

18
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,072
Why do you punish yourself?

19
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,307
Come on, now.

20
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:10,243
Even a game lost
is a game well played.

21
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:13,113
Spoken like a man
who is about to lose.

22
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,182
I'm trying to teach you.

23
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,284
There's your problem.
You're too nice.

24
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:19,953
And this always ends the same.

25
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:28,028
Well.

26
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,963
Next time.

27
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,769
Sometimes I get the feeling
you let me win these games.

28
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:39,440
Where would be the lesson
in that?

29
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,798
"I took the long way
to work today."

30
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,181
"The weather was too hot
for riding."

31
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,787
"It never cools off
at this time of year."

32
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:43,557
"My mother loves the winter,
but she lives in the south."

33
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,525
"Mine is partial to spring."

34
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,360
"Flowers in the air."

35
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,596
"Orchids."

36
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:51,599
"Always a good season
for orchids."

37
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,215
YYou have...

38
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,472
The girls are saying
you've got a meeting upstairs.

39
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,374
You should stop charming
those women.

40
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,877
Is it the Strategy job?

41
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:40,714
Howard. Mon frère.

42
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:44,317
Honestly? I do not think
you should waste your time.

43
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,186
- You don't?
- No.

44
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,321
Just let it go.
Pretend it never happened.

45
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,793
I think you're just afraid
you're gonna miss me.

46
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,376
This way, please.

47
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,849
Wait, please. In the circle.

48
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,296
This way.

49
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,121
Hello.

50
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,588
They brought this in.

51
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,091
I'd share it, but...

52
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,729
What's that, your résumé?

53
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:05,065
No, we have it on the, um,
on the computer.

54
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,466
Yeah. Howard...

55
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,269
Silk.

56
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,904
Howard Silk.

57
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,706
Been in the Office 29 years.

58
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,342
Worked your way up to Interface.

59
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,045
As you can see, I've made
Row Designation six years now.

60
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,723
Sorry to hear about
your wife, by the way.

61
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:20,814
Howhow is she?

62
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:24,451
Shshe's improving.

63
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,886
- Yeah?
- Thank you. Yeah.

64
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,888
Her coworkers
speak very highly of her.

65
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,957
I've never met her myself,
but...

66
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,661
At my last review,

67
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,639
they mentioned there was
an opening in Strategy.

68
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,498
- Sorry, where do you live?
- Sorry, what?

69
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,567
- Where do you live?
- I'm sor...

70
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,736
- Veilsdorf.
- Do you like it there?

71
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:45,973
- It's quiet.
- Drives me mad.

72
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,708
I went out with a girl from
there once... not very long.

73
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:49,953
I mean,
you have to get into a cab

74
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,257
to find a decent meal,
don't you?

75
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,349
Asas you can see, I...

76
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,752
I've been with Interface
for quite some time now.

77
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,620
No, yeah, one of our best.

78
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,555
No one has ever
had a complaint about you.

79
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,025
Excellent.

80
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,895
I was hoping there would be
room for me in Strategy.

81
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:11,331
An opportunity to serve
at a higher level.

82
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,000
More relevant.

83
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,003
I'm sorry, Howard,
but that post has been filled.

84
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,307
When?

85
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,742
Howard, you're an Interface man.
Everyone likes you there.

86
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,112
There's no need to
upset the cart, is there?

87
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,582
Ilf... if I could
just have an interview...

88
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,719
You know, Oversight were looking
at your tapes from this morning.

89
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,654
Apparently, there was
a nonapproved exchange.

90
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,923
I'm sorry.

91
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:38,291
"Nonapproved"?

92
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:42,029
Man of your experience,
you'd think you'd know better.

93
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,799
The man had a...

94
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,235
a spot on his...

95
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:51,538
With all due respect,
Mr. Quayle...

96
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:55,542
I have come to this building
every day and done my job.

97
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,311
I understand secrecy, security.

98
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:02,015
Three decades
I've given to this office.

99
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,851
But, honestly,
sometimes it scares me.

100
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,919
I don't know what we do here.

101
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,587
I certainly don't understand

102
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,557
why telling a stranger
that he has a spot on his tie

103
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:13,493
makes one shred of difference.

104
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,898
Howard, it's been 30 years.

105
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,902
If it was gonna happen,
it would have happened.

106
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,408
Yeah.

107
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,580
Howard.

108
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,582
We're celebrating. Drinks?

109
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,617
What's the occasion?

110
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,052
Marcel, the bastard.

111
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,922
He got himself
that Strategy job.

112
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,458
Why don't you come?

113
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,661
No, I can't.

114
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,465
Um... plans.

115
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,267
Congratulations.

116
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,215
Yeah, okay.

117
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,684
I've been trying you all week.

118
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,955
Should have occurred to me
I could've just found you here.

119
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:51,024
Yes, it should have.

120
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,594
My mother's
always been difficult.

121
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,997
It's no secret.

122
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:00,633
But I'm the one
who still has to live with her.

123
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,602
She wants what she wants.

124
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:08,875
You came all the way here
just to tell me that?

125
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,843
There's been no improvement.

126
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,980
Yes. Concussive trauma
can take up to a year...

127
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,680
I know, Howard.
I've spoken to them, too.

128
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:18,118
But we have to be realistic.
It's been six weeks.

129
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,988
They're moving her
to longterm care.

130
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:25,892
All our mother wants
is to have her at home...

131
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,328
if the time comes.

132
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,133
Have a look at this.

133
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,104
Sign it when
you've had a moment.

134
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,674
She wants her
surrounded by family.

135
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,244
I'm her family.

136
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:48,948
I tell you what,
I'll pop it over here.

137
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,987
Please think it over.

138
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,008
I have a new book.

139
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,649
"You, only.

140
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:26,219
Only you... exist."

141
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,731
You know who I am?

142
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,166
Yes.

143
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,669
Aldrich. Housekeeping.

144
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,139
Do you know why
we might want to speak?

145
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,707
I told you,
he doesn't know a damn thing.

146
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,942
He's nobody.

147
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,377
Go and get him.

148
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,788
Sorry. It's his job
to be disliked.

149
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,724
I... Have I done
something wrong?

150
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,327
Listen, Howard,
we have a bit of a situation.

151
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,364
Um, something we need
to bring you in on.

152
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:20,099
Me?

153
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,569
Someone's walked in
from the other side.

154
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,171
It might be a defection.

155
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,139
Don't really know
what else to call it.

156
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,874
I'ml'm sorry,
the other side? I...

157
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,910
Well, typically we don't
entertain this sort of business.

158
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,879
Strangers come over,
we turn them away.

159
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,615
But this one is... different.

160
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,384
He... he's valuable.

161
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,319
And...

162
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,554
Well, he's only willing
to speak to you.

163
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:01,107
Just, whatever you do...

164
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,875
don't panic.

165
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,378
This is a bad idea.

166
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,449
Wha... What...

167
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,851
Hi, Howard.

168
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,456
Well, this is disappointing.

169
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:20,159
Why did you come over, Howard?

170
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,295
I'm Howard.

171
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,964
Does he really not know
what's going on?

172
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,500
What level are you?

173
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,403
- He's an Interface man.
- Enough.

174
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,805
- He's wasting our time.
- Believe me, I'm not.

175
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,308
But I have to be back
in about 12 minutes,

176
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,444
so let's discuss terms.

177
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:40,847
First, no one outside this room
knows about this arrangement.

178
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:43,250
Why would we listen
to a word you have to say?

179
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,385
Because if you don't,
people start dying.

180
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,387
A kill order came out
from my side,

181
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,256
targeting people on your side.

182
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:50,790
- Bullshit.
- Yeah, I get it.

183
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,192
You're skeptical.
You've made that very clear.

184
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,213
If there is a problem,
we go to the Fourth Floor.

185
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,230
Your Fourth Floor
may be compromised.

186
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,565
He's lying.

187
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:01,368
There's no intelligence
to confirm any of this.

188
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:03,135
All due respect,
your intelligence

189
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,204
is kind of a shit show
right now.

190
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,640
Okay, well, this was fun.

191
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,141
Got to go.

192
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:12,011
Wait.

193
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,980
Who's on the list?

194
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,848
Not till I know where you stand.

195
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,151
I'll be back tomorrow.
Longer visa. "Courier duty."

196
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,321
You have until then
to make up your mind.

197
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,357
And we're gonna need this one,
so you might want to...

198
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,659
I don't know, read him in.

199
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,530
Wow. Interface.

200
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,599
Perfect.

201
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,723
- What is this?!
- Shut up, Howard.

202
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,616
JJust let me think
for a second, okay?

203
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,252
He looks exactly like me.

204
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:55,622
He is you, Howard.

205
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:58,257
Really, do you have any idea
how lucky you are?

206
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,460
No one... no one...
Gets to meet their other.

207
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,595
Other? -Everyone
wonders about it, but...

208
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:05,031
Mr. Quayle, you brought me
into that room.

209
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,133
Please tell me what is going on.

210
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,543
30 years ago,
during the Cold War,

211
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:19,412
there was an experiment,
an accident, in this building.

212
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,414
Eastern scientists...

213
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,316
Something went wrong.

214
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:27,086
They opened up a passage
directly beneath us.

215
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,622
When you go through this door,
you come out the other side,

216
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:32,158
you're in another world,
identical to ours.

217
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,060
I... Identical to ours?

218
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,928
Same events, same experiences.

219
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,097
So, where this building stands,
where we are now,

220
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,166
- this is called the Crossing.
- Wh...

221
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,234
But... Identical to ours?

222
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:44,571
Hehe... he looks
exactly like me,

223
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,706
but he is nothing like me.

224
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:50,577
So, when this door opened,
our paths began to branch off.

225
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,545
More and more, over time.

226
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,515
This... this is not my job
to tell you this, Howard.

227
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:58,317
You shouldn't even...

228
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:03,255
What you need to know is
we keep a lid on it.

229
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,592
We trade information,
we gather intelligence

230
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,603
- from the other side.
- Whatwhat kind of intelligence?

231
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:10,029
That's not important. To you.

232
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:14,634
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

233
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:17,236
Okay, who else knows about this?

234
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,305
Out... Outside this building?

235
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:20,707
What do you think?

236
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:24,577
II don't know...
Governments, world leaders?

237
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:28,114
Some. That's... It's murky.
I don't...

238
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,516
Look, Howard, you know this now.

239
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:32,184
But you do not know this.

240
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,387
Is he gone?

241
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:37,123
- Yes. He gave me a name.
- From the kill list?

242
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:39,526
Emily Silk, his wife.

243
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:42,729
- WhWhat about my wife?
- She's in the hospital.

244
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:44,607
- Albert Schweitzer.
- Okay, we'll put a watch on her,

245
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:46,699
- as a precaution.
- Hold... What, are you saying

246
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,168
- my wife is in danger?
- No, no, she's fine.

247
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,679
Howard, you know what?
Go back to work.

248
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,506
WhWhat does my wife
have to do with any of this?

249
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,142
We'll handle it. She'll be safe.

250
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,478
We'll be in touch.

251
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:00,647
What did he say?

252
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:03,416
We have to be very cautious
about it.

253
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,183
Gin and tonic, bitte.

254
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,804
Hey. Hey.

255
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:06,939
- Marcel.
- Ja?

256
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:24,023
Very quiet this morning.

257
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,294
Do you think...

258
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:31,964
life is just
a sum of our choices?

259
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:36,335
You do something and I react.

260
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:39,672
You do it often enough...

261
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,441
my reaction changes.

262
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,912
We're changing, all the time.

263
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,282
Those choices define who we are.

264
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,384
No.

265
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,553
Who we are is not about choice.

266
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,357
It's not?

267
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:01,861
You are who you are.
I am what I am.

268
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:04,964
And the game only ends one way.

269
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,036
Know your problem?

270
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,073
You're too young.

271
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,478
Purpose of visit?

272
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,580
Bringing the embassy pouch.

273
00:26:54,681 --> 00:26:56,382
12hour visa.

274
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:00,753
It's better on my side.

275
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:14,901
One of ours was killed
last night.

276
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,103
Not here.

277
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:35,554
You know who carried this out?

278
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,489
Don't know much about her.

279
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,125
Her?

280
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:41,460
Yeah, we didn't know that
until the other night.

281
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,531
She skipped out on a crash
meeting by posing as a hooker.

282
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:47,633
Handle is Baldwin.

283
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:51,037
She's a contract assassin.

284
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:54,841
Killed some good men on my side.

285
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:56,776
That your dead man's dossier?

286
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:03,850
Marcel.

287
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,152
Double tap entry.

288
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:08,087
No witnesses.

289
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,956
Marcel was killed?

290
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:13,459
Howard, you wouldn't happen
to have any cream, would you?

291
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,734
So why did they target this man?

292
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,269
I don't know.

293
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,703
He was Strategy?

294
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:26,238
He was just promoted.

295
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,885
Look, I'm sorry.
We've done our part, all right?

296
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:31,453
We... we keep doing
everything you've asked for.

297
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,579
It's time for you
to be a little more forthright.

298
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,814
What is this about?

299
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:37,616
There's been some infighting
in leadership on my side.

300
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,918
You've been aware of it?

301
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,753
We heard a few things.

302
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:43,856
There's a faction,
may be trying a takeover.

303
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:46,125
Unclear who, exactly.

304
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,796
They're hardline, ideological,
don't care much for diplomacy.

305
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,563
What do they want?

306
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,666
It's been bad on my side
for months now.

307
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,635
Contentious, defection talk.

308
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,537
People have been disappearing.

309
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,807
- And now the fight spills over.
- So what is this?

310
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:02,584
They're just picking off
our people at random?

311
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:03,843
It's not random.

312
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:06,478
I don't know what it is,
but it's not random.

313
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,148
Enough. We have to
tell the Fourth Floor. -No.

314
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,785
Right now, nobody knows
about this arrangement.

315
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,720
We need to keep it that way.

316
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:17,756
I... I'ml'm sorry
to interrupt, but I...

317
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:18,991
I don't understand.

318
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,827
Why do they want to hurt Emily?

319
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:23,662
My guess is
to send me a message.

320
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,897
By threatening my wife?

321
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,133
WhWhy not yours?

322
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,901
My Emily's dead.

323
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,039
Cancer.

324
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,580
What's your designation?

325
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,717
Officially, I'm 4C, Diplomacy.

326
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,586
But I'm Section Two.

327
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,956
I've spent my career building

328
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:52,825
our clandestine operational
network on your side.

329
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:56,963
So Section Two is real.

330
00:29:57,063 --> 00:30:00,933
What about, the other Emily?

331
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:02,534
Where is she, at work?

332
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,671
No.

333
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,739
Um...

334
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,843
six weeks ago,
she was crossing the street,

335
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:15,114
and a...
a car came out of nowhere.

336
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,351
Kid driving,
wasn't paying attention.

337
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,923
She's in a coma.

338
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:29,095
So she's in a hospital?

339
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:32,064
Yeah. -All right.
I need to know everything.

340
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:35,001
If Baldwin is operating
on this side,

341
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,969
your wife may be
her next target.

342
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,670
We have guards.

343
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,873
- Hold 'em back.
- Hold them back?

344
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:43,375
Look, the only advantage
we have right now is

345
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:45,311
she doesn't know I'm here.

346
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:47,746
She's methodical,
she studies routine.

347
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,150
One break in that,
and she might call it off.

348
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,852
- When do you visit?
- Every night.

349
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:56,222
All right, I'll go
in your place tonight.

350
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:59,025
Howard, why do you think
I brought you in on this?

351
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,659
For your great tactical skill?

352
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,095
Your indepth knowledge
of this whole fucking thing?

353
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,899
I need to pretend to be you,
take Baldwin out myself.

354
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,968
You don't make these decisions.

355
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:11,070
Yeah, you're right. I don't.

356
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,639
He does.

357
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,041
Fine.

358
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:17,743
We'll arrange things on our end.

359
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,478
We'll be ready in...

360
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,382
Whatwhat do you think?

361
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,453
We start immediately.

362
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,055
Excellent.

363
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:32,891
You two stay here until then.

364
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,428
Get acquainted.

365
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,444
If he makes one left
instead of a right, kill him.

366
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,476
Like looking in a mirror?

367
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,947
This was my favorite tie.

368
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:30,382
I lost it years ago.

369
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:31,917
Keep it.

370
00:32:32,018 --> 00:32:34,486
II haven't worn it in years.

371
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:38,024
Okay, let's talk routine.

372
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,826
You go in,
straight up to her room.

373
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:44,096
Anyone you interact with
regularly?

374
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:45,931
The nurses.

375
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:48,100
I say hello.

376
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,868
No one else, really.

377
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,603
Here, II want you to try this.

378
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,939
It's from the bakery downstairs.

379
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,941
No, thanks.

380
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:58,110
Please, indulge me. It's a...

381
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,546
I spent a summer in Maine
when I was a kid.

382
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,014
Yeah, I was there.

383
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:04,783
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

384
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:07,853
Right. We spent.

385
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:10,922
Remember Dad got the...
the funnel cakes?

386
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:13,759
Yeah. I really can't.
High cholesterol.

387
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,061
Really?

388
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,529
Yeah. You don't have it?

389
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,765
II don't think so.

390
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:22,034
Okay.

391
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:33,779
There's so many things
I want to ask you about.

392
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:37,616
Memories and... feelings
that I've had my whole life

393
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,151
that only belonged to me.

394
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:43,555
And now it's... us.

395
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,592
We share... genetics.

396
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:49,061
A childhood.

397
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,132
So?

398
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:55,267
So how did we get to be
so different?

399
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,970
You'd drive yourself crazy
trying to chart it out.

400
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:01,039
Seriously, people have.

401
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,910
What kind of music
do you listen to?

402
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,145
I don't care for it.

403
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,680
Favorite food?

404
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,182
Taste buds must be the same.

405
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:11,950
I don't know. American, I guess.

406
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,620
Chinese.

407
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,488
It's fascinating.

408
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:19,991
Tell you what
I've been wondering.

409
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:23,095
How come you never
got out of Interface?

410
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:25,531
All these years,
you never moved up.

411
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:26,898
What held you back?

412
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,667
I don't know.

413
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,971
- Just, life, I guess.
- Seriously?

414
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,141
- Life? That's your excuse?
- Well...

415
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:38,043
I mean, I'm not,
I'm not making excuses.

416
00:34:38,144 --> 00:34:39,911
You have regrets?

417
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,280
Yeah, some.

418
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,282
See, this is what's
so fucked up.

419
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:47,519
Genetics, childhood...
Doesn't matter.

420
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:51,457
We're helpless
to our experience.

421
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:55,327
Difference between you
and me could be a single moment,

422
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,596
one little thing gone wrong.

423
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,565
Or right.

424
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,536
Okay, routine.

425
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:06,638
At the hospital.

426
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:09,241
Um...

427
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,943
I, I read to her.

428
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,279
Books she likes.

429
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:15,714
Um, you know, poetry, mostly.

430
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:19,050
Whitman, Rilke, you know.

431
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:20,619
Stay in touch
with any of her family?

432
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,290
- Just Eric.
- That piece of shit.

433
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,060
- Eric always had it out for us.
- Yeah.

434
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:31,563
Tried to talk her
out of the wedding?

435
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:34,766
Wedding?

436
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:38,504
Yeah, the... wedding.

437
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:43,709
28 years ago, October.

438
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,411
We eloped.

439
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:48,046
28 years?

440
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,616
Wasn't that
right after we'd met?

441
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:52,618
When you know, you know.

442
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:02,628
Our first date, when she,
left the table to wash up,

443
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:06,598
I said to the waiter,
"I'm gonna marry her."

444
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,300
I just knew.

445
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:15,741
I... I couldn't get
to sleep last night.

446
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,776
I was...

447
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,511
I was so excited.

448
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:23,249
I... I was thinking,
if there's another me,

449
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:26,985
that means there's another her.

450
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,620
But...

451
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,189
She gonna make it?

452
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,393
It's too early to tell.

453
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:39,331
Were you, um...

454
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:44,236
Were you there...
for her at the end?

455
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:46,705
I, um...

456
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:50,208
I wasn't perfect.

457
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:53,612
You have regrets.

458
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,099
Which one are you?

459
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:16,802
- Fuck off.
- It's time.

460
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,220
Wait. Can you
pull over right here?

461
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:38,290
What is it?

462
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:44,330
I'll be right back.

463
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:04,750
Here. I always
bring her flowers.

464
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:17,896
Radio.

465
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:21,900
Give him one, too.

466
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,454
We got two men on every exit.

467
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,289
He told you everything?

468
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,258
Yeah, take a right
off the elevator, room 322.

469
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,428
Flowers.

470
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:51,930
Give me a gun.

471
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,001
Our guard is never down.

472
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,805
All right.

473
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:07,813
Keep your people out of sight?

474
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:11,349
Howard, wait.

475
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,851
Um... the...

476
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:16,622
the nurse on duty tonight
is named Talia.

477
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:21,427
Keep him out of sight, too?

478
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,028
Pull around back.

479
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:59,558
What did you talk about,
the two of you,

480
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:01,059
in your apartment?

481
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,663
Cholesterol.

482
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,568
10:00.

483
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:14,472
There's a visitor.

484
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,608
- Is it her?
- No.

485
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,844
Male. 40s, well dressed.

486
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:21,747
That could be Eric.

487
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:24,149
- Who the fuck is Eric?
- Her brother.

488
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,720
Okay. What do I need to know?

489
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,089
He left a contract on the,
on the table by the door.

490
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:35,961
What is this?

491
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:37,563
You didn't sign it.

492
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:39,531
No. No, of course not.

493
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:40,632
You weren't going to.

494
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,568
It's... complicated.

495
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:44,035
Get rid of him.

496
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,710
Well, I'm leaving
for the airport.

497
00:41:53,545 --> 00:41:55,981
So what do I tell her?

498
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:58,016
Listen.

499
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:00,719
Their mother wants her
back in England.

500
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:02,988
Howard, sign the fucking thing,
get him out of there.

501
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:05,423
It's time to let go, Howard.

502
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,125
Let her be with family.

503
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:12,030
This is about me, isn't it?

504
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,732
You tried to warn her
away from me

505
00:42:13,832 --> 00:42:14,909
- from the beginning.
- Stop it.

506
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:16,668
She was in love.

507
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:18,670
She was happy.

508
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,840
And you tried to ruin
the one good thing she had.

509
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,575
I'm gonna ask you one more time,

510
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:25,595
and then I'm gonna leave
'cause this is childish.

511
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,415
She will sue you
until you submit.

512
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:32,117
You understand that?

513
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:36,054
Sign it.

514
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,156
Let's be done with this.

515
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:41,793
Just sign the fucking thing.

516
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:51,770
No.

517
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,939
- For fuck sake.
- I'm sorry?

518
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:58,509
I said no.

519
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,546
Let me tell you something, Eric.

520
00:43:01,647 --> 00:43:05,516
This is something
very few people will tell you.

521
00:43:05,617 --> 00:43:07,552
You're a real fucking asshole.

522
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:10,021
Guys like you
confuse words with action.

523
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:13,224
I don't.

524
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:16,561
So I will be very, very clear.

525
00:43:16,662 --> 00:43:19,064
If you or anyone in your family

526
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:21,933
try to take her away from me,
we will be done.

527
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,602
There will be
nothing left to say.

528
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:27,005
And believe me, Eric,

529
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:31,977
the last thing you want
is me with nothing left to say.

530
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,249
Incoming female.

531
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,151
Howard, what in God's name...?

532
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:44,155
- Shh.
- I think it's her.

533
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:50,228
Go.

534
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:57,102
Whoa.

535
00:43:57,202 --> 00:43:58,770
Listen to me.

536
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,350
Someone is coming up here
to kill her.

537
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:01,840
- What?
- Shut the fuck up.

538
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,909
Stay in this room,
stay away from the door.

539
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:06,053
I'm trying to save your life
here. Do you understand me?

540
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:08,246
Eric.

541
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:09,681
Do you understand me?

542
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:11,850
Yeah. Yes.

543
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,052
Not a fucking sound.

544
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,705
Where is she?

545
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:36,141
Coming up the elevator now.

546
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,034
What are...?

547
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:21,346
She's on the second floor!

548
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,081
Second floor!

549
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:55,180
Outside! Fast!

550
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:40,125
You okay?

551
00:47:43,962 --> 00:47:45,363
She got away.

552
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:57,943
Where you going?

553
00:47:58,043 --> 00:48:00,011
To check on my wife.

554
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:23,068
What the hell is happening?

555
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,507
Just get on the plane, Eric.

556
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:31,576
It's okay, you can go.

557
00:48:33,979 --> 00:48:36,081
It's safe.

558
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:19,424
So what happens next?

559
00:49:19,524 --> 00:49:20,825
She'll try again.

560
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:22,127
And?

561
00:49:22,227 --> 00:49:23,694
I'll get another visa.

562
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,031
Might take 24 hours,
maybe longer.

563
00:49:26,131 --> 00:49:28,333
Meantime, you keep watch.

564
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:30,568
We're gonna need that one again.

565
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:34,339
I'll talk to him.

566
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:04,735
You know, I remember
when I first found out.

567
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:08,606
It doesn't normally happen
like this, you know.

568
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:10,841
There'sthere's people
you have to talk to.

569
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,311
There's, like, doctors
and psychiatrists.

570
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:16,181
You're read in.
There's this whole process.

571
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:18,549
And you, you...

572
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:20,618
You...

573
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:27,525
Do you have any idea

574
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:30,495
the world that's just
opened up to you, Howard?

575
00:51:21,346 --> 00:51:23,814
So we can count on you
to help us?

576
00:51:26,651 --> 00:51:28,052
Thanks for the ride.

577
00:51:28,153 --> 00:51:30,255
Howard. H...

578
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:34,724
Howard.

579
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:37,528
Howard!

580
00:51:39,164 --> 00:51:40,698
What do you want?

581
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:42,633
I'll tell you what I want.

582
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:46,237
II want the promotion that I
should have had three days ago.

583
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:48,206
Howard, thatthat's
not even possible.

584
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:50,375
And real access.

585
00:51:50,475 --> 00:51:53,178
Real operational knowledge.

586
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:56,581
I think, after 30 years,
I deserve that.

587
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:58,283
Okay, Howard, look,
you don't understand.

588
00:51:58,383 --> 00:51:59,650
It doesn't work like that.

589
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:04,455
Here's what I do understand.

590
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:08,359
You need me now.

591
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:14,432
So, I guess you got to...

592
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:16,567
I don't know... figure it out.

593
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:02,647
Scotch.

594
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:18,162
At the dark end.

595
00:53:18,263 --> 00:53:19,830
Of the street.

596
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:26,937
That's where we always meet.

597
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,774
Hiding in shadows.

598
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:33,978
Where we don't belong.

599
00:53:34,078 --> 00:53:36,281
Living in darkness.

600
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:39,784
To hide our wrong.

601
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:43,521
You and me.

602
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:49,026
At the dark end of the street.

603
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:52,663
You and me

604
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:54,965
I know time.

605
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:59,236
Is gonna take its toll.

606
00:53:59,337 --> 00:54:00,971
We have to pay.

607
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:05,810
For the love we stole.

608
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,845
It's a sin.

609
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:11,248
And we know it's wrong.

610
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:13,818
But our love.

611
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:17,688
Keeps coming on strong.

612
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:20,991
Steal away.

613
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:26,897
To the dark end of the street.

614
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:34,339
They're gonna find us...

615
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:37,041
What on earth have you
been doing over there?

616
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:39,410
They're gonna find us...

617
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,646
You don't want to know.

618
00:54:41,746 --> 00:54:43,381
Someday.

619
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:45,983
You and me.

620
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,552
Ha.

621
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:52,423
At the dark end of the street.

622
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:56,494
You and me.

623
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:59,697
And when the daylight hour.

624
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:03,000
Rolls around.

625
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,035
And by chance.

626
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:09,039
We're both downtown.

627
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,442
If we should meet.

628
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:15,279
Just walk on by.

629
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,449
Darling.

630
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:21,318
Please, don't cry.

631
00:55:21,419 --> 00:55:24,922
Tonight we'll meet.

632
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:27,324
If we should meet.

633
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:30,895
Just walk on by me.

634
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:34,098
Darling.

635
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:37,067
Please, don't cry.

636
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,638
Tonight we'll meet.

637
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:46,777
At the dark end of the street

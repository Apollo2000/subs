1
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,021
There's a source

2
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:23,257
- on their Third Floor.
- Strategy.

3
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,393
They say he's been
feeding Pope for years now.

4
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:27,027
You trust
this man's intelligence?

5
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:28,662
He has never been wrong.

6
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,331
If Shadow is real,

7
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,066
everything is compromised.

8
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,234
They created a vacancy.

9
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:34,602
A hightraffic position.

10
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,404
Director level.

11
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,907
Found your little stash.

12
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,909
Thanks for the intel.

13
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,220
You know, we could
help each other.

14
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:44,321
The Office are watching me,

15
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:45,179
but they're not watching you.

16
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,014
What about Ian?

17
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:48,549
Stay the fuck away from her.

18
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,451
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,353
About what happened
to your other.

20
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,125
I care about you,

21
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,427
and I would never
let anyone hurt you.

22
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,133
You're moving pouches
for Lambert?

23
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,735
To a specific location?

24
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,071
I need the address, Edgar.

25
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:12,706
A mansion. Potsdam.

26
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,918
Hey!

27
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,342
Okay?

28
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:43,156
Okay, okay.

29
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,284
Customs.

30
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,590
Why does it always
break down at Customs?

31
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,568
Prince's best work in years.

32
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,773
But you do know he's no longer
alive over there, right?

33
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,841
Now, what do you think
would happen

34
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:51,178
if this fucking album
were to find its way across?

35
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,613
Ian, please...

36
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:55,849
We are tasked with safeguarding

37
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,585
the most important
fucking secret

38
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:59,152
in the history of mankind.

39
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,988
I'm broke.

40
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,389
My kid is sick.

41
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,493
Jovey.

42
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,963
You think I care
about your family?

43
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,167
Here's the code.

44
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,170
Don't, please!

45
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,840
Fuck up the code,
you get fucked up.

46
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,392
Yeah?

47
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,928
Do you remember Edgar Brandt?

48
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,497
That embassy courier
we had on a wiretap.

49
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,599
He was talking too much
to his girlfriends.

50
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,234
Yeah, what about him?

51
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,869
Heard him make a call tonight,

52
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,072
crying about getting shaken
down by Emily for some address.

53
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:55,175
- Address?
- She was with Howard Silk.

54
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,147
What do you want
to do with them?

55
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:03,283
Black room. Three months.

56
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,853
No, Ian! Please don't do this!

57
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,463
He doesn't show up.

58
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,065
I cannot work like this.

59
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,300
He comes and goes as he pleases.

60
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,137
This is unacceptable.

61
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,872
Director, are you listening?

62
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:35,175
Hehe has not been in for days.

63
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,311
- Who?
- Howard Silk.

64
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,479
It was my impression

65
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,990
you were sending someone
to lighten my load.

66
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,216
- Should I be drafting a complaint?
- What?

67
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,153
Should I be drafting a complaint
about Howard Silk?

68
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,655
No, no, don't, no.

69
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:50,590
I'll, um...
I'll take care of it.

70
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:53,894
Thank you.

71
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,037
- I'm going out.
- What about your 2:00?

72
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:24,725
You're alive.
Sorry, I wasn't sure.

73
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,393
I've been busy.

74
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:27,671
How's your
internal search going?

75
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,329
Brilliantly well.

76
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,940
There's a mole in Strategy.
It's official.

77
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,432
We confirmed it with a source.

78
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,877
Yeah, no shit.
Do you know what section?

79
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,111
No, Aldrich's
looking into it now.

80
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,612
And if you don't start
coming into work,

81
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,747
he's gonna start
looking at you, too.

82
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,606
Is that what you want?

83
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:40,908
What's this?

84
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:42,810
This is what Emily
was working on.

85
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,278
Stolen internal documents,
taken from your office,

86
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,579
passed to the outside.

87
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,348
- This is my floor code.
- Yes, it is.

88
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,417
These documents were stolen
from my department?

89
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:52,185
Yes. As I said, you have a mole.

90
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,187
And when were you planning
on showing me these?

91
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,789
How about right now?

92
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,891
And what about Baldwin?

93
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,960
We will find Baldwin.
This is more important.

94
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,729
You find out
who those came from,

95
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,031
I'm gonna keep going
through all this.

96
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,701
I'll be at the Walcot Hotel.

97
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,037
Not spending another minute
in that office.

98
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,107
You know it's my birthday today?

99
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,144
Supposed to be hosting
a dinner party tonight.

100
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,079
Friends, colleagues.

101
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,983
Who knows? Probably inviting
this mole into my house.

102
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,852
Yeah.

103
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:26,754
Look into those memos.

104
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:30,457
Don't you worry,
I'm playing my part.

105
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,225
Play yours.

106
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:08,494
Ja.

107
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,714
Ja.

108
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,200
Best pudding in Berlin,
don't you think?

109
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,570
Roast the hazelnuts inhouse.

110
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,505
It's always the little things.

111
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:28,942
Bit strange...

112
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,911
seeing him
with nothing pithy to say.

113
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,413
Maybe he's having an offday.

114
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,615
Hear the good news, Howard?

115
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,817
Lieber.

116
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:41,454
Doctor says his knee
won't need any pins.

117
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:45,592
The limp he'll have to live
with, but no more surgery.

118
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,261
You never did apologize,
did you?

119
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,865
I don't think Howard's sorry
for what he did.

120
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:54,868
But don't take it personally.

121
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,237
He's a worldclass prick
to everyone.

122
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:02,475
You followed me here
just to bust my balls?

123
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,212
I want to talk about
Edgar Brandt, the courier.

124
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,881
Been on the phone
whining about you and Em

125
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,883
twisting his arm
about some address.

126
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:13,020
What are you two looking for?

127
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,721
Maybe you should talk to her.

128
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,456
No, Howard.

129
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:20,393
It's about time
you and me had a real chat.

130
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,210
Ian said you're trying
to go back to work.

131
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,607
Well, you know
what a shitty patient I am.

132
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,976
No sugar, thank you.

133
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,912
- Since when?
- New study.

134
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,747
High blood cholesterol levels.

135
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,782
Sugar's the culprit.

136
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,617
I'd inherit it from Dad.

137
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,686
Well, that is the only thing

138
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,755
you're gonna inherit
from your dad.

139
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,294
Has he been acting strange
to you lately?

140
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,432
Well...

141
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:04,671
He did show some...

142
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,574
natural concern
for my wellbeing.

143
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,346
Fuck, Mom.

144
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:18,218
When you finally decided
to leave him,

145
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,687
it was like any obligation I had

146
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:24,291
to feel anything for him
had lifted.

147
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:28,228
And now... I can't believe
I'm going to say this...

148
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,430
But I'm worried about him.

149
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,534
I went to see him yesterday.

150
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,770
What did you talk about?

151
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,107
Everything.

152
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:43,543
I opened up, and he listened.

153
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,546
He seemed actually
interested in my life.

154
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,251
Maybe he's trying to atone?

155
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:56,923
You shouldn't put too much stock
into that, you know.

156
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:59,926
Mom, I promised myself
a long time ago

157
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:03,430
I was done giving him chances
to disappoint me.

158
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,632
Yeah. Keep that promise.

159
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,503
Sooner or later,
he will be back to his old self.

160
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,213
Clare!

161
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,881
How are you, Ingrid?

162
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:44,884
Have you brightened your hair?

163
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,052
Thank God for you.

164
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,454
First person to notice.

165
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:48,955
We'll be seeing you later?

166
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,290
Yes, sure. I can't wait.

167
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,525
- Bye.
- Bye.

168
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,377
Act normal, or I snap your neck.

169
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,880
Look at this place.

170
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,848
Ten euro.

171
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,551
So fucking expensive.

172
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,920
- What do you want from me?
- I finish the job.

173
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,489
Then you pay me,
and I disappear.

174
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:25,258
- Nadia...
- You do not get to call me that.

175
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,827
You tried to have me killed.

176
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,098
I had no choice.

177
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,066
They put me in a corner.

178
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,268
I'm sorry.

179
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,737
Is this real?

180
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:41,708
Your shopping and your house
and your little family?

181
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:47,280
- Why are you doing this?
- To be free.

182
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,549
You escaped. You are free.

183
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,285
100,000 euro...
What you promised.

184
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,387
I finish the contracts, you pay.

185
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,389
Are you mad? They want you dead.

186
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,224
They need me to finish.

187
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,259
If I do, you'll get the money.

188
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,434
Yeah.

189
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:11,003
I pity you.

190
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,306
Nothing you are is true.

191
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,195
Early.

192
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,431
Punctual.

193
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,302
You seem nervous.

194
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,372
Terrified.

195
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,308
Howard, you remember Kaspar.

196
00:21:56,416 --> 00:22:00,086
Please keep movement
to a minimum.

197
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,326
It's now or never.

198
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:10,229
No, thanks. Not hungry.

199
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,433
You have no idea
what you're missing.

200
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,370
Read, each card carefully.

201
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,676
"Fred specialized in the job

202
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,012
of making very quaint wax toys."

203
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,079
Next card.

204
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:34,320
"Five wine experts
jokingly quizzed

205
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:36,155
- "sample Chablis."
- Next.

206
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:38,658
"Six big devils from Japan

207
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,661
quickly forgot how to waltz."

208
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:44,096
Time for new pangrams, mate.

209
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,633
We're ready.

210
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,671
You know the drill, Howard.

211
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:54,674
I'm going to ask questions.

212
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:57,410
Starting back at the embassy.

213
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,447
The hour you had with Emily...

214
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:03,049
What did you two discuss
after I left?

215
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,857
I don't remember.

216
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:13,392
Not in the mood
to cook up a story?

217
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:16,596
I just don't remember.

218
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,635
Before she and I left,

219
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,904
you told her to light a candle
at St. Christopher's.

220
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,406
It was a coded exchange.
What did it mean?

221
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:28,975
I don't know.

222
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,647
May I have a word
with you, please?

223
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,794
Everything's steady.

224
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:49,729
Not even a pupillary response.

225
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:52,298
His defenses are getting better.

226
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:54,501
Best he's ever been.

227
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,420
I can't keep giving handouts.

228
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:17,824
No. I can pay.

229
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:25,164
Here. For the other day.

230
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,236
Thank you for being kind.

231
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,776
Yo, an espresso.

232
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,478
Do you know where that is?

233
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,214
Yeah.

234
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,051
It's a beach in Croatia.

235
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,319
Do you like it? I took it.

236
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,523
I like it.

237
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,993
Thank you. I'm Greta.

238
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,664
Nadia.

239
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:59,165
You're new to the city?

240
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,100
Yes.

241
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,703
Cash like that, you can go
to any restaurant.

242
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:05,972
Coffee is good here.

243
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:09,776
No, it's not.

244
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:14,647
What do you do
while you're here?

245
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:18,084
Nothing. Just work.

246
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:21,020
And what do you do for fun?

247
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:28,060
Well, if you like to hang out,
there's this allday party.

248
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:32,932
You should check it out.
It's fun.

249
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,081
Is your name Lamar Jung?

250
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,186
Sorry, do we know each other?

251
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,123
I was a colleague
of an old friend of yours.

252
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,792
Walter Atwood.

253
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,994
He was a director at my office.

254
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:05,397
You knew Walter.

255
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,667
Can we talk?

256
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,637
Please, come in.

257
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:17,744
I don't recall you being
at Walter's funeral.

258
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:20,346
He was private,
as a married man.

259
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,083
How well did you know him?

260
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:25,952
Well enough to know.

261
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:29,155
Well, at least we can
dispel with the pretense.

262
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,090
You know, you're the first
of his colleagues

263
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,258
who's ever come to me.

264
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:35,194
Five years after he died.

265
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:37,163
Why wait until now?

266
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:41,668
He was 49 years old
and died of a heart attack.

267
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,203
- Right?
- Yes.

268
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:47,006
The stress of that job.

269
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,408
I used to tell him
he needed to slow down.

270
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:53,345
Do you remember anything
he was troubled by back then?

271
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,348
It's been years. I mean...

272
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,953
The usual pressures...
He used to complain

273
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,089
he was being pushed out
of his position.

274
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:08,194
Paranoia.

275
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,730
He was always inferring
he was being watched.

276
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,465
- Watched?
- Yeah.

277
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:17,003
I just thought he was stressed.

278
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,376
Do you remember
when you last saw him?

279
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:32,018
I was supposed to see him
that day, Hotel Concorde.

280
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:34,821
I was...

281
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:37,957
sitting in that room, waiting.

282
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:44,864
Walter was always
the one to call.

283
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,799
That was the arrangement.

284
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,336
I didn't find out
until the obituary, days later.

285
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:54,206
Until then, I just thought
it was his way of ending things.

286
00:27:58,945 --> 00:28:02,214
Are you saying we should be
suspicious about Walter's death?

287
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,717
No.

288
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,786
I'm just tying up loose ends.

289
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:27,506
I don't know how to do this.

290
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,742
I know you give him
these numbers

291
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:33,179
so he can contact you
when he's in trouble.

292
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:37,416
I think you should come over.

293
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:19,859
Thank you
for letting me come in today.

294
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:23,095
I realize you've been
talking to Ian, but...

295
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,264
I thought you should
hear it from me.

296
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,401
I confess that,

297
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:33,739
I have been having some
personal difficulties lately.

298
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,908
Yeah. I know.

299
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:40,379
And, recently,
it's been getting worse.

300
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:45,284
So, what am I supposed
to say here, Emily?

301
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,454
I mean, you've been
with the department how long?

302
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:50,589
You're an institution.

303
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:52,591
And you do all of this
with impunity,

304
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:54,593
going over my head
whenever you want.

305
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:57,263
Yes, I'm very sorry about that.

306
00:29:57,363 --> 00:30:00,032
So, you tell me, Emily,
how am I supposed to react?

307
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,903
Well, you did mention
the possibility

308
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,939
of my having some time off
to get my life in order,

309
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,075
and I think you're right.

310
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,447
Take whatever time you need.

311
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:16,983
Thank you.

312
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,957
How did that go?

313
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:29,228
Well, should keep Personnel
off my ass for a little bit.

314
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,363
You look like
you had a rough night.

315
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:32,965
These boys in Records,

316
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,767
with their posturing
and their competitive drinking.

317
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:38,670
Could barely hide
their erections.

318
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,640
And did you dig
as deep as you could?

319
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,542
To the very bottom.

320
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:44,877
We closed the bar.

321
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:46,212
My condolences.

322
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:48,714
Look, that address in Potsdam,

323
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,849
none of them has ever
seen or heard of it.

324
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,819
State records say
it's privately owned.

325
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,122
Not by us.

326
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:59,025
Sorry. Wish I could've found
something better.

327
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,327
Nothing's something.

328
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:05,031
By the way, I saw Ian
coming through this morning.

329
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:06,765
He had your ex with him.

330
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,534
He was heading into Oversight.

331
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:13,639
What's your trick, Howard?

332
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:17,676
Lying like you do,
so comfortably.

333
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:19,011
My trick?

334
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,982
Maybe I just really don't kno.

335
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,417
You've dragged Emily
into a mess.

336
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,553
First, it was
that rendition bullshit.

337
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:29,455
Nearly got her killed.

338
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,823
And now this.

339
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:36,828
The address you got from Edgar,
what are you two looking for?

340
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:39,198
I'll tell you
what I'm looking for.

341
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,400
How 'bout
a damn good explanation

342
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,803
why I'm professionally obligated
to tell you anything,

343
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,338
other than "fuck off"?

344
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:49,441
Look, what you do over there
is not my purview.

345
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:52,678
Section Two, fine.

346
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:55,681
But this, here, this is my turf.

347
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:57,316
Now, what am I missing,
you fuck?

348
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,655
Boy, she really has a type,
doesn't she?

349
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,958
- You think this is funny?
- Well, I mean, look at it.

350
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:08,127
A few years ago, she leaves me,

351
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:10,662
a colossal asshole,
by all accounts.

352
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,532
She's free from the worst
husband anyone can conjure.

353
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:16,635
And what does she do? She runs
off with a guy like you.

354
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:18,204
A guy like me?

355
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:20,072
Yeah, the whole
tough guy routine.

356
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:21,740
It's another version
of the same thing.

357
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,609
Fuck you.

358
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,944
Hit a nerve, did I?

359
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,649
You actually think
we have something in common?

360
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:34,953
You, always fleeing this life
for the promise of another.

361
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:37,089
You think we're alike?

362
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,491
I'm a pretty good judge.

363
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,731
Then where were you, Howard?

364
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:50,569
Where were you years ago,
when she was at her worst,

365
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:52,471
bottoming out on detox?

366
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:56,808
Where the hell were you then,
if we're so alike?

367
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,378
I was there.

368
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:05,551
Sat by her bedside,
reading to her every night.

369
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:09,355
When everyone else in her life
had given up on her,

370
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:11,390
I was there.

371
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:16,495
You've not one inkling
of what it was like

372
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,996
for her and I.

373
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:20,832
You couldn't begin
to understand.

374
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:24,570
Now, take some responsibility
for once in your fucking life.

375
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,672
- I'm trying to.
- Good.

376
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:27,873
Now, what's this address?

377
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:29,275
You're just wasting time.

378
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,452
You're gonna get her killed.

379
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:32,378
I would never let that happen!

380
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:43,255
Do you still love
your exwife, Howard?

381
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,164
Emily, you can't go in there.
Ridiculous!

382
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:54,666
- Turn this thing off.
- No! Please be careful with that.

383
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:57,736
Outside now, please.

384
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,175
Have you completely
taken leave of your senses?

385
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,943
Just trying to get
a few things straight.

386
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,778
You bring him in here,
give him a lie exam

387
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,315
- in front of the whole Office?
- You're defending him now?

388
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:12,251
If you have a question,
you come to me.

389
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:13,619
I did.

390
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,387
At the hospital.

391
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:17,989
You told me you would
lay low for a while,

392
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,692
that we'd do
this thing together.

393
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,194
That's what we agreed.

394
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:25,331
What's changed
between then and now?

395
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:29,601
He's helping me
with my investigation.

396
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:32,013
- Are you fucking serious?
- You see? I tell you the truth,

397
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,572
and then you shut me down.

398
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,809
Let me in, Em.

399
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:42,181
I'm yours first.

400
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:45,417
What's the address?

401
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,193
It's a house in Potsdam.

402
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:58,029
Doesn't belong to the Office,
at least not officially.

403
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,065
Edgar is carrying orders

404
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:03,969
between that house
and the embassy over there.

405
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,705
Max, call your brother.

406
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,106
Get him to bring some mates.

407
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:09,875
We're going to Potsdam.

408
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,477
Him, too.

409
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,411
I want to order
the lunch special.

410
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:48,614
And I'd like it delivered.

411
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,932
Yes?

412
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,767
Have I reached the dry cleaners?

413
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:12,137
No. This has never been
the dry cleaners.

414
00:36:12,238 --> 00:36:14,206
I beg your pardon.

415
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:16,642
I must've dialed
the wrong number.

416
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,731
Hi.

417
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:18,637
Are you okay?

418
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:24,476
You don't normally do
this kind of thing, do you?

419
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,681
I don't like it.

420
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:35,387
Do you mind if I... if I ask
what happened to your...?

421
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:43,595
Sorry.

422
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:51,470
I was with someone, too.

423
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,271
She used to hurt me.

424
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,809
That's a long time ago.

425
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:04,149
What did you do?

426
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,851
Run.

427
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,285
Came here.

428
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:08,987
New city, new life.

429
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:12,057
Fuck her, right?

430
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,992
Lots of people run like that.

431
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,827
It's normal.

432
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:25,504
Can I?

433
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,167
You took all of these?

434
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,869
Yeah.

435
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:01,540
It's a hobby.

436
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:09,615
I like to travel.

437
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,823
I think I would like to travel.

438
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:27,158
Stay.

439
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:28,086
It's okay. Sleep.

440
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:35,226
Nadia.

441
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:17,168
He left this for you.

442
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,449
Why did they do that to him...

443
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,920
Remove his fingers, his teeth?

444
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:39,357
They do that so the police
can't identify the body.

445
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:42,127
But they have his name.

446
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:45,096
Not his real name.

447
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:53,038
He talked to me, you know.

448
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:55,540
He told me what you are.

449
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:57,676
Spies.

450
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:02,047
You work for Russia?

451
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:07,485
The United States?

452
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,989
It's better that you don't know.

453
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:17,663
You're alive because he kept you
far enough away from all this.

454
00:43:17,763 --> 00:43:21,266
Then why do you help me?

455
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,270
Because he was my friend.

456
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,911
Listen, you need to call
the police.

457
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:34,913
Tell them you found him
that way.

458
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:39,084
Don't tell them about the money.

459
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:41,319
Okay, put this away.

460
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,694
I don't even know who he was.

461
00:43:48,794 --> 00:43:51,730
Did you love him?

462
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,564
It was a lie.

463
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:56,067
No.

464
00:43:58,036 --> 00:44:02,140
My wife... kept things from me.

465
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,810
Secrets.

466
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:09,314
When I found out, I...

467
00:44:15,754 --> 00:44:18,656
You want my advice?

468
00:44:18,757 --> 00:44:22,060
If you loved him, truly...

469
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,397
you have to love the lie.

470
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:36,742
I'm sorry to have to
ask you this right now.

471
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:40,145
Did you see anything,
in the last two or three days,

472
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:41,880
unusual?

473
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,583
Anyone you didn't recognize
talking to him?

474
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,354
I need to find out who did this.

475
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,161
You were the only one
who talked to him.

476
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:02,200
And that handsome young man
you came here with.

477
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:25,456
What the hell are...

478
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,993
Who the fuck is this?

479
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,035
- What the fuck are you doing?!
- Go!

480
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:40,782
- How many of these are there?
- What are you talking about?

481
00:45:40,806 --> 00:45:42,716
The hookers... what, do you
fucking keep a rotation?

482
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,142
No. How...?

483
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,522
Do you talk about work
with them?

484
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,696
Of course I don't talk about

485
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,379
fucking work with them, Howard.

486
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:51,616
How stupid do you think I am?
What is this about?

487
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:54,820
- Sit down.
- Howard!

488
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,022
Sit the fuck down!

489
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:02,961
The butcher...
My friend... is dead.

490
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:05,897
Now, I have gone
to great lengths

491
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:07,632
to cultivate my network
on this side,

492
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:09,367
to keep them safe.

493
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:10,936
I do not expose them.

494
00:46:11,036 --> 00:46:13,138
You and I were the only ones
who went to see him.

495
00:46:13,238 --> 00:46:14,105
Okay, Howard,
you don't think that I...

496
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:15,673
I'll tell you
what I fucking think.

497
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,742
I think you better
dig hard and fucking fast

498
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:19,410
to find this mole.

499
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,613
Because whoever is getting
information from your floor,

500
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,282
they're getting it from you.

501
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:27,953
Do your fucking job.

502
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,762
What the hell?

503
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,664
Do you see that?

504
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:48,866
You sure this is
the right address?

505
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,301
Something's wrong.

506
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:52,303
Max.

507
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,344
I hear you visited our daughter.

508
00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:05,750
Stay here.

509
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:09,054
See if you can find that low
profile we were talking about.

510
00:48:10,956 --> 00:48:13,091
Would he go?

511
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,135
Ian, give me a gun.

512
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:03,874
Em, what is this?

513
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:05,310
I don't know.

514
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:19,090
Darling, are you home?

515
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,691
Just putting her to bed.

516
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,911
I've got some work to finish
before the guests arrive.

517
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,195
I'll be in the study.

518
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:38,543
Come in.

519
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:47,385
Sit.

520
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,620
We need to speak.

521
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,723
I visited an old friend
of Walter Atwood's today.

522
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,925
You remember Walter?

523
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:57,995
Yeah, former deputy director.
He died.

524
00:49:58,096 --> 00:50:01,466
This friend, Lamar Jung,
was his lover.

525
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:04,969
Yeah, Atwood kept it
from friends and family.

526
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,280
I remember something
about him coming out,

527
00:50:06,304 --> 00:50:08,406
after the heart attack.

528
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,775
What?

529
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:13,178
Alice was right. There's a mole.

530
00:50:13,278 --> 00:50:15,880
And it's worse than we though.

531
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:35,032
According to his lover,

532
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:36,767
Atwood felt
he was being followed.

533
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,003
Weeks before his death.

534
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:42,673
Atwood died of a heart attack.
Natural causes.

535
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:44,109
It's impossible to induce that

536
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:45,610
without putting up
warning signs.

537
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,912
Not impossible.

538
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:51,216
They killed one of ours
to make room for one of theirs.

539
00:50:51,316 --> 00:50:53,050
And we missed it all this time.

540
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,324
You do realize who replaced him?

541
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:02,627
He's the perfect spy.

542
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,929
Wellconnected.

543
00:51:05,029 --> 00:51:07,698
Married, smart.

544
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:10,568
Protected by family up high.

545
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:13,998
It's Quayle.

546
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:16,234
It's been him all this time.

547
00:52:22,106 --> 00:52:24,141
So, what are we gonna do
about him?

548
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:15,626
How was your day, birthday boy?

549
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:17,695
It was fine.

550
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:23,133
- Something wrong?
- No, no.

551
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:24,902
I'm just, I'm jjust exhausted.

552
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:26,471
Right.

553
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:28,273
Well, you have
a long night ahead.

554
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:30,575
Do you mind getting the steak
out of the oven?

555
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:33,711
I've asked people to start
showing up at 8:00.

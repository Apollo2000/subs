1
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:21,489
They want to bring over our
guests earlier than expected.

2
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,457
She hasn't removed
the targets yet.

3
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,063
They're sending agents

4
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,363
to replace their counterparts.

5
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:31,832
Tell me something

6
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,101
about yourself.

7
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,303
There's not much to know.

8
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:41,485
You need to find
your friend from the lie exam.

9
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,611
- Kaspar?
- He's the only person

10
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,978
who knew we were on our way.

11
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,181
I want to order
the lunch special.

12
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,882
And I'd like it delivered.

13
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,119
You can't keep me here
forever. Sooner or later,

14
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,753
you're gonna
have to do something.

15
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,773
I know it looks like
all the fingers point at me,

16
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,757
but it's not me.

17
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,259
It's Howard Silk.

18
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:03,531
You willingly
let her deceive you.

19
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,767
I didn't know she was married.
She's human.

20
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,569
She made mistakes.

21
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,272
She's a fucking fraud,
just like my wife.

22
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,607
I guess we have
nothing left to say.

23
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,770
These fucking hospitals.

24
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,141
Greet you with a smile,
but take a number, have a seat.

25
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,281
What are you in for?

26
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,784
My wife was in an accident.

27
00:01:56,884 --> 00:02:00,454
Is she... all right?

28
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:01,989
I don't know.

29
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,824
She's in surgery.

30
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,796
II can't get
any information yet.

31
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,836
I'm Andrei.

32
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,838
Howard.

33
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,551
It's so, so normal here.

34
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,353
You know?

35
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:38,426
Your whole life
hangs in the balance.

36
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,266
Does bring life
into focus, though.

37
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,801
What matters and what doesn't.

38
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,507
What matters to me is her.

39
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,738
Yeah.

40
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,573
- Are you at home?
- Yeah.

41
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,107
Get out. They're coming to you.

42
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,676
- Who?
- Aldrich's men.

43
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,911
Get over to my house.
I'll explain when I see you,

44
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,647
but you need to leave.

45
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,403
I want him found.

46
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,556
I'm looking for
one of my lie exam men.

47
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:58,659
Seems he's been
informing for you lately.

48
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,029
Goes by the name of Kaspar.

49
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,197
Sound familiar?

50
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,133
Rings a bell.

51
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,301
I couldn't find him at his flat.

52
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:12,105
Thought you might know
where he disappeared to.

53
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:17,911
How was your visit to Potsdam?

54
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,519
Here's how
this is gonna play out.

55
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,756
I either end your wretched
little life right now,

56
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:31,024
or I bring you into Management
for you to answer

57
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,326
for whatever the hell it is
you're caught up in,

58
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,863
and they deal with you
accordingly.

59
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,998
What's it gonna be?

60
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:50,911
I don't know.

61
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,814
Which would you prefer?

62
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,190
Fuck you.

63
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,226
Don't be so touchy, dear boy.

64
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,563
Actually, I'm glad
you came to see me.

65
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,799
You know, there's something
I wanted to ask you about.

66
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:15,503
If this is how you want it
to end, go ahead.

67
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:18,305
It involves that woman
in your life,

68
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:22,009
and the man
you think is Howard Silk.

69
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:26,680
Come now.

70
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,382
Man of your intelligence
had to know the truth.

71
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:32,586
That one is nothing
like his other.

72
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,589
Too loyal to her.

73
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,362
You did know.

74
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,999
Why did you let it
go on so long?

75
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,870
You were waiting?

76
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,742
How romantic.

77
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:58,478
You were hoping she would
come to you with the truth.

78
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,986
Well, you might want to act on
this sooner rather than later.

79
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:09,623
God knows what kind of
Howard Silk he might turn into

80
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,625
the longer he hangs around.

81
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,528
Good luck with Kaspar.

82
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:17,264
Hope you get to him before I do.

83
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,681
Ja, hallo?

84
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,515
Will you be joining us
for supper?

85
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,218
Tea is oolong.

86
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,187
We're out of green.

87
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,324
Whose house?

88
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,993
Roderick's.

89
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:29,496
Make sure your people are there.

90
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,733
I think they're watching me.

91
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,735
Hold up your end of the promise.

92
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:43,276
Tea is oolong.

93
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,644
We're out of green.

94
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,546
Whose house?

95
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,281
Roderick's.

96
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,751
Make sure your people are there.

97
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,519
I think they're watching me.

98
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,587
What the hell is an oolong?

99
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,123
- It's a tea.
- A tea?

100
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:59,559
Maybe it's a crypt
for dead drops.

101
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,394
Each type's a different address.

102
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,430
We'll never crack that.

103
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,232
It's not for dead drops.

104
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:09,770
It's a crypt that
the old network used to use.

105
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,205
"Tea" is time of day.
"Oolong" is 1100 hours.

106
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,843
Right.
And "Roderick" is a subway exit.

107
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:17,444
Fuck, I can't remember which.

108
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,479
Potsdamer Platz.

109
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,948
It's an exfiltration.

110
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:24,284
Pope is gonna
help him disappear.

111
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,054
Disappear or "disappear"?

112
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,389
Clearly,
Pope's not comfortable with

113
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,424
how much he knows.

114
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,293
What do you think?

115
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:36,363
Potsdamer Platz it is.

116
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,634
But not him.

117
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,636
This is Housekeeping business.

118
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,473
I'm sick and tired
of having a tagalong.

119
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,417
He's right.

120
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,953
Wait here for us.

121
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,944
What do you think?

122
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,746
It's nice.

123
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,682
Try it on.

124
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,451
- For me?
- Yeah. Would be fun.

125
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,521
I pick out something for you,
you pick out something for me.

126
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,157
Come on. What do you like?

127
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,260
I don't know.

128
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,096
It doesn't have to be my style.

129
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:31,198
That's the fun of it.

130
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,435
I don't know.

131
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,906
You're hopeless.

132
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,442
It's like you grew up
on a different planet.

133
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,983
Nadia?

134
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,955
I don't understand.

135
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:58,758
Is this some kind of an act?

136
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:01,928
What happened to you?

137
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:05,065
I'm not sure who you think I am.

138
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,969
Are you fucking serious
right now?

139
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,245
Fuck you.

140
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,846
Really.

141
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,015
Whatever this is, fuck you.

142
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,121
What was that?

143
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,157
I don't know her.

144
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,692
Yeah, but she knew you.

145
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,665
It's all right to have a past,

146
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:41,734
but I think we should be honest
with each other about it.

147
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,738
She was mistaken.

148
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,243
I don't know her.

149
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,501
The next train arrives at 10:58.

150
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,536
That'll be him.

151
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,371
Wait for it.

152
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,143
As soon as we have Kaspar,

153
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,912
we need to be fast
in getting him out of the open.

154
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,681
I don't trust that Pope won't
try something desperate.

155
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,693
I never said thank you...

156
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,230
for helping yesterday.

157
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,736
I know it's complicated
when it comes to him.

158
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:54,541
Thank you for understanding
why I had to work with him.

159
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:11,158
You can always trust me.

160
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,460
You know that.

161
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:18,331
I would always listen.

162
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,771
I know.

163
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,729
There he is.

164
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,802
Something's wrong.

165
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,373
He knows.

166
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:23,683
Where?

167
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:34,761
Kaspar.

168
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,814
You good?

169
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,082
Max is hurt.

170
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,950
Go back.

171
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,655
Why did you do that?

172
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,457
I just saved your life.

173
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:06,826
Kaspar, listen to me, these
people are not your friends.

174
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:10,763
You have no idea!

175
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:13,099
Come with us.

176
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:15,067
I can keep you safe. They won't.

177
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,405
You don't understand.

178
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,540
That was my only chance.

179
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:24,977
You just took my only chance!

180
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,254
I know what these people can do.

181
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,848
You... you've seen it, too.

182
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,552
Whatever they've offered you,

183
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:35,788
you're more important
to them dead.

184
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,424
Do you hear me?

185
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,192
Whatever it is...

186
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,562
I can help you.

187
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,691
Your wife and kid home?

188
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,791
No.

189
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,226
How long have they been here?

190
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,995
All night.

191
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:26,172
What the hell happened, Peter?

192
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:27,807
Aldrich came over last night,

193
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,342
started asking questions
about you.

194
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,083
It's pretty safe to say
that you're blown.

195
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:34,380
Me... II don't know
what he knows about me yet.

196
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:36,649
Fuck.

197
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,519
This could not happen
at a worse fucking time.

198
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:42,689
Did you hear anything
from the Interface room?

199
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,423
Yeah, three known operatives
have crossed

200
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:46,659
in the last couple of days.

201
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,328
At least one of their others
works in your office.

202
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,363
They're placing people inside?

203
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:53,900
I think it's time
we talked to your wife.

204
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,602
Why?

205
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:57,570
Peter, we're out of
options here.

206
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,239
Something big is about to go
down, and she knows about it.

207
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,416
No, no, no.
You were right, Howard.

208
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,618
II need to keep
playing the game.

209
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:05,077
There's no game, Peter.
It's game over.

210
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,114
I mean, if I'm blown, we're...

211
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:09,949
What the fuck...?

212
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:14,587
Gun.

213
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,857
Okay, okay.

214
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,527
Take it easy.

215
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:28,535
- You told Aldrich.
- He came to me.

216
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,937
- I had to give him something.
- Right.

217
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:32,572
Then you get me
out of the apartment

218
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,340
so they don't capture me,
and now what?

219
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,842
You're gonna kill me
in selfdefense?

220
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,620
And you think that's gonna
keep your secret safe?

221
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,084
Peter, II got to tell you,
this is...

222
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:40,713
- this is a bad fucking plan.
- Shut up!

223
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,783
Listen, all right? Take it easy.

224
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,685
This doesn't buy you much time.

225
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:48,263
Even Aldrich is gonna figure out
that I'm not the one responsible

226
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:52,258
for five years of leaks
from your department.

227
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:53,726
Okay? It's gonna
come back to you.

228
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,303
Yeah, well, I've got time
to figure that out.

229
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,263
We got time right now...

230
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,098
You don't have any fucking time!

231
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,938
Big fucking mistake.

232
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,314
How long have you been

233
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:17,049
working for Pope?

234
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,155
How long?

235
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,258
Three years now.

236
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,395
He wanted to know
vulnerabilities

237
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:31,898
of certain people
within the Office.

238
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:34,533
Could they be coerced and how.

239
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,102
And you shared recordings?

240
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:38,104
Sometimes.

241
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:43,209
- Damn it.
- Help us, Kaspar.

242
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,377
We need to understand
what these people are

243
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,413
preparing to do.

244
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:48,924
Why would they share
anything with me?

245
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:50,349
The School.

246
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:51,660
All those kids
they were teaching.

247
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:53,319
That is years of legwork.

248
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:55,121
You must have heard something.

249
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,456
What is this?

250
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,926
Is this your fucking
blood money?

251
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:03,129
Look, just... be careful.

252
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,731
Fuck you!

253
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:07,033
Those children died
because you made

254
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:10,002
- a fucking phone call!
- No, no, no! No, no!

255
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:18,945
What the hell?

256
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,916
You're a sad kind of bastard.

257
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,233
Is this your child?

258
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,072
Yes.

259
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:47,807
My son.

260
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:50,943
How old?

261
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,646
Ten.

262
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,887
He would have been ten.

263
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:07,994
Alexander Pope bribed you

264
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:11,097
with safe passage;
Is that what went on?

265
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:15,067
Some kind of switch out?

266
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:18,070
He promised you
you could visit the other side

267
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,538
and see your...

268
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,241
living son?

269
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,415
I can't protect you, Kaspar,

270
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:32,084
if you don't tell me
who they are.

271
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:35,421
Protect me?

272
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:36,631
Don't you understand
what they do

273
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,990
to anyone who gets in their way?

274
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,927
The other you...
She tried, you know?

275
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,262
Reached out to one of ours,
months ago.

276
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,297
A warning
that people were coming over.

277
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,300
I took it to Pope.
You know what he did?

278
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,303
Had her run down, car accident.

279
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,372
That's how far his reach goes!

280
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,041
That accident... that was Pope?!

281
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,744
That's why she's in
the hospital? Pope and you?!

282
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:59,979
You trade human lives
for some false hope

283
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,814
of a second chance?! What...?

284
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,783
That is not your world
over there!

285
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:06,118
That little boy over there
is not yours!

286
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,354
- Do you understand?!
- Howard, stop!

287
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:23,102
I'll tell you
who's been working for him.

288
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,940
Everyone I know.

289
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,118
What happened?

290
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,129
What do you think happened?
He broke into my fucking house

291
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,955
while your men were
supposed to be watching.

292
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,892
And you said, last night,
if I give you the name,

293
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:48,761
you would protect me.

294
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,109
Okay.

295
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:07,679
Aldrich.

296
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,616
Find him.

297
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,251
Do whatever you have to do.

298
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:42,648
Yeah?

299
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:43,950
Anything at the house?

300
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,518
Nothing. He swept it clean.

301
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,087
What happened over there?

302
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:49,922
He came to Quayle, but got away.

303
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:51,523
This is bullshit, Aldrich.

304
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,535
Quayle's not telling us
something. Let's bring him in.

305
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,560
Not yet.

306
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,896
Silk can't possibly be Shadow.

307
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:58,530
Neither is Quayle.

308
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,042
There's someone else
he's protecting.

309
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:02,368
I think Howard Silk
knows who it is.

310
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:04,370
Find him.

311
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,125
Thought I told you
to keep her quiet.

312
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,860
How am I expected
to do anything?

313
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,963
I can't even pick her up.

314
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,040
Peter, please.

315
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:58,457
This is really bad.

316
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:01,560
You know that, right?

317
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,364
He can't be allowed
out there like this.

318
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,733
If they catch him,
and with his last dying breath,

319
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,701
he says my name, we're done.

320
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,070
What the...?

321
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:15,074
- Peter, for fuck's sake!
- Listen to me.

322
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:18,877
All right, he told me that three
people have just come over.

323
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:20,646
And you know about this?

324
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,048
From where?

325
00:31:22,148 --> 00:31:25,918
From your fucking side, Clare.

326
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,221
Of course you know about it.

327
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,632
You arranged their passage,
didn't you?

328
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,500
You know, you know exactly
what they're gonna do.

329
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,094
If you're complicit in this,
your life will be in danger.

330
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:38,297
Clare, what the fuck do you
think is happening right now?

331
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:44,536
I know someone who can
take care of Howard Silk for us.

332
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,073
Baldwin, my assassin.

333
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,111
No, no.

334
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:54,313
Peter, please. Stop!

335
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,315
Fuck!

336
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:07,059
Howard, what are you doing?

337
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,028
You're gonna do me a favor.

338
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:12,231
You might not see me again.

339
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:18,270
Gonna keep this up here;
You're not gonna look at it.

340
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,006
You're gonna give it
back to Emily

341
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:22,174
when she comes out
of the hospital.

342
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,210
Does this make me
some kind of accessory?

343
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,278
It makes you a man
who's doing the right thing

344
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:29,081
instead of fucking
another man's wife.

345
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:32,818
Why trust me?

346
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,891
Only because she did.

347
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:41,994
Howard?

348
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,598
She never would've left you.

349
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,568
I asked her once, she said no.

350
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,371
I wanted you to know that.

351
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,111
I don't know why I let this
friendship go on like it did.

352
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:02,081
The Go game,
the bullshit charade.

353
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,583
Maybe it was disingenuous.

354
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:10,356
I just saw you
in that waiting room,

355
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:13,125
and you looked like the
loneliest man I'd ever seen.

356
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:17,296
And I felt bad for you.

357
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,737
Whatever this is,
you're not alone, you know that.

358
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,501
Where the fuck have you been?

359
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:57,503
Tell me you've eliminated
the targets.

360
00:33:57,603 --> 00:33:59,771
All but the woman
in the hospital.

361
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,673
She's still guarded.

362
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,242
Go back to her later.

363
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:04,910
There's something else
I need you to do.

364
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,046
I'll find you the money.

365
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:09,715
I'll pay you double.

366
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:13,185
But Howard Silk...
The one here is from our side.

367
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,454
He needs to be eliminated.

368
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:23,129
Another hundred thousand
for Silk and his wife.

369
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,565
I'll get it for you.

370
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,402
I'll be in touch.

371
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:54,993
Hello.

372
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,828
Triple bypass surgery.

373
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,330
WhWhat?

374
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,432
Only time I've missed work
in the last ten years.

375
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,268
Please tell me
that you're forwarding

376
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:04,035
your calls to your death bed,

377
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:06,572
and that's why
you're not at work today.

378
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:08,807
No, it's... it's just this fflu.

379
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:12,278
II don't want
to spread it around.

380
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:14,180
Upstairs wants a joint briefig

381
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,383
on that deal that went to shit.

382
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:20,018
Can we... can we reschedule?

383
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,487
With the Fourth Floor?

384
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,459
I can't. I'm sorry.

385
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:31,197
Peter, I don't know what's
been going on with you lately.

386
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,499
That little show
you put on the other night?

387
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,377
I get it. Marriage isn't
perfect, I understand that.

388
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:37,102
But do yourself a favor.

389
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:39,805
Get your life in order
and get your ass in here.

390
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:41,640
Yes, sir.

391
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,675
Good choice.

392
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,017
Children, you know?

393
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:54,486
Can you take this
down the hall, please?

394
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,490
- Right away.
- Thank you.

395
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,266
What are you doing?

396
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:10,035
Going to work.

397
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:11,337
Peter, wait.

398
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:12,738
This is what I do.

399
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,007
Your father calls, I answer.

400
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,244
Not today.

401
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,750
I can't tell you why.

402
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,619
Please, just...

403
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,589
don't go in today.

404
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,906
No.

405
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:10,729
What am I to you?

406
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:14,466
Am I a mark?

407
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,636
Or am I actually your husband?

408
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:21,440
Just... just make up
your fucking mind.

409
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:34,753
When I first met you,
I despised you.

410
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,955
The other girls,

411
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:40,659
the lying, bullshit wedding.

412
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,466
But I went through with it.

413
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:49,535
'Cause that's what I do.

414
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:53,204
I spent my whole life

415
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:56,007
becoming this perfect version
of someone else.

416
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:01,046
The stupid girl
they wanted me to be.

417
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:10,389
I've never had anything
of my own.

418
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:15,494
Until she was born.

419
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:21,232
Spencer was mine.

420
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:24,570
Not hers or theirs.

421
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:28,239
For the first time in my life,

422
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,042
I had something
that belonged to only me.

423
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:45,691
Peter, I know our marriage has
been one giant, fuckedup sham,

424
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:49,728
but... you're the only one
who knows me.

425
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,332
Both sides of who I am.

426
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,186
Days like these
I always forget to eat.

427
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,723
No, thank you.

428
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:21,259
My Emily always has gummy beas

429
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,694
in her purse.

430
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:25,797
Otherwise, she can get a bit...

431
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,166
Lightheaded.

432
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:31,537
Well, I was gonna say...
temperamental.

433
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:38,143
So strange. I look at you,
and I see a woman

434
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:40,646
that I've loved for 30 years.

435
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,952
I think about everything
that we've shared.

436
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,955
Thanksgivings...

437
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:53,091
jokes, fights.

438
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:55,961
All of it.

439
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:58,363
Then I realize...

440
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,466
you're not a part of that.

441
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,470
I don't know you.

442
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,509
What are we doing?

443
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,482
I don't know.

444
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,063
I can't be here anymore.

445
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,065
Where are you going?

446
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,203
I'm sorry. I...

447
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,207
I miss my wife.

448
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,011
I need to go home.

449
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,492
Peter, what is this?

450
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:36,094
We're going for a drive.

451
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,663
They have eyes on us.

452
00:41:37,763 --> 00:41:39,097
I don't give a fuck.

453
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,498
Where's Spencer?

454
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,668
Your mother picked her up.

455
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:21,106
Are you turning me in?

456
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:41,235
You're gonna get us killed
before we even get there.

457
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,161
I don't even know
what to say anymore, Clare.

458
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:46,898
- Stop this!
- I've been such a fucking fool.

459
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:53,004
I'm so sorry, Peter.

460
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:55,340
Maybe a part of me
does love you.

461
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:59,177
The part of you that I know.

462
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:00,979
Yeah, but that's the problem,
isn't it?

463
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,415
We only see the parts of people
that we want to see.

464
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,188
I'm such a fucking coward.

465
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,204
Peter.

466
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:28,006
Okay.

467
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:31,009
All right, Peter,
time for some bravery.

468
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:34,612
First time in your fucking life.

469
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:35,753
Peter, what are you doing?

470
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,365
He's here.

471
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:38,343
Good. You came to us.

472
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:49,014
Please tell me
that you know this is not me.

473
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:50,615
You can't be
that fucking stupid.

474
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:52,283
It's Quayle's wife.

475
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:54,319
She's the mole,
and she's not alone.

476
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:56,754
You got to check every employee
in this building.

477
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:59,124
You have multiple points
of compromise.

478
00:46:48,073 --> 00:46:49,607
My God.

479
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:52,410
Is she all right?

480
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,713
What hospital?

481
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,483
All right. I'll be right there.

482
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:01,352
Helen!

483
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:03,421
Helen! I need my car...

484
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:47,498
Aldrich...

485
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:48,799
God...

486
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,501
Fuck!

487
00:48:57,335 --> 00:48:59,470
They're trying
to get downstairs.

488
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,286
Please. Please help me.

489
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:49,386
Help me.

490
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,193
Should we get him?

491
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:04,095
No. We can't touch him now.

492
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:06,231
He's on the border.

1
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,900
The world is not a nice place, Clare.

2
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,440
She's marrying him?

3
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,340
Her father put him on the
director track in Strategy.

4
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,220
You are going to be the one
who changes everything.

5
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,640
- You have a mole.
- It's Quayle.

6
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,390
It's been him all this time.

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,500
- Cyanide, Peter.
- Take it,

8
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,120
you fucking spy! I'm
giving you a way out.

9
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,740
These are your orders.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,070
What about the personal effects?

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,480
You'll get them when
your marks are dead.

12
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,470
I finish the contracts, you pay.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,440
Are you mad? They want you dead.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,660
Do you still love your ex-wife, Howard?

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,540
Stay the fuck away from her.

16
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,450
My mother's always been difficult.

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,460
She wants what she wants.

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,360
Their mother wants her back in England.

19
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,280
You're a real fucking asshole.

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,990
We're going to Potsdam.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,470
Him, too.

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,500
The hell?

23
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,310
Yes?

24
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,510
Have I reached the dry cleaners?

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,530
No.

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,580
This has never been the dry cleaners.

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,160
I beg your pardon.

28
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,680
I must've dialed the wrong number.

29
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,760
As you can see, the district has not...

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,430
Lukas, take over, please.

31
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,190
So, the results

32
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,250
of the election were
very much the same...

33
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,690
He called for the dry cleaners.

34
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,490
And there's the election.

35
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,200
However, the issues,

36
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,440
voting districts,

37
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,100
and media coverage bore
little similarities.

38
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,790
Health Amendment Two.

39
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,770
Everyone gather your things.

40
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,840
We have a surprise today.

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,680
Aldus is going to take
you on a special trip.

42
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,700
Everyone.

43
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,980
Go to the pantry... There's a safe.

44
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,270
Combination, 40-12-31.

45
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,530
Repeat it back to me.

46
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,910
40-12-31.

47
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,520
Get the leather pouch.

48
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,400
They'll be here soon.

49
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,040
Em, what is this?

50
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,420
I don't know.

51
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,460
Get down.

52
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,730
Somebody's there!

53
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,040
Fan out.

54
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,000
Move.

55
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,290
Visitors.

56
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,500
They're here.

57
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,890
Do you have the pouch?

58
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,770
Think about all we've
accomplished over the years.

59
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,500
Think about all we still have to do.

60
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,680
Our legacy only survives

61
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,730
if we can protect this secret.

62
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,400
Get down!

63
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,310
Take cover!

64
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,920
You're leaving?

65
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,370
Help me with this.

66
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,760
What about the others?

67
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,740
Their work is finished.

68
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,460
Ours isn't.

69
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,080
Are you coming or not?

synced & corrected by PopcornAWH
www.addic7ed.com

71
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,830
Did you find anything?

72
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,980
Everything was destroyed
before we got here.

73
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,610
No paper trail, no
documents, no nothing.

74
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,940
The hell is this place?

75
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,320
I don't know.

76
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,450
We pull up here, into
a fucking firefight?

77
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,970
I thought it was a dead drop.

78
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,960
Ian, I had no idea it would be...

79
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,610
this.

80
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,140
There's something I need to show you.

81
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,620
It's from their side.

82
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,840
They're comparing timelines
between our worlds.

83
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,150
Events,

84
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,210
traditions.

85
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,550
They were teaching kids
about life over there.

86
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,680
A school.

87
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,910
Down here!

88
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,730
What's wrong?

89
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,940
Oh, dear God.

90
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,430
Charlotte?

91
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,340
Try not to sound so
disappointed, Howard.

92
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,570
Did I wake you?

93
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,410
Terribly sorry.

94
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,290
Thought I should let
you know I'm in town.

95
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,180
You're in Berlin?

96
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,470
Came in overnight.

97
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,060
I'm at the hospital.

98
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,720
Why? What's wrong?

99
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,450
Haven't they reached you yet?

100
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,040
Your wife,

101
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,720
our Emily,

102
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,440
she's woken up.

103
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,390
Come on, Spencer.

104
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,150
Come on, come on, please, please.

105
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,390
Come on. Come on.

106
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,140
- How is she?
- Doctors aren't sure

107
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,420
how much she can understand,
if anything at all.

108
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,060
They're calling it a first step.

109
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,440
First step of many, we hope.

110
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,670
Good to see you, Howard.

111
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,270
Been a long time.

112
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,760
Emily?

113
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,780
Can you hear me?

114
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,850
She's a warrior, our girl.

115
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,630
Soldiering on.

116
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,460
Even as a child, she had
that fighter's heart.

117
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,870
No, no. Keep still.

118
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,360
- Don't move.
- I don't like it.

119
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,170
Why?

120
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,180
Do you think a photograph
will steal your soul?

121
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,490
There's supposed to be peace in sleep.

122
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,540
But not yours.

123
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,140
You were restless all night.

124
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,120
Delete them.

125
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,480
You want some breakfast?

126
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,960
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

127
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,640
Must be important.

128
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,700
Tell me something about yourself.

129
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,360
There's not much to know.

130
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,190
You come to Berlin for what, a big job?

131
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,060
Maybe you're the CEO of a company?

132
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,900
Or you live out of a backpack.

133
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,910
And I just invited a
homeless person over

134
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,800
for a one-night stand.

135
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,530
But I guess it wasn't
even a one-night stand.

136
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,980
Technically, I mean.

137
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,110
Thank you.

138
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,680
What are you doing?

139
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,050
I'm calling the Office.

140
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,450
18 people are dead, and
half of those are children.

141
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,660
Yeah, and last time I spoke
through official channels,

142
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,360
I was nearly killed.

143
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,680
Until we know who our friends are,

144
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,010
I'd like to keep this between us.

145
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,900
Are you sure Alexander
Pope was behind all this?

146
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,640
Right now I'm finding it hard to believe

147
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,330
that anyone's capable of this.

148
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,030
But if we're going after Pope,

149
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,390
then we need to be really
sure of our ground.

150
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,850
Must be something they didn't destroy.

151
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,510
You okay?

152
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,250
I'm fine.

153
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,000
Maybe you should go to the
car and get some fresh air.

154
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,360
I'm fine.

155
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,730
You should see this.

156
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,670
These are reconnaissance photos.

157
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,930
They look like they're
from the other side.

158
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,630
Okay, look.

159
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,920
They're forging a visa.

160
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,740
These are customs papers

161
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,400
crossing from our side to theirs.

162
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,760
And they're using this man's.

163
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,920
What?

164
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,710
Well, that's what this place is.

165
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,820
The classrooms.

166
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,970
The children they didn't
want us to question.

167
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,530
Why else would you teach
kids about the other side?

168
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,910
They're sending agents

169
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,480
to replace their counterparts.

170
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,890
Do you still have friends in Customs?

171
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,270
In Facial Recognition.

172
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,910
See if this man went through

173
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,730
the Crossing over the past few days.

174
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,890
I'll go with him.

175
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,620
What, he can't go on his own?

176
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,220
You need to find your
friend from the lie exam.

177
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,540
Oh, Kaspar?

178
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,730
This place was already
burning when we got here.

179
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,310
He's the only person who
knew we were on our way.

180
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,950
Fuck it.

181
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,910
Check in with me if you find anything.

182
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,450
She needs to be fed.

183
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,030
I'm not gonna hurt her...
She's my daughter.

184
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,570
How long has it been?

185
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,210
Do you remember when she...

186
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,870
broke up with you?

187
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,720
Before the wedding.

188
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,240
She caught you with someone else.

189
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,140
We were gonna wait, but...

190
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,870
that precipitated a faster move.

191
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,160
I had to switch that night.

192
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,950
So what happened to her?

193
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,920
My Clare. What happened to the
woman I asked to marry me?

194
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,790
She was extracted.

195
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,810
I don't know, she was...

196
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,440
they gave her a new life,
probably on my side.

197
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,650
It's not for me to know.

198
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,420
I'm just an operative.

199
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,790
I swear I'm the woman you married.

200
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,660
I'm the mother of our child.

201
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,520
Please let me feed her.

202
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,310
Please.

203
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,670
She has your eyes, you know.

204
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,180
Shh, shh.

205
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,770
These are all positive
steps, but it's still early.

206
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,100
Every patient with a
traumatic brain injury

207
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,330
- responds differently.
- Of course.

208
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,270
It might be months before we understand

209
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,900
the full extent of her impairment.

210
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,150
These injuries,

211
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,450
motor skills tend to recover

212
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,540
much more quickly than
cognitive function.

213
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,750
What she means is, we
need to be more patient.

214
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,220
Yes. And depending on Emily's progress,

215
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,150
you might want to consider moving her to

216
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,910
specialized rehabilitation.

217
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,890
I'd be very happy to offer

218
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,700
some recommendations, Mrs. Burton.

219
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,230
Oh, that would be wonderful.

220
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,950
Wherever you think would
be the best place

221
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,940
- for her recovery.
- Of course.

222
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,750
Good day.

223
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,170
Thank you.

224
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,040
What the hell are you doing?

225
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,890
I'm sorry?

226
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,230
The esteemed Charlotte Burton.

227
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,780
Suddenly steadfast mother of the year?

228
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,460
I know my daughter and I

229
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,590
have had our ups and
downs over the years...

230
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,700
but I'm here now...

231
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,080
out of love.

232
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,950
I find it strange... Eric
hasn't spoken a word to me

233
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,830
since his last visit, except to tell me

234
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,590
that you refused my request
to supervise Emily's care.

235
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,520
So what did you two talk about?

236
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,100
We just got some things straight.

237
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,920
You moved her out of the old hospital?

238
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,750
Without telling us?

239
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,390
Was that out of spite?

240
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,140
No, Charlotte. Believe it or not,

241
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,540
it had nothing to do with you.

242
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:11,070
I brought her here because
it's a better hospital.

243
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,390
Huh.

244
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,030
I shall be taking an
apartment in Berlin,

245
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,600
beginning of the month.

246
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,950
Emily's recovery is gonna be... long.

247
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,160
I don't suppose you'll be able

248
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,070
to handle that aspect financially.

249
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,150
Especially in a place like this.

250
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,510
See you around.

251
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,110
You did well last night.

252
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,280
I know it's not the kind of thing

253
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:12,150
that you are accustomed to.

254
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,300
How do you do this?

255
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,410
How do... how do you...

256
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,930
how does it not get to you?

257
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,470
You find...

258
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,160
ways to cope.

259
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,050
I didn't say they were good ways.

260
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:51,490
Look, if these people really
are sending operatives

261
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,790
across the fenceline...

262
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,900
we need to make him aware.

263
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,170
Are you serious?

264
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,710
Howard's the only one we
can trust over there.

265
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,110
There are things I could
do to reach out, but...

266
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,380
your status is so much better than mine

267
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,270
in the Office right now.

268
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,820
I'm going to need you.

269
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,940
I need your help.

270
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,660
What do you need me to do?

271
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,690
You can't keep me here forever.

272
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,950
Sooner or later you're gonna
have to do something.

273
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,670
Are there others?

274
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,550
Like you?

275
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,360
I think it's better if
we didn't discuss this.

276
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,090
I don't give a fuck what you think.

277
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,090
This is an act of war.

278
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,530
Your side is declaring war.

279
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,090
My side doesn't know anything
about what's happening.

280
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,710
They wouldn't know what to
do about it if they did.

281
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,970
Do you think we're all
so blind over there?

282
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,800
The flu killed hundreds of millions.

283
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,890
My parents. Decimated Europe.

284
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,850
And all that time, your side...

285
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,010
wasn't affected.

286
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,300
What, you don't, you don't think

287
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,600
that if something like that
happened, you don't think

288
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,080
that I would know about it?

289
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,100
An operation of that size?

290
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,220
You're so naive.

291
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,050
Pretty soon,

292
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,800
people are gonna give a long, hard look

293
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,190
at this charade we call diplomacy.

294
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,450
Sooner or later
everything's gonna change.

295
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,390
I'm turning you in.

296
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,260
That would be a mistake.

297
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,870
Think about your life.

298
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,830
What will people say when they realize

299
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,420
it was your wife all along?

300
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,950
You are not my wife.

301
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,880
Letting me siphon your intelligence,

302
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,220
access your resources.

303
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,140
And what about Spencer?

304
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,090
A child born of two worlds.

305
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,030
Have you thought it through?

306
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,240
You really think they're
just gonna release her?

307
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,340
There's nothing you can do.

308
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,270
It's all underway.

309
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,420
Peter, I'm sorry for
what I've done to you.

310
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,780
I really am.

311
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,220
But I think it's time you realize

312
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,550
that we're both trapped in this.

313
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,090
You and me.

314
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,440
Together.

315
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,900
So, do you recognize

316
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,060
this man? Did you see him cross over?

317
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,260
Yes, sure.

318
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,860
A few days ago. He was part
of a diplomatic envoy.

319
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,000
Went with these two.

320
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,390
Not due back for another day.

321
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,970
What do you need with them?

322
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,860
Oh, it's not important.
Just a routine check.

323
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,470
Thank you.

324
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,040
I heard you were ill.

325
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,180
May I come in?

326
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,670
Sorry. It's a bit of a
war zone, I'm afraid.

327
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,960
We had a...

328
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,400
party, uh, last night.

329
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,010
You know you could
have called, you know?

330
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,590
I thought it was safer not to.

331
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,170
Why? What-What-What-What's happening?

332
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,720
I picked up a taste for this years ago.

333
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,380
Russian recipe.

334
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,690
Three things those bastards left us

335
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,890
poetry,

336
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,310
counterintelligence and soup.

337
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,540
Mmm.

338
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,360
So, is there any news on the mole?

339
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,900
On-on Sha-Shadow?

340
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,710
What do you think?

341
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,250
About the soup.

342
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,900
Yeah, no.

343
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,160
It's-it's really nice. Thank you.

344
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,610
My concern with these molehunts

345
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,100
is that they turn people
against each other.

346
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,840
When there's fear of trust,

347
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:36,390
everyone's worried about
self-preservation.

348
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,770
Yeah, well, I mean, something
has to be done though,

349
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,260
- doesn't it?
- Yeah.

350
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,720
You know, I've been thinking recently

351
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,580
about my other.

352
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,870
Me on the other side.

353
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,290
I knew him.

354
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,780
You... you knew him personally?

355
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,080
Yeah.

356
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,520
We played chess.

357
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,750
Across the cable. We
made moves through code.

358
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,720
I had a board in my
office, board in his.

359
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,550
- You're kidding.
- No.

360
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,310
It was like Kasparov playing himself.

361
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,340
Always ended in a stalemate.

362
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,690
Neither of us made any mistakes.

363
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,650
Other people in our trade

364
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,010
usually are sloppy, like artists.

365
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,340
It's a problem.

366
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,400
Too many flaws.

367
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,250
But never us.

368
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,760
So I thought.

369
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,380
I-I planted...

370
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,020
an operative

371
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,960
on the other side.

372
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,710
I picked her because I knew
she had certain qualities

373
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,800
that he would appreciate.

374
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,470
And, um, one day

375
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,450
she came back with a message

376
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,440
that he'd fallen in love.

377
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,380
And that he wanted to defect for her.

378
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,870
Your other wanted to come
over and work for us?

379
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,730
Would have been a coup.

380
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:03,300
But would have ruined
me at the same time.

381
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,820
Every day they would have looked at me

382
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,790
and wondered, what would be my price?

383
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,950
So...

384
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,330
I killed her.

385
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,900
To stop him from coming.

386
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,270
From what I heard, he broke down.

387
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,720
Went mad.

388
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,440
But I survived.

389
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,150
One point or the other,

390
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,470
we all must make that choice.

391
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,850
The cause versus ourselves.

392
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,320
If you want to survive.

393
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,820
You understand me, don't you?

394
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,430
No, I'm not certain that I do, actually.

395
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,380
I think you understand exactly
what I'm talking about.

396
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,510
I won't involve the Office in this yet,

397
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,710
but I'm leaving men outside your house.

398
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,020
I'll be at the Walcot tonight.

399
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,150
10:00. Eating at the bar.

400
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,730
I hope you make the right choice.

401
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,250
Merhaba, Raash.

402
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,230
I need to get a message

403
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,390
to a mutual friend on the other side.

404
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,390
Looks a little like my ex-husband.

405
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,120
Where the fuck have you been?

406
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,520
Listen, someone from the other side

407
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,730
wants to meet with me.

408
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,360
I need you to get me into
an Interface room tonight.

409
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,120
What?

410
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,510
They do, uh, end of market reports

411
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,840
after hours all the time.

412
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,630
I need you to make sure no eyes or ears

413
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,990
are on this meeting.

414
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,750
Howard, th-th-this is not

415
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,210
some kind of straightforward request.

416
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,520
What... the s-situation here
is pretty fucking critical.

417
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,870
Look, if somebody over there
needs to speak with me

418
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,970
in a hurry, there's
nothing more important.

419
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,570
Make it happen. 8:00.

420
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,890
Getting information

421
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,550
from those panting perverts
in Records is one thing,

422
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,970
but getting your ex-husband
into an Interface room?

423
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,060
Unwatched?

424
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,880
- As always, I...
- Yeah, I know.

425
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,860
You appreciate my support.

426
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,340
One of these days you're gonna tell me

427
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,240
what this is really about.

428
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,420
- Thank you, Cara.
- Yeah.

429
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,120
I'll figure something out.

430
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,280
Have the bastard meet me tonight.

431
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,380
Each camera's outfitted

432
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,910
with its own backup power source.

433
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,390
Shutting one down would raise flags.

434
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,470
Loose screw?

435
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,270
Easier to explain.

436
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:40,000
- Thank you.
- Fuck you.

437
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,650
You should know better than
to drag her into this.

438
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,440
Night off.

439
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,230
Deputy Directors want to perform

440
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,650
a systems simulation.

441
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,660
Poor bugger owes me four box
seats next time, not two.

442
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,100
Get him the message.

443
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,360
I've been looking into
the Embassy's network

444
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,550
on this side.

445
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,360
Went to a, uh, compound
outside of Potsdam.

446
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:46,080
It was a... a school.

447
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,210
Not formally funded by your Office,

448
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,530
but, uh...

449
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,720
we believe they were training...

450
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,640
sleepers. Sleeper agents.

451
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,100
Operatives.

452
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,730
Three names.

453
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,610
Oskar Wolfe, Helen Moller

454
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,920
and Rashad Roumani.

455
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:09,810
They're all on that side
now on false visas.

456
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,700
So we thought you should know.

457
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,100
We?

458
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,000
Yeah, maybe you thought it would
be someone else sitting here.

459
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,730
Maybe your ex-wife?

460
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,830
The one you told me died of cancer?

461
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,340
I-I don't even know... where to start.

462
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,140
She's alive, you're
divorced, a daughter.

463
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,900
Yeah, people tend to do desperate things

464
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,430
when they learn about
their other versions.

465
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,990
So you were doing me a favor?

466
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,830
We really shouldn't be here.

467
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,330
Thanks for the intel. I'll look into it.

468
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,810
Is there... is there just
any truth... to you?

469
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,180
After all I've seen of your
life, the things you've done,

470
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,930
is-is there... is there a
shred of honesty in you?

471
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,610
Look at you, Howard.

472
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,760
Believe me, I'm looking.

473
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,700
Not long ago, I sent you over there

474
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,370
like a doe in the woods.

475
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,410
Now you're a spy hunter,

476
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,360
bringing me actionable intelligence.

477
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,990
What's your point?

478
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,640
Think you owe me some gratitude.

479
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,300
- For what?
- For waking you the fuck up.

480
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,440
What the hell were you before me?

481
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,250
Pathetic little meek sad
sack, loyal hubby...

482
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,770
with your flowers on the nightstand,

483
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,820
and your fucking poetry.

484
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,510
Now look at you. Now there's
something breathing

485
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,590
behind those eyes.

486
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,350
You enjoying yourself with my family?

487
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,630
They hate you.

488
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,150
Yeah, that sounds about right.

489
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:54,120
Although... less and less lately.

490
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,050
It really hasn't taken that much

491
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,510
to steer your life out of a skid.

492
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:02,700
A little kindness, little attention.

493
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,930
You'd be amazed the difference it makes.

494
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,550
Restoring some good to
the ashes of your life.

495
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:09,820
Where's my gratitude?

496
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,730
You love this, don't you?

497
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,650
Running around, poking your nose

498
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,200
into all the little details of my life,

499
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,680
every fiber of my being.

500
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,970
We've been helping you.

501
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,210
"We" again.

502
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:28,900
You have feelings for her, Howard?

503
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,050
What?

504
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,350
Come on, it's right
there in front of you.

505
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,610
A second chance, right?

506
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,820
Or at least an opportunity
to, you know, compare and

507
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,600
- contrast?
- She is not my wife.

508
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,290
You want to move back
into your old apartment?

509
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,510
Cohabitate, maybe break bread

510
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,080
with the daughter you never knew?

511
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,760
That's not my life.

512
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,330
That's yours. It's not mine.

513
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,690
Yeah, speaking of your life,

514
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,810
we've been sitting here for a while and,

515
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,530
you haven't even asked about
Sleeping Beauty over here.

516
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,810
Her condition is unchanged, by the way.

517
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,830
Not sure I can say the same about you.

518
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,550
Or even myself. Jesus fucking Christ.

519
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,350
This is killing me, being
stuck in your life.

520
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,070
Every time I look in the mirror now,

521
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,930
I see more and more of you looking back.

522
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,830
All the worst parts.

523
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,820
The-the weakest, saddest

524
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,620
parts of me are just taking hold.

525
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,230
I don't blame you for not
missing it over here.

526
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,500
It's better over there.

527
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,730
I do miss it.

528
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,600
I miss her.

529
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,930
You don't even know who the fuck she is.

530
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:44,390
Geez, you're uh, so fucking blind.

531
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,900
Sorry about your, uh,
go partner, by the way.

532
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,760
I don't think he'll be around anymore.

533
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:54,130
- Andrei?
- Yeah. I-I-I don't know how

534
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,890
the fuck you managed
to miss all of that.

535
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,700
He meets you in the hospital.

536
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,130
His sister is admitted the same day?

537
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,290
What a coincidence. Huh.

538
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,540
Course you never even met her.

539
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,820
But he needed to know, "How's
your wife doing, Howard?

540
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,700
How-how is she?"

541
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,320
What are you... what
are you talking about?

542
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,770
What the fuck do you think?
They were fucking.

543
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:18,480
Jesus Christ!

544
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,260
How do you not see that?

545
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,770
How much denial do you have to be in

546
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:26,090
to continue to idealize
her the way you do?

547
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:28,890
I know my wife.

548
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:31,790
What? I'm-I'm sorry. I don't...
I don't think I caught that.

549
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,730
She's a-a spy, Howard.

550
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,040
She's a fucking fraud,
just like my wife.

551
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,580
She's a survivor who will do anything

552
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,920
and anyone to get what she wants.

553
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,360
- Okay. Enough.
- You think

554
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,970
your life is so much better than mine?

555
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,040
Your little paltry existence?

556
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:51,130
Bullshit bits and pieces of phrases

557
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,880
from a fucking Hallmark card?

558
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,940
You willingly let her deceive you.

559
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,180
- I know.
- You go

560
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,510
tiptoeing along.

561
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,740
Jesus fucking Christ.

562
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,910
No wonder life hits you
like a wrecking ball.

563
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,740
Goddamn it, I said I know!

564
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,860
I fucking know!

565
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,490
All those years.

566
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:21,020
The late nights, the-the...
the cover stories.

567
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:24,950
You think a man doesn't...
question things?

568
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,410
I knew... I knew everything about her.

569
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:34,500
Not the... not the job, details, but...

570
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:38,000
about the lies.

571
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,560
I knew about... about Andrei, sure.

572
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,870
Because he wasn't the first.

573
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:52,530
She's human.

574
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,670
She made mistakes.

575
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,250
We worked through them.

576
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,860
That's something you
wouldn't understand.

577
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,630
Caring enough to-to
work on your marriage.

578
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,390
I love her

579
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,730
for everything she is,

580
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,870
and for everything she isn't.

581
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:29,240
And in the end, that-that
capacity for love,

582
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,440
the ability to love someone

583
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,730
unselfishly...

584
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:42,060
is the only thing that
will separate me from you.

585
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,950
You need to stay the
fuck away from my life.

586
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,950
It's not yours.

587
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:59,290
It's a fucking vacation rental.

588
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,060
And sooner or later, I'll be back,

589
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,860
and you'll come back here,

590
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,560
and nothing will have changed.

591
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,880
I guess we have nothing left to say.

592
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,130
_

593
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:31,310
You break into my apartment?

594
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,160
You can't do that. It's weird.

595
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,940
I'm sorry.

596
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,760
Do you have nowhere to go?

597
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,600
I wanted to see you.

598
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,000
Vodka, pure, please.

599
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,860
Right away, sir.

600
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,610
Danke.

601
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:26,750
You know, I never really
appreciated what it is we do.

602
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:31,310
This game.

603
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:41,180
I know what people think of me,

604
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,430
how I came to this position,

605
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,340
how I'm not qualified to...

606
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,310
And they're right.

607
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:54,970
I'm an idiot, and I know how this looks.

608
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,630
I know.

609
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:02,870
I know how this looks
from where you sit.

610
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,880
I know it looks like all
the fingers point at me,

611
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:09,190
but it's not me.

612
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:12,540
I'm not the mole.

613
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,460
Who is it, then?

614
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,850
Look, I'm not innocent.

615
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:24,440
I'm responsible for the leaks.

616
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:29,810
But I've been manipulated...

617
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,350
for years,

618
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,680
like a complete fucking fool.

619
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,720
That's probably why they chose me.

620
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,750
Who did this to you?

621
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,670
I can protect you, but
you have to tell me

622
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,570
who's been manipulating you.

623
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,890
It's Howard Silk.

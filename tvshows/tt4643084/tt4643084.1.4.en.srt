1
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:20,321
A few months ago
I started getting these letters.

2
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,557
Who wrote you the letters?

3
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:24,657
If I'm to be harmed,

4
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,095
I need you to reach out
to the other Howard.

5
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,532
Are we still together over here?

6
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,601
Are we happy?

7
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,570
A woman from our world
was arrested... an assassin.

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,639
- They call her Baldwin.
- She's here illegally,

9
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,441
and I need to find out
who sent her.

10
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,743
- Not my concern.
- Lambert, the ambassador...

11
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:44,645
Think he might be working
with these people.

12
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:48,516
Leave them.

13
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:50,251
You didn't give them anything,
did you?

14
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,520
Your side is compromised.

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,930
I'm not saying
it's your department,

16
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,554
but I'm sure as hell not
saying it's not.

17
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:57,734
- We're fucked.
- Not if we send this one back in my place.

18
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:58,878
We're after the same people.

19
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,129
They tried to take me out.

20
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,596
They might try
the same with you.

21
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,213
My God.

22
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,084
Danke.

23
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,786
Gute Nacht.

24
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:34,207
I get to work
every morning at 8:30.

25
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:35,943
I'm never late.

26
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:37,043
Howard.

27
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,212
Early, actually,

28
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,415
so I guess I get to work
at 8:20something.

29
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,517
Howard.

30
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,487
What are you doing in there?
Packing? Are you packing?

31
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:49,089
- You said it might be a week.
- You're gonna be living

32
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,992
in my life. You don't need...

33
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,027
Forget it.

34
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,332
Um, after work,

35
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,934
I, I just grab a quick dinner,

36
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:05,305
and I get to the hospital
between 7:00 and 7:30.

37
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:08,642
I read to her,
but you know that.

38
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,177
Anything else?

39
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,579
Most mornings.

40
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:15,048
II stop for coffee
down at the café.

41
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,451
Go. We play

42
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,252
the board game Go.

43
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:21,288
On Tuesdays and Thursdays,
I meet a friend.

44
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:25,993
His name is Andrei,
and, we play Go.

45
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,362
Jesus.

46
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:35,035
You know, they say it's so great

47
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:38,271
to meet yourself.

48
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:41,241
Bullshit.

49
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,477
Kind of like losing
your virginity, you know?

50
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,579
Wait your whole life for it,

51
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,215
and then 20 seconds later,
you're disappointed.

52
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,349
What are you doing?

53
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,586
In about six hours,

54
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,888
we need to become each other.

55
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,458
Even though, apparently,
I can pretty much do

56
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,993
whatever the fuck I want,
as long as it's not too exciting

57
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,529
or even remotely interesting.

58
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,231
If we really want to get
to know each other,

59
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,467
let's play cards.

60
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,745
So, how'd you meet this Andrei?

61
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:23,951
We met at the hospital.

62
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,353
His sister was admitted
the same day as Emily.

63
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:28,789
She's diabetic.

64
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:36,096
Any, extracurriculars?

65
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,732
You mean...

66
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,735
Jesus, Howard. Are there
any other women in your life?

67
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,771
I'm married.

68
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:49,276
Diddid you...

69
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:53,180
When she was still alive,

70
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,484
did you do that kind of thing?

71
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,489
So, let me get this straight.

72
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,658
Your only friend in this
big old city is some guy

73
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,595
you didn't even know
until six weeks ago?

74
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:10,430
Until six weeks ago, I had her.

75
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,169
What about...

76
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,038
what about your routines?

77
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,440
Don't worry about me.

78
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,642
I work a desk job

79
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,377
and have absolutely
no social life.

80
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,380
We've spent the last hour
going over my stuff,

81
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,518
and you do II don't know what,

82
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,486
and your answer is,
"Don't worry about it"?

83
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:33,954
Yeah. I got a guy.

84
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,857
His name is Raash.
He'll take care of you.

85
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,392
You do realize we're the same
person, right? Essentially.

86
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:42,530
I mean, the same flesh
and blood, the same DNA.

87
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,532
Yeah. Believe me, I do.

88
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:48,569
Then why do you feel compelled
to treat me so badly?

89
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,471
It's your bet.

90
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,381
You flopped top pair,
and you're folding?

91
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,951
That was a good bluff.

92
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,719
Do me a favor, will you?

93
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,122
Play one hand like you actually
know how to win.

94
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,601
Howard, play the fucking hand.

95
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,541
Are we finished?

96
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,358
No one will notice you here.

97
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,828
Fresh clothes.

98
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,672
Weapon?

99
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,711
You were in their custody
for hours.

100
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,813
What did they ask you?

101
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,363
I'm sorry.

102
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:27,167
About what happened
to your other.

103
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,202
She's dead.

104
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,205
And I gave them nothing.

105
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,229
I'll talk to them about
next steps. Get some rest.

106
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,253
Howard, it's time.

107
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,395
Well, well, well.

108
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,397
You're saving the good stuff?

109
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:34,334
That's not for me. Or you.

110
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:38,872
It's for when she wakes up.

111
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,749
Just one week.

112
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,818
You're doing the right thing.

113
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,953
They're gonna see through me.

114
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,822
Not if you keep your mouth shut.

115
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:59,026
You'll read to her every day.

116
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,962
I will.

117
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,704
Keep her safe.

118
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,641
Find these people.

119
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:16,910
Howard.

120
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,616
I'll take him, Cyrus, from here.

121
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,918
Thank you.

122
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,431
Do you have his paperwork?

123
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,033
Yeah.

124
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,936
All right. They don't do that,
by the way.

125
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,704
What?

126
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:20,908
Shake hands. Berlin,
on the other side, they...

127
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:23,576
You'll see. It's a germ thing.

128
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:24,744
Good to know.

129
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,814
Howard, if you are caught,

130
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,682
there's no one
to protect you over there.

131
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,152
You understand?
You're on your own.

132
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,922
Yeah.

133
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,524
I have to deny any part of this.

134
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,761
Okay. Thank you.

135
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,036
Danke.

136
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,043
Arms up.

137
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,382
Yours?

138
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:17,850
Shit, I forgot.

139
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:21,221
Come on, it's just
a pack of bloody smokes.

140
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:24,024
For God's sake,
it was just a mistake.

141
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,892
Come on, really?

142
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,661
Sir?

143
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,233
Purpose of visit?

144
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,435
The, embassy pouch.

145
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,694
Welcome home.

146
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,274
I'm Raash.

147
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,373
Thank you.

148
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,947
Hey! Hey! What...

149
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,047
Come on,

150
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:29,949
what are you...?

151
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,484
Hey.

152
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,388
Hey!

153
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,408
A little sparse.

154
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:58,978
I have a few contacts
left at the embassy.

155
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,481
We'll put more escorts
on Lambert.

156
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:05,285
If he has any connections to
Baldwin, my men will find out.

157
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,497
Do you ever have doubts
about these men?

158
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,167
I'm just wondering
how we've always been

159
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,235
one step behind here.

160
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,372
'Cause we've been
meticulous, right?

161
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,907
In our vetting.
I mean, there's no...

162
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:31,444
There's no chance of any point
of compromise here, is there?

163
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,514
Not unless you count
Howard Silk.

164
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,883
You promoted him.

165
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,918
Well, that was the deal.

166
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,453
His other's gone.

167
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,490
- Why make deals?
- Because, candidly speaking,

168
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,925
that man's been a lot more
useful than your lot lately,

169
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,594
and I'd like to stay
on his good side.

170
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,131
Was there anything else?

171
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,920
Finally, they send help.

172
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,194
Thought I was gonna be
in Strategy.

173
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,396
Yes, this is it.
Strategy payroll.

174
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,097
You have a degree
in accounting, yeah?

175
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:26,866
No.

176
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,201
Your desk.

177
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,337
They think what I do is a joke,

178
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:33,573
so now they play a joke on me.

179
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:37,277
Need to file every time card,
mark it with code, send it back.

180
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,747
You take too long, I will
find someone to replace you.

181
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,749
Questions?

182
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,452
Where are you going?

183
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,420
Personal day.

184
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,410
What is wrong with you?

185
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,045
This is all his idea, I assume?

186
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,914
Groceries.

187
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,887
So, this is it?

188
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,791
Just you and me, locked
in this apartment for a week?

189
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,296
God, I'm such an idiot.

190
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:33,566
Open the door.

191
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,302
I just saw Raash go in there.

192
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,270
I know you're in there.

193
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,240
Dad!

194
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,616
Your phone's been off all day.

195
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,718
Mom's in the hospital,
we've got to go, come on.

196
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:54,487
- Mom?
- Yes.

197
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,157
Your mom?

198
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,259
Obviously.
What... get your jacket.

199
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,696
Come on. Come on.

200
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,659
Anna?

201
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,528
What?

202
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:40,333
What, what happened
to your mother?

203
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:43,370
It was another overdose.

204
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,237
Yeah. Neighbors found her
on the floor.

205
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:46,573
Barely had a pulse.

206
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:49,308
She'd probably been there
all night.

207
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,846
You're actually surprised?

208
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,520
II'm a lot of things right now.

209
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,222
Yeah, well, don't worry.
You don't have to do anything.

210
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,224
I'll deal with the doctors
when we get there.

211
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,160
Right.

212
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,398
Yeah. OOf course.

213
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,579
I see you.

214
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,093
Two escorts now.

215
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,630
For some reason, they think
I'm using these appointments

216
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,798
for clandestine meetings.

217
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:51,003
So, where is she?

218
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,005
She wants to keep working.

219
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,807
Says she told them nothing.

220
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:58,010
Told you she told them nothing.

221
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:05,384
Have you heard anything
from home?

222
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:11,524
Towel, please.

223
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,532
Your friends are not happy

224
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:23,603
with how things
have been developing.

225
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:27,273
They want to bring over our
guests earlier than expected.

226
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:28,941
She hasn't removed
the targets yet.

227
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,277
And on that note,

228
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:34,313
they also raised questions

229
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,483
about your assassin friend.

230
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,285
First they push me
out of an airplane

231
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,554
and then they take away
my chute.

232
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,756
They want her removed.

233
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,592
She trusts me.

234
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:48,495
That's putting it lightly,
from what I hear.

235
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,597
Perhaps it's time

236
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:53,833
you actually use that situation
to your advantage.

237
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:56,836
Clare.

238
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,345
I can't imagine
the pressure you're under.

239
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,181
The weight
of these expectations.

240
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:13,586
But after all the work
that they did to place you here,

241
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,454
would you really risk
this mission

242
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:18,324
when we're so close
to the big day?

243
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:21,293
I'll take care of it.

244
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,496
You always do.

245
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:21,754
How are you feeling?

246
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,624
Thirsty.

247
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,099
Jesus, Em.

248
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:37,804
What happened?

249
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:39,606
Um...

250
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,808
There some reason
you're here, Howard?

251
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:44,577
I'm...

252
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,078
Well, thank you for coming.

253
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:48,615
- I've got it.
- Could you...

254
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,851
put your dicks away, please?

255
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,896
"Light a candle
at St. Christopher's."

256
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:06,999
What the fuck
does that even mean?

257
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:12,571
You want to know what I'm
thinking right now, you prick?

258
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,741
I'm thinking this is on you.

259
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:18,945
Stay the fuck away from her.

260
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:47,073
Really? Just walk out
in the middle of the day?

261
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:48,908
You want to be
any more conspicuous?

262
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,285
That was your idea
of a promotion?

263
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,844
- Payroll?
- Well, I'm sorry.

264
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,213
It was the best I could do
with ten seconds' notice.

265
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:59,085
Okay, what do you know
about this, Lambert?

266
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:01,087
Nothing.

267
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,066
I don't know, we got men
on him all the time,

268
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,225
but he's a highranking
diplomat, so...

269
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,131
- Really?
- What?

270
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:16,002
You're married to
a director's daughter, right?

271
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:17,569
Yeah. So?

272
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,406
What the hell's
my marriage got to...?

273
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:23,609
I'll have you know I was
on my own career trajectory

274
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,845
long before I met
Roland Fancher's daughter.

275
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:28,647
- Okay.
- Yeah, and I resent the implication.

276
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:30,582
I'm fucking good at my job,

277
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:32,651
and when it comes
to my work, Howard Silk,

278
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:34,586
nothing gets past me.

279
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:38,224
So I guess you know all about
other Howard's wife, then?

280
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,359
She was an agent.

281
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:43,129
Housekeeping? Under Aldrich.

282
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,231
How do you know that?

283
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,399
'Cause she was my contact.

284
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,635
She reached out to me
months ago,

285
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:52,271
said things on your floor
were compromised,

286
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,741
she couldn't trust anybody,

287
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,342
and then she had
a little accident.

288
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,787
But you know
all about that, right?

289
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:00,980
'Cause nothing gets past you.

290
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,016
Get back to the fucking Office.

291
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,952
I'm meeting a friend
this afternoon.

292
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:07,153
Who?

293
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:09,688
An old friend.
Don't worry about it.

294
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:10,933
All right, we're gonna
have to establish

295
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:13,692
a few fucking ground rules here.

296
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,394
Both of our lives
are on the line

297
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:16,763
because of this arrangement,

298
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,206
so you can't wander
around my world

299
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,999
like it's your
fucking playground.

300
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,201
We're in lockstep from now on.

301
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:26,272
So who is this friend,
and when are we meeting him?

302
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:28,975
What do you remember?

303
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:31,978
- Couple of pairs of feet.
- Faces?

304
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:36,148
Ian, I promise you I'll talk
to you about it, but not here.

305
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:37,349
It's not safe.

306
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,753
Well, let me
tell you how this looks

307
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:43,022
- from an Office perspective.
- Here we go.

308
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:46,092
You failed another drug test.

309
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:48,727
You know
that's not what this is.

310
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:50,029
In light of this,

311
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,932
Dwyer's requested
a full evaluation.

312
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:56,668
See if you're fit to return.

313
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:58,771
He wants you supervised,

314
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:01,273
followed, monitored.

315
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:05,945
He could have burned you
entirely, but I spoke to him,

316
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:07,880
bought you some time.

317
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,616
Talk to me, Em.

318
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:13,853
What's going on?

319
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:17,990
I can't talk about it now.

320
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,462
We'll fight it.

321
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:28,835
Pills again, dash of cocaine.

322
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:31,737
And just last week,
I said to myself,

323
00:29:31,838 --> 00:29:33,705
"She's better now.

324
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:36,142
You don't have to worry."

325
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:37,977
I'm sorry.

326
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:40,746
- For what?
- For...

327
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:43,415
not being there.

328
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,451
No, you're not.

329
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:48,387
And fuck you, by the way.

330
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:51,322
Do you know what?

331
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:52,859
You don't have
to be here anymore.

332
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,626
I thought I needed
your help, but I don't.

333
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,095
I want to be here.

334
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:59,932
Because you feel guilty.
Otherwise,

335
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,010
you would have buggered off
at the first sight of me.

336
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:04,336
I'll go if it makes you feel
more comfortable.

337
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:06,906
- Of course.
- But II would like to stay.

338
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:09,308
Then stay. Jesus, Dad,
what's the matter with you?

339
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,513
We'll get her help.

340
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:17,416
Good luck trying
to convince her.

341
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,418
We'll do it together.

342
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,455
So, who is this friend?

343
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:24,857
He's originally from my side,

344
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,026
but he now has an identity here.

345
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:29,228
But you didn't hear that.

346
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,433
Heinrich is here?

347
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:45,878
Holy shit.

348
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:47,813
You're here.

349
00:30:47,914 --> 00:30:49,348
Indeed I am.

350
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,383
Hello.

351
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:55,321
Good to see you, pal.

352
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:57,089
Come here.

353
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,464
Local?

354
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,300
Yeah, do you mind giving us
a few minutes?

355
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:15,975
Here, sit.

356
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:20,812
Brought
a little something for you.

357
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:22,949
Compliments of the other side.

358
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,562
It's good to see you.

359
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,064
I miss this shit.

360
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:40,566
It's terrible over here.

361
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:41,867
Nothing like home.

362
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:43,202
Here's to home.

363
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:44,403
Cheers.

364
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,843
So, how you doing over here?
Okay?

365
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:53,645
Well, cover is decent.

366
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:58,517
Um, married a local...

367
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,020
who actually loves me.

368
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:04,356
You?

369
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:08,060
I think I'm having a problem
with our old friend.

370
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,632
You know anything about this
group Pope is working with?

371
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:16,135
Brought an assassin over here.

372
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:20,006
Lambert at the embassy's
apparently a part of it, too.

373
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:23,275
Are you sure you want
to know about this?

374
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:26,512
They're fucked up, these people.

375
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,581
Fanatics inside our office.

376
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,318
And Pope is definitely involved?

377
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:34,386
Yeah.

378
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,489
He's been helping 'em move
illegals a long time now.

379
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:42,094
Hey.

380
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:44,163
He is what he is.

381
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:46,032
Yeah, yeah, don't...

382
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:47,612
I don't need
the whole fucking speech.

383
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:52,004
How long ago did he pitch you?

384
00:32:52,104 --> 00:32:54,106
Almost 20 years.

385
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,742
We helped build this network

386
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,177
and you're actually surprised

387
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:00,712
it's being used
for this kind of shit?

388
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:05,984
Thanks, schatz.

389
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,486
Danke schon.

390
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,491
Five minutes till lunch.

391
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:21,100
Don't fight him.

392
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,369
Whatever angle you think
you have, he's got it covered.

393
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:26,972
I'm a step ahead of him
for the time being, anyway.

394
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:29,408
Sure about that?

395
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:33,445
Listen, there's something
you should know.

396
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,284
There's a source
on the Third Floor over here.

397
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:41,120
A mole, very high clearance.

398
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,755
They say he's been feeding Pope
for years now.

399
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:49,027
Strategy.

400
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:51,663
High clearance
as in director level?

401
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:55,734
You don't have a name?

402
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,803
Something's about to happen.

403
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:00,639
People coming over.
Something big.

404
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:04,543
You go up against
Alexander Pope, you'll lose.

405
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:39,411
- Danke schon.
- Danke schon.

406
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,773
Sorry about the mess.

407
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,814
Can I get you anything?

408
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,716
No, thank you.

409
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,818
Make yourself at home.

410
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,854
Just a word on tradecraft.

411
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:58,324
My exhusband

412
00:35:58,424 --> 00:36:00,626
wouldn't have brought me home,

413
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:02,761
wouldn't even have come
to the hospital,

414
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:05,364
and certainly wouldn't have
lent me his coat.

415
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,468
Perhaps it'll be simpler
if we introduce ourselves.

416
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:11,437
I'm Emily.

417
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,782
I... II don't know what you...

418
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,317
Well, let me guess.

419
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:26,952
You two were colluding.

420
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:28,520
He's had you brought over here

421
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,557
so that he can spend
more time over there.

422
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:35,627
I'm... I'ml'm not...
colluding with him.

423
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,964
That's not how it looks, Howard.

424
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,333
He had me brought over here

425
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:44,803
and kept my locked
in an empty apartment.

426
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:47,706
And what's he doing next?

427
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:50,609
He's, um...

428
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,679
he's investigating something.

429
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,013
II don't know.

430
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:56,715
You don't know
or you won't tell me?

431
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,485
Believe me, he did not
keep me in the loop.

432
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:02,788
I mean, he told me
you were dead.

433
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,792
So, what department
do you work for?

434
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:10,662
Up until just a few days ago,
I was in Interface.

435
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,030
Interface?

436
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,232
No, he hasn't worked
for them since...

437
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,367
No, II know.

438
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:18,203
He hasn't, but...

439
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:19,905
I was still there.

440
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:26,177
Perhaps it's best if we don't
talk about everything.

441
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:27,346
Yes.

442
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:30,582
Best for everyone.

443
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,956
Why are you looking at me
like that?

444
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:39,691
I'm sorry.

445
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:43,028
You shouldn't be here.

446
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:44,730
This isn't usual behavior
for him.

447
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,830
It'll attract attention.

448
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,568
I forgot.

449
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:53,004
I, invited Anna for dinner.

450
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,806
Is that unusual, too?

451
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:55,941
Yes.

452
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:08,954
Hi, Mom.

453
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:11,857
Dad.

454
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,402
Did you sleep?

455
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:26,838
What did they say?

456
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:31,009
They're worried
about the situation.

457
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:32,978
But they're glad
you're all right.

458
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:35,013
They want you to kill me.

459
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:38,950
We have to find a new crash pad.

460
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,986
It won't be safe for you here.

461
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,390
Three more contracts.

462
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,458
- Nadia.
- I can finish the kill list.

463
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:48,093
You don't know these people
like I do.

464
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:49,236
They don't tolerate mistakes.

465
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,996
Why are you protecting me?

466
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:53,932
Because I care about you.

467
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,969
You only care
about your mission.

468
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:01,573
Is that who you think I am?

469
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,109
You think I just drop you
on the side of the road?

470
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:07,413
You're not the only one,
you know.

471
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:12,083
When I first crossed over,
I watched my other

472
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,020
and her quaint, little life.

473
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,857
She had everything.

474
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:23,462
She was free and happy.

475
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:26,097
And I was alone.

476
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,835
Why are you telling me this?

477
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:31,069
Because it's a choice.

478
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:32,904
Loneliness.

479
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,609
Let me help you.

480
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,978
You're the only one
who knows who I really am

481
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:42,581
in this whole fucking world,

482
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:46,117
and I would never let
anyone hurt you.

483
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,125
I'm sorry.

484
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:58,797
No.

485
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:52,744
Anna.

486
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:55,914
Dinner is served.

487
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,024
Didn't know you could do
anything but barbecue.

488
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:11,162
Well, I guess...

489
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,865
you learn things living alone.

490
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,136
Wow.

491
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:20,105
It's actually really good.

492
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:23,975
You always mess up a compliment
with "actually."

493
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:28,747
When did you learn to cook?

494
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:32,283
A cooking class a while back.

495
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,721
The secret of the chicken is
to leave it in the oven

496
00:42:35,821 --> 00:42:37,589
as it cools, and it helps

497
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:40,592
to bring out the flavor.

498
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:45,563
It's wonderful, actually.

499
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:48,299
Always was your favorite.

500
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,810
Anna, how's work?

501
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,046
Anything but the subject
at hand.

502
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:05,784
I thought we could wait
until dessert.

503
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:07,118
What's going on here?

504
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:09,087
Going on?

505
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:10,856
Are yo...

506
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:12,099
Are you two getting
back together?

507
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,491
- No.
- What?

508
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,393
Then stop acting like teenagers.

509
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:17,796
Okay, let's settle down.

510
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:19,931
For a second, I thought
you gave a shit

511
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:21,499
about something
other than yourself.

512
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,936
- Anna...
- Mom overdosed again!

513
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:27,372
And I'm the only one
who seems to care.

514
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:32,043
Anna, please sit down. Please.

515
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:35,213
I'm so sick of being
your mother.

516
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:38,684
I'm sick of being the parent
to both of you.

517
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:11,336
That wasn't your fault,
you know.

518
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:16,074
You were no part of that.

519
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:18,877
I know.

520
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,480
For a moment,
it felt like I was,

521
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,816
but I know.

522
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:29,787
Is she like that on your side?

523
00:46:34,826 --> 00:46:37,128
When, when my Emily
got pregnant,

524
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:41,366
we went overboard with
the clothes and the room

525
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:43,969
and the registry.

526
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:46,271
We wanted everything
to be perfect.

527
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:51,342
I used to lean into her belly

528
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:53,511
and talk to the baby,

529
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:56,414
tell her what the world
was like.

530
00:46:56,514 --> 00:47:00,451
Seemed like when I did that,
she would kick.

531
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:05,456
But, she miscarried.

532
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,529
I'm so sorry.

533
00:47:13,198 --> 00:47:16,267
We had already
picked out the name.

534
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:21,239
Anna.

535
00:47:24,642 --> 00:47:27,745
Look, I don't... I don't...
I don't really know

536
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,647
how it is between you and him.

537
00:47:29,747 --> 00:47:33,518
I mean... I could guess,

538
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:36,687
knowing him a bit.

539
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:39,157
But, um...

540
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:44,595
however bad it is...

541
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,331
you're both very lucky.

542
00:47:53,438 --> 00:47:56,574
I don't really know you
at all, Howard,

543
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:59,978
but whatever circumstance
made you

544
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:02,480
who you are...

545
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:05,616
you're better than him.

546
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,029
I could stay here tonight.

547
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:20,665
Crash on the couch.

548
00:48:24,302 --> 00:48:26,571
I don't need you to protect me.

549
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,606
I know.

550
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:49,260
Do you trust
this man's intelligence?

551
00:48:50,195 --> 00:48:53,331
He has never been wrong.

552
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,572
So there's a mole,

553
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,241
someone from the other side,

554
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:06,444
on my floor,
under Aldrich's nose

555
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:08,846
for... years.

556
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,450
I mean, how is that
even possible?

557
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,553
Someone got to Emily.

558
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:18,389
Who's to say they don't know
what you're doing, too?

559
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:27,632
Bottom line is, I'm too exposed.

560
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:28,972
Until you find out what's what,

561
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:31,102
I think I need
to stay out of it.

562
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:32,703
And how you gonna do that?

563
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:37,342
By being him, I guess.

564
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:39,110
Best I can.

565
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:50,555
That other Howard,
he was with his wife...

566
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,192
however many years.

567
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:57,128
He had no idea about her?

568
00:49:57,228 --> 00:50:01,432
No.

569
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:05,703
I guess loyalty is
his biggest flaw.

570
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:11,076
Mine, too.

571
00:52:52,737 --> 00:52:54,972
Not even a goodbye?

572
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:58,343
I am clearly writing you a note.

573
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:04,181
You know, we could
help each other.

574
00:53:05,483 --> 00:53:07,218
I mean,
the Office are watching me,

575
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:09,554
but they're not watching you.

576
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:12,323
There's a lot of stuff
going on out there.

577
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:14,759
We could help him.

578
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:17,061
Sure.

579
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:19,564
Yeah, whatever I can do.

580
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:25,102
That wouldn't be strange
for you at all?

581
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,938
Us, together?

582
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:31,909
I don't know.
Would it be strange for you?

583
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:33,644
Yes.

584
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:35,045
Yeah, okay.

585
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,886
Okay, now I'm going.

586
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:44,989
Not taking your pen.

587
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,362
Thank you.

588
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,764
Morning.

589
00:54:26,864 --> 00:54:29,033
I'm going for a walk.

590
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:31,569
Probably get a cup of tea,

591
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:35,005
and then, I think
I'll just keep walking

592
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:38,309
and go wherever I want.

593
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:41,679
I'd like to have his keys.

594
00:54:48,252 --> 00:54:49,252
Thank you.

595
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,055
Next time you talk to him,

596
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:52,957
tell him I love my new digs.

597
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:07,405
 Where I lead me
I will travel 

598
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:13,411
 Where I need me
I will call me 

599
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:18,616
 Well, I'm no fool,
I'll be ready 

600
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:21,318
 God knows I will be

601
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:24,154
 And in the meantime

602
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:25,254
 Make a little money

603
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:27,525
 And buy a little mercy

604
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:34,198
 Well, met this morning,
now she loves me 

605
00:55:34,298 --> 00:55:37,134
 Says she loves me

606
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:40,004
 It must be easy,
look around you 

607
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:42,373
 All around you

608
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:45,209
 But you see the motion,
you're not movin' 

609
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:48,946
 And you don't know how
to hold on 

610
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:52,282
 You just keep it loose,
don't get excited 

611
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:55,453
 You know it's gonna pass
before long 

612
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:02,760
 Well, one is goin',
one is stayin'

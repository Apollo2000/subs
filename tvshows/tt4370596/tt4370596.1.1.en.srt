Hey! Hi. Hey, cookie.

334
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:46,898
Sammy, cookie, you want to hear a story?

335
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:48,177
I got a good one for
you. Let me tell you...

336
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:49,834
Don't get in there and wind her up,

337
00:16:49,903 --> 00:16:51,869
I just got her down.

338
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:53,371
Shut up!

339
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,772
Listen, Sammy,

340
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:56,140
your dad had a great day.

341
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:57,208
I had a great day.

342
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:59,143
Okay, I got irons in the fire, kid.

343
00:16:59,212 --> 00:17:01,746
This guy called me, he thinks
he wants to do one of my stories.

344
00:17:01,815 --> 00:17:03,225
You remember the one about the junk man?

345
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,049
He could see things other
people couldn't.

346
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:06,717
Could turn garbage into gold.

347
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:08,030
He thinks it could go to television.

348
00:17:08,054 --> 00:17:09,554
I'm talkin' TV, the big game.

349
00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:11,823
You, me, the big game.
Everything could change.

350
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:14,025
Even for her. Don't
tell her I woke you up.

351
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:15,593
All right, go back to bed. Goodnight.

I said get out.

362
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:52,508
Did you know that in Africa,

363
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:53,910
girls get their clitoris cut off

364
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:56,512
when they're, like,
13 on their birthday?

365
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:58,648
What if I did that as, like, a protest?

366
00:17:58,717 --> 00:18:01,351
That would be so, like, real.

367
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:02,585
Get out.

368
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:04,707
Get out of my room. Get out.

369
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:06,509
- Get out of my room.
- No.

370
00:18:06,578 --> 00:18:11,013
- Get out. Get out of my room.
- No.

And no, you're not
getting your clit cut off!

375
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,692
Oh, sweetie.

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,460

Real.

00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:39,575
Like, I want it to at least feel real.

384
00:18:39,644 --> 00:18:42,411
Can they just really make it feel real?

385
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,780
What are your search words?

386
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:46,616
I don't... What? I
don't know what that is.

387

Everything you want is out there.

388
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:51,454
You just need to know how to
narrow it down to search words.

389
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:54,257
Close your eyes and picture anything,

390

and there is porn of
that on the internet.

No, Stan, we're not a couple anymore.

I'd burn the whole

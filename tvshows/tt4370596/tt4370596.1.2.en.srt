1
00:00:03,132 --> 00:00:04,465
Hi, Sam.

2
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:06,033
Hi, Dr. Akoya.

3
00:00:06,102 --> 00:00:07,434
How are you doing?

4
00:00:07,503 --> 00:00:09,169
I'm okay.

5
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:11,138
Been behaving yourself?

6
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:13,540
Well, you're about to find out.

7
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:15,809
You might find some evidence in there.

8
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:18,412
Gosh, you're so crazy.

9
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:21,315
I can see you haven't
been behaving yourself.

10
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:23,650
You've got a belly full
of dicks there, young lady.

11
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,385
Oh, God!

12
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:28,122
- Sam, you must stop.
- Sorry.

13
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,289
Okay, shall we take a look?

14
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:31,191
Fine.

15
00:00:32,328 --> 00:00:34,728
Okay. Anyway,

16
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:38,132
I was just kidding. I haven't
done anythi-ing.

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,243
Okay?

19
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:50,811
Yeah.

20
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,616
Right. Okay.

21
00:00:55,684 --> 00:00:57,951
All good. All normal.

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,490
Okay. Normal, like... for my age?

23
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:04,792
How close am I?

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,393
Close to...

25
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:09,129
Like, have I shut down down there?

26
00:01:09,198 --> 00:01:10,497
Am I a man yet?

27
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:12,199
Please tell me I'm close to being a man.

28
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:13,634
No more periods.

29
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:16,370
Sam, I hate to tell you,

30
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:18,138
but you have the reproductive system

31
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:19,473
of a 16-year-old.

32
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:21,542
Oh, my God.

33
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,279
Yeah. Your tubes are ripe and working.

34
00:01:25,347 --> 00:01:28,282
Jesus, that's so weird.

35
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,184
Why?

36
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:32,586
I don't know. I just... Because...

37
00:01:32,655 --> 00:01:34,888
Ew! Shut up. Stop talking about me.

38
00:01:34,957 --> 00:01:36,757
Okay. All right.

39
00:01:36,826 --> 00:01:39,226
Talk about you. When are you due?

40
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:42,563
Any bloody minute, as you can see.

41
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:44,898
Can I feel?

42
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:47,000
- Yeah, of course.
- Ohh!

43
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:49,903
Hello, there, baby.

44
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:52,239
Your mommy's a doctor.

45
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:56,610
And your daddy's a... Uh, writer?

46
00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:01,281
Yeah, yeah. He, uh, well,
he's trying to write.

47
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,683
Mm.

48
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:08,222
So this is so weird.

49
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,158
Um, I went to Dr. Akoya today.

50
00:02:11,227 --> 00:02:12,426
She pregnant?

51
00:02:12,494 --> 00:02:13,627
Yeah.

52
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:14,728
- Really?
- Oh, my God.

53
00:02:14,797 --> 00:02:16,063
I know. That's annoying.

54
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:18,031
- Why?
- I don't know.

55
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,078
She should take a leave of
absence when she's pregnant.

56
00:02:20,102 --> 00:02:22,536
- Why?
- I don't know.

57
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:24,805
Oh, baby, are you pausing yet?

58
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:27,541
No. Okay, so this is the weird thing.

59
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,909
I assumed, you know.

60
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:30,878
I thought I was at
the end of the rope here,

61
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:33,680
and I was kind of hoping that
she was going to say that.

62
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:37,284
But apparently I have
the reproductive system

63
00:02:37,353 --> 00:02:39,219
of a 16-year-old. Like,

64
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:42,055
my tubes are really good,

65
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:44,424
and my eggs are still coming,

66
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:48,262
and I'm fully functional and productive

67
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,032
and just the reproductive
system of a 16-year-old.

68
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:54,568
Hmm.

69
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:58,505
Did I fart? What's wrong?

70
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:02,976
But your eggs are... fried.

71
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:05,001
Right? I mean, they're... rotten.

72
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:07,681
It's not like you can make anything.

73
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,083
Um...

74
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:12,286
Do you want to have a baby?

75
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:14,821
- No. I just...
- Then why did you bring it up?

76
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,957
I just thought it was funny.

77
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:19,026
Oh. Well, it is. It's funny.

78
00:03:20,162 --> 00:03:22,462
Um, okay.

79
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:25,009
I think I'm going to have the s'mores.

80
00:03:31,354 --> 00:03:37,388

81
00:03:58,298 --> 00:03:59,864
As long as you're doing all this,

82
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,866
can you help me out
on the chin a little?

83
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:03,301
Do I have to be an alien

84
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,870
who's also an aging lady with whiskers?

85
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,106
Don't women on the planet Zeepzop

86
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:10,342
get electrolysis or whatever?

87
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:13,845
No, but seriously, can you...

88
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:16,915
Hi, Sam.

89
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:19,517
Oh. Hi.

90
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:22,654
So, um, this is just...

91
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:24,522
I'm sorry, but thank you so much.

92
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:26,658
What?

93
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:30,662
Uh, you can get out of
that make-up and go home.

94
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:33,031
Home to the hotel?

95
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,034
No. Home to Los Angeles.

96
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:38,169
Oh.

97
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:40,438
Oh.

98
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:42,607
Got it. I'm fired.

99
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:44,042
No. Not exactly.

100
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:45,495
They decided that,

101
00:04:45,496 --> 00:04:47,323
instead of the Horvan
Crystal getting destroyed

102
00:04:47,347 --> 00:04:48,987
and then having to come
back to the planet

103
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:50,593
to seek the source,
they're just going to go

104
00:04:50,617 --> 00:04:51,983
straight to the Peevan Galaxy.

105
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:53,685
Oh. No. Totally.

106
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:56,087
Also, we, uh, would really appreciate it

107
00:04:56,156 --> 00:04:58,757
if you didn't divulge any of
the story points to the public

108
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:00,859
or post any selfies
while still in make-up.

109
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:03,628
Copy that.

110
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:04,963
Hi.

111
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,699
Can we smoke in your cab?

112
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:13,438
How many kids do you have, Curtis?

113
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:15,273
I got four kids, man.

114
00:05:15,342 --> 00:05:17,242
Are any of them named Curtis?

115
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,244
Uh-huh. No, them all girl, you see,

116
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:21,980
but I'm on working on
getting me a Curtis,

117
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:24,416
and I will not quit until I get me one.

118
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:27,752
So how many kids you got, darling?

119
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,554
I have three girls.

120
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:31,022
Is the daddy a good man?

121
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,426
Um... uh...

122
00:05:34,494 --> 00:05:35,527
I get the picture.

123
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:36,728
That's why, cuz,

124
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:38,329
I will never, never leave my children.

125
00:05:38,398 --> 00:05:39,731
Never.

126
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,700
Yeah, so you get to
tuck them in every night,

127
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:43,868
right, Daddy?

128
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:46,905
Soon come. They live in Jamaica.

129
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,745
- Yoo-hoo!
- Hi, Mom.

130
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:55,616
- Hello, darling.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

131
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:57,031
- Hi.
- Don't come over here.

132
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:58,418
Don't come over here. Don't come...

133
00:05:58,419 --> 00:05:59,684
Have a good day, Mom.

134
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:02,231
- What are you doing?
- I got to go...

135
00:06:02,255 --> 00:06:03,488
What are you doing?

136
00:06:03,557 --> 00:06:05,156
I just got back from working in Canada.

137
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:08,526
Canada? You know, it's legal
to be a prostitute there.

138
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:09,828
Fascinating, isn't it?

139
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:11,329
If you're not a child.

140
00:06:11,398 --> 00:06:13,932
It's illegal to pay for a prostitute,

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,667
but it's legal to be one.

142
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:19,037
Oh. Good. Well, anyway...

143
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:22,974
... they let me go a day early, so...

144
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:24,909
Where are the girls?

145
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:26,744
Well, I assume they're here,

146
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:29,881
although they don't answer
their phones to torture me.

147
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,249
Susie's with them.

148
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:33,084
Oh. Why didn't you ask me to watch them

149
00:06:33,153 --> 00:06:34,886
- when you were gone?
- Oh, that's okay.

150
00:06:34,955 --> 00:06:36,154
Well, anyway, it's impossible

151
00:06:36,223 --> 00:06:37,228
because I couldn't have done

152
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,068
because we have a neighborhood
watch meeting

153
00:06:39,092 --> 00:06:40,592
to discuss disaster response.

154
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,361
Mom, I want to go inside now.

155
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,629
Yes. I know.

156
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:45,897
- Okay.
- Hold on a minute

157
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:47,532
because what I wanted to tell you

158
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:49,767
was that I'm building up my muscles.

159
00:06:49,836 --> 00:06:51,302
And look. Look at my arm.

160
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:52,882
- That's good. Good.
- No, look. Feel it.

161
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:55,039
- Nope.
- Because what's interesting

162
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:56,908
is that my nail is falling off,

163
00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:58,754
- and that's disgusting.
- No. Mom, I don't...

164
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:00,545
The muscles are really, really good.

165
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:01,813
- Go on, feel them, Sam.
- No.

166
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:03,147
Let me see yours, then.

167
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:05,383
No, Mom! I don't want to stand outside

168
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:08,620
and compare bodies with you
like we're grooming chimps.

169
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:11,489
I'm sorry.

170
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:13,691
Time to go home now, though.

171
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:16,594
You certainly told me.

172
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:18,663
Yes. Home. Now.

173
00:07:18,732 --> 00:07:20,031
All right.

174
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,802
Ohh.

175
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:37,181
Oh, shit.

176
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:42,053
Oh, shit.

177
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:44,489
Hello.

178
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:13,551
No, Mom. I mean, you weren't even
supposed to be home today.

179
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,986
We would have cleaned it all up.

180
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:17,422
This... This doesn't even count.

181
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,690
Sam?

182
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,193
Hi, Susie.

183
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:23,528
Hi.

184
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:26,531
Susie, I didn't mean it.

185
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,333
I didn't mean hi.

186
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:30,034
Sorry.

187
00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:32,637
Where is Duke?

188
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:34,372
Duke is sleeping at Lam's house,

189
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:35,840
and Max...

190
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,810
I don't give a shit
where Max is right now.

191
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:41,446
Mom, you're freakazoid.

192
00:08:41,514 --> 00:08:43,014
Please stop freaking out

193
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,627
so we don't have to send
you to a mental hospital.

194
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:45,917
This is what I'm going to do.

195
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:47,852
I'm going to go upstairs
and take a long nap,

196
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:49,587
like Susie got to,

197
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:52,724
and then I'm going to come downstairs,

198
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,759
and all of this is going
to be cleaned up.

199
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:57,996
Mom, I can't. I have soccer, remember?

200
00:08:58,064 --> 00:08:59,998
Are you taking me to soccer?

201
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,633
I'll take her.

202
00:09:07,538 --> 00:09:08,938
Hello.

203
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,506
Hi, Mom.

204
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:12,475
Hello, darling.

205
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:14,744
Uh, tell me about your muscles

206
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:15,757
and the water thing.

207
00:09:15,758 --> 00:09:17,947
You can do it now if you want.

208
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:22,485
Oh. Well, you know Marshall Sanders.

209
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:24,920
Uh, well, he's the watch commander,

210
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:28,224
and his wife died last year,

211
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:30,493
and I don't know whether
I'm making it up,

212
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:32,661
but I think he's got his eye on me

213
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,598
because do you remember how he looked
at me in the grocery store?

214
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:36,877
And then I thought to myself,

215
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,236
God, "watch commander"... Aptly named.

216
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:41,670
But I might be wrong. Anyway,

217
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:42,905
but the thing is,

218
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:44,573
I was very, very pleased

219
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:46,509
that he chose me to
be in charge of water

220
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:48,744
because I thought it was
quite a responsible position,

221
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:51,147
don't you think? It is, isn't it?

222
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,517
And so I've got to be very on the ball

223
00:09:54,585 --> 00:09:55,985
in case there's an earthquake.

224
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,720
Uh, and then he'll be pleased with me,

225
00:09:57,789 --> 00:09:58,754
don't you think?

226
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:01,624
Anyway,

227
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:04,260
so the doctor says
I'm losing muscle mass,

228
00:10:04,328 --> 00:10:06,028
- but he's a liar.
- Uh-huh.

229
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:08,297
And he can't tell me
what's happening to my body

230
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:09,965
because I know.

231
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:13,969
So I'm trying to decide
if I should sue him.

232
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:16,038
What do you think?

233
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:17,773
And then he'd stop.

234
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:28,851
Phil.

235
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,052
Yes, darling?

236
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:31,987
Do you have any vodka?

237
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:34,190
I always have vodka.

238
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:43,232
What was the name of the man

239
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:45,534
that you were dating
when you met my dad?

240
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:50,039
Audrey.

241
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,240
That's right.

242
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,742
That's amazing. Audrey.

243
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:54,810
Hmm.

244
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,146
He swept me off my feet.

245
00:10:57,215 --> 00:10:59,148
Then why didn't you marry him?

246
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:01,517
Oh, no, no. You don't marry the man

247
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:03,152
who sweeps you off your feet.

248
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:05,421
You marry the man
who pulls you back down

249
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,755
and grounds you,

250
00:11:06,824 --> 00:11:08,491
takes care of you.

251
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,926
My dad.

252
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:12,828
No.

253
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,865
What do you mean?

254
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:20,636
I met Audrey in 1960,

255
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:24,273
and I fell in love immediately.

256
00:11:24,342 --> 00:11:28,611
And he took me to New Zealand
to live by a vineyard

257
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:34,049
while he picked grapes
for about five cents a pound.

258
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:36,552
And then I met Joseph,

259
00:11:36,621 --> 00:11:38,687
and he was an American businessman.

260
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:41,624
He was very small and serious.

261
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:43,459
And he saw me in the Village,

262
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:47,496
and he said, "I'm gonna marry you,"

263
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:51,167
and told me how much he made

264
00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:53,636
and he could provide for me,

265
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:58,874
and so I grew up,
and I said yes to Joseph.

266
00:11:58,943 --> 00:12:01,343
What the hell?

267
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:04,346
What the hell, Mom. I
don't know this story.

268
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:06,348
What happened to Joseph?

269
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:09,385
Well, we were getting ready

270
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:11,587
to go back to the States
the get married,

271
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:13,756
and I said good-bye to Audrey.

272
00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:18,093
But then Joseph died.

273
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:23,365
Jesus. He died?

274
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:25,301
He drowned.

275
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:29,205
He got drunk and fell in a puddle.

276
00:12:29,273 --> 00:12:31,273
Well, it was raining.

277
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:34,810
And so then I went back to Audrey.

278
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,080
And then two years later,
I met your father.

279
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:46,555
So why did you marry my dad?

280
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:50,292
I don't know.

281
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:52,428
Why'd you marry him?

282
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:53,963
I don't know...

283
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:55,531
Why'd you marry my dad?

284
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:36,406
So are you ever gonna say something?

285
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:38,842
About what?

286
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,577
Oh, my God. Nothing.

287
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:44,781
Are you ever gonna say something?

288
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,915
About what?

289
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:48,351
Oh! About my dad leaving.

290
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,787
What?

291
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:52,722
Yeah, I didn't think so.

292
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,193
Max, you had a party.

293
00:13:57,262 --> 00:14:00,263
No, it wasn't a
party. And anyway, you left.

294
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:05,035
- I had to work.
- God, you don't have to work, Mom.

295
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:09,606
What? How do you think
we ever have anything?

296
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:13,410
You work because you wanna be famous.

297
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,246
Dad told me. You have tons
of money in savings,

298
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,482
and he is living like shit.

299
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:22,252
This is so unfair that I
think I'm gonna pass out.

300
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,251
Oh, my God. Yeah, Mom,
you're the victim.

301
00:14:24,252 --> 00:14:26,389
Everything is unfair.

302
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:36,633
Max, I try like hell
to be fair to your father

303
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:38,334
and not put you in the middle.

304
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:41,337
I'm human, but I do try that.

305
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:46,643
But you're 16 now, and that's
old enough to know how unfair it is

306
00:14:46,712 --> 00:14:49,312
what you just said to me.

307
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:51,981
You know, it really disgusts me

308
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,250
how you will sometimes say anything

309
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:57,420
to avoid
responsibility for your mistakes.

310
00:14:57,489 --> 00:15:03,059
You had a party, and
you wrecked the house.

311
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:05,095
You're not the first kid to do that.

312
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:07,230
It's not the end of the world.

313
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:10,600
Then why are you acting like it is?

314
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:13,269
Because you make me get this mad

315
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:16,112
before you even look up from your phone!

316
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:19,943
And you act like your shit don't stink

317
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:21,489
and you shouldn't answer for anything.

318
00:15:21,513 --> 00:15:22,746
But you know what, baby?

319
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:24,647
Your shit does stink.

320
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,951
And your father lives better than I do!

321
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,086
And I pay for all of it!

322
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:42,532
Answer your phone.

323
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:47,804
Hello?

324
00:15:47,873 --> 00:15:50,151
If you can meet me somewhere tomorrow
at ten in the morning,

325
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:52,809
then we can do it maybe even twice.

326
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:54,210
I have a meeting at noon.

327
00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:57,814
Yes, I will be there then.

328
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:00,683
Bye.

329
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:07,991
20 years instead kids

330
00:16:07,992 --> 00:16:09,764
they never left, they
let... It's like this amazing story.

331
00:16:09,788 --> 00:16:11,319
So I asked if I could do my project,

332
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,647
like, I have three of my friends
stay in my basement for, like, a month.

333
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:16,238
And then we all write about it afterwards
to see what it felt like.

334
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:19,062
And it was like...
Mom, are you listening?

335
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:22,966
- Yes. What? Tell me.
- Ugh! Mom, listen.

336
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:25,380
- Okay, go. - I'm telling you about
this because it's important!

337
00:16:25,404 --> 00:16:27,204
Frankie, don't speak
to your mother like that!

338
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:29,551
Ugh! Anyway, my teacher was
like, "No, you can't do that."

339
00:16:29,575 --> 00:16:31,141
But I was like, "Oh, This is just so...

340
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,644
- Mommy, I don't get what this is.
- Oh, my God!

341
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:34,878
- Frankie!
- Hey!

342
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:36,613
Stop. Save it for later.

343
00:16:36,682 --> 00:16:39,583
Oh, I wanna kill everybody.

344
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:42,355
- Calm down.
- Mommy, what is this ever gonna do?

345
00:16:42,356 --> 00:16:44,928
It's this women and girls empowerment
thing, and it's annoying.

346
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,291
Women and girls empowerment is annoying?

347
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,892
It is the way my school does it.

348
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:51,595
The people get up there
and they talk and they ruin it.

349
00:16:51,664 --> 00:16:53,864
Oh, well, I'll try not to ruin it.

350
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:55,799
Now, come on, we're
here for your mother.

351
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:57,401
- No, we're not.
- Yes, we are.

352
00:16:57,469 --> 00:16:59,203
Hey, Patty.

353
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:01,905
Sam, thank God you're here.

354
00:17:01,974 --> 00:17:03,473
Hi, Miss Donner. Donner, Donner...

355
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,142
Did you think I wasn't gonna come?

356
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:07,244
Well, two of my speakers flaked on me.

357
00:17:07,313 --> 00:17:09,446
- Oh, my God.
- I'm gonna start.

358
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:12,449
- Okay, so who's on first?
- It's just you.

359
00:17:12,518 --> 00:17:15,252
- Oh, shit.
- Darling!

360
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:17,054
Okay? I'm starting.

361
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:19,423
- Donner, Donner, Donner, Donner.
- God!

362
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:23,427
I am so happy you all could come

363
00:17:23,495 --> 00:17:27,097
to our women and girls
empowerment seminar.

364
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,215
We have one guest speaker.

365
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,308
And tonight she's
gonna speak about being a mom

366
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:35,778
- and having a career.
- Nobody cares.

367
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:40,349
Please welcome our very own Sam Fox.

368
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:42,751
Oof.

369
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:47,923
Yeah, Mom! Go, Mom!

370
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:59,101
Thank you, Patty.

371
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,670
Um, well...

372
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:05,641
I work and I am a mom.

373
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:09,611
And some of you might later in life

374
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,183
find yourselves in the
same situation, I hope.

375
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:20,155
Because you girls
can be anything you want.

376
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,057
You know, when I was a girl,

377
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:25,127
no one ever really said
that women had jobs,

378
00:18:25,196 --> 00:18:28,430
except Marlo Thomas
and Mary Tyler Moore.

379
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:31,533
Thank you, Henry.

380
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:35,404
But, uh...

381
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:38,006
we can do it all!

382
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,176
And we have to do it all,
because in the end,

383
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:45,247
the mom, the women,
are the ones left watching.

384
00:18:52,189 --> 00:18:53,722
Okay, this is...

385
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:59,061
Let me ask you all a question.

386
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:02,698
How many girls out there
get your period?

387
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:06,735
Yeah, you heard me.

388
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:11,139
If anybody here has got their
period yet, put your hand up.

389
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,875
Put your hand up. It's okay.

390
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,376
It's okay.

391
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,345
Who's cotton-holing?

392
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:18,013
I know, gross.

393
00:19:18,082 --> 00:19:20,682
But we're all girls and women here.

394
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:22,117
It's just us.

395
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:25,587
So come on, Frankie, help me out.

396
00:19:25,656 --> 00:19:28,590
- Mom!
- Come on, raise your hand.

397
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:31,360
Listen, Frankie and I
went through it last week.

398
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:34,769
She was stealing her sister's
tampons for half a year before she told me.

399
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:36,598
- Mom!
- Frankie.

400
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:37,900
Be a leader. Get your hand up.

401
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,002
- Mom!
- Help 'em out.

402
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:43,939
Good girl! There!

403
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:46,308
Anybody else? Who
else here? Who's bleeding?

404
00:19:46,377 --> 00:19:50,112
There you go! Good! So brave!

405
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,814
Come on, moms, let's hear it for them.

406
00:19:52,883 --> 00:19:57,152
All right, who here has
not gotten their period yet?

407
00:19:57,221 --> 00:19:59,855
Wow! Okay!

408
00:19:59,924 --> 00:20:02,557
Well, you girls are in
for it. You really are.

409
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:04,593
But we all got your backs, right?

410
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:08,196
Who here is having
their period right now?

411
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:10,599
I know I am! Can you tell?

412
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,334
All right! Thank you!

413
00:20:12,403 --> 00:20:15,337
Mrs. Donner! Yeah!

414
00:20:15,406 --> 00:20:18,240
Moms? Thank you! Hands, hands.

415
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:21,243
Sisters all!

416
00:20:21,312 --> 00:20:26,715
Who here has stopped getting
their period altogether?

417
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:29,718
Aunt Flo has left the station forever.

418
00:20:31,221 --> 00:20:34,122
Mom. Mom.

419
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,727
Thank you!

420
00:20:38,796 --> 00:20:41,663
Thank you for that! Thank you!

421
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:47,836
Look, we're all girls,
and we're all women.

422
00:20:47,905 --> 00:20:51,073
And we all bleed, and we all suffer.

423
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:54,643
And then the bleeding stops,
and we still suffer.

424
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,345
But you're gonna find your own path,

425
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:59,548
because we're tough, and we can take it.

426
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:01,950
And as long as you believe in yourself,

427
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:04,553
and you take care of each other

428
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:06,321
and watch out for each other,

429
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,590
you just make the
rest up as you go along.

430
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:10,425
That's all there is to it.

431
00:21:10,494 --> 00:21:12,894
That's it! Thank you!

432
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:15,664
Thank you! Thank you, Detroit!

433
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:27,175
Good job, Mom. Also, I hate you.

434
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,691
I know. It's okay.

435
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:43,748
- Okay.
- Yeah.

436
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:46,451
Do you have a condom?

437
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:51,289
- No.
- You need to use a condom.

438
00:21:55,162 --> 00:21:57,295
You never asked me before.

439
00:21:57,364 --> 00:21:58,763
I know.

440
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:01,947
Shit.

441
00:22:02,002 --> 00:22:05,637
- Wait, wait. I'll be right back.
- What?

442
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:07,105
Stay.

443
00:22:25,154 --> 00:22:30,273

444

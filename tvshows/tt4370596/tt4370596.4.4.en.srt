00:00:26,015 --> 00:00:31,857
BETTER THINGS

3
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,128
- I'm getting the worst hands.
- Me, too.

4
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:25,424
Don't say those words.
The P.C. police might show up

5
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:30,681
and arrest me for playing cards alone
with you three gorgeous women.

6
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:34,437
I think all this Me Too stuff is good.

7
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,482
Seeing all those horrible men
being taken down.

8
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:40,653
Lord knows I wish my daddy would be
around to get his reckoning.

9
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:43,073
Oh, things used to be so different.

10
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:46,494
I'd probably be in prison
for ten life sentences.

11
00:03:48,873 --> 00:03:53,337
Kidding ! Just kidding !
I can't even joke anymore ?

12
00:03:53,421 --> 00:03:57,968
Whenever a man would pinch my behind,
I took it as a compliment.

13
00:03:58,052 --> 00:04:00,263
And I would pinch him right back.

14
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,229
My sexuality was my greatest asset.

15
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,566
I didn't have higher education.
I couldn't type.

16
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:11,528
And yet I got hired for every job
I ever applied to,

17
00:04:11,612 --> 00:04:14,741
and I knew it was because of the way
I looked.

18
00:04:16,285 --> 00:04:19,539
- Hi !
- Hi !

19
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:26,632
- Phil ?
- What ?

20
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:30,930
It's today.
We're not putting it off anymore.

21
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:32,765
Give me your spit.

22
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:35,895
- What is it ?
- I think it's a DNA test.

23
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:41,152
No, I don't want to. And the advances
of my co-workers were just part of it.

24
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,363
- Part of what ?
- Not your business.

25
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,492
Okay. That's fine.
Let's go. Come on.

26
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:49,204
Let's just do it today.
You guys don't mind for one sec ?

27
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:51,582
She promised me she would do this.
Spit in here.

28
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,086
- Stop it !
- Spit in here, it'll be fun.

29
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:58,300
No !
It does not sound fun to me.

30
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:01,471
I have no interest in some Irish
third cousin I've never heard of

31
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:03,473
tracking me down,
trying to get money out of me.

32
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,060
This is so annoying,
you said you would do this.

33
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:07,813
- I'm not going to do it.
- You're gonna do it.

34
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:09,565
- I'm not going to do it.
- I'm gonna get you.

35
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:12,068
- You're not.
- Goddamn it, Phil.

36
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:14,321
- Phil. Stay.
- No !

37
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:17,826
- Phil... Stop it !
- I'm not going to do it.

38
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,789
Phil, you want me to chase you ?
I will chase you.

39
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:24,335
- You'll never catch me.
- You're not... Phyllis ! Phil, you...

40
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:26,004
- Mom !
- No !

41
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:28,257
- Phyllis !
- I won't.

42
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,470
This is silly. You are such a child.

43
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:34,599
- Phil ! Goddamn it.
- I'm not going.

44
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:38,646
Fine. I'm not letting you through. No.
Mom.

45
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,190
I'm taking you down.

46
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,902
Mom, give me your spit.

47
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:44,946
- Stop.
- What ?

48
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,949
Spit.

49
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:50,537
Not just one spit,
you got to fill the phone vial.

50
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,337
- Jesus, I may puke.
- I may puke.

51
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:58,214
Just do it.

52
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:09,354
There, go away, for God's sake.

53
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:15,112
Jesus. I better be Samoan or something
cool worth doing this for.

54
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:16,781
- Bye.
- Bye.

55
00:06:16,948 --> 00:06:20,870
Hey, Sam. What do you call Jewish girls
that won't give blow jobs ?

56
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:24,458
Married. Ha ! Good one, Hal.

57
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:29,089
- See ? She doesn't mind.
- Oh, my God.

58
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,551
You're a dirty old man.

59
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:33,512
I like it.

60
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:41,314
After seeing three other doctors,

61
00:06:41,397 --> 00:06:45,904
only Dr. Ballinger was able to make me
pain-free again.

62
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:48,490
Dr. Ballinger is a miracle worker.

63
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,250
Thank you.

64
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:06,640
What are you in for ?

65
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:09,686
Eh, wear and tear.

66
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:13,608
- I don't got a good story.
- Same.

67
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:15,944
When did your hands start to go bad ?

68
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:20,701
When I was about 78 to 79,
not too long ago.

69
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:25,290
So, what should we do ?

70
00:07:25,707 --> 00:07:30,088
Oh, man.
I think I'm a little emotional.

71
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:33,301
It took me six months
to get this appointment.

72
00:07:33,384 --> 00:07:36,847
- Why'd you wait so long ?
- Because you...

73
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:42,397
Anyway, I'm here now,
so I will do whatever it takes.

74
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,441
I know you're the miracle worker.

75
00:07:44,524 --> 00:07:49,364
Whatever you want to do P.T., O.T,
supplements, steroids.

76
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:53,954
Well, this side is mild to moderate.

77
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:57,375
And this is moderate to severe.

78
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:04,718
Your hands are much older than you are.

79
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:08,891
- May I touch you ?
- Yeah.

80
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:12,354
- This hurt ?
- Yeah.

81
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:18,487
- How about this ?
- Yeah.

82
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:25,413
Yep. Your muscles have atrophied.

83
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:29,752
Jesus !
Well, what about physical therapy ?

84
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,342
Won't help. Listen, I'm a surgeon,
I would love to go in there and cut,

85
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:36,887
but your hand could wind up like this.

86
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:40,350
Well, what about all the patient
testimonials in the waiting room ?

87
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:43,145
How am I supposed to function without
opposable thumbs ?

88
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:47,568
I'm sorry, Sam. The technology just
isn't here for what you've got, yet.

89
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:50,614
You are a lot younger than your hands.

90
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:56,705
Jesus. That's the first time in forever
anyone ever said I was young.

91
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:59,083
This blows dead donkey dicks.

92
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:01,962
Well, you don't need hands for that.

93
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:05,843
It's true.

94
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,433
Yello ?

95
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:15,564
Sam, quick thought. I spoke with my
producers, and we want to move you up.

96
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:17,150
Oh, wow. Really ?

97
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:21,364
Yeah, I can't stop thinking about you.
And then I started thinking about me.

98
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:24,952
I just got tired of being
some gun for hire, you know ?

99
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:28,623
Fuck, I'm gonna be 30 in five minutes.

100
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:31,586
- Yeah.
- You need to prepare yourself, Sam.

101
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:34,965
You're gonna wake up and be 50,
and then what are you gonna do ?

102
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:38,929
Well,
I hadn't actually thought about that.

103
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,350
You need to have something of your own,
right ?

104
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:45,855
Because if we don't come up with it,
then nobody else is gonna do it.

105
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:48,859
Yeah. Fuck yeah.

106
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:52,322
And I'm aware of the irony here,
that technically you're my hired gun.

107
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:54,951
That's okay. I'm okay with the irony.

108
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:59,457
But I really want you to make this your
own thing. I think you are brilliant,

109
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,213
and I want that Sam Fox brilliant brain
splattered all over my show.

110
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:06,758
That is cool.

111
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:10,638
Can you say how brilliant you think
I am to my daughters ?

112
00:10:10,805 --> 00:10:13,142
See ? Fucking hilarious !

113
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:15,645
I am so excited. I discovered you.

114
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:19,025
I want everybody to know that you never
existed before this moment.

115
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:21,904
It's gonna be amazing. Think of some
ideas, and then we'll chat.

116
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:26,034
I cannot even begin to tell you
how excited I am about this.

117
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:02,751
Okay.

118
00:11:04,336 --> 00:11:07,590
Okay, boy. Okay, boy.

119
00:11:08,425 --> 00:11:10,553
Okay, boy.

120
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:15,434
Gonna get somebody to...

121
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:19,106
- Is it gone ?
- Nope.

122
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:23,362
- Why isn't it leaving ?
- It's probably just scared.

123
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:28,535
Maybe it got a letter from Hogwarts.

124
00:11:28,702 --> 00:11:31,957
Mom, this is serious.
An owl in the house is bad luck.

125
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,168
Don't say that !

126
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:37,381
So, owls have traditionally seen
as a harbinger of death,

127
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:40,844
but they can also be a sign of change
and fertility.

128
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,179
So which is it ?

129
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:45,225
We should take the snake out.

130
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:48,479
- Owls eat snakes, shit licker.
- Not baby ones.

131
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:52,943
- So you want to murder a baby owl ?
- No. That ain't no baby owl.

132
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:56,490
- No, I just want to scare it off.
- You want me to go get my dad ?

133
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:58,409
I'm gonna go get my dad.

134
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:13,429
Did she just go in there ?

135
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,316
Why do you have a penis on the wall ?

136
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:25,863
- We have a lot of penises on the wall.
- We've lots of penises on the wall.

137
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:33,790
We should really take the penises off
the wall. It's not good with company.

138
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:36,836
Hi, I'm Duke.

139
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,815
I promise I'll be careful,

140
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:55,945
if you promise not to peck my eyes out.

141
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:11,883
Take the penises off the wall.

142
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:25,777
- Cool.
- Oh, my gosh. Look at its little beak.

143
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:28,906
- What ?
- You don't touch it.

144
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,371
With the finger oil, his mother may
kill him or not come back or something.

145
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:37,126
Mom, that's a myth. You just want to be
careful, you don't want to hurt it.

146
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:46,806
Oh, my God. Be careful.

147
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:48,892
So soft.

148
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:54,441
Little guy, we got to get you back
where you belong.

149
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:59,489
I got to, like,
call animal control or something.

150
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,826
- We should name it first.
- What's his name ?

151
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:05,372
- Edwin.
- Oh, my God. It's perfect.

152
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,960
Edwin, oh, my God.

153
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:11,965
- The softest thing in the world.
- Okay, let's get him to... because...

154
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:14,635
- Be careful, be careful, be careful.
- I got it.

155
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:17,096
- Oh, my God.
- You're, like, his mommy.

156
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:23,230
- Hi, José.
- Hey. Hi, Sam.

157
00:14:23,313 --> 00:14:24,774
Hi.

158
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:27,903
Everything okay ?

159
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:32,367
Yeah. The pets are fine, it's just that
I had them take away the girls.

160
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:36,122
- Couldn't housebreak them.
- Reinita's behaving herself ?

161
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:38,375
Oh, yeah. She's the best.
I'm keeping her.

162
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:41,171
She made a list for me the other day.

163
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:44,383
All the colleges she wants to go to,
all out of state.

164
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,593
And she said,

165
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,556
"papi, if I get into these schools,
can you help pay for them ?"

166
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,725
What can I say to that ? I want to give
her everything, you know ?

167
00:14:50,892 --> 00:14:52,686
Yeah, she's a really great kid.

168
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,315
Between that and her quinceañera
next month,

169
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:58,027
my wife thinks we should move
to Phoenix to save money.

170
00:14:58,194 --> 00:14:59,278
Really ?

171
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:02,241
What am I supposed to do for work ?
Nothing grows there.

172
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:07,373
- You know, maybe we should team up ?
- What do you mean ?

173
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,335
Frankie was talking about doing
one of those...

174
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:11,837
- A quinceañera ?
- Yeah.

175
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:14,007
But aren't you guys Jewish ?

176
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:16,677
Even though I do bring you
a Christmas tree every Hanukkah.

177
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,888
Yeah.

178
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:22,310
No, is that weird ? Is that bad ?

179
00:15:22,393 --> 00:15:24,896
They're a lot of fun. She should.

180
00:15:25,063 --> 00:15:27,567
Hey, have you seen your new trees ?

181
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,155
Grapefruit, Meyer lemon and kumquat.
You like the pots ?

182
00:15:31,238 --> 00:15:32,824
- They're so gorgeous !
- Yeah ?

183
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:34,785
Thank you, José. I love it.

184
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:38,540
- José, I'm so glad you haven't left.
- Oh, hi.

185
00:15:38,623 --> 00:15:42,253
It seems you've pruned the wrong
branches on my plum tree.

186
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:45,466
- ¿Qué ? I'm pretty sure I didn't.
- Afraid you did.

187
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:47,635
- Okay, I'll go check it out, then.
- No, no, no, no.

188
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:50,139
What are you doing ?
It's not your day.

189
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:52,809
I know that, but he likes my latkes.
Come along, José.

190
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:55,312
- No.
- She made it a little weird.

191
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:58,609
Oh, my God ! That's so rude.

192
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:00,987
- Sam, I got it.
- He won't be long.

193
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,990
- I'm coming, Phil.
- Phil !

194
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:05,409
- Be nice !
- I will.

195
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:11,960
Is this the Meyer lemon ?
I love it.

196
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,800
Mom ! Mom !

197
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:22,349
Mom, can Pepper start the El Camino ?
Just, just start it.

198
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:24,894
Oh ! God, geez !

199
00:16:24,978 --> 00:16:26,813
Say yes, Sam !

200
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:31,236
- Oh, God. Just don't tell your mom !
- Oh, my God !

201
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:40,874
- Your chariot, miss.
- Oh, thank you, kindly.

202
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:03,404
What happened ? What happened ?
What happened ?

203
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:06,033
Oh, okay, let me see.

204
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:11,374
Raise your hand in the air. I got you.
I got you. It's okay, it's okay.

205
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:14,628
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.
Let me just wrap it up.

206
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:18,216
- What is wrong with you ?
- I'm sorry, I can't help it.

207
00:17:18,383 --> 00:17:19,885
Get a towel !

208
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:21,637
- Is it bad ?
- It's okay, baby.

209
00:17:21,804 --> 00:17:25,476
No, honey, honey, just calm down.
Lay your head back.

210
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,982
Yeah, you just cut it a little bit,
sweetie. Yes, it's okay. It's okay.

211
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:33,111
Hey, Mom,
is it qualm with or qualm about ?

212
00:17:33,195 --> 00:17:35,990
- Mom !
- Frankie, call Pepper's mom.

213
00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:38,911
It's okay, honey.

214
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:41,289
Mom, Chewy's got something.

215
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:43,959
- Chewy, release !
- What is that ? Come here, come here.

216
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:47,547
Duke, Duke, where are the keys ?
Duke, where are the keys ?!

217
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:50,426
- I don't know.
- Looks like a worm or something.

218
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,012
- Duke !
- Pepper has them.

219
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:53,722
- Okay. Okay.
- He swallowed it.

220
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:57,311
Oh, God. Oh, shit.

221
00:17:57,394 --> 00:17:59,981
Oh, Jesus.
It's okay. That's fine.

222
00:18:00,064 --> 00:18:02,568
That's fine. No, no, no, no, no.
Don't look at that.

223
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:06,198
Pepper ? Pepper ! Okay. Frankie !

224
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:12,373
Good boy. What a good poop. Yes, a good
poop. Good boy. Who made a good poop ?

225
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:14,459
- Mom, where's my black dress ?
- What ?

226
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,336
- Like, with the neck.
- Check your closet.

227
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:18,339
No, it's not there,
and I have to go to work.

228
00:18:18,423 --> 00:18:19,549
Well, I'm sorry.

229
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,845
I'm kind of busy 'cause I have to sift
through Chewy's shit right now,

230
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:23,972
so maybe you can just look yourself ?

231
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:25,933
Mom. That's disgusting.

232
00:18:26,016 --> 00:18:28,061
Yeah, and she's probably gonna have to
put him down, too.

233
00:18:28,144 --> 00:18:29,312
- What ?
- Frankie !

234
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,315
- He tasted human flesh.
- Mom, you can't kill Chewy !

235
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:33,860
- Nobody's killing Chewy.
- Mom, I'm gonna be late.

236
00:18:33,943 --> 00:18:34,987
So wear something else.

237
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,657
I can't wear something else
'cause I have my period.

238
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:39,910
Max, can you just check
the laundry room,

239
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,707
because I'm sorry, full disclosure,
I forgot to put the load in last night.

240
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,709
- Sorry.
- Mom, the laundry ?

241
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,713
- And, Duke, no one's killing anyone.
- Promise ?

242
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:52,343
Yes, I promise. Chewy's gonna be
around for a long time,

243
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:54,680
unless that coyote comes back.

244
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:59,228
Mom, if you don't do the laundry
and we think you are, it's messed up.

245
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:01,940
I was counting on that to be clean.

246
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:03,817
So sorry.

247
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,988
Oh, my God.
I didn't check the laundry.

248
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,335
Mom, get out. Oh, my God. Nothing fits.
I'm so bloated.

249
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:23,093
I'm sorry that you feel bad, but you
have to learn to rein this shit in.

250
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:26,348
I never took my period out on anybody
the way that you do.

251
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:30,603
Sorry, Mom. Maybe I should just go,
like, lie down in my trailer, right ?

252
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,107
- What ?
- This is actual work, Mom.

253
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,694
I have to be on my feet all night.
It's not like some movie set.

254
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:40,074
Max. I know you're a little stressed
out, and this is your first job,

255
00:19:40,158 --> 00:19:43,621
but that doesn't mean you get to be
super shitty to me whenever you want.

256
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:46,625
Mom, I'm not being super shitty.
You're so dramatic.

257
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,754
I can't believe I still have to put up
with this bullshit.

258
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:53,217
You realize you live here rent-free,
right ? You do realize that ?

259
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:56,013
Oh, you want me to go ? I'll go.
I am fucking gone.

260
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:58,141
- Good.
- The second I save up some money.

261
00:19:58,307 --> 00:20:00,394
You have a paycheck.
What's stopping you ?

262
00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:02,396
- You think I won't ?
- Goodbye.

263
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,983
Good. Your dirty dress
is in the laundry room.

264
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,569
My dad said I can live with him
whenever I want.

265
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:11,200
Oh, that old chestnut. Perfect.
That's great. Go, go. Great.

266
00:20:11,283 --> 00:20:13,453
- Great.
- Great.

267
00:20:13,536 --> 00:20:15,623
- Great.
- Great.

268
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:19,753
You know what would be great, Max ?
If you helped me.

269
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:22,382
It would be great if you helped me.

270
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:26,053
If you cleaned up after yourself,
that would be great.

271
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:29,391
If you helped me with your sisters,
that would be great.

272
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:32,604
Kids aren't supposed to help their mom.
Their mom is supposed to help them.

273
00:20:32,771 --> 00:20:34,273
Oh, is that the law ?

274
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:37,444
I didn't realize that I was breaking,
like, the Mommy Law.

275
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,947
Yeah. And great job you're doing,
by the way, Mom.

276
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,534
Frankie basically does
whatever the fuck she wants,

277
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:44,745
and I'm probably gonna be fired now.

278
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:49,335
Oh, yeah. I'm bad. That's bad.
I'm a bad mommy.

279
00:20:49,418 --> 00:20:54,467
No, you're a disaster, Mom. And you
don't always have to be so hard,

280
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,180
just 'cause you don't know
what it's like to be a woman anymore.

281
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:01,351
You cunt.

282
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:05,899
What ?

283
00:21:05,982 --> 00:21:07,943
You're a cunt, Max.

284
00:21:08,027 --> 00:21:12,282
- I'm a cunt ?
- Yep. You're a cunt.

285
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:14,285
You're a cunt.

286
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:16,496
No, Max. You're a cunt.

287
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,252
- No, you're a cunt, Mom.
- No, you're a cunt, Max.

288
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:22,630
- No, you're a fucking cunt, Mom.
- You're a fucking cunt, Max.

289
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:26,301
- No, you're a fucking cunt, Mom.
- You're a fucking cunt, Max.

290
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:28,763
You're a big fucking cunt, Mom.

291
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,849
You're a bit fucking cunt,

292
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:34,813
your sister's an asshole,
and your other sister's great.

293
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:37,775
Thanks, Mom ! Love you, Mom !

294
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:55,174
Oh, my God.

295
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:02,475
- I'm sorry.
- No.

296
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,063
- I am a cunt.
- No, I'm a cunt.

297
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,735
No. You're not. You're the best.

298
00:22:09,818 --> 00:22:11,905
And I am such a cunt.

299
00:22:12,823 --> 00:22:15,034
Well...

300
00:22:17,454 --> 00:22:21,459
My Uncle Sid called me a cunt.
I was nine.

301
00:22:21,543 --> 00:22:24,338
- Uncle Sid ?
- He's dead now.

302
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:27,175
Fuck you, Uncle Sid.

303
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,733
- I love you.
- And I love you.

304
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,154
I don't want you to move out.

305
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,074
But I do.

306
00:22:46,576 --> 00:22:48,579
So you shouldn't.

307
00:22:48,663 --> 00:22:52,960
But please move out soon.
But don't.

308
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,717
- Oh, wow.
- What ?

309
00:22:58,968 --> 00:23:01,931
Just realized you're gonna have to go
through this three times.

310
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:04,601
Oh, Jesus Christ.

310
00:23:05,305 --> 00:24:05,884

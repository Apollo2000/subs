2
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,125
What...

3
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:18,426
Hello.

4
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:21,029
Can... Can I have those?

5
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:23,765
Uh... oh.

6
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:27,068
Of course.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,173
Yeah.

8
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:33,408
Wow.

9
00:00:33,477 --> 00:00:36,177
Your car is messy.

10
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:38,313
You got kids. I can tell that.

11
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:40,215
Yeah, I sure do.

12
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:41,797
Why are you sleeping in your car?

13
00:00:41,798 --> 00:00:43,012
Oh.

14
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:46,149
Uh, I'm tired all the time.

15
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:47,951
I call it Momstein Bar.

16
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:50,373
I try to power nap when I can.

17
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:52,889
Yeah, you got to take them
here and there, right, Mama?

18
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,312
Yeah.

19
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:55,826
Oh, I have to go to Staples, remember?

20
00:00:55,827 --> 00:00:57,926
You promised. I have to get
five things off my list.

21
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:00,033
Wait, Mom. Mom, you're
passing the Goodwill place.

22
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:01,808
- Mom, pay attention!
- Stop!

23
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:04,744
Here. Take the jacket.

24
00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:05,812
Ohh.

25
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:07,567
And what size shoe do you wear?

26
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,280
Thank you. I wear a 8.

27
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:11,182
Because I...

28
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,184
I don't know whose this is,

29
00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:15,286
but these are, like, a 9 or a 10, maybe.

30
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:19,824
Oh, man, you are such a nice lady.

31
00:01:19,892 --> 00:01:21,158
You're pretty.

32
00:01:21,227 --> 00:01:23,294
Thank you. You're pretty.

33
00:01:23,363 --> 00:01:26,330
Oh, no. No. I used to be,

34
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:29,100
but you got to take care of yourself...

35
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:31,102
You know, get your car washed,

36
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,470
get your hair done.

37
00:01:32,538 --> 00:01:35,940
How do you think you're
going to get a nice man

38
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:37,174
to make love to you?

39
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:41,145
Oh. No. None of that for
me. I got rid of him.

40
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:43,047
I'm not talking about a husband.

41
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:45,149
I'm talking about a man.

42
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:48,786
Don't you want a man to be nice to you?

43
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:49,987
Oh.

44
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:51,455
Yeah. Well...

45
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:54,225
I told Paisley we could
to a vintage photo shoot,

46
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:55,459
and I need wardrobe.

47
00:01:55,684 --> 00:01:58,805
♪ Shut up, Maxie, shut up, Maxie ♪

48
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:00,064
Shut your face!

49
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:02,500
Sam, your daughter is a monster.

50
00:02:02,568 --> 00:02:05,102
You can't just be a mama all the time.

51
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:07,405
You got to sometimes be a lady,

52
00:02:07,473 --> 00:02:10,007
with the man putting
his full weight on you,

53
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:11,809
making you feel good.

54
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:13,310
Yeah.

55
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,645
I appreciate that, Diane,

56
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:17,248
but there is zero time
in the mom's schedule

57
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:18,482
for being a lady.

58
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:21,285
Oh, yeah, okay. I hear you with that.

59
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:23,254
I raised four of my own.

60
00:02:23,322 --> 00:02:24,655
So you know.

61
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:29,360
Oh, yeah. I mean, you give
them every second you got.

62
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:31,328
You take them to school.

63
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:33,130
You take them to their friend's house,

64
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,265
music lessons...

65
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,033
- Dance class.
- Yeah, sports.

66
00:02:36,102 --> 00:02:37,935
All those activities.

67
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:39,170
Endless.

68
00:02:39,238 --> 00:02:40,337
I got my oldest.

69
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:42,373
He's a lawyer back in Minnesota.

70
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:44,208
- Wow.
- Yeah.

71
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:45,676
One of them's married in Oregon.

72
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:47,978
Two of them are working back east.

73
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:49,080
They got good lives.

74
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:51,282
And you gave that to them.

75
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,317
Just like you.

76
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:55,352
And now look at me.

77
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:58,389
They leave you with nothing.

78
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:02,159
You got to make time for you, Mama.

79
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:03,461
They take everything,

80
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:05,429
and then you're like me,

81
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:08,065
hoping you find some nice lady

82
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:09,834
to give you a jacket.

83
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,972
Get out.

84
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:15,873
What?

85
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:17,208
What are you doing, Samantha?

86
00:03:17,276 --> 00:03:19,610
- Get out.
- No way, Mom.

87
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:22,113
Mom, you can't just leave us here.

88
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,215
There's a bus stop right there.

89
00:03:24,283 --> 00:03:26,350
Get on the bus. Take it home.

90
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:27,685
Mom, don't be a drama queen.

91
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:30,254
That bus doesn't even go to our house.

92
00:03:30,323 --> 00:03:31,422
No, it doesn't.

93
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:33,424
You're going to take the bus to Ventura,

94
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:35,559
get out, walk up the hill.

95
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:38,496
Bye! Bye! Get out! I mean it!

96
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:40,564
Mom, we're sorry.
We don't need anything.

97
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:43,100
We'll help you with the groceries
when we get home.

98
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:44,135
Please.

100
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:16,801
Shit, I don't know.

101
00:04:17,503 --> 00:04:18,602
Damn it.

102
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:21,505
What did the Network
say about Eliza again?

103
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:24,308
I don't know. She
doesn't pop. Something like that.

104
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:27,044
Uhh. I'm sick of all these ladies.

105
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:30,214
Jen, what did they say about Eliza?

106
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:32,449
Um, the note was she's a bummer.

107
00:04:32,518 --> 00:04:33,717
She is a bummer.

108
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:35,920
I hate that we circle back
to talking about her.

109
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:39,223
The network already approved
Manning Truesome. Let's just cast her.

110
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,225
I'll kill myself first.

111
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:42,526
- George.
- Yeah.

112
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:44,495
Is there anyone we haven't thought of?

113
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:47,231
All right, look. I have someone.

114
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:47,950
Who?

115
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:49,627
She was in a pilot I directed

116
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:51,569
about ten years ago. She was hilarious.

117
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:54,205
Network fired her
because she had no tits.

118
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:55,406
That's not good.

119
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:57,474
Who?

120
00:04:57,543 --> 00:05:00,211
- Sam Fox.
- I used to jerk off to her.

121
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:03,347
No way.

122
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,383
No way. She's, like, 60 now.

123
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:08,552
Possible side effects include nausea,

124
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:11,522
stiffness of joints,
thoughts of suicide,

125
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:15,759
diarrhea, and, in rare cases,
seizures or death.

126
00:05:15,828 --> 00:05:19,296
Yeah, Sam, can you sound a little more

127
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:20,764
cheerful during the disclaimer?

128
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,434
Possible side effects include nausea,

129
00:05:23,502 --> 00:05:25,903
stiffness of joints,
thoughts of suicide,

130
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:31,308
diarrhea, and, in rare cases,
seizures or death.

131
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:33,043
I'm sorry.

132
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:39,350
I'm sorry. I'm trying to sound
cheerful about diarrhea.

133
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:42,219
I'm sorry. Ahem. Diarrhea, sir.

134
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:43,754
Oh, diarrhea, everyone.

135
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:47,725
Is it thoughts of suicide and diarrhea,

136
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:50,461
or is it thoughts of suicide

137
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:53,530
and also thoughts of diarrhea?

138
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,200
There's...

139
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:58,302
I know, buddy. I'm sorry.

140
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,504
What does this drug do anyway?

141
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:01,739
It's a boner maker.

142
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:06,243
Oh. Well, anything for a boner.

143
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:07,278
Yeah, okay.

144
00:06:07,346 --> 00:06:08,812
I mean, although,

145
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:10,748
if a guy has a nice hard dick

146
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:12,783
and he has diarrhea
squirting out the back,

147
00:06:12,852 --> 00:06:16,120
it sort of ruins it,
you know what I mean?

148
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:17,187
Just sort of.

149
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,976
Okay, let's go. Is it you?

150
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:47,952
Shit.

151
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:54,458
Oh.

152
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:56,126
Come on.

153
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:01,231
Bingo.

154
00:07:05,604 --> 00:07:07,304
Seriously?

155
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:08,405
Ohh.

156
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,620
Ohh! No, no, no, no, no,

157
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:25,556
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

158
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,359
Mama, what's happening?

159
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:29,460
Honey, I'm sorry.

160
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:30,627
Mom, what did you do?

161
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:32,563
It's just the smoke detectors.

162
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:33,909
- Oh, my God.
- Mama, I'm scared!

163
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:36,400
- It's okay.
- Mom, call Dad right now!

164
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:37,801
- No!
- What's going on?

165
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,737
Who are all those people in there?

166
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,705
Who cares? Are we going
to die right now?

167
00:07:41,774 --> 00:07:44,341
You idiot! It's just a
frigging smoke detector!

168
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,476
Shut up!

169
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:47,678
Everybody, stop!

170
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:49,680
I am so, so, so sorry.

171
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,749
My God, this is so embarrassing.

172
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:54,018
Shut up, Max! Mommy's doing her best!

173
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:57,654
Mom, call Dad. The firemen
are going to want to talk to Dad.

174
00:07:57,723 --> 00:07:59,757
I can talk to the firemen!

175
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:01,892
I don't need your fucking father!

176
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:06,463
I can talk to a fireman by myself!

177
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,806
I mean, I can send you out
for any audition that you want,

178
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:13,161
but you have to be careful
about burning yourself out.

179
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:14,629
I think personally that it's better

180
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:17,465
to go out for just a few
things every month.

181
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:19,267
You know, just seem more selective.

182
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:21,502
The interesting thing about you

183
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:24,172
is that you can play
a good range age-wise.

184
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,441
Oh, definitely. I can play up to 25

185
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:28,976
- and really down to 16.
- Mm-hmm.

186
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:30,244
Phone call.

187
00:08:30,313 --> 00:08:32,080
- I'm meeting.
- It's Jen Abrams.

188
00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:35,650
Jen, hi.

189
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,086
Hey, Tressa, do you still
represent Sam Fox?

190
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:40,288
Uh... yeah.

191
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:41,656
So you don't. Did she fire you?

192
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:45,126
Well, no, Jen, she didn't.
I do represent her.

193
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:46,260
Can I help you?

194
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:49,130
I'm checking her avails for a pilot.

195
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:50,364
<i>Oh, for when?</i>

196
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:53,267
It shoots in March. It's the lead.

197
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:56,003
The lead? Whose pilot is it?

198
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:57,238
Danny and Zack.

199
00:08:57,307 --> 00:09:00,208
Okay. Well, I will give her a call.

200
00:09:00,276 --> 00:09:01,375
Um, is this...

201
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:02,443
Danny and Zack love her.

202
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:04,078
Haven't checked the network yet.

203
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:06,114
Ah. Got it. Thanks, Jen.

204
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:07,081
Yeah.

205
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:10,084
See, I like that one.

206
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:11,452
Yeah, but...

207
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:13,054
It... It's subtle.

208
00:09:13,123 --> 00:09:14,222
Like, you don't notice,

209
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,423
but you can totally tell.

210
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:17,091
- It's shiny.
- It's really good.

211
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,327
I want my face and neck

212
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:21,395
to stop being old-looking, that's all.

213
00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:23,397
Yeah. That's scary. That's just scary.

214
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:25,333
She looks like an alien.

215
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:27,135
Hang on. It's my manager.

216
00:09:27,203 --> 00:09:28,169
Hi, honey.

217
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:29,437
Hi, Tressa.

218
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:33,441
Hey, so, uh, some people
are checking your avails

219
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,343
for March for a pilot.

220
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:36,444
Okay.

221
00:09:36,513 --> 00:09:38,479
Should I say you're around?

222
00:09:38,548 --> 00:09:41,282
Yeah, I'm around. I mean,
you know I'm around.

223
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:43,351
- Sure.
- Wait. What's the pilot?

224
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:44,585
- What's the part?
- You know,

225
00:09:44,654 --> 00:09:46,654
just the usual friend
of the lead kind of thing.

226
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:48,756
Anyway, I will let them
know that you're around.

227
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:51,392
- Yeah. Bye, doll.
- Bye, honey.

228
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:53,694
- Hi. Hello.
- Hi.

229
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:55,429
So nice to meet you. I'm John.

230
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:57,231
Hi. I'm Sam.

231
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,633
This is Sunny, my friend.

232
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:01,402
Uh, did you get a chance
to look at the photos?

233
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:03,604
Ahem. Yeah, we did.

234
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:07,408
Um, I'm not saying that yours do at all,

235
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:09,610
but I notice that sometimes

236
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,280
people tend to look a little shiny

237
00:10:12,348 --> 00:10:14,382
and a bit like a potato, kind of.

238
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,217
A wet potato.

239
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:17,451
Right. Well, not here

240
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,443
because our technique is undetectable.

241
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:23,257
You will not leave looking
like a shiny potato face.

242
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:25,493
Wow. Okay. Well, we're here.

243
00:10:25,562 --> 00:10:28,396
I mean, this is for me. She's perfect.

244
00:10:28,464 --> 00:10:31,365
Ha ha ha. No, seriously,
what do you... what do you...

245
00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:33,334
How young are we now?

246
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:35,503
Um, I'm 38.

247
00:10:35,572 --> 00:10:37,138
- You look great.
- Thank you.

248
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:38,272
You both look great.

249
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,030
I wouldn't really do anything on you.

250
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:41,275
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

251
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:43,578
Wow.

252
00:10:43,646 --> 00:10:47,281
Okay. Why don't you
climb up onto this chair?

253
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,250
Okay. Ahem.

254
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:53,020
Okay.

255
00:10:54,357 --> 00:10:55,356
Awesome.

256
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:56,657
Okay, let's have a look.

257
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:58,693
- Okay, so, ahem...
- Uh-huh.

258
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:02,697
You see how kind of the left
side of my face, it's melting?

259
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:04,532
- Hmm.
- Like, my right eye,

260
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:05,733
it's really heavy,

261
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:07,635
like I've been in a prize fight.

262
00:11:07,704 --> 00:11:09,570
- Hmm.
- And then my neck.

263
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:12,473
Jesus. I mean, what's happening to me?

264
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,508
- Mm-hmm.
- Show him the picture.

265
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:17,111
- Oh, yeah. Um...
- The picture of me.

266
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:20,448
See, that's like, um...

267
00:11:20,516 --> 00:11:21,549
- Ah.
- Seven, eight,

268
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:22,617
- maybe...
- 14.

269
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:23,662
- ...years.
- Yeah, right.

270
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:26,554
See, here you look fresh.

271
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:29,590
And now you look tired, just tired.

272
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,559
- Oh.
- That's all. No big deal.

273
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:33,394
- We can remedy that.
- Okay.

274
00:11:33,463 --> 00:11:35,329
Okay? Here, why don't you hold this?

275
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:36,397
- Okay.
- Okay. Now, see,

276
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:37,732
if we do a partial face lift,

277
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,634
it would raise all of this up.

278
00:11:39,702 --> 00:11:41,435
- Okay.
- If we did the neck lift,

279
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:43,304
it would be very understated

280
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:44,538
- Okay, watch.
- Okay.

281
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:46,374
Watch this. See this?

282
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:48,542
- Pretty.
- Oh.

283
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:50,278
- Pretty.
- Mm.

284
00:11:50,346 --> 00:11:52,647
Huh? Pretty.

285
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,045
- Pretty.
- He's right.

286
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,594
- It's kind of amazing.
- Huh?

287
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:56,550
- Uh-huh.
- Pretty.

288
00:11:56,619 --> 00:11:57,585
Pretty.

289
00:11:57,654 --> 00:11:58,653
What about, uh,

290
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:00,321
what about my neck thing?

291
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,589
Okay. Watch. Ready?

292
00:12:01,658 --> 00:12:03,391
- Mm-hmm. 
- Mm-hmm.

293
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:04,458
Fresh.

294
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:05,626
Whoa.

295
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:07,328
- Fresh.
- Fresh.

296
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:09,530
Huh? Fresh.

297
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,599
Huh? So fresh.

298
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:13,734
You see that? Fresh.

299
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:15,803
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

300
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:18,272
You look like you went to, like,

301
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:19,373
the Bahamas or something.

302
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:20,574
Yeah. Wow.

303
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:23,844
Uh, how long is the down time?

304
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:25,613
Well, your face will be all bruises

305
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:27,615
- for about three weeks.
- Oh, shit.

306
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:30,351
Oh, but I anticipate
a very youthful result.

307
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:33,821
W-What would you tell the girls?

308
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,890
Well, I'll just
tell them I got attacked.

309
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,792
That way, they won't be mad at me.

310
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,128
At least they'll be nice
to be for a day, maybe.

311
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:44,432
So I have an opening on the 18th.

312
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,270
Wow. Well, how much are we talking here?

313
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:50,604
Okay.

314
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:54,442
For the neck lift, it would be 45,000.

315
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,743
And for the partial face lift,

316
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:57,812
it would run 50,000.

317
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,780
Oh, you know what? I'm just going...

318
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:02,650
Can I take the price list with me today?

319
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:05,553
Because I'm going to think about it.

320
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:09,223
I don't think I can go
completely Garbo right now.

321
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:10,091
Of course.

322
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,759
Sit, sit, sit. Everyone sit.

323
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:17,331
Terrific. So we are very excited

324
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,399
about your show.

325
00:13:18,468 --> 00:13:19,633
So are we.

326
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:24,338
Good. So what's up?

327
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:25,706
What can I help you with now?

328
00:13:25,775 --> 00:13:28,576
So, uh, we know who
we want for the lead.

329
00:13:28,644 --> 00:13:33,414
Wow. Great. Have we seen her?

330
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:34,515
All, right, so, Charles,

331
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:35,794
I know you want to see choices.

332
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:37,685
I mean, we've all been
through this before.

333
00:13:37,754 --> 00:13:40,488
And I'd like to think we
have some credibility here

334
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:42,690
with our other shows doing so well.

335
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,992
We absolutely love your shows.
I hope you know that.

336
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:48,362
So who... who is it?
Who are we talking about?

337
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:49,597
Jen: Sam Fox.

338
00:13:49,665 --> 00:13:51,499
Sam Fox is funny,

339
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:52,867
and that's our bottom line.

340
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:54,802
You've got cute all over the network,

341
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:56,504
and there's cute in the show,

342
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:58,506
but Sam Fox is, like, real people.

343
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:01,709
She will score with every demographic.

344
00:14:01,778 --> 00:14:04,712
When we cast young, we
leave everyone else out.

345
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:06,747
Sam Fox has sex appeal,

346
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:09,517
but the big move here is that
she's hysterically funny

347
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:11,318
and everyone likes her.

348
00:14:11,387 --> 00:14:13,054
She's an everywoman.

349
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,322
Works for me.

350
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:16,490
Jen, great job.

351
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,691
She's not on the show yet.

352
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,926
What are you mad about?

353
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:20,873
Because I just burned
about 30% of my credibility

354
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:22,596
with Charles Kemp.

355
00:14:22,665 --> 00:14:24,043
What, you didn't believe
what you said in there?

356
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:26,634
- Because you seemed to.
- That's my job.

357
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:27,968
You're a gender traitor.

358
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:30,571
You're putting down your own people.

359
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,739
My people?

360
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:34,375
You know, start a test
deal with Sam Fox.

361
00:14:34,444 --> 00:14:37,078
Call the reps now, please.

362
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:41,649
Uh, Charles said that?

363
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:44,218
That's what he said. So
we need to start a test deal.

364
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:45,319
Wow.

365
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:47,788
Yeah, well, send a deal
memo to my office,

366
00:14:47,857 --> 00:14:49,723
and we'll get started.

367
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:51,725
Okay, Tressa. Thanks.

368
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:52,960
Bye, Jen.

369
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,729
Should I get Sam on the phone?

370
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:59,600
No. And don't tell anyone about this.

371
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,368
You got that?

372
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:03,170
Okay.

373
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:08,144
We create...

374
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:09,379
- Just let me...
- Stop.

375
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:11,214
- I just...
- Mom, shush. Pay attention.

376
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:12,540
I want to get your face in.

377
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:13,650
Fine! Jesus!

378
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,151
We're not misandrists,

379
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,221
but the patriarchy must be stopped.

380
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,389
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

381
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,424
- Now, Martin Luther King...
- Yeah!

382
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:23,126
...he had one kind of a dream.

383
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:24,360
And if he was alive...

384
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:26,062
Martin Luther King beat his wife.

385
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:27,263
What?

386
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:28,465
Well, some people say

387
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,066
that the FBI spread that story

388
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:31,108
to discredit him,

389
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:32,547
but other people say
he cheated on his wife,

390
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:35,238
- and also...
- Wait. Who told you this?

391
00:15:35,307 --> 00:15:36,940
Cary, Mom.

392
00:15:38,143 --> 00:15:39,109
My teacher?

393
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:40,143
- Yes.
- Remember?

394
00:15:40,212 --> 00:15:41,177
Yes.

395
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:43,213
Mahatma Gandhi beat his wife, too.

396
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:45,648
Aah. I didn't know
Gandhi was even married.

397
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:48,251
Why would Cary be
telling you these things?

398
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,386
Like, is he trying to make
you hate these people?

399
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:53,189
No. He's just telling us
the whole truth about them,

400
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:55,125
or at least as it's known.

401
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:57,227
He's telling us what's been said.

402
00:15:57,295 --> 00:16:00,330
I mean, yeah, maybe
the FBI lied about King,

403
00:16:00,398 --> 00:16:04,000
but to say that he's this
perfect human statue

404
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:06,002
is... is a lie.

405
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:07,370
Hmm.

406
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:09,272
It... It's important, Mom.

407
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:10,540
Plus, they're still my heroes

408
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:12,642
for the good that they did do.

409
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:15,378
But their personal lives
were just kind of sketched out.

410
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:18,281
Anyway, woman is
the nigger of the world.

411
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,482
Frankie, don't say that.

412
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:21,317
John Lennon said that.

413
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:22,685
I know, but don't you say it.

414
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:24,554
Do you know what he's
saying with that song?

415
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:26,389
Also, it's a direct quote from

416
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,024
Both: Zora Neale Hurston.

417
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:29,325
Mom, I know.

418
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:30,493
He wasn't being derogatory.

419
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:34,063
It was being, like, metaphorical.

420
00:16:34,132 --> 00:16:35,865
Cary told us that.

421
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:37,033
Hmm.

422
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:38,968
Also, Gandhi was pen pals with Hitler.

423
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:40,303
Oh, my God.

424
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:42,438
This kid looks like
Sam could be his mom.

425
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:44,207
Why if we give her a black son?

426
00:16:44,276 --> 00:16:45,275
Like she adopted?

427
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:46,442
Or shtupped a black guy?

428
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:48,511
Shtupped. Yes. Please.

429
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:52,482
We're ready for him.

430
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:54,250
I have Charles for you.

431
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:55,351
Hi, Charles.

432
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,420
- Hi, Charles.
- Hey, Charles.

433
00:16:57,489 --> 00:16:59,255
Guys, I have great news.

434
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:01,424
- Yeah?
- Great. Let's hear it.

435
00:17:01,493 --> 00:17:03,093
Rachel McAdams got
a hold of your script.

436
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:04,227
She wants the lead.

437
00:17:04,296 --> 00:17:05,261
She's amazing.

438
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,329
She's funny, talented.

439
00:17:06,398 --> 00:17:07,430
We love her.

440
00:17:07,499 --> 00:17:09,065
So we just locked her down,

441
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:10,567
and based on that,

442
00:17:10,635 --> 00:17:12,101
we're ready to move on to series.

443
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,240
Uh, Charles, that... that's great.

444
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:18,575
Amazing. We love her.

445
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:20,376
Congratulations, guys.

446
00:17:20,445 --> 00:17:21,945
I'm excited.

447
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:23,179
So are we.

448
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:24,414
Good. We'll talk soon.

449
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:25,682
Ow. Yeah, right.

450
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,585
Uh, all right, great. So let's, uh...

451
00:17:28,653 --> 00:17:30,987
let's look at this stuff
and figure it out.

452
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:44,378
We're gathered here
today because we know

453
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:46,376
- that there is an atrocity...
- You know, I read

454
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:49,947
that Mother Teresa
used to take private jets

455
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:51,815
and go to fancy dinners.

456
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:54,017
Mom, that's not the same thing.

457
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:55,319
She was a Catholic nun.

458
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:57,688
There's nothing complex
about Mother Teresa.

459
00:17:57,756 --> 00:17:58,622
She sucked.

460
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:00,824
I know, but Gandhi was so little.

461
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:02,659
How could he beat up anybody?

462
00:18:04,136 --> 00:18:06,475
All right, guys, let's start the mob.

463
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:09,533
Just look to the lady in
the pink T-shirt for the moves.

464
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:12,202
Frankie, take the rest of these
T-shirts. Hand them out.

465
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:14,004
Yes, I can do it, yes.

466
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,940
She loves your class.

467
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:19,776
Well, Frankie is a rock star.

468
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:21,211
Yeah. Uh, listen,

469
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,014
I got to ask a favor of you, buddy.

470
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,884
Frankie's knowledge of
the world is accelerating

471
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:29,019
because of your class, good and bad,

472
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:32,089
and that's great, but
it's going really fast.

473
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:34,925
And I can't keep up.

474
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:37,261
I work. I rarely
get a download from her,

475
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:40,731
and when I do, she's on
a newer and bigger planet,

476
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,798
like today.

477
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,267
Come with us to Stockton.

478
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:46,203
- What? - Yeah, we're going on
a class trip to Stockton.

479
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,939
You would learn so much with Frankie,

480
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:50,252
so then you'll be totally up to speed.

481
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:52,109
- Our song is next.
- When is it?

482
00:18:52,177 --> 00:18:53,255
It's the first week of March.

483
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,245
She should totally come with us.

484
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:57,180
Oh, Stockton? Mom's always got to work.

485
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:58,348
She won't make it, Cary.

486
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,784
Well, that's good, Frankie.

487
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:01,785
Your mom's an earner.

488
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:02,853
I know.

489
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:06,123
Shall we mob it up, Madame?

490
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:07,858
Yes.

491
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:15,065
Hi, Sam.

Tressa, hi. Listen, is that
pilot still happening,

493
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:22,039
that pilot in March?

494
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:24,141
No, it went away.

495
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:26,043
Oh, good!

496
00:19:26,111 --> 00:19:28,178
Thanks, honey! Love you!

497
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,847
Love you. Have fun.

498
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:38,255
I'm going to do it.

499
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:40,958
Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!

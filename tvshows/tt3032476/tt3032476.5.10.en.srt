1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,906
- He wants out.
- Varga stays.

2
00:00:01,908 --> 00:00:03,904
I quit Schweikart and Cokely.

3
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:06,333
- Wait. What?
- To help people who are actually in need.

4
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:09,037
Put your phone down. Leave it on.

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,257
What did you do, Saul?

6
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:12,258
If you don't trust your
men with your money,

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,812
you have bigger problems than
if you trust Saul Goodman.

8
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:16,947
Come on, Ignacio, go.

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,749
We got a long way ahead of us.

10
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:21,085
Hey. Did you hear all that?

11
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:23,768
I heard enough to
know she saved your ass.

12
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,772
So... ?

13
00:01:26,722 --> 00:01:29,683
So what happens next?

14
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:30,964
We'll see.

15
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:39,374
Who was that?

16
00:01:40,936 --> 00:01:45,578
Uh, that was, um...

17
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,980
It's the guy who saved my life.

18
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,262
Kim, I got the money.

19
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:52,745
I was on my way back...

20
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:54,749
I thought I was home free...

21
00:01:56,751 --> 00:02:03,675
And I was ambushed,
by, uh, like, a gang.

22
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:07,078
A... A cartel gang.

23
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,601
And they... they took the money,

24
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:12,924
and one of them...

25
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:15,366
put a gun to my head.

26
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:20,619
And that guy on the phone... ?

27
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:22,100
He showed up.

28
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:24,983
He... He shot 'em with a sniper rifle.

29
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:28,949
He... killed all of them.

30
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:31,829
All but one.

31
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:34,792
One guy got away.

32
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:38,999
And later, I helped him
to get that one, too.

33
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,198
Kim, I...

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,439
Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy.

35
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:44,561
Oh, my God.

36
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:46,683
Oh, my God.

37
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,652
I think we should get outta here.

38
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,060
Kind of assumed we'd
be staying at a Motel 6

39
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:06,582
or the nail salon.

40
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:09,064
B-Better to have more people around.

41
00:03:44,585 --> 00:03:47,746
How're your shoulders?

42
00:03:47,748 --> 00:03:49,388
Should I put something on them,

43
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,029
or would that just make it worse?

44
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:57,437
I think I'm, uh...

45
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:04,004
Am I bad for you?

46
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:10,848
Are you "bad for me"?

47
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,411
I got you into this.

48
00:04:14,413 --> 00:04:17,134
What happened tonight...

49
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:19,176
None of this would have happened

50
00:04:19,178 --> 00:04:21,180
if you weren't with me.

51
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,842
You crossed a line.

52
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:50,687
You're not gonna do it again.

53
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:57,894
Yeah.

54
00:05:00,657 --> 00:05:02,897
It's been a long day.

55
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:05,021
Come on. Make room.

56
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:08,664
Mm.

57
00:05:23,118 --> 00:05:24,757
Good night.

58
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:41,497
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

59
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,060
Well?

60
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:18,342
He went over the border and kept going.

61
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:21,065
Looks to be headed for
his place in Chihuahua.

62
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,347
And he should be there in a few hours.

63
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,628
Good.

64
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,390
There's a wrinkle.

65
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:28,592
He took Varga with him.

66
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:30,113
Why?

67
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:33,597
Well, if he thought Varga
was working for you,

68
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:35,078
he'd have killed him on the spot.

69
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,679
If I had to guess,

70
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:40,483
I'd say Varga's up for a promotion.

71
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:43,005
Can you communicate with Varga?

72
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:46,449
Salamanca's place is in
the middle of nowhere.

73
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:48,931
Landlines and sat phones only.

74
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:51,453
A technical issue.

75
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:53,455
The way things stand,

76
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:56,258
he's gonna get caught in the crossfire.

77
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,939
I'm thinking we should find a way

78
00:06:57,941 --> 00:07:01,062
to pull him out of there.

79
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,273
And tip our hand?

80
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:15,678
He's earned some consideration.

81
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,887
Does Varga know

82
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,889
there's going to be an assassination?

83
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:31,331
No one's told him...

84
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,693
but he can make a
pretty damn good guess.

85
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:36,415
Perhaps...

86
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:38,858
there is a way to make
use of this situation.

87
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:42,298
The men I've chosen for
this are highly skilled.

88
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,882
They're the best in the their business.

89
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:47,866
But the one thing they do not have...

90
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:50,511
is a man on the inside.

91
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:10,824
Mi Yolis! Como estas?

92
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:13,146
Quien te quiere?

93
00:09:13,148 --> 00:09:15,629
Te ves flaco.

94
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:17,230
No había nada comer allá.

95
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:24,517
¿Cecilio, cómo estás, amigo?

96
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,919
Patrón...

97
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:30,282
Ah.

98
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,209
Nachito, come on over, huh?

99
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:38,250
Don't be shy.

100
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:48,659
These... These are my people.

101
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:51,022
Yolanda... she is the best
cook in all of Chihua...

102
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:54,825
you're gonna eat like you have
never eaten before in your life.

103
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,989
Cecilio... he takes care
of all of my gardens...

104
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:02,633
His tomatoes are the best ever, eh?

105
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:06,396
Ciro, Miguel, Gerardo, Raúl,

106
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,598
and all the rest of these fools...

107
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,321
they're supposed to
be guarding this place,

108
00:10:11,323 --> 00:10:14,000
but, uh, I just keep 'em around

109
00:10:14,002 --> 00:10:15,805
because they're so pretty, right?

110
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:19,809
Ah.

111
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:24,277
Eh?

112
00:10:33,544 --> 00:10:34,783
Hey, listen.

113
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:36,144
Welcome. Smile.

114
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:37,866
You're in my house, man.
Come on. Come in.

115
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:59,047
Mnh.

116
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:11,297
Hey, did you pack
anything with aloe in it?

117
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:13,019
Oh. Mornin'.

118
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:15,020
Morning.

119
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:18,303
- I didn't wake you, did I?
- No.

120
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:20,284
- Uh, you're going to court?
- Yeah.

121
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:21,709
I have a hearing at 10:00,

122
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:23,663
and I want to see if I can catch Oakley

123
00:11:23,665 --> 00:11:26,912
before I go in.

124
00:11:26,914 --> 00:11:29,074
You seemed like you could use the sleep.

125
00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:30,915
Yeah.

126
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:44,520
Hey, I think I might have a better idea.

127
00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:46,706
What if we spend the
whole day here, you know?

128
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,610
Uh, this place has got everything.

129
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:51,415
It's got a heated pool,
a swim-up bar, a hot tub.

130
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:52,896
Well, I didn't pack a swimsuit.

131
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:54,257
Neither did I.

132
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:55,899
Th-There's a shop downstairs.

133
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:58,261
And... And... And we can
stop in at the spa, you know,

134
00:11:58,263 --> 00:11:59,943
a-and get couples massages.

135
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:01,584
With your sunburn?

136
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:03,626
Yeah.

137
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:06,025
Or, um, or a "seaweed wrap", you know,

138
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:07,774
and then... then we'll just go hang

139
00:12:07,776 --> 00:12:09,752
in the co-ed sauna, you know,

140
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:12,234
- sweat out some toxins and, uh...
- Mm.

141
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:13,635
Oh!

142
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:15,557
24-hour room service.

143
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,402
Hey, what could be more luxurious

144
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,425
than to spend a whole
day being totally pampered

145
00:12:20,427 --> 00:12:23,391
and end it all with a
midnight cheeseburger?

146
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:25,607
Come on. Hey, don't we deserve this?

147
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:28,329
Jimmy, I-I-I have clients.

148
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,650
Yeah.

149
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:31,409
You... You just quit Schweikart.

150
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:32,913
I mean, take one day off.

151
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:34,198
The clerks love you.

152
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,338
They will give you a
continuance on anything.

153
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,499
Hey, Kim, we already
sprang for this place.

154
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:40,541
I'm just sayin' let's take advantage.

155
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:43,183
You know, let's John
and Yoko this sucker.

156
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:45,187
You don't think it's safe?

157
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,069
Probably, it is.

158
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:52,702
But here's the thing.

159
00:12:52,704 --> 00:12:54,847
L-Lalo has guys, right?

160
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:56,956
So it doesn't really
matter where he is...

161
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,171
if he finds one loose end,

162
00:12:59,173 --> 00:13:01,375
all it takes is a phone call.

163
00:13:03,044 --> 00:13:04,964
Do you know something
you're not telling me?

164
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:06,666
No. No, I don't.

165
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:10,969
But what's the harm in
being a little cautious?

166
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:13,091
What about tomorrow?

167
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,293
And the next day?

168
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,655
Jimmy, what about next week?

169
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:20,540
I don't know.

170
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,983
Alright.

171
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:27,985
Then, the way I see it,

172
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:29,867
we just need to keep our eyes open

173
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:32,549
and get on with our lives.

174
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:34,471
- Kim, listen...
- The courthouse...

175
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:37,314
it's... it's three blocks from here.

176
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,636
It's full of cops...

177
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:43,280
police headquarters is right next door.

178
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:47,964
Jimmy...

179
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:49,605
it's gonna be fine.

180
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:51,609
I'll see you later.

181
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:22,276
Hey, it's me. I want an update.

182
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:24,758
Bullshit.

183
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,362
I want to know what's going on.

184
00:14:28,364 --> 00:14:29,723
Not good enough.

185
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:31,365
No. You know what?

186
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:33,687
Y'know what... We are...
We are gonna talk about this

187
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:35,048
face-to-face.

188
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,610
You tell me where you are.

189
00:14:36,612 --> 00:14:37,771
I will come to...

190
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,212
Hello?

191
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,717
That means we won.

192
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:54,159
The state dropped the charges.

193
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:55,280
No, no, no.

194
00:14:55,282 --> 00:14:56,922
You don't have to appear in court again.

195
00:14:56,924 --> 00:14:59,566
Now we both have the morning off.

196
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:05,009
Uh-huh.

197
00:15:05,011 --> 00:15:07,411
Mm-hmm.

198
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:09,013
I'm sorry, Mira... you know what?

199
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:10,734
I have to go.

200
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:13,457
But call if you have
any questions, any time.

201
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,619
Okay. Yes, bye.

202
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:16,780
Hey, Grant.

203
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,262
You got a minute?

204
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:20,007
How's it going?

205
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:21,144
Uh, let's see.

206
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:24,099
I have half an hour to
plead out four taggers

207
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:26,091
and a homeless guy who tried to stuff

208
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,992
a dozen hardboiled eggs down
his pants at a Ruby Tuesday's.

209
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,634
Life in the Public Defender's office.
How's your day so far?

210
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:34,317
Uh, I've got some holes in
my schedule I'm lookin' to fill.

211
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:37,003
Holes? You tellin' me
you're billin'... what?

212
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:38,040
Two-fifty an hour?

213
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,762
And you've got holes in your schedule?

214
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:41,964
If I were you, I'd keep things airtight.

215
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:44,646
I'd like some more PD overflow.

216
00:15:44,648 --> 00:15:46,688
Go talk to the contract liaison.

217
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,490
And Gloria'll set you up.

218
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:50,091
Alright, the thing is,

219
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:51,926
I know I'm not supposed
to choose the cases I get,

220
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:56,020
but I'm looking for
something... specific.

221
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,060
Specific?

222
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:00,341
Like what?

223
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:03,264
Uh, uh.

224
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:05,143
I just want to make sure
I'm spending my time

225
00:16:05,145 --> 00:16:07,948
where it'll do the most good.

226
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,389
I gotcha.

227
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:12,753
So plain old indigent's
not good enough for you?

228
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:16,476
You want the clients that'll
get you, you know, in here.

229
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:19,359
Grant, just let me
have some tricky ones.

230
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:21,044
Think of all the extra time you'll have

231
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,846
to spend on your egg stuffers.

232
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,232
If I were going to go along with that,

233
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,567
- you'd have to take felonies.
- Sure.

234
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:30,489
We're talking cases that
are headed for trial.

235
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:32,313
Nothing you can plead
out in three hot minutes

236
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:33,772
with your friendly neighborhood ADA.

237
00:16:33,774 --> 00:16:35,094
I'll take 20.

238
00:16:35,096 --> 00:16:36,375
Today.

239
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:38,457
20?

240
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:40,138
That's your offer?

241
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,100
20 felonies?

242
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,822
Yes.

243
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:46,346
Hold this.

244
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,348
Come on.

245
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,509
Hey, Dana!

246
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,793
Any chance you can tell the judge

247
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:54,380
I'm running 15 minutes late?

248
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:58,115
Oh. Gotta warn you, right now,

249
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,798
we're backed up like an
outhouse at Woodstock.

250
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:10,447
So, possession raps are here...

251
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:12,248
Possession with intent...

252
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,771
These are all assault...

253
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:16,933
wait, no...

254
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,131
assault's on the other
side of this shelf.

255
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:21,017
All of these cases are pending?

256
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:22,858
Pretty much.

257
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,861
Had more burnouts than
usual this last quarter.

258
00:17:25,863 --> 00:17:28,656
That's what I call taking
that private firm gig,

259
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:30,506
gettin' that sweet company car,

260
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,509
burnin' rubber on your way out.

261
00:17:35,632 --> 00:17:39,834
Public intoxication, petty larceny,

262
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:44,741
destruction of property,
DUI, trespassing...

263
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:49,043
Involuntary manslaughter,

264
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:53,447
immigration, domestic violence...

265
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:59,573
Or, if you feel like you do want...

266
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:02,976
Juveniles.

267
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,180
Go ahead and have a look around.

268
00:18:07,182 --> 00:18:09,182
Let me know which ones you
want so we can kick 'em over.

269
00:18:09,184 --> 00:18:10,863
I'll getchu a box.

270
00:18:34,968 --> 00:18:37,050
Flashlight.

271
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:44,655
When you talk to the
boss, you call him Don.

272
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:47,017
He asks you a question,

273
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:49,099
you tell the truth,

274
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:53,343
fewest words... you can.

275
00:18:55,107 --> 00:18:57,067
If he likes you, he's gonna
give you a bump up.

276
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:03,673
Hey, don't think I don't see you, eh?

277
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,955
I see you. I do.

278
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:09,881
Right now, steady is
what we need, you know?

279
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:14,685
What if he doesn't like me?

280
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:19,648
Ah, you'll be fine.

281
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,249
Gimme the socket wrench.

282
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:35,223
- Um. I gotta hit the head.
- Yeah, yeah.

283
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:38,466
Hey, don't get any
grease on my sink, eh?

284
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:55,602
Yeah.

285
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:40,331
After that, I want you
both to be thinking about

286
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,572
how to parse out discovery.

287
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,133
It's gonna be document heavy,

288
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,776
so let's be mindful
of resource management.

289
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,858
Howard.

290
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,539
Kim. Good to see you.

291
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,944
- Uh, what floor?
- Three, please.

292
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:56,586
Have you met my associates,

293
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,227
Paul Shepard and Michelle Avila?

294
00:20:58,229 --> 00:20:59,869
- I don't think so. Hi.
- Hello.

295
00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:01,873
Nice to meet you.

296
00:21:03,434 --> 00:21:05,154
Uh, guys, this is Kim Wexler.

297
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:06,755
She's an HHM alum

298
00:21:06,757 --> 00:21:08,877
and now heads up banking
at Schweikart and Cokely.

299
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:10,881
Nice to meet you both.

300
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:17,606
I'm actually not at Schweikart anymore.

301
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:20,408
Or in banking, for that matter.

302
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,890
Really?

303
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:24,292
As of yesterday.

304
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:26,296
Take care, Howard.

305
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:30,738
Kim, Kim!

306
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,742
Hang on a sec!

307
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:36,063
Out of curiosity, where'd you land?

308
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:37,264
Reeves and Green?

309
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:40,030
I'm out on my own again.

310
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,765
Rich let you go?

311
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,990
It wasn't up to him. I left.

312
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:45,632
What about Mesa Verde?

313
00:21:45,634 --> 00:21:47,954
I advised them to stay with Schweikart.

314
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:51,437
Um. I know it's a
personal question, Kim,

315
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:54,199
- but can I ask why?
- That is personal.

316
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:56,042
- And I have a busy day, so...
- Spare me a minute.

317
00:21:56,044 --> 00:21:58,004
Please.

318
00:21:58,006 --> 00:22:00,007
It's important.

319
00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:05,611
What's up?

320
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:11,256
I wasn't going to say anything.

321
00:22:11,258 --> 00:22:13,338
Last time I tried to get
something off my chest,

322
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,459
it didn't go very well.

323
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:17,141
I just think

324
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:21,265
before you make any big
changes in your life,

325
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:25,472
there's something about
Jimmy you ought to hear.

326
00:22:26,993 --> 00:22:28,995
Okay.

327
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:34,117
A little while ago, I offered
Jimmy a job at HHM.

328
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,600
I'm guessing he didn't
mention it to you.

329
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:42,966
He said he had to think about it.

330
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:45,528
But then, the very next night,

331
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,211
he threw bowling balls
over my front gate.

332
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:50,453
Bowling balls?

333
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:52,498
Someone could've been really hurt.

334
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,817
More or less destroyed my car.

335
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:56,779
Then, a couple of weeks later,

336
00:22:56,781 --> 00:22:58,861
I'm having lunch with Cliff Main,

337
00:22:58,863 --> 00:23:01,783
and I'm accosted by two prostitutes.

338
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:04,186
Actual prostitutes.

339
00:23:04,188 --> 00:23:06,548
Jimmy had sent them to make a scene.

340
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,310
I confronted Jimmy about it,

341
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,473
and after some hemming and hawing,

342
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,477
he all but confessed.

343
00:23:21,003 --> 00:23:24,204
- And that's it?
- Mm-hmm.

344
00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:26,126
Sorry.

345
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,530
Ah.

346
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:33,213
Howard, you really...

347
00:23:33,215 --> 00:23:35,015
you... you really had me going there.

348
00:23:35,017 --> 00:23:37,457
Laugh if you want,

349
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,258
but no person in their right mind

350
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,940
would behave the way Jimmy has.

351
00:23:40,942 --> 00:23:42,341
We are talking about someone

352
00:23:42,343 --> 00:23:44,784
who's not in control of himself.

353
00:23:44,786 --> 00:23:47,611
You and I both know it makes no sense

354
00:23:47,613 --> 00:23:49,949
to drop a client like Mesa Verde,

355
00:23:49,951 --> 00:23:52,113
and I gotta think Jimmy had
something to do with that.

356
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:58,477
Do you have any idea
how insulting that is?

357
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:02,000
I make my own decisions,
for my own reasons.

358
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:03,281
You gotta listen to me.

359
00:24:03,283 --> 00:24:04,842
The man needs help.

360
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:08,488
Howard, I know Jimmy, and you're wrong.

361
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:17,294
You know who really knew Jimmy?

362
00:24:17,296 --> 00:24:19,298
Chuck.

363
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:36,838
Open up, asshole!

364
00:24:38,814 --> 00:24:40,534
Open this door!

365
00:24:40,536 --> 00:24:42,496
I want to talk to you!

366
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:52,906
What? Huh?

367
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,029
You didn't think I'd find
your ultra secret bat cave?

368
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:57,550
Well, the joke's on you, sucker!

369
00:24:57,552 --> 00:24:58,694
I'm your attorney,

370
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:01,754
and you will let me in!

371
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:12,844
I'm not goin' anywhere!

372
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,005
I mean it!

373
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:16,127
I got nowhere to be!

374
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:18,169
Open. Up. Now!

375
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:20,173
Hey!

376
00:25:21,014 --> 00:25:22,894
What the hell do you think you're doing?

377
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,535
Ah, there he is!

378
00:25:24,537 --> 00:25:27,418
Not... Not a fan of the
surprise pop-in, huh?

379
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,820
- Well, I can't imagine why!
- You keep it down.

380
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:31,542
- I got neighbors.
- I will not keep it down.

381
00:25:31,544 --> 00:25:33,344
I want answers, okay?

382
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:35,425
The time has come for
you to level with me,

383
00:25:35,427 --> 00:25:37,347
and I'm not going to leave until you do.

384
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:38,829
Inside, now.

385
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:40,150
Okay, look, look.

386
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:42,272
Okay.

387
00:25:44,156 --> 00:25:48,117
Y-You saved my life.

388
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,399
Thank you for that.

389
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:51,924
But from here on out,

390
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,483
I gotta be kept in the loop, man.

391
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:56,789
It's not my fault that I got ambushed.

392
00:25:56,791 --> 00:26:00,249
Why did I have to lie
to Salamanca about that?

393
00:26:00,251 --> 00:26:01,933
Who was I lying for?

394
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:05,053
Now, you gotta tell me
what is happening now!

395
00:26:05,055 --> 00:26:07,698
- That's not your concern.
- Oh, come on!

396
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:10,859
Listen to me... you
are not blowing me off

397
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,266
with any "that's not the
end of the story" crap!

398
00:26:13,268 --> 00:26:14,582
Now, just specifics!

399
00:26:14,584 --> 00:26:17,345
You're asking for
information you can't have.

400
00:26:28,181 --> 00:26:30,183
If anything happens to her...

401
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:36,923
I can't do this.

402
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:38,927
I can't.

403
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,852
Hm. Hm.

404
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,134
Alright.

405
00:26:48,136 --> 00:26:50,178
Alright.

406
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:54,900
Now, you listen, and you shut up.

407
00:26:54,902 --> 00:26:57,182
This man has other things on his mind.

408
00:26:57,184 --> 00:26:59,346
He's not thinking about you.

409
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:05,710
Lalo Salamanca is going to die.

410
00:27:05,712 --> 00:27:07,312
Tonight.

411
00:27:09,516 --> 00:27:10,955
Tonight... ?

412
00:27:10,957 --> 00:27:14,038
This time tomorrow, it'll be done.

413
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:21,485
Oh. Okay, then...

414
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:27,694
Now... I need you to leave.

415
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:32,938
I have family coming over.

416
00:28:29,911 --> 00:28:31,150
Charlie Manson!

417
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,202
Don Eladio.

418
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:51,699
Bolsa.

419
00:28:54,975 --> 00:28:56,098
Hey.

420
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,110
- Ah.
- Hmm.

421
00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:15,176
- Excelente.
- Sí.

422
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:31,871
Mm. Hm.

423
00:29:47,063 --> 00:29:49,544
Ooh. I "Magnum, P.I."!

424
00:29:57,593 --> 00:30:00,194
¿Eh, Bolsa?

425
00:30:01,437 --> 00:30:03,461
Sí.

426
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:12,330
Don.

427
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,614
Ah.

428
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:28,805
"Frunk".

429
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:34,410
Oh.

430
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,344
Oiga, Don Eladio...

431
00:30:56,395 --> 00:30:58,418
Ah.

432
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:14,127
Ah.

433
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:33,601
Entonces...

434
00:31:45,895 --> 00:31:47,374
Mm.

435
00:31:47,376 --> 00:31:48,736
Ah.

436
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:20,245
Bikers?

437
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,477
Hm.

438
00:32:41,681 --> 00:32:44,947
Don Eladio...

439
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:54,862
Mm-hmm.

440
00:33:13,497 --> 00:33:17,702
Ignacio Varga...

441
00:33:24,574 --> 00:33:26,576
Mm.

442
00:34:17,797 --> 00:34:20,598
Salud.

443
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,594
Really?

444
00:34:49,596 --> 00:34:52,239
Really.

445
00:34:54,641 --> 00:34:56,643
How do you know?

446
00:34:57,924 --> 00:34:59,724
I talked to my guy.

447
00:34:59,726 --> 00:35:02,727
Lalo's in Mexico, and
he's stayin' there.

448
00:35:02,729 --> 00:35:05,449
But you said he might call someone...

449
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:08,252
He's not gonna do that.

450
00:35:08,254 --> 00:35:10,814
Your "guy", h-how does he know for sure?

451
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:13,257
He's not gonna tell me, but he knows.

452
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:14,738
And you believe him?

453
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,300
Yeah, I do.

454
00:35:17,302 --> 00:35:20,503
So... we're safe?

455
00:35:20,505 --> 00:35:22,305
Yeah.

456
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,669
My God.

457
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,273
Oh, my God.

458
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:34,518
That's great.

459
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,963
It's great, right?

460
00:35:42,846 --> 00:35:44,180
So what's wrong?

461
00:35:44,182 --> 00:35:46,625
It's... It's over.

462
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:50,974
This time.

463
00:35:52,215 --> 00:35:55,378
There's not gonna be a next time.

464
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,989
Kim...

465
00:36:10,632 --> 00:36:12,872
... it's been a rough ride.

466
00:36:12,874 --> 00:36:15,595
I've been thinking a lot,

467
00:36:15,597 --> 00:36:18,358
and, um...

468
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,761
we should probably just
check out and go home.

469
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,093
I-I, uh, packed my stuff.

470
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:25,745
I think I got yours, too.

471
00:36:25,747 --> 00:36:28,710
And double-check.

472
00:36:32,853 --> 00:36:36,855
We already paid for the night.

473
00:36:36,857 --> 00:36:40,218
What about the spa and all that?

474
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,222
We haven't even tried room service.

475
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:47,427
Kim, don't you just want to go home?

476

Yeah.

498
00:38:12,521 --> 00:38:16,749
You know why Hamlin told me all that?

499
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:20,312
It was for "my own good".

00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:29,681
It's...

503
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:31,643
I-It's... It's all about him...

504
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:35,086
it's always all about him.

505
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:39,009
The guy is in love with himself.

506
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:42,493
He needed to be taken down a peg.

507
00:38:42,495 --> 00:38:46,700
So...

508
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,620
what's next?

509
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,753
You went after his car.

510
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:57,347
You went after his reputation. So...

511
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:01,594
I think maybe the next thing is...

512
00:39:01,596 --> 00:39:05,801
his hair, right?

513
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:09,840
Suppose... and I'm... I'm
just brainstorming here...

514
00:39:09,842 --> 00:39:13,081
but suppose we slip him a mickey,

515
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:15,123
and then, while he's out,

516
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:18,406
we get out the old electric clippers...

517
00:39:18,408 --> 00:39:21,489
zzzzzt...

518
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:23,651
shave him bald.

519
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:27,935
Nair.

520
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:29,939
What?

521
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:34,021
It's an old gag, but, um...

522
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:36,058
sneak into his country club

523
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,308
and put Nair in his shampoo bottle.

524
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,812
Then he takes a shower, and...

525
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:41,691
Hair falls out.

526
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:42,835
- Yeah.
- Nice.

527
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:45,406
Or... Or... Or, um,

528
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:50,036
we pour a barrel of chlorine
into his swimming pool,

529
00:39:50,038 --> 00:39:52,318
- so that...
- Bleaches his hair and his eyebrows

530
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,160
- and everything.
- Yes, yes, and the eyebrows.

531
00:39:57,244 --> 00:39:59,347
Or... Or...

532
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:03,449
Or we break into his house,

533
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:06,718
replace all the fluffy
toilet-paper rolls

534
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,734
- with single-ply.
- Ouch.

535
00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:10,856
Hit him where he lives.

536
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:14,539
Or whatever tanning lotion he uses...

537
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:16,626
we replace it with sunblock.

538
00:40:16,628 --> 00:40:18,530
He gets in his tanning bed,

539
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:21,185
and waste of time.

540
00:40:21,187 --> 00:40:25,670
Or... Or...

541
00:40:25,672 --> 00:40:27,992
Or what?

542
00:40:27,994 --> 00:40:31,355
We'd never do it, but...

543
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:36,880
Never do what?

544
00:40:36,882 --> 00:40:39,525
What if...

545
00:40:41,366 --> 00:40:44,809
What if Howard does something terrible?

546
00:40:46,442 --> 00:40:50,106
Like he murders a waiter

547
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:52,174
for putting butter
on his cauliflower... ?

548
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:57,459
No, I mean really bad.

549
00:40:57,461 --> 00:41:00,113
Like misconduct.

550
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:01,818
You know, misappropriating funds

551
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,879
and, um, bribing witnesses...

552
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:06,503
something like that.

553
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,711
You know what that'd mean
for the Sandpiper case?

554
00:41:09,713 --> 00:41:12,153
A big class action suit?

555
00:41:12,155 --> 00:41:14,716
It could tank the whole thing.

556
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:18,479
Cliff Main's hair would be on fire.

557
00:41:20,483 --> 00:41:22,883
He'd get it settled.

558
00:41:22,885 --> 00:41:25,087
Pronto.

559
00:41:27,169 --> 00:41:29,049
He would?

560
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:30,490
Yeah.

561
00:41:30,492 --> 00:41:34,697
Think about how much
they've put into that case.

562
00:41:35,497 --> 00:41:39,487
Almost two years of work.

563
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:42,713
If it fell apart now,
they'd get nothing.

564
00:41:42,715 --> 00:41:44,395
So, yeah.

565
00:41:44,397 --> 00:41:46,677
Cliff Main would take whatever
Sandpiper was offering.

566
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:49,800
I already tried like hell
to get Sandpiper settled.

567
00:41:49,802 --> 00:41:51,322
Yeah, but you went about it wrong.

568
00:41:53,205 --> 00:41:56,849
Sorry, but... this is how you do it.

569
00:42:01,293 --> 00:42:03,693
And it's not like the
old folks'd get stiffed.

570
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:05,615
If Sandpiper settled now,

571
00:42:05,617 --> 00:42:09,859
they might each get 15, 20 bucks less,

572
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:14,583
but they'd get their money now,
while they can still use it.

573
00:42:14,585 --> 00:42:18,947
And the lawyers get paid.

574
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:20,951
And the lawyers get paid.

575
00:42:22,913 --> 00:42:25,075
How much of the common fund do you get?

576
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:31,882
We get 20% of the common fund.

577
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,723
I'm just... I'm...

578
00:42:35,725 --> 00:42:37,685
Forget it, okay?

579
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:40,167
Okay.

580
00:44:28,114 --> 00:44:30,033
Hey.

581
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:32,676
Hey.

582
00:44:32,678 --> 00:44:34,958
Have a seat.

583
00:44:56,373 --> 00:44:58,653
Hey, you did good today, huh?

584
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:02,297
Tomorrow, I'll show you around. Mm.

585
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,979
When you go back up north...

586
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:07,221
you're gonna be halfway
to being a Salamanca, eh?

587
00:45:08,945 --> 00:45:10,224
Thanks.

588
00:45:14,944 --> 00:45:17,222
Ah.

589
00:45:17,224 --> 00:45:19,304
Another night owl, huh? You don't sleep?

590
00:45:19,306 --> 00:45:21,466
Mnh-mnh.

591
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:25,790
Not tonight.

592
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:29,754
Yeah, I never sleep much.

593
00:45:29,756 --> 00:45:31,555
An hour, maybe two.

594
00:45:31,557 --> 00:45:33,559
It's enough.

595
00:45:36,482 --> 00:45:38,484
When it's like this?

596
00:45:40,646 --> 00:45:42,648
That's when I can think.

597
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:48,732
I get my best ideas when
everybody else is asleep.

598
00:45:50,735 --> 00:45:53,376
Some people... they call it a curse.

599
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:55,738
I like it.

600
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,341
I don't know.

601
00:46:01,505 --> 00:46:05,733
I'd rather get some shuteye.

602
00:46:05,735 --> 00:46:07,557
And yet, here we are.

603
00:46:19,362 --> 00:46:21,522
Got anything stronger?

604
00:46:22,966 --> 00:46:25,646
Now you're talking.

605
00:46:25,648 --> 00:46:30,130
In the bar, bottom shelf, decanter.

606
00:46:30,132 --> 00:46:32,653
That's the good stuff.

607
00:46:32,655 --> 00:46:34,975
Two glasses.

608
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,054
There he is!

609
00:47:17,056 --> 00:47:19,176
I thought you got lost.

610
00:47:24,223 --> 00:47:25,622
Ah.

611
00:47:33,992 --> 00:47:36,593
You ever had Louis XIII?

612
00:47:36,595 --> 00:47:38,314
I don't think so.

613
00:47:38,316 --> 00:47:40,396
Ooph. You're in for a treat.

614
00:47:49,193 --> 00:47:52,714
To sleep and those who need it.

615
00:47:52,716 --> 00:47:54,275
To sleep.

616
00:48:00,323 --> 00:48:02,203
What the hell is that?

617
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:10,250
These morons have no respect!

618
00:48:10,252 --> 00:48:12,172
iCiro!

619
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:13,470
Ah!

620
00:49:13,472 --> 00:49:15,111
iCiro!

621
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,863
iCiro!

622
00:49:27,454 --> 00:49:28,678
Ciro, Ciro.

623
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:54,490
Ah!

624
00:53:42,817 --> 00:53:45,698
Ah.

625
00:53:47,502 --> 00:53:50,062
What do you want?

626
00:53:50,064 --> 00:53:52,546
I'll have a little of everything.

627
00:53:54,268 --> 00:53:56,750
Actually, leave off the mint chip.

628
00:54:03,356 --> 00:54:05,637
I set the alarm for 6:00.

629
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:09,760
Since we have to check out
and go home before work.

630
00:54:09,762 --> 00:54:12,563
That's a solid 2 and a half hours.

631
00:54:12,565 --> 00:54:14,567
Sounds good.

632
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,585
So, what would you do with it?

633
00:54:36,668 --> 00:54:38,227
I don't know.

634
00:54:38,229 --> 00:54:41,270
What would you?

635
00:54:41,272 --> 00:54:45,794
I'd hire Stef away from Schweikart.

636
00:54:45,796 --> 00:54:49,558
I'd hire Bruce from HHM.

637
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,920
I'd get Viola.

638
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:54,693
I'd rent the smallest, shittiest office

639
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:56,204
I could find near the courthouse

640
00:54:56,206 --> 00:54:59,807
and open a pro bono practice.

641
00:54:59,809 --> 00:55:02,527
Give regular people the
kind of representation

642
00:55:02,529 --> 00:55:04,531
usually only millionaires get.

643
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:08,135
I was gonna say we'd buy a house.

644
00:55:08,137 --> 00:55:10,297
Sorry.

645
00:55:10,299 --> 00:55:11,578
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

646
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,181
We could do both.

647
00:55:14,183 --> 00:55:15,622
Last I heard,

648
00:55:15,624 --> 00:55:18,865
Sandpiper was willing
to go to $26 million.

649
00:55:18,867 --> 00:55:20,547
Wow.

650
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:23,276
Um, a third of that is $8.5 million.

651
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,141
Mm-hmm. And 20% of that is...

652
00:55:25,143 --> 00:55:27,145
Around $2 mil.

653
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:36,001
Ah, but it's not happening.

654
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:38,764
Come on, Kim.

655
00:55:38,766 --> 00:55:41,607
We're not talking
about a bar trick here.

656
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:43,650
We're talking about scorched earth.

657
00:55:45,292 --> 00:55:47,572
We would have to hurt him.

658
00:55:47,574 --> 00:55:49,654
Hurt him bad.

659
00:55:49,656 --> 00:55:51,616
To get a bunch of lawyers
to run for the exits?

660
00:55:51,618 --> 00:55:55,980
Howard would have to have
done something... unforgivable.

661
00:55:55,982 --> 00:55:57,501
At the end of it,

662
00:55:57,503 --> 00:56:00,226
he might never be able
to practice law again.

663
00:56:01,347 --> 00:56:04,028
Ah, he doesn't deserve that.

664
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:06,031
And who knows if we could pull it off?

665
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:13,076
Okay, maybe we could pull it off, yeah.

666
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,718
But we won't.

667
00:56:22,006 --> 00:56:26,809
We're talking about a career setback.

668
00:56:26,811 --> 00:56:30,414
A career setback for one lawyer.

669
00:56:32,336 --> 00:56:34,576
Yeah, and you could
help a lot of people.

670
00:56:34,578 --> 00:56:36,218
I-I get it, but...

671
00:56:39,223 --> 00:56:40,982
Kim, doing this, that...

672
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:44,305
It's not you.

673
00:56:44,307 --> 00:56:46,788
Okay?

674
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:49,270
You would not be okay with it.

675
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,714
Not in the cold light of day.

676
00:56:54,877 --> 00:56:57,400
Wouldn't I?

677
00:57:07,569 --> 00:57:09,209
I'm gonna go take a shower

678
00:57:09,211 --> 00:57:11,533
so I don't have to in the morning.

679
00:57:14,816 --> 00:57:17,378
Kim, you're shittin' me, right?

680
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,219
P-chew! P-chew!

681
00:58:35,452 --> 00:58:36,731
Bien.

682
00:58:36,733 --> 00:58:39,734
Bien.

683
00:58:52,387 --> 00:58:55,412
Bien. Bien, bien, bien, bien.

684
00:59:55,985 --> 00:59:59,008

00:00:02,401 --> 00:00:04,190
My father is a simple man.

3
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:05,938
I don't trust him.

4
00:00:07,145 --> 00:00:08,559
Call 911.

5
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:10,274
He took these.

6
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:13,724
This is the first time
I've done this... for anyone.

7
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:14,839
I don't know
what you do,

8
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,400
but Mr. Fring must think
you're quite good at it.

9
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:19,857
Ehrmantraut.
Security consultant.

10
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:21,920
I don't think what happened
was an accident.

11
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:24,027
He was improving until
the thing with the insurance,

12
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:25,499
so I forced him out.

13
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:28,774
Well, Howard, I guess
that's your cross to bear.

14
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:49,950
<i>Six every touchdown.</i>

15
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,782
<i>- But who keeps track of that?
- It's all on the computer.</i>

16
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:55,930
<i>Computer does everything.
Every stat gets converted into points.</i>

17
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:58,542
<i>I don't know.
Sounds kind of dumb, to be honest.</i>

18
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,727
<i>- I just wanna watch the game.
- You're afraid to lose 20 bucks.</i>

19
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:05,564
<i>You wanna bet, let's do it.
Why mess with all this extra stuff?</i>

20
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:10,277
<i>Trust me, it's fun. You end up cheering
for a lot of weird things on Sunday.</i>

21
00:02:26,817 --> 00:02:31,109
He's no longer in a coma,
but he's unresponsive.

22
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,035
His condition is stable.

23
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,171
They're managing his blood pressure.

24
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,956
But whether he will wake up...

25
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,726
and understand
what's going on around him...

26
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,742
there's no way of knowing.

27
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,992
That's unacceptable.

28
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:49,218
Gustavo, he's getting
very good care here.

29
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:52,429
There's very little
even the best hospitals could do.

30
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,738
Now...

31
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,992
might it be different
if he was in the care...

32
00:02:58,113 --> 00:03:03,515
of someplace
like Johns Hopkins, perhaps?

33
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:08,105
Or...

34
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,640
it could make no difference at all.

35
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,101
But in the end....

36
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:19,578
In the end...

37
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:24,312
I can think of no better judgment
on this man.

38
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:30,445
Isn't this what he deserves?

39
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:34,953
I decide what he deserves.

40
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,264
No one else.

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,521
Want some fresh OJ?

45
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:42,270
Mmm. Good. Vitamin C.
It'll help you heal quicker.

46
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:44,554
I don't think it works like that.

47
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:46,707
It might. You don't know.

48
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:48,176
I'm good.

49
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:52,410
Oh, I've also got leftover bacon
from my breakfast sandwich.

50
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:54,866
That's got definite healing powers.

51
00:04:54,943 --> 00:04:56,276
Okay, that I believe.

52
00:04:56,353 --> 00:05:00,070
And I made coffee,
put a little cinnamon in it for flavor.

53
00:05:00,157 --> 00:05:01,843
Just trying something different.

54
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:04,450
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

55
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:08,088
- Oh, did I wake you with the noise?
- No. No, not at all.

56
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:11,051
- I totally did, didn't I?
- No, I was getting up...

57
00:05:11,128 --> 00:05:12,558
- I'm sorry... eventually.
- I've got

58
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:14,137
job interviews lined up.

59
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,668
I wanted to get an early jump.

60
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:19,094
I'm starting down south,
office manager interview in Polvadera...

61
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:22,255
then I'm working my way
up north to Algodones.

62
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:23,667
I got a lot of ground to cover.

63
00:05:23,744 --> 00:05:26,773
Jimmy, you know,
you can take some time off.

64
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:31,078
Nobody's gonna ding you for not having
a steady job right this minute.

65
00:05:33,023 --> 00:05:34,395
Why wait?

66
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:38,148
I don't want unemployment
hanging over my head.

67
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:40,928
And we could use
another paycheck, and....

68
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,708
Besides, this is your office now.

69
00:05:43,785 --> 00:05:46,292
- I don't wanna be a distraction.
- You're not a distraction.

70
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:48,984
That's right.
Because I'll be out finding me a job.

71
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:50,417
Wish me luck.

72
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:51,707
Good luck.

73
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:55,301
- Thai or Mexican?
- Hmm?

74
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:57,370
I'm gonna pick up dinner
on the way back.

75
00:05:57,447 --> 00:05:59,946
Oh. Uh,
either. Your choice.

76
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:01,922
And what a choice it shall be.

77
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:04,726
Yeah. Okay. Jimmy, wait. Are you...?

78
00:06:04,888 --> 00:06:06,787
You're not going to that meeting?

79
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:10,849
No. If there's anything important,
Howard knows how to find me.

80
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:06,742
It's just me.

81
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:26,389
Papa.

82
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:28,888
It's over.

83
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:15,833
You can keep that.

84
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,282
No one's coming for it.

85
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,342
Mijo.

86
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:00,420
And when is it over for you?

87
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:04,224
I'm working on it.

88
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,197
Hi.

89
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,673
You see there, that's Alma,
and on the left is Ollie...

90
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,209
Mr. Neff's aunt and uncle.

91
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:58,787
They started this company
almost 50 years ago.

92
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:00,081
- Whoa.
- Hmm.

93
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:01,691
- Look at that.
- Yeah.

94
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,050
And we think that other fellow
is Frank Corker.

95
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:05,448
One of the early repairmen.

96
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:08,425
- Oh, they must've relied on him a lot.
- That's a Thermo-Fax.

97
00:10:08,502 --> 00:10:11,907
It needed a specially-coated paper
to get an image off one of those babies.

98
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:13,720
Uhh! You know your stuff.

99
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:17,423
Ah! I worked in a mail room,
so I talked to a lot of repairmen.

100
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,525
A lot.
They love talking shop.

101
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:23,036
Yes.
They are a lonely bunch, for sure.

102
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:27,932
This one was a real big seller for Neff,
really put us on the map.

103
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:30,220
- That's the 6500 color copier.
- Yeah.

104
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,285
That's a warhorse.

105
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:34,439
You ever see the guts of this beast?
It takes 15 seconds to get a printout.

106
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:38,569
- I... worked with one back in Chicago.
- That machine was almost too good.

107
00:10:38,646 --> 00:10:41,489
Counterfeiters used it
to make phony $5 bills.

108
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:42,983
- What? That's...
- Yeah.

109
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,862
That's... That's not right.

110
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:49,569
Oh, look. You got a lot
of hardware over here.

111
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:52,722
Yes, Mr. Neff loves
sponsoring the kids.

112
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:56,788
- Bowling, that's fun.
- We had a pretty good run in the '90s...

113
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:00,046
but we don't find kids
much interested anymore.

114
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:04,014
Yeah, this generation is all hacky sack
and video games.

115
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:06,214
Ain't that the truth? Yeah.

116
00:11:07,372 --> 00:11:08,415
Hummels.

117
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:11,032
Yes. Those were Alma's.

118
00:11:11,109 --> 00:11:14,462
She loved collecting the little things.
God rest her soul.

119
00:11:14,726 --> 00:11:17,946
Yeah, I knew a lady. Same way.

120
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:22,860
Ah! Touring the wall of crap, I see.
I need to drag that stuff to the dumpster.

121
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:25,102
Just haven't had a chance
to motivate myself.

122
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:27,569
- Mr. Neff, James McGill.
- Just "Jimmy" is fine.

123
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,521
Jimmy. Pleasure.
Come on down, have a seat.

124
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:31,687
Yeah.

125
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:33,866
Guessing Henry filled you in
on what we look for?

126
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,014
Oh! He did indeed.

127
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:37,509
Uhm. Office-to-office salesman...

128
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:40,147
willing to have multiple doors
slammed in my face...

129
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:41,797
with one mission:

130
00:11:41,874 --> 00:11:43,876
Upgrade, upgrade, upgrade...

131
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,722
their old copiers
to your top-of-the-line new ones.

132
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:48,540
You think you have the chops?

133
00:11:48,617 --> 00:11:52,203
- It's a lot harder than it sounds.
- I'd sure love a crack at it.

134
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,335
I'm told stubbornness
and persuasiveness...

135
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:56,183
are two of my top qualities.

136
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:58,928
I have to say,
he knows his way around a copier.

137
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:00,467
No kidding.

138
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,337
Well....

139
00:12:07,164 --> 00:12:10,198
Says here you were a lawyer...

140
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:14,120
up until not that long ago.

141
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:17,400
What changed?

142
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:22,128
Well, you know why God
made snakes before he made lawyers?

143
00:12:22,218 --> 00:12:24,042
He needed the practice.

144
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:26,194
Needed the practice.

145
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:27,515
- Yeah.
- Right?

146
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:31,409
That's the only lawyer joke I know
because all the others are true stories.

147
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:35,628
Look, I know you're looking for
somebody with sales experience...

148
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:37,045
and I don't have any.

149
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:41,073
Except... Except being a lawyer.

150
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,352
Look, being a lawyer,
my job was sales.

151
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:46,274
I was selling to judges,
I was selling to juries.

152
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:47,693
Sometimes
I was selling to clients...

153
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,033
to take the best deal
from a series of bad options.

154
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,592
But every hour of every day,
I was convincing...

155
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:55,912
persuading, I was selling.

156
00:12:57,132 --> 00:12:59,025
I hear what you're saying.

157
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:03,509
We have a lot of high-ticket items,
and a clientele primed to say no.

158
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:08,159
Well, my spirit animal is a Gila monster,
and once I latch on, I don't let go.

159
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:11,894
I like it, I like it.

160
00:13:12,414 --> 00:13:15,399
Well, you make a lot of
excellent points, Jimmy.

161
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,860
I can see why Henry
wanted me to meet you.

162
00:13:17,937 --> 00:13:20,540
- Thank you for coming down.
- Absolutely. Anytime.

163
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:21,969
We'll put our heads together,

164
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:23,727
have a decision
in about a week or so.

165
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,436
- We'll let you know then.
- Thank you very much.

166
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,095
- You bet.
- Great.

167
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:57,063
- Yes?
- I'm sorry, can I have another minute?

168
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,631
I'll be real quick.

169
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,360
Yeah, sure, Jimmy.
What's on your mind?

170
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:06,063
I know you're gonna take time,
consider your options...

171
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,108
but maybe we can
settle this right now.

172
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:11,589
There's a thing that we all know
called opportunity cost.

173
00:14:11,671 --> 00:14:15,081
The time you spend looking for someone
is time I could be working for you.

174
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:19,606
And sure, there are salesmen out there
with way more experience than me.

175
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:23,444
What are the chances one will
walk through that door in the next week?

176
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:25,661
And is it worth the wait?

177
00:14:25,738 --> 00:14:27,753
Maybe. Maybe.

178
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:30,259
But I can tell you this:

179
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:33,825
None of them will have the connection
to your machines that I do.

180
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:35,138
None.

181
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,795
I worked in the mail room.

182
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:39,074
I know how important
the copy machine is.

183
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:41,223
Deadlines,
last-minute changes.

184
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,077
I was in there, clearing paper jams.

185
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:46,975
I was cleaning ink
off gears and rollers...

186
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,149
trying to figure out where
the mystery streaks were coming from.

187
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:52,301
I was down on my hands and knees...

188
00:14:52,378 --> 00:14:55,209
with my tie over my shoulder
and ink-stained hands...

189
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:57,074
and a line of assistants out the door,

190
00:14:57,151 --> 00:14:59,692
and they're all worried
they're gonna lose their job...

191
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:02,465
if they don't get their document
the next five minutes.

192
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:05,371
I know... I know better than anyone...

193
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:09,709
that the copier,
it's the beating heart of any business.

194
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:13,350
It goes down, it causes delays,
that is lost money...

195
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:16,629
that is frustrated employees,
that's a negative work environment.

196
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:19,204
That's a business on life support.

197
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:23,243
But you plug one of your new machines
into the system...

198
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,052
whew! That is a healthy,
strong heartbeat.

199
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:29,309
Ca-chunk, ca-chunk, ca-chunk.

200
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,451
That is a healthy business.

201
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:33,067
Ca-chunk, ca-chunk, ca-chunk.

202
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:35,181
That is successful business.

203
00:15:35,497 --> 00:15:37,642
And that's what we're selling.

204
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:44,482
One minute.

205
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:56,327
- I don't need to see anymore.
- I mean, he's kind of exciting.

206
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:59,715
He's great. The passion
that this gentleman has....

207
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:03,134
- Can you imagine sending that guy out?
- Yeah. Come on.

208
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:04,966
Jimmy.

209
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:06,714
Welcome to the team.

210
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:09,319
- Really?
- Damn right.

211
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:12,121
Congrats. We'll get you set up
with Audrey in HR...

212
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:15,813
fill out your paperwork. Hopefully,
you'll be all set by end of day.

213
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,678
So just like that, huh?

214
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:19,715
Yep. Why wait
when we can get you rolling?

215
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:22,699
You were gonna take some time,
consider your options...

216
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:27,082
but I just come in
and did that little song and dance...

217
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,388
and I'm in?

218
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:31,001
Yeah. Right. That's right.

219
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:34,790
Are you out of your mind?

220
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:37,985
You don't know me.

221
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,496
I just came in off the street.

222
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,528
You guys are like a couple of cats.

223
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:46,477
I come in, wave a shiny object around,
you're like, "I want that."

224
00:16:46,857 --> 00:16:50,131
No due diligence,
no background check.

225
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,720
No. "Just hire the guy
that says them fancy words."

226
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:58,050
I could be a serial killer. I could be
a guy who pees in your coffee pot.

227
00:16:58,127 --> 00:16:59,798
I could be both.

228
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:04,604
- So you're not taking the job?
- No, I'm not taking the job.

229
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,224
Suckers.

230
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,026
I feel sorry for you.

231
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:55,472
Hello. I-I'm wondering,
are you still interviewing...

232
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:57,601
for the sales associate position?

233
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,664
Great. I can be there in 20 minutes.

234
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,968
James McGill.

235
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:11,336
Ellen, okay. Wonderful.
Well, thank you, Ellen. I'll see you soon.

236
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:35,792
Pop-Pop, look how high I can go.

237
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:37,857
Yeah, that's good.

238
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:39,505
You be careful.

239
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:41,481
<i>You wanna do a couple more?</i>

240
00:18:47,073 --> 00:18:48,410
Okay.

241
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,293
Yeah?

242
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,999
This is he.

243
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:59,726
Meet at what time?

244
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:06,343
Yeah, I can be there.
You let her know.

245
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:08,363
Yeah.

246
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:11,141
All right, baby.

247
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,483
Time to get you back to your mama.

248
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:15,076
Five more minutes?

249
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:18,476
- Oh, honey, come on.
- Please?

250
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:20,983
Five minutes.

251
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:22,963
You're on the clock.

252
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,898
Thank you.

253
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:55,769
- Good afternoon.
- Yeah. Madrigal Electromotive?

254
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:58,120
Down the hall,
the Sandia Room on your left.

255
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,391
Thank you.

256
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:14,628
Oh, good.

257
00:20:15,073 --> 00:20:16,499
Take a seat.

258
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:41,371
You didn't come all this way
just for me.

259
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,499
I frequently travel
to conference with distributors.

260
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,860
Albuquerque is one of many stops.

261
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:48,019
Hmm.

262
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:51,472
Okay.

263
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,920
I'm just...

264
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:58,264
looking for an explanation.

265
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,708
You steal an employee's badge...

266
00:21:00,785 --> 00:21:03,576
waltz through my warehouse,
interfere with operations...

267
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:06,116
and strong-arm my facility manager.

268
00:21:06,742 --> 00:21:07,910
Why?

269
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:10,885
I'm on your books
as a security consultant.

270
00:21:10,962 --> 00:21:15,147
If I show my face in your warehouse,
it makes for a better cover story.

271
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:18,867
Anyone ever ask if I was there, I was.

272
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:23,038
Plus, you had a few things that needed
correcting, so consider it a bonus.

273
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,833
That's not the point.
This is meant to be a paper transaction.

274
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,670
You sit at home and we pay you.

275
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:31,686
Your own money.

276
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:36,426
Doing what you did, the way you did it,
raises the threat of exposure.

277
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:39,756
The way I see it, it lowers the threat.

278
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:43,928
Like I said, now there's a face
to the name that cashes the check.

279
00:21:47,253 --> 00:21:48,921
So...

280
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:52,186
what's your plan, then?

281
00:21:52,837 --> 00:21:56,116
Madrigal has eight terminals
in the southwest.

282
00:21:56,341 --> 00:21:58,524
One down, seven to go.

283
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:05,477
And if I asked you to reconsider?

284
00:22:05,554 --> 00:22:07,625
I'd ask you to do the same.

285
00:22:26,131 --> 00:22:29,448
At the moment,
you have Gus Fring's respect.

286
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,500
I'd want to keep that if I were you.

287
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,841
Hello. Hi.

288
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:11,130
Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Diseth...

289
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:14,889
this is Dr. Maureen Bruckner,
just arrived this morning.

290
00:23:14,966 --> 00:23:17,590
- Nice to meet you. Hello.
- Dr. Bruckner.

291
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:20,199
Dr. Bruckner's visiting
from Johns Hopkins.

292
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:22,240
We're asking her
to take the lead

293
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,206
with some of the
more severe cases in the ward...

294
00:23:24,283 --> 00:23:26,215
including Mr. Salamanca.

295
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:27,445
Johns Hopkins?

296
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:31,121
Yes, a generous grant came through
which allowed Dr. Bruckner...

297
00:23:31,198 --> 00:23:33,960
- to lend us her expertise.
- Only temporarily.

298
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,243
I'm not here to step on any toes.

299
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,195
Okay, I...

300
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:43,707
Our staff can help with the database
whenever you're ready to pull records...

301
00:23:43,784 --> 00:23:47,412
but I'm available anytime
if you have any questions.

302
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:50,477
Thank you. Again,
I don't wanna step on toes.

303
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,178
We can co-manage care,

304
00:23:52,255 --> 00:23:54,071
- if you like, we...
- No, no.

305
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,438
- He's all yours. Good luck.
- Thank you.

306
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:04,537
Okay. Um, well,
I will let you get to it, then.

307
00:24:04,614 --> 00:24:07,494
Let us know if there's anything you need,
anything at all.

308
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,839
Absolutely.

309
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,256
Thank you.

310
00:24:10,571 --> 00:24:12,010
Are you the family?

311
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,648
Are you the family?

312
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,930
- Yes.
- Sons.

313
00:24:23,491 --> 00:24:24,889
He's our uncle.

314
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,701
I want to let you know...

315
00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:30,579
that your uncle has been getting
excellent care here at Lovelace.

316
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:33,265
But we're going to try something
a little different.

317
00:24:33,342 --> 00:24:37,490
Look, when parts of the brain
are damaged by a stroke...

318
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:39,628
those parts, they cannot be repaired.

319
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:43,543
Our job is to stimulate
your uncle's brain...

320
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,238
and teach it to rewire itself.

321
00:24:46,711 --> 00:24:49,324
We are going to start here
with the legs.

322
00:24:53,077 --> 00:24:54,777
When did they get here?

323
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:01,214
Don't worry.
We're still running things.

324
00:25:05,848 --> 00:25:06,984
Hello.

325
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,228
Are you family as well?

326
00:25:09,305 --> 00:25:10,601
Friends of the family.

327
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:11,932
Okay.

328
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:13,218
As I was saying...

329
00:25:13,295 --> 00:25:17,025
I'll return later with
an occupational therapist...

330
00:25:17,102 --> 00:25:20,398
to begin some electrical stimulus.
In the meantime...

331
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:22,856
I'd ask that you speak to Hector.

332
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:27,287
Chances are, on some level,
he can hear you.

333
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:31,796
The more you speak, the more
his brain will work to respond...

334
00:25:31,873 --> 00:25:35,418
and find pathways to connect.

335
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:37,462
Okay? Good.

336
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:40,481
We'll do everything we can
to help your uncle.

337
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:42,940
Nice to meet you all.

338
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:56,914
Speak.

339
00:26:20,102 --> 00:26:21,855
Don Hector.

340
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:24,997
Everything is good out on the street.

341
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:34,567
All our men are keeping busy.

342
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:37,066
Real busy.

343
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,500
That's right, Don Hector.

344
00:26:39,812 --> 00:26:42,800
We're staying on top of the count.

345
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,808
It's all looking good.

346
00:26:49,444 --> 00:26:53,177
We had a problem with that
shit gang over on Lomas, but...

347
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:55,682
we showed some muscle.

348
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:57,835
Took care of it.

349
00:26:58,356 --> 00:27:01,339
No one wants to mess
with the Salamancas.

350
00:27:01,873 --> 00:27:03,155
No one.

351
00:27:28,258 --> 00:27:30,261
You look good, Don Hector.

352
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:32,664
Real good.

353
00:27:33,496 --> 00:27:36,144
The doctors, they're gonna fix you up.

354
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:44,273
Yes.

355
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:48,305
You're gonna get past this...

356
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:53,222
and be stronger than ever.

357
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,522
- Yes?
- It's me.

358
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:26,773
Can we meet?

359
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,058
- Now is not a good time.
- I'm in town.

360
00:28:29,135 --> 00:28:31,425
I can easily meet
wherever's convenient.

361
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:34,713
Assume this is a secure line.

362
00:28:35,602 --> 00:28:38,906
I spoke with your security contractor.

363
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,886
I explained the situation again.

364
00:28:42,074 --> 00:28:44,543
But he's going to keep doing
what he's doing.

365
00:28:45,035 --> 00:28:46,785
I understand.

366
00:28:47,078 --> 00:28:50,667
But what he's doing makes no sense.

367
00:28:50,744 --> 00:28:53,988
- Do his reasons matter?
- They do if he's unreliable.

368
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,658
He is reliable.

369
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:59,780
So I'm just supposed to let him
keep stealing my employees' badges?

370
00:28:59,883 --> 00:29:01,608
I don't know where he'll turn up next...

371
00:29:01,685 --> 00:29:04,996
what disruption he'll cause,
what mess I'll have to clean up.

372
00:29:05,116 --> 00:29:07,601
This isn't something
I want to worry about.

373
00:29:07,678 --> 00:29:10,472
Then I suggest you give
the man a badge.

374
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:20,160
Varga and Salamanca's man, Colon,
they came by in the afternoon.

375
00:29:20,237 --> 00:29:21,912
Nephews were in his room all day.

376
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:24,952
Bruckner saw him three times,
couple of specialists with her.

377
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,027
They took him for a brain scan

378
00:29:28,078 --> 00:29:29,328
And?

379
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,261
That's everything. No change.

380
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:16,394
You want me back at the hospital?

381
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,203
No.

382
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:27,066
Call Victor.

383
00:30:27,513 --> 00:30:29,328
Have him meet us.

384
00:31:29,825 --> 00:31:31,464
Just a few more.

385
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:33,454
I know Chuck was thorough...

386
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:36,722
but even I didn't think there was
gonna be this much paperwork.

387
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:39,222
Having worked with him
as long as I did...

388
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:43,082
I was actually
pleasantly surprised by his restraint.

389
00:31:43,305 --> 00:31:47,133
This is the agreement for the transfer
of property, as discussed.

390
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,863
If you can initial here.

391
00:31:49,928 --> 00:31:52,939
And right down here.

392
00:31:53,016 --> 00:31:55,972
- Am I late?
- Kim. No, right on time.

393
00:31:56,226 --> 00:31:59,226
We were just finishing up
Rebecca's side of things.

394
00:31:59,303 --> 00:32:00,537
Hi, Rebecca.

395
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:02,762
It's nice to see you again.

396
00:32:03,317 --> 00:32:06,633
I'm sorry we didn't get a chance
to talk more at the service.

397
00:32:06,737 --> 00:32:09,928
Oh, I don't think
anyone felt much like talking.

398
00:32:10,157 --> 00:32:13,348
- Jimmy's not coming?
- I'm here on his behalf.

399
00:32:13,425 --> 00:32:15,861
And that should do it.

400
00:32:15,938 --> 00:32:19,502
I apologize for bringing us
together so soon after Chuck's service.

401
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:21,378
It's really my fault.

402
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,510
Howard's being polite.

403
00:32:23,587 --> 00:32:25,110
Thank you, Julie.

404
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:30,618
In any event, we thought
since Rebecca was still in town...

405
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:33,238
better to talk through
the estate in person.

406
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:34,500
Sure.

407
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,603
Chuck left the house to Rebecca...

408
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,300
and as executor,
I'll be liquidating the property.

409
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:43,486
Howard suggested, and of course, I agree,
that it would be the right thing...

410
00:32:43,563 --> 00:32:47,070
for Jimmy to go through whatever
survived and take whatever he wants.

411
00:32:47,147 --> 00:32:50,486
- I mean, anything with sentimental value.
- We can set up a time.

412
00:32:50,563 --> 00:32:54,280
The estate can provide a truck and
storage for anything he chooses to keep.

413
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:55,556
That's okay.

414
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:57,351
Jimmy doesn't want any of it.

415
00:32:57,996 --> 00:32:58,997
You sure?

416
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:02,429
I think the garage is pretty intact,
except for some water damage.

417
00:33:02,506 --> 00:33:05,327
He doesn't want it.
Thank you.

418
00:33:07,422 --> 00:33:09,769
Okay. I understand.

419
00:33:10,937 --> 00:33:12,878
Well, then...

420
00:33:13,136 --> 00:33:14,811
as far as Jimmy's concerned...

421
00:33:14,888 --> 00:33:17,954
all that's left is for him
to sign this agreement letter.

422
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:22,121
Once that's done,
we can disperse his share of the estate.

423
00:33:22,646 --> 00:33:25,207
Let me guess. Four thousand?

424
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:28,360
Five.

425
00:33:29,953 --> 00:33:33,637
It's what you give when you cut someone
from a will and not have it contested.

426
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,699
Just enough money to show
the recipient wasn't forgotten.

427
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:42,884
Chuck also left a substantial endowment
for a scholarship for deserving youth.

428
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:45,964
I was hoping Jimmy would agree
to serve on the board.

429
00:33:47,296 --> 00:33:49,111
I'll let him know.

430
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:51,086
What else?

431
00:33:51,388 --> 00:33:52,890
Well...

432
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:56,074
Chuck left Jimmy a personal letter.

433
00:33:57,173 --> 00:33:59,029
His eyes only.

434
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:11,701
Howard, thank you for everything
that you've done.

435
00:34:11,778 --> 00:34:13,552
I know it's been difficult.

436
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:16,019
It's hard on all of us.

437
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:19,593
Well, I don't wanna keep you.
Let me walk you out.

438
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:23,158
Actually, Howard,
we have a few more things to discuss.

439
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:28,608
Kim, please give Jimmy my best.

440
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:30,969
I will.

441
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:33,306
It was very nice seeing you, Rebecca.

442
00:34:33,383 --> 00:34:34,921
You too.

443
00:34:37,507 --> 00:34:39,322
Safe travels.

444
00:34:44,644 --> 00:34:47,714
- Kim.
- I just... um...

445
00:34:50,014 --> 00:34:52,172
I just...

446
00:34:53,062 --> 00:34:55,104
had to know...

447
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:57,246
what were you thinking?

448
00:34:58,188 --> 00:34:59,690
About?

449
00:34:59,993 --> 00:35:01,991
What were you thinking
when you came to Jimmy

450
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:04,980
on the day of his brother's funeral
and laid that shit on him?

451
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,910
That Chuck killed himself?

452
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,769
What's wrong with you?

453
00:35:11,398 --> 00:35:13,588
I-I thought....

454
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,569
I thought
I owed it to Jimmy to tell him.

455
00:35:19,646 --> 00:35:21,527
Owed it to him?

456
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,172
Did you owe it to Rebecca?

457
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:26,121
You tell her your theory?

458
00:35:26,311 --> 00:35:31,707
That Chuck intentionally
set himself on fire?

459
00:35:33,944 --> 00:35:35,118
I guess not.

460
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:37,746
I guess you just
saved that one for Jimmy.

461
00:35:37,823 --> 00:35:39,814
Kim, I didn't do it to hurt Jimmy...

462
00:35:39,891 --> 00:35:41,858
No. You did it
to make yourself feel better.

463
00:35:41,935 --> 00:35:44,510
- That's not what I was...
- To make yourself feel better

464
00:35:44,587 --> 00:35:46,569
by unloading your guilt.

465
00:35:46,665 --> 00:35:50,190
Who cares what it does to Jimmy
as long as Howard Hamlin is okay.

466
00:35:50,267 --> 00:35:52,673
- Kim, I-I don't think that's fair...
- Fair?

467
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,570
Let's talk about fair.

468
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,831
"Hey, let's let Jimmy dig around
the fire-damaged wreck...

469
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:01,227
where his brother died screaming.

470
00:36:01,304 --> 00:36:03,604
Let's let him
pick up a keepsake or two."

471
00:36:03,681 --> 00:36:07,997
That is so, so fair.
And did I hear you right?

472
00:36:08,074 --> 00:36:11,440
You want him to serve on the board
of a scholarship committee?

473
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:14,409
A scholarship that Chuck
never in a million years...

474
00:36:14,486 --> 00:36:17,572
would've given to Jimmy.
Never! It is just...

475
00:36:17,649 --> 00:36:20,924
I mean... Oh, what's this too, Howard?
What's in this?

476
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:24,169
One last "screw you, little brother"
from beyond the grave?

477
00:36:24,278 --> 00:36:26,971
I'm really supposed to do this
to him?

478
00:36:27,048 --> 00:36:28,812
All right. Kim.

479
00:36:29,947 --> 00:36:32,038
What can I do to make it better?

480
00:36:34,504 --> 00:36:35,956
Nothing.

481
00:36:37,424 --> 00:36:39,538
There is nothing you can do.

482
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,491
Just stay away.

483
00:37:05,676 --> 00:37:06,677
Hey.

484
00:37:06,844 --> 00:37:10,010
I hope you're hungry.
I bought way too much food.

485
00:37:10,087 --> 00:37:11,608
Yeah. I can always eat.

486
00:37:11,714 --> 00:37:13,622
Counter or couch?

487
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:16,483
- Uh-h-ha, Couch is good.
- Couch it is.

488
00:37:16,729 --> 00:37:21,528
If I remember correctly, in five minutes,
one of the classic movie channels...

489
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:24,416
is showing uh,
White Heat without interruption.

490
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:27,846
The other is showing
Jaws 3 with commercials.

491
00:37:27,923 --> 00:37:30,186
So a real Sophie's Choice.

492
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:33,411
It is Jaws 3-D, to be exact.

493
00:37:33,488 --> 00:37:34,827
Aah!

494
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:37,910
But Cagney wins this one.

495
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:41,142
All right.
Hey, I got us Thai iced teas...

496
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:44,827
unless you want me to pour you
something less non-alcoholic.

497
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:46,754
No, I'm good with that.

498
00:37:47,008 --> 00:37:49,724
So how was the job search?

499
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,533
Pretty good.
I uh...

500
00:37:51,797 --> 00:37:53,579
I got a couple leads.

501
00:37:53,711 --> 00:37:55,789
Actually, I got an offer.

502
00:37:55,922 --> 00:37:57,583
- Really?
- Yeah...

503
00:37:57,758 --> 00:38:01,736
but didn't feel quite right.

504
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:03,108
It was....

505
00:38:03,563 --> 00:38:05,683
It just wasn't a perfect fit.

506
00:38:05,774 --> 00:38:09,933
But I think I might get a call back
on one or two of the others.

507
00:38:10,074 --> 00:38:13,191
Wow, that's a pretty good first day.

508
00:38:13,322 --> 00:38:16,035
You know, somebody's gonna
be lucky to get you.

509
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,427
How was your day?

510
00:38:20,584 --> 00:38:24,631
I just mostly stayed here,
trying to get organized.

511
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:29,394
No pressure from Paige and Kevin,
but I gotta get back on the horse, right?

512
00:38:29,649 --> 00:38:31,533
You are right.

513
00:38:31,703 --> 00:38:34,996
And movie's about to start.

514
00:38:35,073 --> 00:38:38,925
So where is the remote?

515
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:31,627
I'm not available at the moment.
Leave a message.

516
00:40:31,704 --> 00:40:35,035
Hey, it's me.
Listen, I got something for you.

517
00:40:35,135 --> 00:40:36,867
It's a job.

518
00:40:37,024 --> 00:40:40,788
I think you're really gonna like this.

519
00:40:40,865 --> 00:40:43,123
So call me.

520
00:41:08,538 --> 00:41:10,463
We're taking six tonight.

521
00:41:11,797 --> 00:41:13,090
What?

522
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:15,611
Six keys. It's what the boss would want.

523
00:41:16,446 --> 00:41:18,627
You're gonna back me up or what?

524
00:41:20,112 --> 00:41:21,655
Yeah.

525
00:41:43,272 --> 00:41:45,220
Where's the rest?

526
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,377
I only see five.

527
00:41:51,503 --> 00:41:53,830
That was a one-time only.

528
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,779
Not the way we see it.

529
00:41:55,912 --> 00:41:57,783
That's the way it is.

530
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:03,236
Salamancas get six.

531
00:42:03,576 --> 00:42:05,799
We're not leaving without six.

532
00:42:09,146 --> 00:42:11,275
Your boss isn't giving orders.

533
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:13,650
He can barely even open his eyes.

534
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:16,258
I'm giving the orders.

535
00:42:17,946 --> 00:42:20,353
Take the five or leave with nothing.

536
00:42:30,524 --> 00:42:32,506
Do you wanna go?

537
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,061
You heard him.

538
00:42:38,228 --> 00:42:39,842
Six.

539
00:42:40,467 --> 00:42:42,345
Put it away.

540
00:42:44,056 --> 00:42:46,478
Do you really wanna do this?

541
00:43:21,071 --> 00:43:24,080
Yeah, that's what I thought.

542
00:43:55,214 --> 00:43:58,448
That's how you do it.
We had them pissing their pants.

543
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:36,606
I know what you've done.

544
00:44:39,116 --> 00:44:41,431
The Salamancas...

545
00:44:41,636 --> 00:44:43,564
they do not.

546
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:46,357
Do you understand
what I am saying?

547
00:44:55,635 --> 00:44:57,658
Look at me.

548
00:45:01,026 --> 00:45:03,056
From now on...

549
00:45:03,445 --> 00:45:07,479
you are mine.

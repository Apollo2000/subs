1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:01,618
He's got a gun...

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,205
to my father's head.

3
00:00:03,207 --> 00:00:05,675
We take care of Lalo. Then we'll talk.

4
00:00:05,677 --> 00:00:09,512
Gray Monte Carlo occupied by one male.

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,300
We had a verbal agreement.

6
00:00:14,302 --> 00:00:17,094
Kevin still gets his call
center. Everybody wins.

7
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:18,104
I can't do this anymore.

8
00:00:18,106 --> 00:00:20,114
You lie! I lie!

9
00:00:20,116 --> 00:00:22,032
- Either we end this now...
- Or what?

10
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:23,392
Or maybe...

11
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:24,702
Maybe we get married.

12
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:34,754
And anything that already happened...

13
00:00:34,756 --> 00:00:36,814
we're not going back over all that.

14
00:00:36,816 --> 00:00:39,408
Let's just focus on from here on out.

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,802
Right. Past is past.

16
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:43,263
And moving forward...

17
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:46,273
Uh, if I have the urge
to not tell you something,

18
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:47,666
then I've gotta tell you.

19
00:00:47,668 --> 00:00:49,510
Right. Full disclosure.

20
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:52,355
- And it works both ways?
- Works both ways.

21
00:00:55,643 --> 00:00:59,310
And... mute.

22
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:01,312
Okay, what if I have the urge

23
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:02,663
to not tell you something,

24
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:04,181
but I tell you,

25
00:01:04,183 --> 00:01:06,959
and you don't like what you hear?

26
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:10,313
I just want to know what's going on.

27
00:01:10,315 --> 00:01:11,913
Yeah, but...

28
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:15,367
Jimmy, we'll cross that
bridge when we come to it.

29
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,993
There he is.

30
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:29,649
So, we're really doing this, huh?

31
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:31,418
Yeah, looks that way.

32
00:01:33,564 --> 00:01:34,746
Am I late?

33
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:36,064
- Nope.
- Cool.

34
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:37,323
Mornin'.

35
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:38,842
- Thanks for coming.
- Good to see you.

36
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:41,327
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

37
00:01:52,516 --> 00:01:53,690
Psst!

38
00:02:03,518 --> 00:02:05,035
What's up?

39
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:07,353
Want me to hold the rings for you?

40
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:09,312
Oh, there's no rings.

41
00:02:09,314 --> 00:02:10,687
Well, I can fix that easy.

42
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:12,525
I seen a clerk downstairs.

43
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:13,859
He had a nice rock,

44
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:15,861
probably about a half a carat.

45
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:18,431
Huell, no.

46
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:20,342
This is a different kind of thing.

47
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,779
Oh. It's like that.

48
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:27,949
Then we should do it up
right, then, for the rugrat.

49
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:29,843
No, there's no rugrat.

50
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:34,623
Well, you're at least gonna
take her somewhere after this?

51
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,024
Little honeymoon?

52
00:02:36,026 --> 00:02:39,811
I gotta friend who
runs a B&B in Roswell.

53
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:41,521
Get you a good deal.

54
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:43,273
How about we take a raincheck on that?

55
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:44,557
We just need to get this done.

56
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:47,636
You feel me?

57
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:50,287
This is a legal arrangement.

58
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:52,813
This way, if I get into trouble,

59
00:02:52,815 --> 00:02:54,993
they can't make her testify against me.

60
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:58,171
You getting hitched for that?

61
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:00,090
Yeah.

62
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:03,501
Yeah. That's all this is.

63
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:06,170
You got it?

64
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:09,415
She gonna be a McGill or Goodman?

65
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,326
Wexler.

66
00:03:11,328 --> 00:03:12,894
I-I got to go finish this.

67
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:17,515
Here you go.

68
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:19,000
Thanks.

69
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:20,496
Sir, do you have documentation

70
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:21,961
of your two previous dissolutions?

71
00:03:21,963 --> 00:03:23,929
Yeah.

72
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:32,080
Great. One sec.

73
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:48,680
This okay with you?

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,454
Of course.

75
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:53,653
Yeah.

76
00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:56,229
I just mean, um...

77
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:58,431
this might not be what you dreamed of

78
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:01,100
when you were 12.

79
00:04:01,102 --> 00:04:04,045
Jimmy, it's not about that.

80
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:07,139
This is just, you know...

81
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:09,308
- everything we talked about.
- Right.

82
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,352
Right. I know.

83
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:14,155
Just making sure.

84
00:04:14,157 --> 00:04:15,481
All set.

85
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:17,541
I just need $25.

86
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:18,984
I got it.

87
00:04:28,463 --> 00:04:31,306
_

88
00:04:53,263 --> 00:04:55,354
Sorry to keep you waiting.

89
00:04:55,356 --> 00:04:57,381
Been that kind of day.

90
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:03,880
So... Wexler-McGill?

91
00:05:03,882 --> 00:05:06,349
Yes.

92
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:08,794
And you picked the
short vows, that right?

93
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:10,278
Yes.

94
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,781
And you have your witnesses?

95
00:05:12,783 --> 00:05:14,599
Mm-hmm.

96
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:16,718
Okay, then.

97
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,269
Here we go.

98
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:22,890
Here we go.

99
00:05:22,892 --> 00:05:24,609
Oh.

100
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:30,273
"Do you, James Morgan McGill,

101
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:33,301
take Kimberly Wexler to... "

102
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:35,537
Hmm. No middle name.

103
00:05:37,082 --> 00:05:39,323
"To be your lawfully wedded wife?

104
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:43,127

I do.

Mm-hmm.

120
00:06:21,618 --> 00:06:24,702
Do you have the rings?

We, um...

122
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:27,856
We didn't do that.

123
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:29,040
No rings.

124

Sorry. I-I just can't get away.

- Saul Goodman, speedy justice for you!
- _

137
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:43,480
I been calling you.

138
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:45,558
Yeah. I had a busy morning.

139
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,807
Go to lock-up.

140
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:48,296
Client's waiting for you.

141
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:49,804
My "client"? Wha...

142
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:51,147
Who got picked up this time?

143
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:53,633
Jorge De Guzman.

144
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:57,053
Who the hell is Jorge De Guzman?

145
00:07:57,055 --> 00:08:00,181
Who do you think?

146
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:29,845
State vs. Jorge De Guzman.

147
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:34,332
Case CR-2004003022.

148
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:37,760
Mr. De Guzman.

149
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:40,780
Murder in the first degree,

150
00:08:40,782 --> 00:08:43,691
robbery while armed
with a deadly weapon,

151
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:46,652
tampering with evidence, arson...

152
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:48,760
Your Honor, uh, my client waives

153
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,182
the reading of the remaining charges.

154
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:52,934
How does he plead?

155
00:08:52,936 --> 00:08:55,895
"Not guilty" on all charges.

156
00:08:55,897 --> 00:08:58,406
I'd like to schedule a pre-trial hearing

157
00:08:58,408 --> 00:08:59,700
in six weeks.

158
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:01,967
And I'm going to deny bond.

159
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:03,027
Uh, Your Honor...

160
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:04,478
That's my decision.

161
00:09:13,632 --> 00:09:15,506
Thank you for making time for us

162
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:16,782
on such short notice.

163
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:22,588
We wanted to tell you face-to-face

164
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,398
how much everyone in the firm

165
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,017
regrets what happened yesterday.

166
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:29,328
The situation in Tucamcari
spiraled out of control,

167
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,440
and we take full responsibility.

168
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:37,803
Kevin, you chose me as your attorney.

169
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:43,234
And that was the best day
of my professional life.

170
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:46,520
Yesterday was the worst
day of my professional life.

171
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:49,397
I can't tell you how much I regret

172
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,333
that I let you down.

173
00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:54,517
But I want you to know
that, if you choose

174
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,889
to move forward with me and with us,

175
00:09:56,891 --> 00:10:00,009
nothing like that
will ever happen again.

176
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,372
No one's denying that
things went off course,

177
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:08,159
but let's keep in mind that
over the last 18 months,

178
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:10,203
we've opened 24 new branches.

179
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:12,337
And, until Tucamcari,

180
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:16,776
the legal work has been... flawless.

181
00:10:18,654 --> 00:10:21,422
Well.

182
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:23,849
Kim, you dropped the
ball. That's for sure.

183
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:28,262
And, uh with all your smarts,

184
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:32,967
whole office full of
associates and fancy degrees...

185
00:10:32,969 --> 00:10:35,503
you get rolled over by...

186
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:39,173
Well, you know what happened.

187
00:10:42,036 --> 00:10:44,178
I expected more.

188
00:10:54,558 --> 00:10:55,825
Thanks for coming in.

189
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:01,312
Thank you, Kevin.

190
00:11:01,314 --> 00:11:03,481
Paige. Thank you.

191
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:06,016
Kim, one more thing.

192
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:10,949
This fella... McGill
or Goodman, whatever.

193
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:16,310
You could do a whole lot better.

194
00:11:26,831 --> 00:11:29,490
I'll say 50/50, but we gave it a shot.

195
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:32,869
Rich, we can't leave it like this.

196
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:36,146
Oh, he'll stew for a
bit, and then we'll see.

197
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:38,775
And if he does stick with us, then what?

198
00:11:38,777 --> 00:11:40,319
We walk on eggshells forever?

199
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:42,496
What's our alternative?

200
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:53,782
We countered with seven, right?

201
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:56,100
Yes, but after the survey...

202
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:57,943
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

203
00:11:57,945 --> 00:12:00,145
Do you mind if we take just
another minute of your time?

204
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:03,758
I guess.

205
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:10,998
Kevin, no matter what our
relationship looks like

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,034
moving forward,

207
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,602
we owe you the truth.

208
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:21,609
And the truth is, you
ignored our advice.

209
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,714
Oh, so this is my fault.

210
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:28,140
We said Mesa Verde

211
00:12:28,142 --> 00:12:30,384
should reconsider the
site for the call center.

212
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:32,328
You declined.

213
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,193
We advised you to keep the purchased lot

214
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:35,814
as an investment.

215
00:12:35,816 --> 00:12:37,575
You declined.

216
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:39,696
And we advised you to leave that meeting

217
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:41,263
when it became apparent
that the other side

218
00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:42,805
was negotiating in bad faith.

219
00:12:42,807 --> 00:12:44,489
You declined.

220
00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:47,884
At every point, we gave you
the best guidance we could,

221
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:50,829
and at every point, you
chose to go your own way.

222
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:53,174
We are your attorneys,

223
00:12:53,176 --> 00:12:55,552
and it is our job to advise you.

224
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:57,094
The decisions will always be yours,

225
00:12:57,096 --> 00:13:02,799
but... if you continue to ignore us...

226
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:04,819
then this is the wrong relationship.

227
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:13,043
And, Kevin, I have to tell you,

228
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:17,265
whoever represents you in the future...

229
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:20,001
I hope you're gonna listen
to them a little bit better.

230
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:23,838
That it?

231
00:13:29,912 --> 00:13:31,670
Alright, then.

232
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:33,222
See you on Thursday.

233
00:13:36,177 --> 00:13:37,560
Okay.

234
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:46,718
Well, uh... I guess we'll
get out of your hair.

235
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,154
Thursday.

236
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,775
JMM.

237
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:05,346
What's that?

238
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:07,481
Oh, that's my motto.

239
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:09,074
Yeah?

240
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:12,411
"Justice Matters Most".

241
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:17,683
Okay, brass tacks.

242
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:20,450
Um, how solid is this "De Guzman" thing?

243
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:22,830
Because if they find out you're
not who they think you are,

244
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:24,740
- that could be a little...
- It's not gonna be a problem.

245
00:14:24,742 --> 00:14:26,167
Great!

246
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,984
Um, first up,

247
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:30,279
we got to get the murder
rap down to manslaughter.

248
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:34,358
Now, I think that the DA
is primed to cut a deal.

249
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,495
So I say make 'em come
to us, power move...

250
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:39,363
- No.
- No?

251
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:43,517
Nope. No deal.

252
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,111
Here's the thing about going to trial...

253
00:14:46,113 --> 00:14:47,321
No, no, no, no, no.

254
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:50,599
No trial. No deal.

255
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:53,569
Okay, yeah. Sure. Just...

256
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:55,938
What did you have in mind?

257
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,640
You're gonna get me out on bail.

258
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:58,941
Bail?

259
00:14:58,943 --> 00:15:02,127
That's...

260
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:03,410
Well, the thing there...

261
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:05,539
I mean, I don't know how
things work south of the border,

262
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,616
but here, under these circumstances,

263
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:11,379
uh, well, that's a long shot.

264
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:14,215
Quieres ser amigo de el cartel?

265
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:16,284
I'm sorry. I-I don't, uh...

266
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:24,399
You wanna be a friend of the cartel?

267
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:26,669
Hmm?

268
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:28,629
Time to get yourself a new motto.

269
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:35,111
Just. Make. Money.

270
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:45,441
"'But what does that mean, "ephemeral"?'

271
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:46,843
repeated the little prince,

272
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,364
who never in his life
let go of a question

273
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,559
once he had asked it.

274
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:52,361
'It means,

275
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:56,999
"Which is in danger of
speedy disappearance".'

276
00:15:57,001 --> 00:16:01,061
'Is my flower in danger
of speedy disappearance?'

277
00:16:01,063 --> 00:16:04,089
'It certainly is.'"

278
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:07,209
Hmm.

279
00:16:07,211 --> 00:16:10,438
Okay, kid, we'll finish the rest later.

280
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,406
Now, good night.

281
00:16:12,408 --> 00:16:14,516
Not yet, Pop-pop.

282
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:17,461
Just two more pages.

283
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:20,448
Two more pages, and that's it, alright?

284
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,350
Now lie down.

285
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:28,397
"'My flower is ephemeral',

286
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,167
the little prince said to himself,

287
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:33,402
'and she only has four thorns

288
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:36,146
to defend herself against the world".

289
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:46,499
She's out.

290
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:48,583
Think "The Little Prince" did the trick.

291
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,204
I think you wore her out
with all that hide-and-seek.

292
00:16:52,206 --> 00:16:53,514
I don't know.

293
00:16:53,516 --> 00:16:55,674
I think maybe she wore me out.

294
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,763
This girl at work...

295
00:17:00,765 --> 00:17:03,649
she can't get her son to sleep.

296
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:05,217
The kid's 2 years old,

297
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:07,811
and he's still tearing
around the house at midnight.

298
00:17:07,813 --> 00:17:10,088
Hmm.

299
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,833
Matty was like that.

300
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:14,243
Really?

301
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:15,667
Yeah, really.

302
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:18,455
Never wanted to conk out.

303
00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:19,840
Too busy.

304
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:27,515
He was such a cutie.

305
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:30,951
I love those pictures of
him sitting on Santa's lap.

306
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:34,012
- Ahh, that face.
- Mm.

307
00:17:34,014 --> 00:17:37,458
Cried his eyes out. Every year.

308
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,397
And every year, he'd
want to try it again.

309
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:48,227
I'm better now.

310
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:53,023
What changed?

311
00:17:55,786 --> 00:17:58,612
Decided to play the cards I was dealt.

312
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:09,553
Just said he'll see us

313
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,883
at the regular Thursday meeting.

314
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:13,535
You spoke truth to power.

315
00:18:13,537 --> 00:18:14,895
We'll see if he sticks to it.

316
00:18:14,897 --> 00:18:16,788
How'd your day go?

317
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:22,428
I got married.

318
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:30,227
Here.

319
00:18:52,568 --> 00:18:54,751
Mmm.

320
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:04,094
What?

321
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:07,747
I'm having the urge not
to tell you something.

322
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:09,040
It's nothing.

323
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:10,801
I'll... I'll tell you later, okay?

324
00:19:10,803 --> 00:19:12,544
Mm.

325
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:15,447
Jimmy, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

326
00:19:15,449 --> 00:19:16,790
What?

327
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:21,203
I have a... a new client.

328
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:23,480
He's, um, connected.

329
00:19:23,482 --> 00:19:25,341
I mean, he's a cartel guy.

330
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:27,618
From Mexico.

331
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,091
Pretty high up.

332
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:31,851
Anyway, he's in for murder,

333
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:33,715
and he wants bail, which...

334
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:34,975
That's impossible.

335
00:19:34,977 --> 00:19:38,111
I mean... no way in hell

336
00:19:38,113 --> 00:19:39,652
this dude is ever seeing sunshine.

337
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:44,709
But if I could, you know,
somehow find a way...

338
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:51,732
um... he said, uh, I'd
be a friend of the cartel.

339
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:55,059
"Friend of the cartel"?

340
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:01,593
You know what that means.

341
00:20:01,595 --> 00:20:03,153
Means money.

342
00:20:04,748 --> 00:20:06,899
Ranch in Montana kind of money,

343
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:08,859
like, uh, private jet kind of money

344
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:11,144
press conferences,

345
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:13,122
TV news, the works.

346
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,259
But...

347
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:20,850
do you want to be a
friend of the cartel?

348
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,694
No. No.

349
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:29,646
Absolutely not. I...

350
00:20:29,648 --> 00:20:31,331
Anyway, it's a moot point

351
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,609
'cause the guy's the definition
of a flight risk, so...

352
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:38,521
Look, I'm gonna put up a
fight, right, just for show.

353
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:44,636
There's no judge on earth
that's gonna grant him bail.

354
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:47,815
I just... I didn't want to tell you,

355
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:52,143
so I thought I should tell you.

356
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,196
You know what?

357
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:04,632
What?

358
00:21:12,224 --> 00:21:15,017
I'm glad you did.

359
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:16,769
Oh.

360
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:54,056
Alright, back in your cell!

361
00:22:00,806 --> 00:22:02,213
Hey.

362
00:22:02,215 --> 00:22:04,474
No, no. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

363
00:22:04,476 --> 00:22:07,811
So, what's happening with sixth street?

364
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:09,554
Mm-hmm.

365
00:22:09,556 --> 00:22:12,949
And the take?

366
00:22:12,951 --> 00:22:14,501
Okay.

367
00:22:14,503 --> 00:22:16,118
So, what're you gonna do about it?

368
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,656
You gonna send in Ocho Loco?

369
00:22:19,658 --> 00:22:23,368
Oh. Even better. Nice.

370
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,979
Listen.

371
00:22:25,981 --> 00:22:28,841
I got something for you to do.

372
00:22:46,377 --> 00:22:48,902
I'm not telling you shit
until we talk about my dad.

373
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:54,011
What you tell me and when you say it

374
00:22:54,013 --> 00:22:55,233
is not up to you.

375
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:56,838
Listen, you said when
Lalo's out of the picture,

376
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,361
we'll talk about my father, right?

377
00:22:58,363 --> 00:23:00,989
Well, he's out of the picture.

378
00:23:03,085 --> 00:23:04,400
Say your piece.

379
00:23:04,402 --> 00:23:07,537
I'm done.

380
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:09,072
I want out.

381
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:11,691
And you want me to square it with Fring.

382
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:13,919
Fring's not all of it. It's the cartel.

383
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:15,178
I disappear,

384
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,430
they're gonna go after my father.

385
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:18,156
He's gotta come with me.

386
00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:19,449
But no matter what I say,

387
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:21,218
with him it's the cops or nothing.

388
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,521
The cops won't solve this.

389
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,435
You got a way?

390
00:23:32,356 --> 00:23:35,515
Hmm.

391
00:23:35,517 --> 00:23:38,869
What are you holding out?

392
00:23:44,952 --> 00:23:47,077
Lalo called me from inside.

393
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:50,923
He put me back in charge.

394
00:23:50,925 --> 00:23:54,418
And... ?

395
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:58,496
And...

396
00:23:58,498 --> 00:24:01,892
he wants me to burn
down a Pollos Hermanos.

397
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:08,357
Then he's not out of the picture, is he?

398
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,030
The "avocado mania" promotion,

399
00:24:34,032 --> 00:24:36,183
which we've been testing
in select franchises,

400
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,850
has been a smashing
success, contributing

401
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,090
to an 18% increase in foot traffic

402
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:42,707
at participating locations

403
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:45,877
and a 12% bump in customer satisfaction.

404
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:47,826
We know a good thing when we see it,

405
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:52,383
so we are planning to fully
roll out "avocado mania" in Q2.

406
00:24:52,385 --> 00:24:56,229
Additionally, our innovative
"family-fun" remodel

407
00:24:56,231 --> 00:24:58,799
improved the in-store
Whiskerstay's experience,

408
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:03,078
resulting in increased
repeat business system-wide.

409
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,488
In fact, we are happy to share the news

410
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,583
that the latest ACSI survey

411
00:25:07,585 --> 00:25:11,119
now places Whiskerstay's in the top 10%

412
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:14,022
of limited-service chains nationwide.

413
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,527
Very nice, Cleo, very nice.

414
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:19,869
Thank you.

415
00:25:19,871 --> 00:25:23,265
And now let's hear from Gustavo Fring

416
00:25:23,267 --> 00:25:25,333
of Los Pollos Hermanos.

417
00:25:25,335 --> 00:25:28,103
- Thank you, Herr Schuler.
- Bitte.

418
00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:29,930
I am delighted to report

419
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:32,229
that the last quarter Los
Pollos Hermanos revenues

420
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,759
have increased 8.3%.

421
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:39,006
Comparable restaurant
sales increased by 4.2%,

422
00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:42,117
representing the eighth
consecutive quarter

423
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:45,178
of comparable sales increases.

424
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,457
In addition to our continued focus

425
00:25:49,459 --> 00:25:51,293
on our core menu,

426
00:25:51,295 --> 00:25:56,523
we are very proud to
introduce a new offering

427
00:25:56,525 --> 00:25:58,950
that will extend our product line

428
00:25:58,952 --> 00:26:02,471
while celebrating our
traditional New Mexican culture.

429
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:08,135
I invite you to taste our
delicious "Spice Curls".

430
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:13,206
"The curly fry with
the Southwestern kick".

431
00:26:24,202 --> 00:26:25,827
Here we are.

432
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:31,457
The bathroom has heated floors.

433
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:34,586
You'll find the dial just
under the light switch.

434
00:26:34,588 --> 00:26:38,373
There's a steam shower...

435
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:41,751
and bidet.

436
00:26:41,753 --> 00:26:45,180
This controls the drapes.

437
00:26:45,182 --> 00:26:47,632
Many of our guests
have enjoyed the rodeo.

438
00:26:47,634 --> 00:26:49,367
It's in town tomorrow
at Reliant Stadium.

439
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:51,019
I highly recommend it.

440
00:26:51,021 --> 00:26:52,336
Oh, thank you.

441
00:26:52,338 --> 00:26:54,014
I'm only staying the night.

442
00:26:54,016 --> 00:26:56,182
Next time, then.

443
00:26:56,184 --> 00:26:57,793
Is there anything else, sir?

444
00:26:57,795 --> 00:27:00,887
No. No, no, that will be all.

445
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:02,698
Thank you very much.

446
00:27:07,337 --> 00:27:09,496
- Thank you, Mr. Fring.
- My pleasure.

447
00:27:20,242 --> 00:27:24,242
_

448
00:28:38,703 --> 00:28:40,336
Peter.

449
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:42,380
- Look who's here.
- Who?

450
00:28:42,382 --> 00:28:44,858
- Hello, my friend.
- Oh.

451
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,967
Gustavo.

452
00:28:51,216 --> 00:28:54,309
It's good to see you, my friend.

453
00:28:54,311 --> 00:28:55,802
Oh, you look well.

454
00:28:55,804 --> 00:29:02,559
Well, I don't feel well.

455
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:05,770
Maybe things will improve
now that you're here.

456
00:29:05,772 --> 00:29:07,989
Lydia tells me Salamanca is in jail.

457
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:10,200
This means you can
continue construction?

458
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:16,743
E-Eduardo Salamanca has
been arrested for murder.

459
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:19,167
- Uh-huh.
- However, even from jail

460
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:24,231
he creates... issues.

461
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:27,509
What kind of issues?

462
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:28,844
He ordered his men

463
00:29:28,846 --> 00:29:30,679
to burn down one of my restaurants.

464
00:29:31,923 --> 00:29:33,556
You're kidding.

465
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:35,967
He's in jail. He can still do that?

466
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:38,486
I'm afraid so.

467
00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:41,331
I know it's not exactly
my area of expertise,

468
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:44,608
but don't people get killed
in prison all the time?

469
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:48,077
I mean, "shanked" and
"shivved" and whatnot?

470
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,229
Anything happens to Salamanca

471
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:51,332
on this side of the border,

472
00:29:51,334 --> 00:29:54,819
the cartel will assume
that it was my doing.

473
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:57,188
It would mean war.

474
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:02,269
War for which we are unprepared.

475
00:30:02,271 --> 00:30:03,861
My God.

476
00:30:03,863 --> 00:30:05,986
This nightmare never ends.

477
00:30:05,988 --> 00:30:09,221
- He's concerned about the money.
- "Concerned"?!

478
00:30:09,223 --> 00:30:12,779
- 4,800,000 Euros.
- Mm.

479
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:14,997
It's a miracle I haven't been caught.

480
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:18,101
Last year the auditors came this close.

481
00:30:18,103 --> 00:30:21,754
One of them, a woman...
I think she knew.

482
00:30:21,756 --> 00:30:23,531
- Peter...
- At first it was a year.

483
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:26,017
Then it was two. Then three.

484
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:27,518
And now you're telling me...

485
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,803
How long?

486
00:30:28,805 --> 00:30:31,414
I can't. I can't.

487
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:33,816
They will catch me, and then it is over.

488
00:30:33,818 --> 00:30:34,951
- Peter..
- I can't.

489
00:30:34,953 --> 00:30:36,861
- Peter...
- Gustavo, please.

490
00:30:36,863 --> 00:30:38,530
- I can't.
- Listen to me.

491
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:40,874
- I...
- Listen to me.

492
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,404
Do you remember Santiago?

493
00:30:46,406 --> 00:30:49,594
The two of us.

494
00:30:49,596 --> 00:30:51,902
Our backs to the wall.

495
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:55,788
I will never forget what you did.

496
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,139
Oh, well...

497
00:30:57,141 --> 00:31:01,585
You are still the same man.

498
00:31:01,587 --> 00:31:07,234
You will do what is necessary.

499
00:31:11,273 --> 00:31:14,049
Stay strong, my friend.

500
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:17,735
We've come so far.

501
00:31:17,737 --> 00:31:20,080
We are so very close.

502
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,463
Okay.

503
00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:31,933
Good.

504
00:31:31,935 --> 00:31:34,803
Now... you eat.

505
00:31:44,573 --> 00:31:47,173
Tomorrow you and
I are going to the rodeo.

506
00:31:47,175 --> 00:31:48,433
The rodeo?

507
00:31:48,435 --> 00:31:51,052
Yeah. To see the cowboys.

508
00:31:51,054 --> 00:31:53,304
I've never been to the rodeo.

509
00:31:53,306 --> 00:31:56,416
Well, you're going to love it.

510
00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:58,493
Gustavo.

511
00:31:59,388 --> 00:32:00,996
♪ You said that you would love me ♪

512
00:32:00,998 --> 00:32:02,746
- Prosit.
- Prosit.

513
00:32:02,748 --> 00:32:04,741
Prost.

514
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:10,029
Uh, "Your guests will relax
in the elegant great room,

515
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:13,215
complete with soaring stone fireplace".

516
00:32:13,217 --> 00:32:14,676
Soaring stone?

517
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:16,736
Yeah. That's the best kind of stone.

518
00:32:18,664 --> 00:32:20,949
How about a lavender farm?

519
00:32:20,951 --> 00:32:22,575
Seriously?

520
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:25,186
Yeah, well, it's, uh...
it's lavender-adjacent.

521
00:32:25,188 --> 00:32:26,804
Tell me more.

522
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:28,690
"Imagine a magical land called 'home'.

523
00:32:28,692 --> 00:32:32,201
Watch the sun set across
your own private meadow,

524
00:32:32,203 --> 00:32:35,221
as wild flowers sway in the breeze.

525
00:32:35,223 --> 00:32:36,923
This stunning desert retreat

526
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:39,984
promotes a casual yet
luxurious lifestyle".

527
00:32:39,986 --> 00:32:41,852
I'm casual yet luxurious.

528
00:32:41,854 --> 00:32:44,005
Yeah. Totally.

529
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:46,282
It's got a five-car garage.

530
00:32:46,284 --> 00:32:48,209
What? How's that gonna work?

531
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:50,787
- We only get 2 and a half cars each?
- Yeah.

532
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:52,696
Garbage.

533
00:32:52,698 --> 00:32:58,169
So, that was wildflowers
dancing in the sun?

534
00:32:58,171 --> 00:32:59,703
They're swaying in the breeze.

535
00:32:59,705 --> 00:33:01,489
Oh. Okay.

536
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:02,706
Well, either way.

537
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:04,083
They're having a very nice time.

538
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:30,293
Saul Goodman, speedy justice for you!

539
00:33:30,295 --> 00:33:32,645
I need a word.

540
00:33:32,647 --> 00:33:35,356
Oh. A word? Yeah, uh...

541
00:33:35,358 --> 00:33:37,750
Yeah, I have a word
for you. Uh, "tunnel"...

542
00:33:37,752 --> 00:33:40,820
... which is where I am right now.

543
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:42,197
Sorry! I can't hear you!

544
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:43,431
Maybe try again later?

545
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:46,350
Coming!

546
00:33:47,996 --> 00:33:49,312
Whatever it is,

547
00:33:49,314 --> 00:33:51,589
it's not for me, and
it shouldn't be for you.

548
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,409
Hey, forget your key...

549
00:33:55,411 --> 00:33:57,070
Oh.

550
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:01,666
Okay. Yeah. Come right in.

551
00:34:01,668 --> 00:34:04,735
Make yourself at home.

552
00:34:04,737 --> 00:34:08,289
You got me in my underwear,
so enjoy the show.

553
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:13,873
You're representing Eduardo Salamanca,

554
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:17,081
AKA Jorge De Guzman.

555
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:20,360
He is a client of mine, yeah. So?

556
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:24,864
Well, I need you to get him out on bail.

557
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:28,584
Wait. What do you have
to do with Lalo Salamanca?

558
00:34:28,586 --> 00:34:31,929
I represent someone who has an interest.

559
00:34:31,931 --> 00:34:33,631
Someone like who?

560
00:34:33,633 --> 00:34:36,951
Someone your client
can never know about.

561
00:34:36,953 --> 00:34:38,878
Yeah, look, I don't take marching orders

562
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,472
- from the man behind the curtain.
- Mm?

563
00:34:41,474 --> 00:34:43,783
In this case, it's better that you do.

564
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,124
You know what Salamanca did, right?

565
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:54,210
I am aware.

566
00:34:57,732 --> 00:34:59,399
What's this?

567
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:05,138
This is everything you
need to do your job.

568
00:35:13,129 --> 00:35:16,631
_

569
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:13,674
Go.

570
00:38:30,453 --> 00:38:33,388
"Significant ties to
his local community"?

571
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,813
What ties?

572
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:37,027
Did you actually think
I wasn't gonna hear

573
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:39,026
about this "private eye" of yours?

574
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:40,043
Excuse me?

575
00:38:40,045 --> 00:38:42,263
Dave Clark.

576
00:38:42,265 --> 00:38:43,732
Dave Clark.

577
00:38:43,734 --> 00:38:47,476
The mysterious "third party"
who's coaching your key witness.

578
00:38:49,072 --> 00:38:50,254
Alright, good.

579
00:38:50,256 --> 00:38:51,312
You know what?

580
00:38:51,314 --> 00:38:53,966
Do the dumb act for Parson. Please.

581
00:38:53,968 --> 00:38:57,637
I can't wait to see him
rip you both a new one.

582
00:39:00,975 --> 00:39:03,826
Any idea what that
asshole is going on about?

583
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:09,507
I'll call the librarian.

584
00:39:23,172 --> 00:39:24,680
Hey.

585
00:39:24,682 --> 00:39:27,275
Uh, play to the judge, okay?

586
00:39:27,277 --> 00:39:29,757
But don't... don't,
like, play to the judge.

587
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:31,987
Don't over do it.

588
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:33,564
Try not to be too cool.

589
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:35,808
I mean, look humble.

590
00:39:36,861 --> 00:39:40,145
A little bit scared.

591
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:41,622
No problem.

592
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:47,420
- Is that them?
- Yep.

593
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:52,675
Who's that?

594
00:39:56,622 --> 00:39:59,307
That's gotta be his family.

595
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:02,351
Fred Whalen.

596
00:40:04,104 --> 00:40:06,422
The guy who died?

597
00:40:06,424 --> 00:40:08,649
- At the Travel Wire?
- Mm.

598
00:40:26,469 --> 00:40:29,562
And I'm told you have new information...

599
00:40:29,564 --> 00:40:33,399
An allegation of witness tampering?

600
00:40:36,161 --> 00:40:37,970
Mr. Goodman?

601
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:41,296
Mr. Goodman?

602
00:40:44,227 --> 00:40:45,917
That's right, Your Honor.

603
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:48,397
Witness tampering.

604
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:49,723
I have reason to believe

605
00:40:49,725 --> 00:40:51,734
that the prosecution's key witness

606
00:40:51,736 --> 00:40:54,441
was coached by a private investigator

607
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:58,440
who was hired to pervert justice.

608
00:40:58,442 --> 00:41:01,476
Does the prosecution have a response?

609
00:41:01,478 --> 00:41:04,205
Unfortunately, Your Honor,

610
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:06,657
it seems a person unknown to my team

611
00:41:06,659 --> 00:41:08,826
may have interacted with our witness,

612
00:41:08,828 --> 00:41:10,937
causing her to call Detective Roberts

613
00:41:10,939 --> 00:41:12,381
and amend her statement

614
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:14,623
two months after the initial interview.

615
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:16,620
This only recently
came to our attention,

616
00:41:16,622 --> 00:41:20,296
and we are vigorously investigating.

617
00:41:20,298 --> 00:41:22,331
I would hope so.

618
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,075
Having said that, Your Honor,

619
00:41:24,077 --> 00:41:27,469
this witness is one small
element of the state's case.

620
00:41:27,471 --> 00:41:31,214
In light of the extraordinary
violence of the crime

621
00:41:31,216 --> 00:41:34,081
and the fact that Mr. De
Guzman is a foreign national

622
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:35,628
with no ties to the community,

623
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,220
we ask that the court

624
00:41:37,222 --> 00:41:39,131
recognize him as a flight risk

625
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:41,968
and as a danger to the
citizens of New Mexico.

626
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:46,163
Mr. Goodman?

627
00:41:46,165 --> 00:41:48,951
Uh, all due respect, Your Honor,

628
00:41:48,953 --> 00:41:52,733
but the witness is not
just one "small element"

629
00:41:52,735 --> 00:41:53,895
of the state's case.

630
00:41:53,897 --> 00:41:55,414
She's the only witness

631
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:58,256
tying Mr. De Guzman to the murder scene,

632
00:41:58,258 --> 00:42:00,319
and she's been manipulated.

633
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:03,278
Furthermore, the claim
that Mr. De Guzman

634
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,934
has no ties to the community...
that's just patently false.

635
00:42:06,936 --> 00:42:11,221
Mr. De Guzman has deep ties
to the city of Albuquerque.

636
00:42:11,223 --> 00:42:13,757
I'd like you to meet... his family.

637
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:15,835
Uh, that's his fiancée

638
00:42:15,837 --> 00:42:18,787
and the love of his life, Beth McKinnon,

639
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:21,690
his stepchildren, Christopher and Ella,

640
00:42:21,692 --> 00:42:25,786
and sitting with them
is Beth's mother, Mary.

641
00:42:25,788 --> 00:42:28,372
Now, Your Honor,

642
00:42:28,374 --> 00:42:30,599
my client is the only father

643
00:42:30,601 --> 00:42:32,018
that these kids have ever known.

644
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,352
They depend on him.

645
00:42:33,354 --> 00:42:35,170
How can you possibly see fit

646
00:42:35,172 --> 00:42:38,939
to separate this beautiful... family?

647
00:42:40,411 --> 00:42:43,054
Um... I'm sorry.

648
00:42:44,482 --> 00:42:45,998
The testimony, um,

649
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,960
implicating Mr. De
Guzman in this crime...

650
00:42:49,962 --> 00:42:51,887
it's been fabricated.

651
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:54,206
You've already held him for three days.

652
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:56,508
Given the circumstances,

653
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,320
Mr. De Guzman should be granted bond.

654
00:42:59,322 --> 00:43:01,489
Your Honor, a sidebar?

655
00:43:10,408 --> 00:43:13,575
Didn't the state do any
investigating at all?

656
00:43:13,577 --> 00:43:15,394
We did, Your Honor.

657
00:43:15,396 --> 00:43:17,897
Your honor, given
what's transpired here...

658
00:43:19,842 --> 00:43:21,233
Alright, that's enough.

659
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:22,401
Your Honor, I really...

660
00:43:29,427 --> 00:43:34,361
I accept the defense's
argument that bond is warranted.

661
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:39,038
But considering the
severity of the charges,

662
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,754
I will set the amount at $7 million.

663
00:43:41,756 --> 00:43:43,138
Cash only.

664
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,523
Oh, Your Honor...

665
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:46,909
All rise.

666
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,873
$7 million?

667
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,825
Yes, and I am so, so sorry.

668
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:57,703
I can do that.

669
00:43:57,705 --> 00:43:59,863
Thing is,

670
00:43:59,865 --> 00:44:02,441
- I'm gonna need you to pick it up.
- What? Me?

671
00:44:02,443 --> 00:44:03,575
Mm-hmm.

672
00:44:03,577 --> 00:44:05,778
- I'll call you.
- Well...

673
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:18,124
- You're good to go.
- Thank you.

674
00:44:23,388 --> 00:44:24,864
Go ahead.

675
00:44:28,845 --> 00:44:30,060
Hey, Jimmy.

676
00:44:30,062 --> 00:44:33,563
Howard.

677
00:44:33,565 --> 00:44:38,610
So... have you thought
any more about the job?

678
00:44:38,612 --> 00:44:40,520
The job.

679
00:44:40,522 --> 00:44:41,997
Yeah.

680
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:44,241
No, um...

681
00:44:44,243 --> 00:44:48,670
I'm still giving it some thought.

682
00:44:48,672 --> 00:44:50,672
Yeah, no problem.

683
00:44:50,674 --> 00:44:51,974
"Giving it some thought"?

684
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:55,484
Yeah.

685
00:44:58,166 --> 00:44:59,440
You know what?

686
00:44:59,442 --> 00:45:01,591
Don't bother.

687
00:45:01,593 --> 00:45:02,926
It seems I've upset you.

688
00:45:02,928 --> 00:45:05,504
So offer's off the table.

689
00:45:05,506 --> 00:45:07,297
You upset me?

690
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:08,524
How... How'd you upset me?

691
00:45:08,526 --> 00:45:11,218
You tell me.

692
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:18,626
This is getting a little weird, Howard.

693
00:45:18,628 --> 00:45:22,988
You want to know what's "weird"?

694
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,823
It's "weird" to offer a job to a man

695
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:26,834
and in return have bowling
balls thrown at your car

696
00:45:26,836 --> 00:45:30,712
and prostitutes sent
to your business lunch.

697
00:45:30,714 --> 00:45:33,290
That's "weird".

698
00:45:34,477 --> 00:45:36,184
Are you listening to yourself?

699
00:45:37,403 --> 00:45:39,371
I don't know what you're
into these days, Howard,

700
00:45:39,373 --> 00:45:43,800
but prostitutes and, uh, bowling balls?

701
00:45:43,802 --> 00:45:48,397
Uh... you sound unhinged.

702
00:45:50,618 --> 00:45:53,277
Jimmy, I'm sorry you're in pain.

703
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:57,448
You're sorry?

704
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,708
You're sorry?

705
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:02,795
You kill my brother,
and you say you're sorry.

706
00:46:02,797 --> 00:46:04,613
Let me tell you something.

707
00:46:04,615 --> 00:46:07,457
The job offer... it didn't upset me.

708
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:09,401
It amused me.

709
00:46:09,403 --> 00:46:13,589
Whew. Big job at the illustrious HHM.

710
00:46:13,591 --> 00:46:16,563
Chance to play at the
palace? Lil' ole me?

711
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,335
- I was trying...
- You have no idea what's going on.

712
00:46:19,337 --> 00:46:21,196
You're a teensy tiny man

713
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:23,217
in a teensy-weensy little bubble!

714
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:24,391
Oh, Jimmy.

715
00:46:24,393 --> 00:46:26,660
Ohh, don't you fuckin' "Oh, Jimmy" me.

716
00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:28,704
You look down on me?! You pity me?!

717
00:46:28,706 --> 00:46:30,263
Walk away. That's right, Howard.

718
00:46:30,265 --> 00:46:31,840
You know why I didn't take the job?

719
00:46:31,842 --> 00:46:33,775
'Cause it's too small!

720
00:46:33,777 --> 00:46:35,777
I don't care about it!

721
00:46:35,779 --> 00:46:37,554
It's nothing to me!

722
00:46:37,556 --> 00:46:38,998
It's a bacterium!

723
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,017
I travel in worlds
you can't even imagine!

724
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:44,494
You can't conceive of
what I'm capable of!

725
00:46:44,496 --> 00:46:46,772
I'm so far beyond you!

726
00:46:46,774 --> 00:46:49,041
I'm like a God in human clothing!

727
00:46:49,043 --> 00:46:53,370
Lightning bolts shoot
from my fingertips!

728
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:22,006

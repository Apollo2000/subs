2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,674
You made it.
Welcome to Kanit House.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,834
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,474
I want to find out what
happened to them.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,680
The same thing that happened
to all of them.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,154
All?
It's more than two Dutch.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,874
This is important information.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,554
And we must take it, take them
to the police station today.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,994
Oh, no, no, no, we don't.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,354
It is not for you to give me
my orders, Mr Knippenberg.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,154
I don't know what to do.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,760
Write a report, Herman.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,874
Lena, just buy the gems.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,200
Help me! When they left before
Christmas, Monique looked scared.

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,234
Where is he now?

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,354
We don't know.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,360
Gautier must have flown as Willem,
and the girl as Lena.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,074
Hey. You're going to a party?

19
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,594
Yeah. A silly embassy thing.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,874
Where's Nadine?

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,480
She went to check her mailbox.

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,840
She should have been home
an hour ago.

23
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,514
Sorry, excuse me.

24
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,234
Excuse me, I'm looking for my wife,
Nadine Gires.

25
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,360
Have you seen her?

26
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,000
He saw her leave.

27
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,560
Remi, I think it was them.

28
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,800
OK, we go now. Kanit House.

29
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,274
Listen.
I don't think we can take you.

30
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,154
Why? Because of your fucking body?

31
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,314
No, not because of the body,

32
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,954
because if we go rushing in there,
they will know that she knows,

33
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,994
and that not only that she knows,
but she has told other people.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,834
It's not safe for Nadine, Remi.

35
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,120
You get home, you find her, call us
at the embassy.

36
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,480
She'd better be OK.

37
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,360
Nadine? Nadine?

38
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,640
Nadine...

39
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,160
Nadine?

40
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,960
I told him I would call him,
but I completely forgot.

41
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,320
Hey, Ajay.
How are you guys?

42
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,200
Never better.

43
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,394
Oh, la, la. Err...

44
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,554
We can't stay.

45
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,674
We're very, very late.
Yes.

46
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,954
So, have a beautiful evening,
and see you tomorrow.

47
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,200
Before you go,
I have something for you.

48
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,714
We picked up a story at the Bangkok
Post about one

49
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,914
of your people, Ambassador.

50
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,794
One of mine? No.

51
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,874
Using his diplomatic credentials to
enquire after some Dutch

52
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,034
murder victims.

53
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,874
Quite adamantly, so the story goes.

54
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,754
Every embassy in town.

55
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,834
Hello, yes.

56
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,914
Jesus Christ.

57
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,794
You tell us to call you and then you
can't even answer the fucking phone?

58
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,674
Yes, I know Remi, Listen, I'm sorry.
You're OK? Yes?

59
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,634
Well, she ate dinner with them,
and she's not dead yet so...

60
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,914
But they are just two Westerners,
why not cover

61
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,434
the hundreds of Vietnamese refugees
that are preyed on by pirates?

62
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,800
Perhaps it's the scarcity that makes
it a good story, Mrs van Dongen.

63
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,080
You have to get out now!

64
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,994
What are they saying?

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,880
That you're a mad fucking Dutchman.
Right.

66
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,754
Herman?

67
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,034
Yes. Nadine?

68
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,074
What do you need?

69
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,274
What do you mean?

70
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,434
As evidence.

71
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,474
No, no.

72
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,074
I don't know where they have
been for the last three months, but

73
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,074
Monique is like a different woman.

74
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,234
They have so much more money.

75
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,834
And, listen,
they have new belongings everywhere,

76
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,554
which must belong to the victims.
I can bring it to you as evidence.

77
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,194
You mustn't take anything, Nadine.

78
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,954
Yes, Nadine, Angela is right.

79
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,074
Everything must seem normal.

80
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,394
Remi must go to work.

81
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,834
Everything. OK?

82
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,474
But if there is anything you can
find out, where they went, who...

83
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,794
Actually, Nadine,
do either of you own a camera?

84
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,160
Herman, you can't just...

85
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,994
Nadine,
if you think it's too dangerous...

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,514
Of course, it's fucking too
dangerous!

87
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,034
Yes, we have a camera,
I can take it.

88
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,874
OK. So, Nadine, take the camera
and you get photographs of him,

89
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,274
Gautier, and the rest of them, OK?

90
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,194
You get photographs of him and the
belongings that you mentioned.

91
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,554
Before the end of the day tomorrow,
no later.

92
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,314
If you are not back by nightfall,
we will come and get you ourselves.

93
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,754
You understand?

94
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,554
Yes.

95
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,794
Goodnight, Angela.

96
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,080
Goodnight, Herman.

97
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,634
I think we are doing
the right thing.

98
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,200
With evidence like that
I can go back to the police.

99
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,434
Royal Nepal Airlines Flight
51 to Kathmandu is now ready to

100
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,514
board at Gate 25.

101
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,640
Ajay?

102
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,120
Have a nice flight, Miss Dekker.

103
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,880
Come on, Lena.

104
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,114
Australian.

105
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,160
They think they're bloody
Australian.

106
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,400
Thank you, Mr Bloem.

107
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,600
Welcome, Miss Dekker.

108
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,194
This place is not for you.

109
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,000
Find somewhere cheaper
and meet us in the morning.

110
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,840
So, what do you
do in Bangkok, Miss Dekker?

111
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,954
Gemstones.

112
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,360
And you're in Kathmandu?

113
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,274
There is barely even a garnet to be
mined here in Nepal.

114
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,320
We're on vacation.

115
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,600
Not on business.

116
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,880
All in.

117
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,440
Fold.

118
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,440
Call.

119
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,154
King.

120
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,314
Oooh.

121
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,040
A good thing you are not
here on business.

122
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,754
It's vulgar to put so much value on
money.

123
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,314
You shouldn't worry so much.

124
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,594
Should she, Ajay?

125
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,154
Yes, Monique.
You really shouldn't worry so much.

126
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,200
Mr Bloem.

127
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,474
I wondering if perhaps you could
settle your account

128
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,880
for the suite,
and however long you hope to stay.

129
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,874
Certainly.

130
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,040
I'll have it arranged.

131
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,680
Money comes, money goes.

132
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,320
But as you see, in this life,
you just need to know where to look.

133
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,440
Stop the car.

134
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,960
Stop the car!

135
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,514
Didn't you hear me?

136
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,560
Stop.

137
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,320
Marie.

138
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,554
What is it you think I ask of you?

139
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,394
Don't!
You lose all our money after...

140
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,914
after everything you made me do!

141
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,400
And now I'm here pretending to be
that sweet Dutch girl.

142
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,320
You think I don't understand
what you did to her?

143
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,320
You and your fucking dog.

144
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,600
You're disgusting!

145
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,440
Stop this, Alain.

146
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,074
Do you want me to deal with her?

147
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,200
No. Take this.
I'll find you later.

148
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,760
I will not be your accomplice
any more.

149
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,640
Wow.

150
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,954
Ajay, will you take one of us?

151
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,200
Yeah, sure.

152
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,160
Thank you.

153
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,594
You look so beautiful.

154
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,040
What happened when you were gone?

155
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,000
He made me feel like a goddess.

156
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,640
And so you are, Monique...

157
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,554
All the English language newspapers.

158
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,354
From September through to January.

159
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,720
Thank you, Lawana.

160
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,874
Now, you.

161
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,634
No, I don't think so, Nadine.

162
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,674
I promise I will do a good one.

163
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,000
I said no, Nadine.

164
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,240
Shall I say it in French
so you understand?

165
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,960
If he doesn't want his picture
taken, you shouldn't force him.

166
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,520
She thinks you are shy.

167
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,400
But I don't either.

168
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,480
Besides, why the sudden interest?

169
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,000
Because we are friends.

170
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,840
Right, Monique?

171
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,594
Mr Knippenberg. Lawana, one moment
please... But, Mr Knippenberg...

172
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,080
Lawana, not now.

173
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,314
Knippenberg?

174
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,520
Mr Ambassador.

175
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,274
Miss Lawana - why were you bringing
Mr Knippenberg all these newspapers?

176
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,240
Oh, it's for the Narcotics
Committee.

177
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,554
Deaths attributed to, erm,
smuggler conflict.

178
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,994
Triads and so forth.

179
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,634
Do you think your lies
convince anyone?

180
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,834
I know what you are doing,
and it is an insult to me

181
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,560
and to the country you represent.

182
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,554
I don't have the ability to
terminate his employment,

183
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,714
he knows that.

184
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,034
Ambassador, please.

185
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,034
I can recommend he is
recalled, however.

186
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,514
Back to the Hague.

187
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,994
That is an uncomfortable city,
Miss Lawana.

188
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,040
And cold like you can't imagine.

189
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,840
Would you agree, Knippenberg?

190
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,600
He agrees.

191
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,234
Have you heard anything?

192
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,040
No, have you?

193
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,120
Ajay? Alain wants some more
whiskey for his guests.

194
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,154
Let me help you with that.

195
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,554
I can help you.

196
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,794
Fuck, Nadine!

197
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,874
I'm so sorry.

198
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,874
That's all the ice we've got!

199
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,354
Ajay, there is
plenty in our apartment.

200
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,074
Help yourself, the door is open.

201
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,440
I can clean this.

202
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,714
Nadine?

203
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,800
Oui.

204
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,840
I just needed a light.

205
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,600
I'm sorry.

206
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,760
Herman, please.

207
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,520
We told them
to be here by nightfall.

208
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,440
What, what have I done?

209
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,954
I'm calling Siemons.

210
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,000
He has a gun.

211
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,160
Wait! What?

212
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,160
Thank God.

213
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,640
You bloody did it!

214
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,994
Well done.

215
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,160
Hey, you want a toke?

216
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,240
He doesn't, so I won't.

217
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,120
What can I say?
I'm a freak for clean.

218
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,880
Look at them, baby.

219
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,080

00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,280
Sure, my brother.

231
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,354
Thanks, man.

232
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,234
Mountains.

233
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,440
They're his trip.

234
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,560
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

235
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,000
Can I cash these traveller's
cheques? Thank you. Thanks.

236
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,000
Thanks.

237
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,360
You're wound kind of tight.

238
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,320
You should take some tea.

239
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,160
What's in there?

240
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,240
All the love you never had.

241
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,080
Every friend you've never made.

242
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,394
Hey, man.

243
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,394
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Take a breath.

244
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,034
I can't fucking see straight.

245
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,074
It's the first plunge.

246
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,120
It'll even out.

247
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,840
I've got you.

248
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,840
Who is that?

249
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,834
Who is that?

250
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,354
Lord Shiva.

251
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,400
The Destroyer.

252
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,034
And what are you?

253
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,634
His apostle.

254
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,880
His slave.

255
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,840
You're safe.

256
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,194
Don't leave me.

257
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,874
I won't.

258
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,960
Come with me.

259
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,000
Our skin - it has no colour.

260
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,480
I'm not a girl.

261
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,320
You're not a boy.

262
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,360
We are only love.

263
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,320
We are only love.

264
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,560
I have been looking for you
all night.

265
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,120
And so...?

266
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,640
She doesn't have anything.

267
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,440
Then why have you been with her
all night, Ajay?

268
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,400
I like her.

269
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,240
Are you a slave?

270
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,794
No.

271
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,600
To her you are a slave.

272
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,760
She may not say it...

273
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,280
not even consciously think it...

274
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,760
but you are.

275
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,034
Why do you think these white
children deny the comfort

276
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,560
and wealth of the life they were
given to come to a place like this?

277
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,320
Worship the same Gods.

278
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,560
Wear the same rags.

279
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,394
Please, don't hurt her...

280
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,680
Live in the same filth.

281
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,354
Each 'experience' is only then
taken home to wear like -

282
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,840
a piece of fake, tribal jewellery.

283
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,080
They travel only to acquire.

284
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,520
It's another form of imperialism...

285
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,320
and she has just colonised you.

286
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,200
I thought we were brothers.

287
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,800
We are.

288
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,800
No brother of mine is a slave.

289
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,154
Hey, hey.

290
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,954
What's wrong?

291
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,000
It's all right, you are loved.

292
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
Just go.

293
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,314
These are birth-control pills.

294
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,434
The writing's in Dutch.

295
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,920
Helena Dekker's, huh?

296
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,360
This is Monique.

297
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,234
And where is Gautier?

298
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,480
He is Gautier.

299
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,074
I drew a map of the apartment.

300
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,000
So, master bedroom.

301
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,234
Here is the spare bedroom with all
the belongings from the visitors.

302
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,960
And most important, the safe,
with all the money and passports.

303
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,034
This safe? Exactly. This one.

304
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,314
She's an excellent spy, my Nadine.

305
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,560
It's enough - for your policeman?

306
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,954
Because we're not going back.

307
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,794
I can go back.

308
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,874
If you need anything, I can go.

309
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,720
Nadine, thank you.

310
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,954
Let's talk a bit about the victims.

311
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,234
This man, the Turk.

312
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,114
These are the same
beads that he's wearing,

313
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,960
but you don't know his name?

314
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,394
I found these stories
in the regional newspapers.

315
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,634
Do you know anything
about these people?

316
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,434
Dominique showed us these.
She is American.

317
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,394
Alain took her to Patpong, I think.

318
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,634
And she's the one whose exit visa
Dominique used to get out.

319
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,354
Stephanie? Stephanie?

320
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,880
Stephanie. Yes.

321
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,400
This? Thank you.

322
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,434
Nadine, where did you get these?

323
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,920
I think at Gautier's.

324
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,880
They were in Nepal.

325
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,040
That's the Kumari Devi.
The Living Goddess.

326
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,600
Reincarnated as a little girl.

327
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,634
They select her, bring her here
to live, and worship her.

328
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,554
Check this - the first day she gets
the crimson, she's out of here.

329
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,640
She's not considered pure any more.

330
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,640
So they kick her out
and find another one.

331
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,840
Then what happens to her?

332
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,354
It gets peachier.

333
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,754
She can't ever find herself
an old man.

334
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,960
She's bad luck for dudes,
so the story goes.

335
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,474
You get with an ex-goddess,
look out!

336
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,400
Then the rest of her life...
she's alone?

337
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,994
I mean, it sure as hell beats

338
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,314
the hell out of living the rest
of your life in fucking Saratoga,

339
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,554
married to some piece of shit
who works in a bank

340
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,040
and picks his toes in front
of the game every night.

341
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,800
I mean, who do you know who gets
to say, "Once, I was a goddess"?

342
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,754
So, where are you headed next?

343
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,274
I'm not sure.

344
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,640
My husband is deciding.

345
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,634
You don't sound too happy
about that.

346
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,360
Does he smack you around?

347
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,760
No. He's...

348
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,160
He's very good to me.

349
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,714
Before Laurent, I only got
with dark men.

350
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,514
You dig? Men who made me
feel powerless.

351
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,954
And then three months ago,
the bus stops in Varanasi

352
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,074
and that fucking lumberjack
gets on and he looks at me,

353
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,514
and I knew, right then and there,

354
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,674
love ain't being powerless.

355
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,114
It's power.

356
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,034
So, if you want to split,
sister, then you split.

357
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,234
Pick a bus and get on it.

358
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,040
You can get on ours if you want.

359
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,954
Where are you going?

360
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:55,474
Does it matter?

361
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,474
I was actually thinking that
I ought to go home,

362
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,674
because I have, like, no money.

363
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,074
But Laurent has these stones.

364
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,280
He says he'll sell them
so we can stay together.

365
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,074
What do you mean, stones?

366
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,994
Rubies.

367
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,594
Two of them.

368
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,640
Like cough-candies.

369
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,280
Hey, what did you
say your name was, again?

370
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,440
Lena.

371
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,600
Mr Bloem?

372
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,514
I'm expecting a telex from
the Nepal Bank here.

373
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,354
Confirmation of a wire transfer
from my own bank in Zurich.

374
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,594
It's quite a lot of money.

375
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,634
You'll let me know
when you receive it?

376
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,440
The moment it arrives, sir.

377
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,994
Hi! I'm with Lena.

378
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,954
There you are, darling.

379
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,520
This is Willem.

380
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,960
Great to meet you, Willem.

381
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,394
Laurent was heading up
the mountain today.

382
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,074
But the weather closed early,
so we hit the temple instead.

383
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,440
Where we all met.

384
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,194
Hi. Did you show them yet? Not yet.

385
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,314
I said Connie-Jo
should have a shower.

386
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,114
I haven't had hot water on my
body since Istanbul.

387
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,320
I am glad.

388
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,600
Show me what?

389
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,200
Laurent has a pair of rubies,
darling.

390
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,440
I think he said we could get
a thousand for them.

391
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,160
I'll have a look at it.

392
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,994
Uh...

393
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,120
I cannot give you what
you want for them.

394
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,474
Those are not what you
think they are.

395
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,154
Then what are they?

396
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,434
Glass, mostly.
I'm sorry, someone has cheated you.

397
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,594
They what?!

398
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,714
These men are skilled
and their work is impressive.

399
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,920
There's no shame
in you trusting them.

400
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,234
I feel dreadful.

401
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,674
I'm so sorry, Connie.

402
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,114
I shouldn't have
raised your hopes like that.

403
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,720
It's OK.

404
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,920
But you must let us buy you dinner.

405
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,754
Yes.

406
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,554
And tomorrow,
when the skies have cleared,

407
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,160
if you like, we can drive you
up the mountain.

408
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,800
You've been so kind.

409
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,400
It's OK.

410
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,754
They're here.

411
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,840
Bye, Iris. See you.

412
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,040
Willem. Lena, hi.

413
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,234
Laurent.

414
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,834
Ajay, my secretary.
Hey, man! Didn't we meet before?

415
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,154
Yes, we did, with Iris.

416
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,914
She is one freaky kid,
I'll tell you that.

417
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,760
Sure! I remember.

418
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,600
Are you not coming, Lena?

419
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,274
She needs to rest.

420
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,034
We're expecting our first child
in July.

421
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,394
No way, guys! Congratulations.Wow.

422
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,295
Hey, that is going to be some kid!

423
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,120
Well, my brother?

424
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,880
See you later, Lena.

425
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,560
Bye!

426
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,080
Thank you.

427
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,914
Let's stop here for a moment
and have some tea.

428
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,520
Excellent.

429
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,834
Mr Bloem!

430
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,560
I must now insist you
settle your account immediately.

431
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,040
I assume you will take
payment in American dollars?

432
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,400
Ma'am? Sir?

433
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,840
Could we have a word?

434
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,920
You look terrible.
I've not slept.

435
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,074
Then eat.

436
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,714
Paul? Herman.

437
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,114
It's contingent.

438
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,240
Contingent? On what?
Me reading whatever that is.

439
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,274
Jesus Christ!

440
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,874
Wait till you shit it out later.

441
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,520
I've eaten. Now you can read.

442
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,234
Gautier. The accomplice, Ajay.

443
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,874
And, er...

444
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,200
Here, the wife or girlfriend,
Monique.

445
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,440
Various items belonging
to their victims.

446
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,234
How did you get these?

447
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,800
Nadine Gires.

448
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,114
Herman.

449
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,554
You sent her to do this?

450
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,994
No.

451
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,354
It's complicated.

452
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,714
My God, Cloggy.

453
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,354
I turn my back for a day,
you get ruthless.

454
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,874
Is it enough?

455
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,354
Enough for what? For the police.

456
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,234
If it is enough, then
I can tell her to get out.

457
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,874
She went back there?! Herman!

458
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,674
I'm terrified for her, Paul.
She's very brave.

459
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,794
And you're entirely reckless.

460
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,320
Says the man who wanted to
shoot Gautier.Well.

461
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,674
Paul, here... Murdered travellers
in Thailand and elsewhere.

462
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,320
Their bodies burned so badly they
could not be identified. Again.

463
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,234
And here! Nadine took these
from the Gautier apartments.

464
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,114
I called this hotel and a Lena
Dekker,

465
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,274
and Willem Bloem stayed for
three days in December.

466
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,154
And here, I believe this is Gautier

467
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,874
and Leclerc travelling
on the passports of my two Dutch.

468
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,674
Just days before these
murders took place in Nepal.

469
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:33,274
See this is what he does, Paul.
Forges victims' passports.

470
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,434
Moves through borders.

471
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,200
Lays false trails across the
entire fucking continent.

472
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,714
All right, Herman, all right.

473
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,760
Close your eyes and count to ten.

474
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,880
What else?

475
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,114
I have calls in
at every foreign embassy

476
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,754
and every foreign ministry
of every Western country.

477
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,954
Missing persons enquiries,
stolen passports,

478
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,360
complaints about robberies
or assaults of any kind.

479
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,840
Well, that explains it.

480
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,960
Explains what?

481
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,554
Hey, Laver! Laver says he's been
leaving messages

482
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,560
for you at the embassy all day.

483
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,954
What are you two?
Batman and fucking Robin?

484
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,434
What's this?
You tell me, son.

485
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,360
It's you sending out dispatches for
druggings and robberies and whatnot.

486
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,914
A crime report.

487
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,714
Two Australian citizens -
Greg and Viola Raynott.

488
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,354
Both got cleaned out on their
holidays in Hua Hin last September.

489
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,834
Whatever they gave the man,
he almost died.

490
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,674
He was hospitalised for two weeks.

491
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,634
The last people they saw?
A couple they met on the beach.

492
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,794
She was French Canadian.

493
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,234
He was of Asian appearance
but spoke French?

494
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,840
What is this, Ker-nippenberg?

495
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,440
It says here the Raynotts
described them as having a dog.

496
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,240
A little white dog.

497
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,040
There!

498
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,000
Now tell me we don't have enough.

499
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,314
Helena Dekker.

500
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,840
Lena, please.

501
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,514
She's famous in the Netherlands.

502
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,594
From the television.

503
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,154
Is that right, Miss Dekker?

504
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,640
Perhaps not famous.

505
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,640
She's modest.

506
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,714
And what about you, Mr Bloem?
What is your work?

507
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,874
I am a professor of sociology.

508
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,880
At the University of Amsterdam.
Here.

509
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:57,120
And you both say you have never met
Miss Bronzich or Mr Carriere?

510
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,760
No. No.

511
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,240
Follow me, please.

512
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,400
Was she your friend?

513
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,520
I'm so sorry.

514
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,480
It's a terrible thing.

515
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,194
Miss May.

516
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,800
Have you seen this lady
and this gentleman before?

517
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,000
Miss Dekker, please step
back from the witness.

518
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,594
Miss May, please. Are these the
people you saw Miss Bronzich

519
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,520
and Mr Carriere leave with?

520
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,000
I don't know.

521
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,554
I'm sorry.

522
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,280
I just want to go home.

523
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,160
Please?

524
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,154
Officer Thapa.

525
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,674
You know just how many drugs these
young people take in your city.

526
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,120
They don't stop from the moment
they arrive, and their minds...

527
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,434
Please don't leave Kathmandu
until this matter is resolved.

528
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,920
Of course not.

529
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,995
Come in.

530
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,240
I believe you have my pen.

531
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,720
Thank you.

532
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,280
Time to hit the road?

533
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,560
Passports, sir.

534
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,240

of the 15th or the 16th.

We've done it, Angela.

They're going to raid Gautier's

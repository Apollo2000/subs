2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,834
Gems in Bangkok, money in Paris.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,320
More gems. More money.

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,160
If it's a fake,
it's a damn good one.

5
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,994
Redland has found the real
David Alan Gore.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,394
It's everything we need.
You two can go home.

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,514
Thank you so much.

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,720
Alain...

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,114
Nothing.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,834
We saw the map that you drew.
For your new Dutch friend?

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,520
Someone just left the doors open
and they walked out.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,434
That's where it belongs.

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,760
Here comes the future.

14
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,034
My report has gone to every
embassy in the city.

15
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,034
Your damn report isn't going to
help you now, Herman.

16
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,240
But this might.

17
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,434
Jesus Christ, Paul.

18
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,354
Just in case - understand?

19
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,594
Are you crazy?!

20
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,394
Are you?

21
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,674
We knew exactly where Gautier was.

22
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,194
Now he could be anywhere.

23
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,034
Not anywhere. France.

24
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,394
To see his mother, Nadine thinks.

25
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,554
His mother?! Jesus Christ.

26
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,354
What about Ajay? He's still here.

27
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,000
And we know he knows all about you.

28
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,720
No.

29
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm not taking it. I'm not
like you.

30
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,434
You're right.

31
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,034
You're not like me.

32
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,800
I know how to stay alive.

33
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,394
What have they done?

34
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,994
Long gone, Ajay said.

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,040
But to France. Yes?

36
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,914
Angela, the pond?

37
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,314
He can just vanish.

38
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
The pond is empty.

39
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,600
Where have the water lilies gone?

40
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,554
Angela, what the
hell has happened to the pond?

41
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,074
I-I asked the gardener to...

42
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,114
I thought I asked him to tidy
the plants,

43
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,794
but it turns out my Thai isn't...

44
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,234
He thought I wanted it
cleared. I... Herman...

45
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,354
Is that gardener mad?

46
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,034
What have they done?

47
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,760
Who would do that to water lilies?

48
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,554
I'm worried.

49
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,034
Where do we sleep?

50
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,360
I know a place.

51
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,954
How long?

52
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,394
A few days.

53
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,354
Once I've confirmed the most
suitable client for the gems.

54
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,634
And we need to wait for Ajay.

55
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,354
Ajay...

56
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,680
how could I forget?

57
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,634
He's our friend.

58
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,840
Doesn't mean we want him living
with us for the rest of our lives.

59
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,840
It's here.

Alain Gautier.

66
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,834
Hello again, Monsieur Gautier.

67
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,474
I believe you may be
interested in certain merchandise.

68
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,794
You know, we've already told you, we
are well served for T4Xs.

69
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,794
This was one month ago,
Madame Boeder.

70
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,914
Before Max Ayga was arrested
in Colombia for embezzlement.

71
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,200
It is true, Max is
indisposed, but...

72
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,754
Gautier, listen to me.

73
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,394
We worked with Ayga for 15 years,
and now you expect us to replace him

74
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,954
with someone we've never met and
whose goods are uncertified?

75
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,474
Well, I intend to remedy
both those things.

76
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,874
My associates and I will be
in Paris.

77
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,034
Associates?

78
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,754
My secretary and my fiance.

79
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,034
And the rest, the goods?

80
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,034
Did you not receive a package?

81
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,274
Has there been a delivery?

82
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,840
John, has a parcel arrived
this morning?

83
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,754
Yes.

84
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,240
I thought I might trust you
with a sample.

85
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,354
Quite a trick, Monsieur Gautier.

86
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,314
Is there somewhere we can reach you?

87
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,914
My hotel in Karachi.

88
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,200
42262...

89
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,314
1659.

90
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,840
Excellent, Madame Boeder.

91
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,274
Hey, you.

92
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,634
Sit here.

93
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,714
If the phone rings, you answer it.

94
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,880
You do it well...

95
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,040
I'll give you another.

96
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,394
You know you are allowed to
congratulate me,

97
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,714
Mama.

98
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,514
What would you like me to
congratulate you for?

99
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,640
Your wedding or your release
from prison?

100
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,274
You know what the greatest
joy of this day is for me?

101
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,434
I will have a real family.

102
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,554
My family.

103
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,960
A different future.

104
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,920
Different how, Charles?

105
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,080
Herman!

106
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,920
What the hell are you doing sneaking
up on me, you stupid woman?!

107
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,994
today they were double-booked with
a different kind

108
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,034
of narcotics liaison along the
Cambodian border.

109
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,994
Thank you, Mr Redland.
Thank you, gentlemen.

110
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,600
Jesus, Knippenberg, I
didn't think I was that dull.

111
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,514
You've got a hell of a nerve,
Knippenberg.

112
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,474
Shoving this garbage through
the mailbox

113
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,834
of every embassy in the city,

114
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,674
bawling about a Canadian citizen

115
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,920
being in some goddamn Bangkok
murder gang!

116
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,154
Well, she is.

117
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,234
She's an accomplice. Whether you
like it or not,

118
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,394
she's Quebecois and you're a
Canadian attache.

119
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,634
I thought you might want to do
something about that,

120
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,474
not come blundering in here as
though it's none of your business.

121
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,114
My God, Knippenberg,
what is the matter with you?

122
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,674
Have you actually even read this?

123
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,560
Ah, Ambassador, your, er, Third
Secretary has jungle fever.

124
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,114
My Third Secretary has been
my First Lieutenant

125
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,154
in our investigation
into the violent crimes

126
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,274
committed against two nationals
of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

127
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,794
A young couple, both now lying on
mortuary slabs.

128
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,600
Nasty and upsetting business,
Mr Bastien.

129
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,354
Yotin, stop the car.

130
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,960
Mr Knippenberg? Stop! STOP!

131
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,080
Sir, what are you...?

132
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,560
They've got plenty and we've
got none.

133
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,594
Can I help you, sir?

134
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,760
Yes.

135
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,960
Suspended?!

136
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,960
It isn't a suspension.

137
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,960
What kind of euphemism would you
prefer for compulsory leave?

138
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,554
I thought I could rely on you to...

139
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,114
To what, Herman?

140
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,274
To be your typist, then
your chauffeur?

141
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,720
And now to tolerate this lunacy?

142
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,400
To believe in me.

143
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,634
When you got your internship
in the Foreign Service,

144
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,994
I put bread on the table
while you took classes.

145
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,194
I believed in you enough for that,

146
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,474
and enough to follow you to the
other side of the world

147
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,434
so you could build your career.

148
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,600
YOUR career.

149
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,834
So forgive me if I take exception in
watching you fling that career

150
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,394
in the dustbin one with one hand

151
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,200
while you wilfully put my life in
danger with the other.

152
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,354
Van Dongen's right.

153
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,800
You need a holiday.

154
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,680
Or at least I do.

155
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,280
Get out of this pond, for God's
sake.

156
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,874
Where's MY glass?

157
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,760
And I'm starving.Ajay.

158
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,920
We're pleased to see you,
aren't we, Monique?

159
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,280
Not a thing.

160
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,154
Just strolled through.

161
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,394
These things are gold, Alain.

162
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,554
And the Dutch man,
Knippenberg? What word?

163
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,354
Oh, my brother, you can sleep easy.

164
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,194
It's all over Bangkok, he's been
sent away.

165
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,834
You got a buyer set up?

166
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,954
Yes, they are Tier 3 buyers.

167
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,874
Boutiques in Bern, Zurich and Paris.

168
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,474
I only need to agree terms with them
and, erm...

169
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,914
And then we can leave.

170
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,840
Paris. Wow.

171
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,674
I'm going to need some
new threads, man.

172
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,754
New clothes, Ajay?

173
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,714
A new character, too.

174
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,514
Fucking hell.

175
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,400
Nice to see you, too, Monique.

176
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,634
What chopped her onions?

177
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,200
The sight of you, mon frere.

178
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,914
You remember when we came through
here in '71?

179
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,954
Of course. I made more in those four
days than my father made

180
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
in all his life. Thanks to you.

181
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,520
What's in your bag?

182
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,760
Well...

183
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,194
Couldn't leave her behind,
could you?

184
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,234
And who could blame you?

185
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,994
Juliette, man, she was like...

186
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,600
Monique, not even in the same class.

187
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,080
What?

188
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,194
Delhi's most celebrated
hotel, the Ashoka,

189
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,074
has been robbed in the most daring
and spectacular fashion.

190
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,274
From the suite above,

191
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,834
a thief drilled into the
jewellery concession,

192
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,594
then escaped with a haul
worth over a million rupees.

193
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,594
New Delhi Crime Branch, under
the authority of Police Sergeant

194
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,514
Narandra Nath Tuli, have reassured
the media

195
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,474
that they have the
suspect's identity

196
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,434
and will leave no stone unturned
until he is apprehended.

197
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,560
Hello?

198
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,554
Please disconnect the phone, sir.

199
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,720
Turn around slowly.

200
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,920
I said turn around.

201
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,440
You're under arrest.

202
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,154
Yes?

203
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,600
Telephone for you, sir.

204
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,034
Yeah?

205
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,514
I'm sorry to disturb you, Herman.

206
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,560
Tell me what?

207
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,520
Nadine, what's happened?

208
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,840
Herman?

209
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,240
Nadine just phoned.

210
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,680
It's Gautier's apartment.

211
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,794
The landlady wants to rent
it out again,

212
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,200
so she's clearing it.

213
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,594
When?

214
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,720
Any day now.

215
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,274
Call the airline.

216
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,400
I'll pack.

217
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,000
This bed must be very
uncomfortable to make love on.

218
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,434
Has Alain made love to you
on it yet?

219
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,520
Ajay, did you bring what I asked?

220
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,720
Yeah, sure.

221
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,080
And the other thing?

222
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,834
Oh, there wasn't time.

223
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,194
It was important! I told you!

224
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,914
I was worried about police,
and Nadine found me...

225
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,120
I'm sorry I forgot your
notebook, Monique.

226
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,914
Why are you even coming to Paris?

227
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,554
Huh? The disgusting things
he keeps you around to do for him.

228
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,474
There'll be no more of that,
do you understand?

229
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,560
That's history. Paris is our
future - mine and Alain's.

230
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,234
You seem very upset about your
notebook, Monique.

231
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,234
Makes me wonder what was in it.

232
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,320
It's personal.

233
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,600
It's personal?

234
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,674
Personal makes it sound more like a
diary to me.

235
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,600
Have you been writing down your
and Alain's little sex secrets?

236
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,320
You want to forget the past?

237
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,634
That Dutch girl screamed for you,

238
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,834
and here you are still wearing
the ring that you sold her.

239
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,000
Vile! You're vile!

240
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,274
You're a fucking monster.

241
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,074
Then what does that make you?
We're just the same.

242
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,114
We both know his name isn't Alain,

243
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,480
but we still call him
what he wants to be called.

244
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,874
You play a role for him,
just like I do.

245
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,200
Why do you think he keeps you
around, Monique?

246
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,120
You were only ever here for
one reason.

247
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,280
To take the place of Juliette.

248
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,080
His wife from Paris.

249
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,440
Didn't he ever tell you?

250
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,080
I was always taught
love is a gift from God.

251
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,034
Whoever lives in love, lives in God.

252
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,474
I love this man. I do.

253
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,074
But I am afraid.

254
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,480
What do you fear?

255
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,560
Sometimes I dream that
I have his child inside me.

256
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,200
But then I... feel his hands
around my throat...

257
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,800
and I wake up.

258
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,920
I do not recognise myself
any more, Father.

259
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,840
Then it is not love that you feel.

260
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,240
If it is not, I...

261
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,400
What is it?

262
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,680
I do not know what it is.

263
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,840
Will you make your confession?

264
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,280
Open your heart and
unburden yourself.

265
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,434
She kept a diary,
everything written down,

266
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,234
and now this.

267
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,914
Alain, they even call it
a confession.

268
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,114
You need a white girl for the white
clients, I get that.

269
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,200
But we're going to Europe, they grow
on trees, and Monique is...

270
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,360
We can't trust her.

271
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,240
You have to get rid of her.

272
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,874
I've brought Bloem and Dekker's
photographs

273
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,914
to help identify anything
that's theirs.

274
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,714
We need to collect everything
of interest - get it out of here,

275
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,840
look through it piece by piece.
Everything.

276
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,960
Paul.

277
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,920
Dutch!

278
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,434
Yeah?

279
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,634
This was loose.

280
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,200
Jesus Christ.

281
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,514
Sedatives, disassociates.

282
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,280
Christ knows what else.

283
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,920
I've seen drug stores with less.

284
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,120
Hell of a narcotics raid.

285
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,320
Hey, what's that?

286
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,200
Kaopectate.

287
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,434
I know this drug.

288
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,234
You get a bad stomach,
it blocks you up.

289
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,794
Whatever's in here
is not kaopectate.

290
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,114
Here.

291
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,114
He poisons the kids, makes them
believe they're sick.

292
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,074
Says, "Take this,
makes you all better."

293
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,274
But it doesn't.

294
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,560
It makes you sicker than
you already were.

295
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,474
Fuck knows what he gives them
to keep them under.

296
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,520
Here.

297
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,794
Wait.

298
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,000
What?

299
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,200
Christ, how many more are there?

300
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,914
Herman. My God!

301
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,240
Herman!

302
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,794
Yeah?

303
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,194
The woman. Monique.

304
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,194
I think this is her diary.

305
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,594
Can you translate it?

306
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,714
Of course. But... I noticed
something already.

307
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,594
What?

308
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,874
There's no mention of the
name Alain,

309
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,554
but on every page
she talks about Char.

310
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,834
Char?

311
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,794
Maybe for Charles?

312
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,994
So his name isn't even Alain.

313
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,554
Is it even Gautier?

314
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,114
It's all just fucking smoke.

315
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,034
No, no. Paul, no, it isn't
just smoke.

316
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,874
All of this, it's his life.

317
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,154
We look hard enough,
we'll find him in it.

318
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,520
Everything we are doing, everything,
it will help us to shackle him.

319
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,714
OK.

320
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,000
OK.

321
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,794
Reports indicate that the
jewel thief faked

322
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,834
the symptoms of appendicitis
so perfectly that he even convinced

323
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,674
the surgeons who removed the organ
at the prison infirmary,

324
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,554
from where, only days later,
he drugged his guards,

325
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,714
jumped over the wall
and fled into the city.

326
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,474
It is thought even the army have now
been brought in

327
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,275
to aid the police in their pursuit.

328
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,234
We will have more updates on
the hour.

329
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,360
But here now, a round-up
of... Charles.

330
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,240
Putain!

331
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,314
Police!

332
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,360
Police!

333
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,280
What did you tell the priest?

334
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,080
Ajay thinks we should leave
you behind.

335
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,640
All I said to the priest was all
I wrote in the diary.

336
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,520
That it tortures me...

337
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,520
but I love you.

338
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,360
It's true.

339
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,320
I do.

340
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,434
Even though I know you have not
been honest with me.

341
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,520
You had a wife before
and you never told me.

342
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,200
Juliette.

343
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,954
Ajay told me.

344
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,280
I was... I was angry.

345
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,314
Come on, man, you've known her for
what, a couple of months?

346
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,394
I left my family behind for you.

347
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,194
And so? Haven't I done the same?

348
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,634
I never needed diaries or priests,
did I?

349
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,634
Everything that I have done for you,
everything that I have done,

350
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,034
I have never questioned it,

351
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,994
and I have done it with a fucking
song in my heart,

352
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,194
because we're brothers.

353
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,274
You cannot trust him
to be what you need.

354
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,434
Not now.

355
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,674
Maybe then, not now.

356
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,635
Charles, not in Paris.

357
00:41:36,643 --> 00:41:39,034
You want to stand beside him

358
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,994
as you walk into the restaurant,
to the George V,

359
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,874
and you go shopping at Cartier.

360
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,114
What will people think of you

361
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,360
when they see you beside a little
brown thug?

362
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,480
A little brown thug?

363
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,074
Then what am I, Marie?

364
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,114
Alain, please.

365
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,600
Mr Alain, Mr Alain! For you.

366
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,154
You are nothing like him.

367
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,800
You know that is not what I meant.

368
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,434
Hello.

369
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,834
Monsieur Gautier?

370
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,514
We were wondering - might you,
and your associates, of course,

371
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,114
see your way to joining us
here is Paris?

372
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,474
You, your associates
and the merchandise?

373
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,834
Madame Boeder, we haven't agreed
either purchase price or fee.

374
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,274
We'll have a little dance I'm sure.

375
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,354
But we're in the same
ballroom, Gautier.

376
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,440
How many of you ought we to expect?

377
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,720
Just the two of us.

378
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,600
"I know he made love again
with Suda."

379
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,834
Suda? Who is Suda?

380
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,754
His Thai girlfriend
I told you about.

381
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,114
"Char tells me if I become
Monique, I will understand.

382
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,514
"These people are just
drug traffickers.

383
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,994
"Should Monique care about the
things she fears he does?

384
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,714
"Marie is terrified,
but Monique has to stay calm."

385
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:46,194
Go on, Angela. "Can I play this role
forever, knowing all that I know?

386
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,194
"'Don't live as Marie-Andree
Leclerc, ' Char says,

387
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,794
"'that girl was lost and alone'".
Leclerc. We've got her name.

388
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,554
"If only Char keeps his promise,
takes me to meet his mother,

389
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,114
"takes me out of this ditch.

390
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,714
"Live instead as Monique,
and be free."

391
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,034
Wait, yes, yes, the mother.
Err, she must say where, no?

392
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,434
No, Herman, she... she doesn't.

393
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,994
What? This woman, she barely knows
any more than we do.

394
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,754
He seduces, he betrays, he destroys,

395
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,680
and yet she yearns for him.

396
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,840
Paul, help me with this.

397
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,280
Look. These must be his parents.

398
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,914
Then who's that? Did she re-marry?

399
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,834
Upgraded to a French Naval Officer.

400
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,360
From the war-torn streets
of Saigon...

401
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,634
to a comfortable home in France.

402
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,794
Hello?

403
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,840
It's me, Mama.

404
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,034
Charles... where are you?

405
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,354
It doesn't matter where I am,

406
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,354
but where I will be soon.

407
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,154
I haven't been home for a while.

408
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,994
There are reasons for that, Charles.

409
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,034
Nonetheless, I wanted to give you
some warning.

410
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,080
Warning of?

411
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,114
I'd like to see you.

412
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,480
I wondered if you might help me
with something.

413
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,160
I want to see my child again.

414
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,874
I don't know why you imagine
I can help you with that.

415
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,394
Her family hate me.

416
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,234
Tell them how you long to see her
and to know her.

417
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,954
And what if I don't? What if I
regret her birth

418
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,594
when I think of all the damage
you've done?

419
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,634
You're not that heartless.

420
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,634
You're not that sentimental.

421
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,754
Nonetheless, I will see my child
whether you help me or not.

422
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,154
We're coming.

423
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,794
Make room on the table...

424
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,840
Mama.

425
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,314
14 days, Karachi to Paris.

426
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,594
Monique?

427
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,594
You will never need to speak to
Monique again.

428
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,114
I promise you this.

429
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,634
You and me, Alain.

430
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,594
Right?

431
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,800
You and me.

432
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,800
Why are we stopping here?

433
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,400
We need to have a
conversation, Ajay.

434
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,080
I've come to understand something.

435
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,760
I can't rely on you any more.

436
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,640
Because this is all you're good for.

437
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,234
Pocket change.

438
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,954
Gutter work.

439
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,514
You're not my partner, Ajay.

440
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,794
You were my errand boy,

441
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,794
and now...

442
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,594
you are nothing.

443
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,720
Alain...

444
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,480
this isn't fucking funny.

445
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,720
You are worthless, little man.

446
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,154
Monique was right.

447
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,234
Paris is no place for a
little brown thug.

448
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,680
So now I want you gone.

449
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,440
Ajay..

450
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,640
Mon ami...

451
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,360
it's time for you to
make your own way in the world.

452
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,400
Juliette.

453
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,440
Juliette!

454
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,240
Herman.

455
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,320
Come to bed.

456
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,234
Please. You can't keep looking
at it.

457
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,794
But it's in here somewhere.

458
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,234
Gautier's mother, Paris,
Leclerc's parents in Quebec.

459
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,594
She calls her parents
every week, she says.

460
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,994
Stop it.

461
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,114
Stop this.

462
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,320
How the hell do you expect me
just to stop it?

463
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,840
Angela, please.

464
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,754
Bastien, it's Knippenberg.

465
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,754
Knippenberg, you don't know how to
give up, do you?

466
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,434
Did you read the report yet?

467
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,754
I might have.

468
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,074
I have the woman's full name,

469
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,794
and the town in Quebec where her
family still live.

470
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,840
Do you, now?

471
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,874
Excuse me, Master.

472
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,040
Yes?

473
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,914
Hello, Bastien.

474
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,874
I didn't think...

475
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,474
Well, that's gratitude, for you.

476
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,674
No, I... Of course, it's just...

477
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,000
I had the Mounties pay a visit on
your behalf.

478
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,880
What is it?

479
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,394
A forwarding address for Leclerc.

480
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,434
The address of Gautier's mother.

481
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,754
We know where they're heading.

482
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,440
Bastien, thank you.

483
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,920
Arretez.

484
00:54:51,305 --> 00:55:51,225

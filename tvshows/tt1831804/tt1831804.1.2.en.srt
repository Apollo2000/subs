1
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,757
Hello? Anyone alive out there?

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,759
Mr. Redman. May I call you Stu?

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,095
I think it's time someone tells
me what the fuck's going on.

4
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,891
- So, it's a virus?
- Yeah, some kind of superflu.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,935
People are calling it
Captain Trips.

6
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,186
Looks like we're the last men

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,439
standing here.
Maybe anywhere.

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,108
- You're telling me they're all dead?
- I am.

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,485
- We're the future.
- Hello, Frannie.

10
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,447
My name is Abagail Freemantle.

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,408
You come see me
at Hemingford Home.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,074

13
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,205
Oh, good. You're up.

14
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,041
I made breakfast.

15
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:06,709
Uh, smells great.

16
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,753
- Thank you.
- Sure, no problem.

17
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,547
Well.

18
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,925
Look who decided to join
the land of the living.

19
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,885
Joe.

20
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,721
Joe, I'd like you
to look at me, please.

21
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,016
When someone's speaking to us,
we look them in the eye.

22
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,188
You know, why don't you guys
start eating?

23
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,731
I'll start packing us up.

24
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,275
Sure.

25
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,902
What do you say?
Want to go get our grub on?

26
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,532
-He still hasn't put it down.
-That's good.

27
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,534
Get the feel. You want to be
an axe man, you got to make

28
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,703
the guitar an extension
of your hands, right?

29
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,542
Right.
Come on.

30
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,878
We need to get on the road
if we're gonna get to Boulder

31
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,796
before dark, so... Come on.

32
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,007
Come on, brother. Let's do it.

33
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,319
Welcome
to the Boulder Free Zone!

34
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,160
All right.

35
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:06,454
Now...

36
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,706
which of one you
is Larry Underwood?

37
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,142
Come on, Larry.

38
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,477
-Showtime.
-Oh, fuck.

39
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,062
-Don't make me come in there.
-Stacie!

40
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,689
I said I'm not fucking playing!

41
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,482
Larry, you're not fucking
doing this to me again.

42
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,943
I booked you this gig,
we agreed to do it.

43
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,529
-Now get your ass...
-I agreed to play with my band!

44
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,531
Your band is sick because
they're a bunch of pussies,

45
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,865
and that's not my fault!

46
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,367
-Hello?
-Larry, you get your ass...

47
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,994
Dude, please tell me
you're on your way.

48
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,372
Stacie!
Give me a fucking second!

49
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,499
-I'll give you a second.
-Fuck!

50
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,334
Mick, shut the fuck up
and listen.

51
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,920
Darrell and Tommy came down
with this fucking bug.

52
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,047
I don't... What?

53
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,842
You know what?
Fuck you, too, then!

54
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,760
- Fuck.
- God...

55
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,846
I can't think with you
beating on this door. Fuck!

56
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,182
I wouldn't beat on the door
if you would come to the door.

57
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,101
-The show must go on, Larry.
-There's no band,

58
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,603
so how the fuck are we gonna
have a show, Stacie?

59
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,605
I've got it all figured out.
They've got backing tracks

60
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,399
-all set up, ready to go.
-Are you out of your mind?

61
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,401
I'm not singing karaoke
to my own song.

62
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,319
Get off.

63
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,948
Hey, Ma.

64
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,576
Sorry, I, uh...

65
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,120
I had a drink in the back.

66
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,540
You had a drink?

67
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,626
Enjoy the show, Ma.

68
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,760
And the man you've
all come to see tonight...

69
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,303
Larry Underwood.

70
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,763
- Yeah!
- Give it up.

71
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,644
Oh, man.

72
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,688
Wow.

73
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,566
Shit, this looks like
my first show.

74
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,443
Uh...

75
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,154
I want to thank all of you who,
uh, who made it out tonight.

76
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,281
The real New Yorkers,
the ones who wouldn't let

77
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,366
a couple of sniffles

78
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,327
stop you from coming
to a friend's album launch.

79
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,246
So, thank you, everybody.

80
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,123
Uh, ac... Excuse me, miss?

81
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,291
Can... You mind if I get a drink?

82
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,834
What can I get for you?

83
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,294
Actually, I'll take that drink,
right there.

84
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,963
Perfect. Sorry,
whoever's drink that was.

85
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,299
Yeah.

86
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,009
So, everyone who has
a drink in their hand,

87
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,260
please, join me in a toast.

88
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,930
Here's to, uh, to Pocket Savior.

89
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,556
Pocket Savior.
--Cheers.

90
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,268
Yeah!

91
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,978
Shit.

92
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,149
All right. So, you guys ready?

93
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,568
This is how "Baby,
Can You Dig Your Man" sounded

94
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,029
before it was used
to sell fucking cologne.

95
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,781
Bet you
made a nice chunk of change

96
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,158
off that, didn't you, Lar?

97
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,785
Put you right on the map, huh?

98
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,371
Hey, Mrs. Underwood.

99
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,831
Remember me?

100
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,666
Of course, Wayne.

101
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,168
I used to hide my purse
whenever you visited.

102
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,170
Wayne Stuckey, ladies and gents,

103
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,339
apparently high
on his own supply,

104
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,007
which I'm pretty sure is against

105
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,135
the code of the candy man,
right, Wayne?

106
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,179
Believe this fucking clown
used to be my roommate?

107
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,557
We used to do blow all night...

108
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,058
Stop, Wayne,
you're making me blush.

109
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,059
Dude!

110
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,646
...listening to my records.

111
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,731
Stole some, too, when he moved.

112
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,151
And that's not all he stole.
Ain't that right, Lar?

113
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,360
Stacie, we don't have
any fucking security?

114
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:26,237
You stole
my hook and chorus, too,

115
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,697
-didn't you, you piece of shit?
-Wayne. Wayne. Wayne, stop!

116
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,448
I'm gonna fuck you up...

117
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,659
Break it up, now.

118
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,537
Let's go. Come on.

119
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,664
Another martini.

120
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,049
You enjoying this, inmate?

121
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,178
Bunch of half-wit convicts treat
you like a rock and roll star?

122
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,346
Boys in max
do love a cop killer.

123
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,390
Hard to blame them.

124
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:56,100
Keep that up, you're liable
to end up swallowing teeth.

125
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,935
Oh, I guess you must have forgot

126
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,189
about all those TV cameras
that saw me get walked in here.

127
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,025
Any marks
on me that weren't there before

128
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,486
and, Lucy, you gonna have
some explaining to do, baby.

129
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,866
Thinking I might volunteer
as a witness

130
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,368
when they give you the juice.

131
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,295
Hey.

132
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,755
Crazy.

133
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,425
I never been
the "notorious outlaw" before.

134
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,052
Hmm.

135
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,930
Yeah, you are that.

136
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,599
Even put this goddamn
flu outbreak onto page two.

137
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,727
-I'm in the newspaper?
-Yeah, you are.

138
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,773
George Trask.

139
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,608
You can call me "Gorgeous."

140
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,778
Third degree burglary,
criminal trespass,

141
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,781
possession of burglar tools.

142
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,450
Lloyd Henreid.

143
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,410
I was framed.

144
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,622
Y'all hold still,
nobody gets hurt!

145
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,374
Here.

146
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,000
Get some money
out of the cash register.

147
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,002
Get us some bills, baby.
Some big bills.

148
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,129
Congratulations.
You have the honor

149
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,006
of being held up
by two genuine desperados.

150
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,175
-Genuine.
-My name is Poke Freeman.

151
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,761
This is my protégé
Lloyd Henreid.

152
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,805
We got lawmen
from at least three states,

153
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,973
two federal agencies on our t...

154
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,141
-Yeah.
-Fuck.

155
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,060
You okay?

156
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,771
Oh, fuck.

157
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,281
Gesundheit.

158
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,325
-Pokerized her, old buddy.
-Oh, shit.

159
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,286
You fucking shot her.

160
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,162
No. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

161
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,664
No. No, no, no.

162
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,165
He's seen our faces.
He knows our names.

163
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,542
-No, no, no.
-We got to Pokerize him, too.

164
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,210
-Poke, we don't have to...
-No, no, no.

165
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,837
-Fucking do it. Poke him.
-Let's get the fuck out of here.

166
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,630
-No. No. -Lloyd, yes.
We got to Pokerize him.

167
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,215
Well, then, you kill him.
I'm not gonna fucking kill him.

168
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,509
You shot her! You should be
the one that shoots him!

169
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,594
-Please don't.
-I don't have to fucking do it!

170
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,471
-Shut the fuck up!
-I'm not gonna do it.

171
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,056
-No! No, no.
-Pokerize him right now

172
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,267
or I'm gonna fucking Pokerize

173
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,019
the both of you.

174
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,646
-Okay. Okay.
-That's it.

175
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,735
-I got, I got kids, man.
Please, please... -Oh, yeah?

176
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,279
Fuck it. Just, you know...

177
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,741
I-I never shot nobody before.

178
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,410
Well, it's time to
break your cherry, Lloyd.

179
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,703
You think I'm bullshitting?

180
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,496
Fucking do it.

181
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,672
-Oh, fuck. Shit.
-Look out!

182
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,578
Don't move! Stand down.

183
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:05,039
- Stand down. -Don't shoot.
I surrender.

184
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,540
-Hands behind your back!
-I...

185
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,708
No...

186
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,254
Ooh, ah.

187
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,257
How do you know who I am?

188
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,718
How do you think?

189
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,179
Mother Abagail?

190
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,972
Shit.

191
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,016
I feel crazy saying
her name out loud.

192
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,602
Well, then, we're all crazy,
'cause we all dreamt of her.

193
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,854
Every single person here,
as far as I know.

194
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,898
And she told you I'd be coming?
Me, specifically?

195
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,442
Before everyone started
arriving, she made a list

196
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,237
of five names, people she wanted
running the place.

197
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,906
-It was you and four others.
-You one of the others?

198
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,325
-That's right. -I'm about the
last person she ought to trust

199
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,244
-to run anything.
-Why is that?

200
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,954
What were you up to
before all this?

201
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,623
Mostly fucking things up
for everyone,

202
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,459
disappointing the people I love.

203
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,504
Not sure how that qualifies me,
but I guess I'll have to ask.

204
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,466
-What? -Well, I asked
the exact same question

205
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,677
the first time I met her.

206
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,180
She said, "All God's seen fit
to show me is the who.

207
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,433
Up to you to sort out the how."

208
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,935
It's just hard to believe
that this is all real, you know?

209
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,770
Well, you traveled 2,000 miles
to meet her.

210
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,147
You must have believed a little.

211
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,815
To be honest, at the beginning,

212
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,776
I think I was mostly
just following Harold.

213
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,654
-Harold?
-Harold Lauder.

214
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,823
I mean, that's who I figured
you were when we first saw you.

215
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,450
Ah, okay, okay.

216
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,494
Well, sorry to disappoint you.

217
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,498
But he's here, though, right?
Harold. He made it?

218
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,876
-Yep, he made it. He's here.
-I ought to see him.

219
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,669
What about that girl
he was with?

220
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,504
Uh, Frances Goldsmith?

221
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,881
Frannie. That's right.

222
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,924
-Yeah, she's here, too.
-I knew it.

223
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,510
I knew he'd...
he would get her here.

224
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,056
And you'll get used to it,
it's just gonna take some time.

225
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,685
Anyway, most of the people
are staying up in the college

226
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,312
'cause they feel less alone,

227
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,688
and it's also where we put
all the generators.

228
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,815
But some of us have moved
into the houses.

229
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,192
We just have to use candles

230
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,319
until we can get
the power back on.

231
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,987
Passed a couple of towns
along the way

232
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,573
- where the power never went off.
- Yeah.

233
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,075
It's a shame Mother Abagail
couldn't dream-summon us

234
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,452
to one of those places.

235
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,206
Yeah. Right?

236
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:14,043
Y-You are having
the dreams, right?

237
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,712
-I'm supposed to ask.
-Yeah, I'm having them.

238
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,382
What about you, Joe?

239
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,842
Joe?

240
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,762
Joe, Ms. Goldsmith
asked you a question.

241
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,139
Does he sign?

242
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,059
Sometimes they teach sign
to kids on the spectrum.

243
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,233
My brother was deaf.
Is he verbal at all?

244
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,776
Uh...

245
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,277
He talks in his sleep sometimes.

246
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,780
Hard to say about what.

247
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,077
Trauma will do
strange things to people.

248
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,204
Especially kids.

249
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,206
Where did you find him?

250
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,208
Pennsylvania.

251
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,710
Just sitting by the side
of the road.

252
00:13:56,794 --> 00:14:00,089
Wasn't a house around
for miles.

253
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,092
Called him Joe because it's what
I used to call the kids in class

254
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,094
when I'd blank on their names.

255
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,428
You're a teacher?

256
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,597
-Was.
-That's great.

257
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,933
We're gonna need teachers.
The sooner the better.

258
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,768
-There are other children?
-Yeah, a few.

259
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,437
And more on the way.

260
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,190
So, Nadine, I have a-a question.

261
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,609
I was wondering
if you would be willing

262
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,945
to take responsibility for him.

263
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,240
You mean,
would I be his mother?

264
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,534
Yeah. At least temporarily.

265
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,331
Yeah. Of course.

266
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,334
I mean, we've been through
so much together.

267
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,671
When I found him, he was...

268
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,258
He's come a long way.

269
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,144
And now,

270
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,646
the moment you've all
been waiting for!

271
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,099
Can you get me a tissue?

272
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,393
Hey, you know, I think

273
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,353
-I'm just gonna...
-Are you fucking kidding me?

274
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,397
Look, I get it.

275
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,898
My mom wasn't feeling well
last night, so...

276
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,567
You got to call your mommy?

277
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,945
I thought you were a rock star.

278
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,699
Well, uh... that was fun.

279
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,912
Thanks.

280
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,540
You're not gonna ask
for my number?

281
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,209
I thought you were a nice guy.

282
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,421
-Sorry, I, I got to go.
-No, you're not a nice guy.

283
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,756
You're not a nice guy!

284
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,259
Fuck you!

285
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,969
--Your mom
can suck my fucking dick!

286
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,138
Great.

287
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,063
Yeah?

288
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,982
- Is this Larry Underwood?
- Uh, speaking.

289
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,485
This is Bellevue Hospital
calling about Alice Underwood.

290
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,038
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Alice Underwood?

291
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,416
-Good luck with that.
-Wh-What?

292
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:28,088
Alice Underwood?
Alice Underwood?

293
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,311
Ma! Ma!

294
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,773
Ma! Ma.

295
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,567
Hey.

296
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,530
Mommy. Mommy.

297
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,658
- Larry...
- Yeah.

298
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,495
Thank God.

299
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,663
Go get your father.

300
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,500
He's in the bar...

301
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,127
with that photographer.

302
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,883
You go tell him...

303
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,843
I said come out of there.

304
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,178
Okay. Just...

305
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,014
Jesus Christ, Ma,
you're burning up.

306
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,813
Okay, I'm gonna get you
out of here.

307
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,648
Huh?

308
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,077
Fucking thief!

309
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,663
-I'll kill you, bitch!
-Wayne...

310
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,707
My mom's in real bad shape.
I'm gonna take her upstairs,

311
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,543
and I'm gonna come back down,

312
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,045
-and we'll sort all this shit out, man.
-End you...

313
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:51,588
Over a fucking song?

314
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,049
My song!

315
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,176
Jesus Christ, man.

316
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,598
Violation
of this order may be met with force.

317
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,269
Remain in your homes.

318
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,396
Curfew is in effect.

319
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,399
Violation of this order may be
met with force.

320
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,040
I'm sorry
I'm such a fuck-up, Ma.

321
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,913
Hey, buddy?

322
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,957
Let me get you a sniff.

323
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,333
It'll take the edge off.

324
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,668
That's the least I can do.

325
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,504
You just need to tell me
where it is.

326
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,130
Hey. Wayne.

327
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,508
Where's the stash, man?
I know you're holding.

328
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,219
You'll never be famous now.

329
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,305
Why would you be hiding it?

330
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,350
There's nobody to hide it from.
Fuck you.

331
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,911
Oh...

332
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,039
Oh, you piece of shit.

333
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,207
Oh...

334
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,141
We'll hoof it from here.

335
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:05,198
- Hey. How are you?
- Good morning.

336
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,743
-All right, so you see the Xs
on the houses here? -Yeah.

337
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,995
They're the houses that have
been cleared of the dead.

338
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,456
-Are all these people waiting to
see Mother Abagail? -Some of them.

339
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,124
-Hey, Stu.
-Good to see you.

340
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:17,419
Some of them already seen her,
just want to stay close.

341
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,546
She's out on her porch
for two hours every day,

342
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,174
greeting new arrivals.

343
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,810
You Underwood?

344
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:39,066
Hm. Took your sweet time,
didn't you?

345
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,109
Excuse me?

346
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,736
She's fucking with you.

347
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,821
At ease, Ray.

348
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,031
Ray Brentner.

349
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,118
Dangerous being a prophet.

350
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,788
Especially during
times of upheaval.

351
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,623
That's what she is? A prophet?

352
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,458
Guess that's not for me to say.

353
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:00,462
I'm gonna leave y'all to it.
You're in good hands.

354
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,297
You're not staying?

355
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,633
I got to make sure we've got
enough deer meat for dinner,

356
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,968
and the spotter's got two more
caravans coming in, so...

357
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,179
It seems like you got
a lot of responsibility here.

358
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,473
Yeah, we all do.

359
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,892
-I'll see you.
-See you.

360
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,686
Come on inside.

361
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,530
Please, sit down.

362
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,595
Larry Underwood,
Nick Andros.

363
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,902
Pleased to meet you.

364
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,367
Larry Underwood...

365
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,412
you better come in here
and sing me a song.

366
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,418
Monsters! Monsters are coming!

367
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,048
Monsters are coming!
There's monsters coming!

368
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,761
Monsters on the way!

369
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,930
They're in the suburbs!
Monsters!

370
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,432
They're coming! Monsters!

371
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,976
Another living soul.

372
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,146
Still a few of us
wandering around.

373
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,649
Where the hell did you
break out of, Bellevue?

374
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,484
Certainly not.

375
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,320
I was in Mount Sinai
getting a stent put in.

376
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,323
Come on, man, maybe you want to

377
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,325
put some fucking clothes on.
There's plenty for everyone.

378
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,828
Where I'm going,
I don't need clothes.

379
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,997
-Yeah, where's that?
-Yankee Stadium.

380
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,165
Fulfill a lifelong ambition.

381
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,167
You're finally gonna
throw out the first pitch?

382
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,961
No, son. I'm gonna
run around that field

383
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,546
stark naked
to my heart's content.

384
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,841
And then I'm gonna
jerk off all over home plate.

385
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,887
Best of luck to you.

386
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,225
What's that tone?
Young man...

387
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,144
we can do whatever we want now.

388
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:47,522
Go anywhere. We've been freed
from society's constraints.

389
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,899
I'm not judging you, boss.

390
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,868
I'm not dangerous, I swear.

391
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,871
You don't look dangerous.

392
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,499
You don't look sick, either.

393
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,752
-You passed by me earlier.
-Well, that's...

394
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,922
I mean, you're hard to miss.

395
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,256
Sit down.

396
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,801
Share my umbrella.

397
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,012
I'm Rita Blakemoor.

398
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,973
Larry Underwood.

399
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,142
I almost hid
when I heard you coming.

400
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,269
I thought you were the man
that's been carrying on

401
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,771
all morning.

402
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,066
Oh... the monster-shouter.

403
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,026
That's very apt.

404
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,658
This was my husband's.

405
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,618
He was terrified
of being robbed.

406
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,247
Maybe I'll try it.

407
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,624
Can you hold this?

408
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:30,792
Uh...

409
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,130
Do you think I can hit
this birdhouse right there?

410
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,798
I really don't think
that's a, uh,

411
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,925
such a good idea...

412
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,301
Ooh.

413
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,889
Bull's-eye.

414
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,686
I'm quite sure I couldn't
shoot a person, I don't think.

415
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,813
Pretty soon there won't be
anyone left to shoot.

416
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,315
Don't be so sure.
I heard shots earlier.

417
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,818
That's probably just someone
spraying bullets at the sky.

418
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,154
-Hm. -After all, who
is there to stop them?

419
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,197
Guy I ran into
this morning told me

420
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,492
he was... headed to
Yankee Stadium to jerk, uh....

421
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,995
masturbate...

422
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,414
on home plate.

423
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,874
That's an awful walk.

424
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,709
Did you tell him
to go someplace closer?

425
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,259
You're very pleasant
to be around.

426
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,054
It's wonderful
that you're not crazy.

427
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,768
What did you do before all this?

428
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,359
Let me show you?

429
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,695
- Okay.
- Yeah?

430
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,447
Yeah.

431
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:59,380
C.O. Savino...

432
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,383
I know you and me got off
on the wrong foot.

433
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,511
I was hoping that
we can make a fresh start.

434
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,639
-If I say yes, will you
shut the fuck up? -Okay,

435
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,598
I know you're not gonna be
relocating guys

436
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,183
that are already sick...

437
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,351
...like this
motherfucker behind me.

438
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,685
He's got the neck blowing up,

439
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,229
and he's, like,
coughing and shit,

440
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,855
and I was hoping maybe 'cause

441
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:16,731
-I'm feeling fine,
maybe you could move me...

442
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:18,566
Even if I gave a shit,

443
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,568
-I got no place to relocate you to.
-Okay, but...

444
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,403
...you got to keep
feeding us, right?

445
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,947
'Cause we haven't had food
in over a day.

446
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,657
We don't have any water,
the tap's off,

447
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,033
and I'm gonna get fucking sick

448
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,159
-because this guy...
-You got water.

449
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,957
You want me to drink
toilet water, you motherf...?

450
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,084
Welcome to the party,
cop killer.

451
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,280
I wish my ma could
have seen it, you know?

452
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,115
I was gonna stand her
right here

453
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,449
and show her I was somebody.

454
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,618
She would have been
so impressed.

455
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,121
I doubt it.
She wasn't impressed with much.

456
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,497
Well, I am.

457
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,086
No one's gonna take it down.

458
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,630
You're gonna be up there
a long time, maybe forever.

459
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,175
You conquered New York City.

460
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,388
Guess I never thought of it
like that.

461
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,290
You hungry, Larry?

462
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,339
Uh... uh...

463
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,343
Hell yeah, I'm hungry.

464
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,345
Let's go to my apartment.

465
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,517
Please. Lead the way.

466
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,436
'Cause you're a rock star!

467
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,415
Oh, the smell, it's awful.

468
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,791
Only gonna get worse.

469
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,918
We can't stay here.

470
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:09,088
You know that, right?

471
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,633
Eight million corpses
in the naked city.

472
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,804
They're just rotting in...
furnished ovens.

473
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,139
Plus the rats.

474
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,477
They'll spread diseases
we're not immune to.

475
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,187
Well, where will we go?

476
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,148
I've been thinking about that.

477
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,150
All day, actually.

478
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,528
It's like what that guy
at the park said.

479
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,490
The Yankee Yanker?

480
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,868
That's not bad.

481
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,998
He said we can do
whatever we want,

482
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:45,625
and we can go anywhere.

483
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,959
Monsters are here!

484
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,002
-They're here!
-Oh, God.

485
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,796
Our friend is back.

486
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,965
I wish our friend would
shut the fuck up.

487
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,509
They're in
the streets, in the sewers!

488
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,386
Monsters are everywhere!

489
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,847
I'm scared.

490
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:03,142
Yeah. Me, too.

491
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,271
You'd have to be
batshit crazy not to be.

492
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,360
But we got pills for that. Huh?

493
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,124
Hey. This way.

494
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,128
You okay?

495
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,964
Yeah. It's just...

496
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:30,354
Hey, you.
Hey, you!

497
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,316
What do you want?

498
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,484
I want to give you
a million dollars.

499
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,445
Thanks, man, we're good.

500
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,031
I'm serious. Look.

501
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,408
I got it right here.

502
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,623
You can have every cent of it...

503
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,627
...if I can borrow her
for 15 minutes.

504
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,003
Get out of here.

505
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,214
Now.

506
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,222
That's a mistake.

507
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,185
-Oh, my God.
-It's okay.

508
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,106
You should have taken the deal.

509
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,944
Let's go!

510
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,320
-Come on. Come on.
-Let's go. Go, go, go!

511
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,478
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

512
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,745
Take this side.

513
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,247
That side.

514
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,630
Should have taken
the deal, Midnight.

515
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,466
All we wanted was the girl.

516
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,064
Is this water?

517
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,233
Uh...

518
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,778
-Oh... -I know it sucks, but I
bet it beats the shit out of

519
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,239
whatever those assholes
had planned.

520
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:48,617
Starting route to Haven Avenue.

521
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,245
In 400 feet, turn right
on Columbus Avenue.

522
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:52,747
I don't think I can do this.

523
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,206
Hey, listen, just pretend
we're Ninja Turtles.

524
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,584
-Okay. Okay.
-Right?

525
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,923
Oh, fuck.

526
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,887
What is this?

527
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,805
It's what you think it is.

528
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,932
Oh.

529
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,355
Oh. Aw, fuck.

530
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,484
Okay...

531
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,239
Oh, yeah.

532
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,578
Proceed west
on East 95th Street.

533
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,001
Do you know where you're going?

534
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,296
Oh, uh, north to GW.

535
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:44,632
-Well, which way is north?
-I don't...

536
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,304
I'm-a say... this way.

537
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,266
Oh, fuck.

538
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,268
Come on, we can just go out.
Let's go up.

539
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,686
I'm not fucking going up there.

540
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,271
You know who's up there.

541
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,360
No.

542
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,614
-Coming?
-Okay. Yeah.

543
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,980
Rita. Rita. Relax. You're okay.

544
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,439
They're just rats.

545
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,024
They're just rats, Rita,
come on. Look at me.

546
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,609
You're okay.

547
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,236
Rita, relax. You're okay.

548
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,029
You're okay. You're okay.

549
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,407
You're all right. You're okay.
We just got to keep going.

550
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,908
-No, I can't do this.
-You can't.

551
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,743
-What if they see you?
-I'm going up. I'm done.

552
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,495
I'm not coming with you,
you understand that?

553
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,539
-If you leave, that's it.
-Please come.

554
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,374
I didn't survive this long
to die. Come on.

555
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:01,709
I can't do it.

556
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,210
Here.

557
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,587
Good luck.

558
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,547
That's it? No goodbye?

559
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,382
-I'm not fucking dying with you, Rita!
-Okay, great.

560
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:10,259
Well, have fun drowning in shit!

561
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,347
Fuck.

562
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,435
Should've took
the million dollars.

563
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,024
Mother?

564
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,942
Mother?

565
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,240
Mother?!

566
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,117
Come on. Here, come on.

567
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,620
Come to me.
Come to me. Come on.

568
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,289
Fucking fuck.

569
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,292
- Come here.
- Mother?!

570
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,085
Yeah. Yeah.

571
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,588
Ow! Fuck! Goddamn it!

572
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,423
- Goddamn it!
- Mother?!

573
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:50,716
Shut the fuck up,
you cock-knocker!

574
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,760
I fucked your mother.

575
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,887
- Mother?!
- Shit. Fuck.

576
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,516
Come here.

577
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:49,358
I guess
that'd make this your room.

578
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,165
So what do you think, bud?

579
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,002
It puts her
right across the hall.

580
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,837
If you ever need her
in the night,

581
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,797
all you got to do is
step out your door.

582
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,523
Hey. Nadine.

583
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:31,567
You're sure this is what you want?

584
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,069
As opposed to what?

585
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,405
I could stay on the couch,
a few nights

586
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,532
at least,
just to help you get settled.

587
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:40,701
It wouldn't have
to mean anything.

588
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,037
What did she say to you...

589
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,039
the old woman?

590
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,583
I told you,
I'm really not supposed to...

591
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,585
-Yeah.
-...tell people what she said.

592
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,254
You said that.

593
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,216
Yeah, so, um, if...

594
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,053
If you're all right, I guess
I'll, uh, gonna go find Harold.

595
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,388
I got his address, so...

596
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,265
Uh...

597
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,933
you mind taking him with you?

598
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,061
Just give me a...

599
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,813
a second to start
setting us up, you know?

600
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,358
Of course.

601
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,901
Hey, Joe?

602
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,694
Joe?

603
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,821
Come on, dude.

604
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,501
Thank you.

605
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,130
Continue north.

606
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,404
Fuck!

607
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,677
Fuck!

608
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,565
Fuck. Ah, fuck.

609
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,679
Fuck!

610
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:08,390
Aw. Fuck!

611
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,017
Oh, fuck.

612
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,060
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

613
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,854
Oh, fuck!

614
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,235
Fuck.

615
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,488
Fuck!

616
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,680
Oh, fuck!

617
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,098
Oh, fu...

618
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,487
Larry?

619
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,822
Ma?

620
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,116
Why didn't you come see me?

621
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,911
-Ma.
-Larry?

622
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,789
I need to go to the ho...

623
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,470
Oh. Fuck. Fuck.

624
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:31,390
Larry!

625
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,103
Larry!

626
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,772
Come back!

627
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,607
Help me!

628
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,735
Why don't you
come see me, Larry?

629
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,992
Hey.

630
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,667
Help me! Let me out!

631
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,131
Let me out! Let me out!

632
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,009
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out.

633
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,480
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

634
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:24,192
It's okay.

635
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,486
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

636
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,280
You're okay. It's me.

637
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,990
It's me. It's me. It's me.

638
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,326
You're okay. You're okay.

639
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,953
How the fuck...? How the fuck
did you get out here?

640
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,164
I walked north like you said.

641
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,833
I lost... I lost my phone.

642
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,044
But not your drugs.

643
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:45,047
I almost lost my mind.

644
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,214
Well, look what you won.

645
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,842
-What?
-We made it.

646
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:52,012
We made it.

647
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,853
- This is stupid.
- What is?

648
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:46,608
That it's raining or...
that you're stuck here with me?

649
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,027
No.

650
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:51,530
Being alive.

651
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:54,783
When everyone else is dead.

652
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,452
It's like being the last people
to leave a party.

653
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,329
Meaning what? That-that...

654
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,581
You're worried it's tacky?

655
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,919
It's stupid.

656
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:08,088
It's not worth it.

657
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,597
I don't know
about you, but I, uh...

658
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,433
can't keep my eyes open.

659
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,226
Ready for bed?

660
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,353
I'm gonna stay up
for a little bit.

661
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,565
You sure?

662
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,650
Okay.

663
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,700
Hi, I'm looking
for Harold Lauder.

664
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,328
How can I help you?

665
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,832
Um...

666
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,084
I'm Larry Underwood. Sorry.

667
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,836
This is my friend Joe.

668
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,298
We followed your signs
all across the country.

669
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,633
You did?

670
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,510
No kidding. Really?

671
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,969
Yeah, really. We did.

672
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,846
Um... I brought you
some presents

673
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,474
as a thanks for helping us out
on the road.

674
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,309
You know, whenever
I was in a tough spot,

675
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:48,271
I'd ask myself,
"What would Harold do?" so...

676
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,697
Actually, is Fran here? I-I'd
really love to meet her, too.

677
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:06,581
No, she doesn't,
she doesn't live here.

678
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:10,210
Oh, I see.

679
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,754
Sorry to hear that.

680
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,049
Yeah, I was with someone
on the road, too.

681
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,009
It didn't work out.

682
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,887
I'll come by one night, we'll
have a drink, talk about it.

683
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,348
And Joe, he... You know, uh...

684
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,810
Joe.

685
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,772
Sorry, he's been through a lot.

686
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,233
We all have.

687
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,569
Yeah.

688
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,446
-Nice to meet you, Larry.
-Yeah.

689
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,240
-Thank you.
-Sure.

690
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,788
Come on, crazy.

691
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,165
What was that about, man?
That was rude.

692
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,239
Hello?

693
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,737
Boo.

694
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,492
Poor thing.

695
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,496
How long you been shitcanned?

696
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,667
Uh, maybe...

697
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:05,630
a week, or a cou...
uh, I... What day is it?

698
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:08,550
How come
you're not dead already?

699
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:10,760
You don't want to know that.

700
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,475
I found this.

701
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,521
I ate him.

702
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,897
Hmm.

703
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:32,365
You didn't happen to have a
little chomp on this fine fellow

704
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:34,200
on the bottom bunk,
by any chance?

705
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:38,204
That couldn't have been me.

706
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,747
That must have been
somebody else.

707
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,166
You see, one of his legs

708
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,792
is looking a bit thinner
than the other.

709
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,170
I don't know about that.
I don't know nothing about that.

710
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,838
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

711
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:50,091
Eh, look about the same to me.

712
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,928
How'd he taste?

713
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,394
It was all Poke's fucking idea.

714
00:58:01,477 --> 00:58:03,855
Taking a bite
out of Mr. Personality?

715
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,398
That was the only goddamn reason

716
00:58:05,481 --> 00:58:07,066
that I'm in this fucking place,
'cause Poke said

717
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,360
that we got to go big and I said
no, we got to stay small.

718
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,613
And I'd never eat
somebody's fucking leg.

719
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:13,615
Look at me.

720
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,533
No.

721
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,243
Why not?

722
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,620
I don't think you're real.

723
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:22,415
Oh, I'm real, baby.

724
00:58:22,498 --> 00:58:24,417
I'm real real.

725
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,546
Well, if you're real, then

726
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,257
you must be the devil.

727
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,427
That's not a very nice thing
to say, Lloyd.

728
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:02,747
Shit.

729
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,291
You dig that?

730
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,252
I learned that trick
from a massage parlor honey

731
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:10,004
-in Secaucus, New Jersey.
-Well, that's a good trick.

732
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:13,800
Secaucus, home of the world's
greatest pig farms.

733
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,260
Mister?

734
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,679
-I'm awful hungry.
-Of course you are.

735
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:20,765
A little rat meat and a bite
or two of raw human calf muscle

736
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:23,351
ain't enough to sustain
a fella like you.

737
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,144
No, it's not enough.

738
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,313
Hell, I'm a bit peckish myself
and it's barely an hour

739
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,815
since I finished lunch.

740
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:32,777
Mmm. Rare roast beef sandwich
on Vienna bread.

741
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,823
--Smothered in onions
and Gulden's spicy brown.

742
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:39,158
Home fries on the side.

743
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,537
Little chocolate milk
to wash it down.

744
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,790
Oh, my, I'm...

745
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,375
I'm torturing you, ain't I?

746
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,502
Tell you what.

747
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,839
How about

748
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,507
I let you out of here

749
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,509
and we go find something to eat?

750
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,553
Yeah. That sounds good.

751
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:01,889
I don't believe
I introduced myself.

752
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:09,689
Name's Flagg. Two Gs.

753
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,151
-Pleased to meet you.
-Likewise.

754
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:15,528
It occurs to me,
before I open this door

755
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:17,363
and we go looking for dinner,
that there's a couple of things

756
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,157
we ought to get straight
between us.

757
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,660
Yeah. You're a beautiful fella.

758
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:25,538
I'm gonna make you
my right-hand man, Lloyd.

759
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:27,665
You'll be Saint Peter
at the pearly gates. Huh?

760
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,083
How about that? Would you like that?

761
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,710
I'd like that.

762
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,547
Now, you'd like to get even
with the people

763
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:37,050
-who left you in here, huh?
-Yeah.

764
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,053
Yeah. And not just them,
but anybody

765
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,555
who would do a thing like that.

766
01:00:42,638 --> 01:00:47,185
The kind of people who look
at a man like you as-as garbage!

767
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:49,854
Yeah. I ain't fucking garbage.

768
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:53,066
-You're not garbage.
-I ain't fucking garbage.

769
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,776
-We're gonna go far.
-I ain't garbage.

770
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:58,196
-It's a good time for people like us.
-Yeah.

771
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,323
Everything's starting up.

772
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,743
Now all I need is your word.

773
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,578
All... What is it?
What-what are you talking...

774
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:07,413
What? All you need
is what... y... what?

775
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,873
Your word?

776
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,917
That you'll be loyal.

777
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,919
-No questioning orders.
-No denials.

778
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,796
No falling asleep on guard duty.

779
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,094
Now, you give me your promise,

780
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,221
and I'll give you the key.

781
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,516
I promise you.

782
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,852
Attaboy.

783
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,987
You're a free man, Lloyd.

784
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,825
I believe this is yours.

785
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,577
It's mine?

786
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,926
Mine.

787
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,637
Yes.

788
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,848
Oh, we can't forget
about dinner.

789
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:09,767
-Dinner, that sounded real nice.
-Mm-hmm. I won't.

790
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,479
I'm very pleased
to have found you, Lloyd.

791
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,733
I believe this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

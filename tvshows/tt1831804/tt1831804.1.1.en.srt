The CDC has quarantined
the area.

Men in U.S. Army uniforms

Uh, Mr. Redman.

00:10:10,922 --> 00:10:12,341
May I call you Stu?

189
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:15,010
Well, you kept me prisoner here
for three days.

190
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:16,553
No lawyer, no phone calls.

191
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:18,221
I figure you can call me
whatever you want.

192
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:20,557
Okay. I'm Jim. Jim Ellis.

193
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:23,226
Uh, my understanding is
you've told the nursing staff

194
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,729
that you're done cooperating
with our work here

195
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:28,065
until they bring in someone
who can answer your questions.

196
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:29,399
Yeah, I think it's time
someone tells me

197
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:30,817
what the fuck's going on.

198
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:32,819
Okay. What do you want to know?

199
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:34,237
Well, for starters, how come

200
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:35,739
you're not wearing
one of those masks?

201
00:10:35,822 --> 00:10:37,908
I'm, uh, too good-looking.

202
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:39,743
Sorry. Uh,

203
00:10:39,826 --> 00:10:42,913
my psych profile says I use
humor to cope with... stress.

204
00:10:42,996 --> 00:10:45,123
No, the reason
I'm not wearing a mask is

205
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:48,543
because it appears
that you're not contagious.

206
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:49,795
How do you know that?

207
00:10:49,878 --> 00:10:51,380
Um, turns out that

208
00:10:51,463 --> 00:10:53,423
guinea pigs are at least
as susceptible as we are.

209
00:10:53,507 --> 00:10:54,841
They start showing symptoms

210
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,760
almost immediately.
You guys have been

211
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:58,804
breathing the same air.
It's been almost 70 hours,

212
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:01,264
and there's not one sniffle.

213
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:03,392
-(guinea pigs squeaking)
-So it's a virus, what I got?

214
00:11:03,475 --> 00:11:06,770
Actually, as far as we can tell,
you haven't got anything at all.

215
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:08,772
As to what Mr. Campion had,

216
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:11,400
yeah, it's a virus,
some kind of super flu.

217
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:13,652
People are calling it
Captain Trips.

218
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:16,613
Campion was the guy
in the car, right?

219
00:11:16,696 --> 00:11:19,908

220
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:21,910
Come on, let's get some chips
going so I can get some steak.

221
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:23,662
-Oh, you ready? -Yeah, I'm ready.
-Let's go, boys. I'm in.

Hap needs a retirement fund.

224
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:29,626
Okay, flip the next card.
I want to see what it is.

225
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,169
-Get 'em, Hap.
-Okay.

226
00:11:31,253 --> 00:11:32,796
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

227
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,923
-(tires squealing)
-Two. Four.

228
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:39,636
Turn off your pumps, Hap.

229
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:40,887
What?

230
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:43,598
Fuck, shit.

231
00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:45,809
Boy must be drunker

232
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:47,602
than a fiddler's bitch.

233
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:49,354
(tires screeching)

234
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:55,152
He was military, huh?

235
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:57,195
-Afraid that's classified.
-(scoffs)

236
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,989
So he was military.

237
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:01,158
You fucking guys.

238
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:04,327
You were in, yourself...
barely a year, it says here.

239
00:12:04,411 --> 00:12:07,497
Medically retired following

240
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:09,875
a catastrophically ruptured

241
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,794
right knee meniscus,
all tendons. Ouch.

242
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:15,797
People I came in here with...
you want to tell me about them?

243
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:18,508
That's not a subject
that I'm at liberty to discuss.

244
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:21,344
I woke up three days ago to men
wearing MOPP suits holding M4s,

245
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:23,847
saying, "Come with us.
No need to be alarmed, sir."

246
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,807
-Look, I...
-Want to tell me about that?

247
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:27,684
Hey, I advised
against those MOPP suits,

248
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:30,353
but it was kind of a tough sell
with your dog on the porch,

249
00:12:30,437 --> 00:12:31,855
kind of shape he was in.

250
00:12:32,898 --> 00:12:35,025
It was my wife's dog.

251
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:37,027
Your wife...
car accident, right?

252
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,821
I-I read about her
in your file.

253
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:41,865
-I'm very sorry for your...
-Sorry for my loss?

254
00:12:41,948 --> 00:12:44,159
Yeah. (sighs)

255
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:46,161
The people I came in here with,

256
00:12:46,244 --> 00:12:49,039
people I worked on rigs with,
people I've known my whole life,

257
00:12:49,122 --> 00:12:51,374
my friends, my family...
tell me about them.

258
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,126
-Well...
-What the fuck did you guys do?

259
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,753
-Okay. -How many of them
had what Campion had?

260
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:56,588
All of them.

261
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:01,676
What do you mean, all of 'em?
What...?

262
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,553
And how are they?

263
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:06,556
Ralph Hodges', uh, youngest
daughter, the four-year-old.

264
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,058
-Eva?
-Uh-huh.

265
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:09,559
She's alive.

266
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:11,228
She was when I came in here.

267
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:13,688
What do you mean? What's-what's
that supposed to mean...

268
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:15,524
"She's alive"?

269
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:17,067
Mis-Mister Redman,
I am so sorry.

270
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,070
This situation... it exists.

271
00:13:20,153 --> 00:13:22,072
We're working to contain it,
and right now

272
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:24,407
that is all that matters.

273
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:26,826
We've got the town of Arnette
under quarantine.

274
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,913
We're trying
to recreate Campion's route,

275
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:31,915
figure out how many people
he may have exposed

276
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:34,417
before he ended up
at Mr. Hapscomb's gas station.

277
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:37,963
So, you spoke to him, right?
Campion?

278
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:40,382
Uh, before the ambulance came?

279
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:42,592
(panting)

280
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:46,304
(coughing)

281
00:13:46,388 --> 00:13:49,099
I got you.

282
00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:50,600
Easy, easy, easy.

283
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:52,435
-Grab his legs.
-(groaning)

284
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,271
(coughing)

285
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:56,773
You're gonna be all right.
You hear me?

286
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:58,441
How's my... how's my wife?

287
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:00,902
How's Sally? How's my kid?
(coughs)

288
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:02,279
(wheezing)

289
00:14:02,362 --> 00:14:03,947
ELLIS:
Ralph Hodges and you.

290
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,074
You were the only ones who made
physical contact with Campion.

291
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:08,285
You're telling me
they're all dead?

292
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:10,287
I am.

293
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,914
-(sighs)
-What about Campion's family?

294
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:15,125
-Anyone touch them? -STU: Just
hang in there, all right?

295
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,918
(gasps)

296
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:18,837
Car just smashed into our pumps.

297
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,255
(breathing heavily)

298
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:22,632
Clock was red.

299
00:14:22,716 --> 00:14:25,468
-The clock?
-(coughing)

300
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:27,637
Red clock means lockdown.

301
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:29,973
Whole place is supposed to seal.
(coughs)

302
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:32,434
Hap?! How are we doing
on that ambulance?

303
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:33,852
Ten minutes out.

304
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:35,186
(mutters)

305
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,646
I thought if I just...

306
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,481
I thought
if I moved fast enough...

307
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:40,984
STU: Campion came from
California, right?

308
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:43,778
Some bioweapons facility
out in the middle of the desert?

309
00:14:43,862 --> 00:14:45,488
-You know I can't say.
-My point is,

310
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:48,158
he traveled 1,700 miles
before he hit Arnette?

311
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:50,577
How many stops is that?

312
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,330
Got to gas up, pee, eat.

313
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:56,124
You think you can find every
person he crossed paths with?

314
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:58,126
Well, as far as we can tell,
everyone who comes

315
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:00,837
in contact with this thing
becomes infected.

316
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,340
Everyone but you,
and we need to find out why.

317
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,009
We need to take as much blood
from you as you can tolerate.

318
00:15:06,092 --> 00:15:07,636
Couple of vials
every couple hours.

319
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:10,055
Run it through every test
we can think of.

320
00:15:10,138 --> 00:15:12,182
Run the rest of you
through every scan we have.

321
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:15,310
Hope that one of these tracks
helps us identify

322
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:17,395
what's protecting you
from this infection.

323
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:20,315
(chuckles): Come up with some
way to protect the rest of us.

324
00:15:20,398 --> 00:15:23,318
Keep any more four-year-olds
from ending up like Eva Hodges.

325
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:29,741
Hey, your wife
was a nurse, right?

326
00:15:29,824 --> 00:15:32,118
What do you think
she'd tell you to do?

327
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,704
All right.

328
00:15:34,788 --> 00:15:36,039
All right?

329
00:15:36,122 --> 00:15:38,625
Do what you got to do.

330
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:44,714
Hey, we're back on.
Bring in the tech.

331
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:46,216
Prep contrast fluid for an MRI.

332
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:48,093
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

333

(sneezes)

334
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:57,268
Excuse me. Allergies.

335
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:06,695
Hello?

336
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:10,198
Can anybody hear me?

337
00:16:18,456 --> 00:16:20,417
Hello?

338
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:26,131
(grunting)

339
00:16:40,353 --> 00:16:42,313
Hello?

340
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:45,775
Anyone alive out there?

341
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,114
This is Harold Lauder.
I live on Ocean Street.

342
00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:53,116
Hello?

343
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,160
Anyone?

344
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:58,621
(whispers):
I'm here, Harold.

345
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,295
-I'm here, Harold.
-HAROLD: Frannie?

346
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:10,258
Holy shit, it's good to see you.

347
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:12,635
Um, obviously, I wish

348
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:14,763
the circumstances were better.

349
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:19,642
Can I come in?

350
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:21,770
(exhales)

351
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:25,732
Thanks.

352
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:28,276
-What happened to you? You're
all banged up. -Fell off

353
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,778
my bike.
(chuckles softly)

354
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:33,323
Is that...

355
00:17:33,406 --> 00:17:35,867
-I'm burying my dad.
-(whispers): Yeah.

356
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,871
I guess you've had
some experience with loss.

357
00:17:39,954 --> 00:17:41,998
Your brother and all.

358
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,340
Well, what about your family?
A-Amy?

359
00:17:50,423 --> 00:17:52,008
Managed to get them
to the funeral home

360
00:17:52,091 --> 00:17:55,887
before it closed its doors,
and there they sit.

361
00:17:58,097 --> 00:18:00,809
-Doubt they'll ever be buried.
-No,

362
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,227
someone will come back
and bury them

363
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,647
when this disease
has burned itself out.

364
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,357
Who?

365
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,359
I don't know,
someone in authority.

366
00:18:09,442 --> 00:18:11,319
Frannie. (chuckles)

367
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:13,655
Five will get you ten,
it was the people in authority

368
00:18:13,738 --> 00:18:14,823
who did this.

369
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:17,408
Some government scientist said,

370
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:19,035
"Look what I made.

371
00:18:19,118 --> 00:18:22,038
Kills almost everybody.
Isn't it great?"

372
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:23,414
(chuckles)

373
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:26,042
Probably got a medal
and a raise.

374
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:27,836
And then somebody spilled it.

375
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,213
-What are you talking about?
-What planet

376
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:32,215
have you been living on?
It was all over the Internet

377
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:33,800
before they shut it down.

378
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:36,261
I've been kind of busy.

379
00:18:38,304 --> 00:18:40,306
I'm sorry.

380
00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:43,017
Let me help you.

381
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:45,019
No, I got it.

382
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:47,730
Look at your hands.

383
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,399
-You can't do this...
-Go home, Harold!

384
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:52,402
I'm not
your fucking babysitter anymore!

385
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,993
No one's coming, Fran.

386

PRESIDENT:
My fellow Americans,

399

we cannot afford
to jump at shadows

400
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,427
like children in the dark,

401
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,429

lightly.

403

There is no truth

Stovington, Vermont.

441
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,662
A secure CDC facility there.

442
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:19,580
It's where this whole effort
is being coordinated.

the Arnette quarantine

450
00:25:32,218 --> 00:25:33,970
The nurse's kid testing positive

451
00:25:34,053 --> 00:25:35,638
means we get
our very own exclusion zone.

Why the hell

Trust me, you should be happy

00:25:46,232 --> 00:25:47,650
we're not telling you more
than we are.

473
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,190
You expect me to wear this thing
the whole time we're there?

COBB: Just on the way. Can
take it off once we're inside.

475
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:32,862
And how long's the trip?

476
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:35,865
You know, it seems to me,

477
00:26:35,948 --> 00:26:38,159
Mr. Redman, you might be
under the misimpression

478
00:26:38,242 --> 00:26:40,536
that our only option as far
as securing your cooperation

479
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:42,330
is to fucking ask for it.

480
00:26:42,413 --> 00:26:44,415
Now, it's gonna be a lot easier
on everybody

481
00:26:44,498 --> 00:26:46,208
if you just let us do our jobs.

482
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:48,085
And what is that, exactly?
Your job?

483
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:50,171
Well, my job, Mr. Redman,
is to keep you safe.

484
00:26:50,254 --> 00:26:52,006
And to keep you cooperating.

485
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:54,216
Now, it's totally up to you
how comfortable you want to be

486
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,634
while both

00:36:25,537 --> 00:36:27,247
No.

655
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:30,292
Uh, pretty much sums it up.

656
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:33,295
See, the first rule
of epidemiology is,

657
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:36,757
you don't end up on the wrong
end of the stethoscope.

658
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,091

00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:39,468
(coughing)

660
00:36:39,551 --> 00:36:41,678
Goddamn it.

661
00:36:41,762 --> 00:36:44,514
The bright side is, it looks
like you won't have Dr. Cobb

662
00:36:44,598 --> 00:36:45,515
to worry about anymore.

663
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,100
Cobb has it, too?

664
00:36:47,184 --> 00:36:49,978
(chuckling)
Yeah.

665
00:36:50,062 --> 00:36:52,439
Pretty much everyone has it.

666
00:36:52,522 --> 00:36:55,150
There's reports of immunes
like you out there,

667
00:36:55,233 --> 00:36:57,319
but there's nothing confirmed.

668
00:36:57,402 --> 00:37:00,155
Oh, God.

669
00:37:00,238 --> 00:37:01,490
Can you imagine that

670
00:37:01,573 --> 00:37:02,950
just, like, a month ago,

671
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:04,826
we were all worried about Ebola.

672
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,995
(hacking laughter)

673
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,539
(coughing)

674
00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:19,007
What can I do for you, huh?

675
00:37:19,091 --> 00:37:20,801
(hawks)

676
00:37:20,884 --> 00:37:22,135

677
00:37:24,262 --> 00:37:25,973

678
00:37:26,056 --> 00:37:27,349
What happens now?

679
00:37:27,432 --> 00:37:29,685
(sniffles)
Now, uh,

680
00:37:29,768 --> 00:37:31,353
it's game over.

681
00:37:31,436 --> 00:37:33,355
I was gonna use this.
You know, just...

682
00:37:33,438 --> 00:37:36,483
Painful, all right, but,

683
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,819
you know, seems smarter than
choking to death on my own snot.

684
00:37:38,902 --> 00:37:42,030
(exhales) And then I had
a similar attractive idea.

685
00:37:42,114 --> 00:37:45,409
I was gonna, uh, raid
the pharmacy down the hall

686
00:37:45,492 --> 00:37:47,703
to see if I can't shuffle off
this mortal coil

687
00:37:47,786 --> 00:37:49,079
with a little bit of style.

688
00:37:49,162 --> 00:37:50,414
-(chuckles)
-Yeah.

689
00:37:50,497 --> 00:37:51,665
Forgive me,
what are they gonna...

690
00:37:51,748 --> 00:37:53,125
what are they gonna do with me?

691
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:54,209
Unknown.

692
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:56,378
Well, no one has heard or seen

693
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:59,548
of General Starkey in 19 hours.

694
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:01,717
He sealed off the command center

695
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,719
and shut down
all movement between floors.

696
00:38:03,802 --> 00:38:06,138
(sniffles) Sometimes he opens
the door for me.

697
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:07,014
Sometimes he doesn't.

698
00:38:07,097 --> 00:38:08,765
He's un-fucking-predictable,
that one.

699
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:09,933

700

-How many floors?

701
00:38:12,436 --> 00:38:15,313
There's one way to find out.

702
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:18,025
Yeah.

703
00:38:18,108 --> 00:38:20,402
Come on, Doc. You got to tell me
how to get the fuck out of here.

I thought I was gonna be the one

How you doing, Doc?

717
00:39:00,692 --> 00:39:02,778
I wondered where you got to.

718
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:04,988
I thought maybe you opted
for the, uh...

719
00:39:05,072 --> 00:39:06,323
the early checkout, you know?

721
00:39:07,908 --> 00:39:09,826

So, what's this?

722
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,787
A tearful goodbye, huh?

723
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,996

What are you doing here, Cobb?

728
00:39:22,714 --> 00:39:25,300
Get... the fuck out.

729
00:39:25,383 --> 00:39:27,677
-I'm not gonna tell you again.
-Come on, Cobb.

Climb aboard.

Leave the gun.

the last time
we heard anybody talk back.

764
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:37,367
My guess,
Cobb was following a checklist.

Contingencies.

that the two great human sins

00:48:33,473 --> 00:48:35,016
are pride and hate.

864
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:37,977
Are they?

I choose to think of them
as the two great virtues.

866
00:48:43,274 --> 00:48:46,402

you will change
for the good of the world.

868

jettisoning the hate.

he was aware

that he could simply
accept what was.

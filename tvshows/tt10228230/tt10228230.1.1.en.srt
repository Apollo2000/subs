Well, I suppose all of them.
I'm the new Director of Programmes.

Uh... Time for a quick catch-up?

61
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:27,465
Walk and talk?
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</font>

62
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:31,305
I'm interested in events.

63
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,145
Event television.

64
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:36,025
Why do the BBC always trounce us
in the big stuff?

65
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:37,865
Diana's funeral
a couple of weeks ago,

66
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:40,065
one of the most watched programmes
in TV history,

67
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:43,065
and obviously, tragic as that was,
goes without saying... <font color="yellow">Tragic.</font>

68
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:44,865
..people still want to
gather as a nation

69
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:47,065
to experience
something big together.

70
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:51,105
I'm just not sure the classic light
entertainment of old fits into that.

71
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:52,305
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

72
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:55,505
<font color="yellow">Well, we've always gotten</font>
<font color="yellow">our game show formats from America.</font>

73
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:56,745
So time for something new.

74
00:03:56,785 --> 00:03:58,945
<font color="yellow">No, time to invent our own.</font>

75
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:01,825
<font color="yellow">The classic TV game show can be</font>

76
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:03,785
<font color="yellow">the must-see TV thingy</font>
<font color="yellow">that you're looking for.</font>

77
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:05,985
<font color="yellow">I'm not just saying that</font>
<font color="yellow">to save my department's skin.</font>

78
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:08,785
Claudia, I've got Martin Bashir
coming in this morning to discuss...

79
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:11,265
<font color="yellow">Very important, but if you just</font>
<font color="yellow">let me bring some people in...</font>

80
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:13,465
<font color="yellow">I have one. I think I have one.</font>

81
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:15,385
<font color="yellow">It's an old one.</font>
<font color="yellow">The last gaffer rejected it.</font>

82
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:16,985
Brilliant. Why is it an event?

83
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:19,545
<font color="yellow">Because they're going to give away</font>
<font color="yellow">£1 million.</font>

84
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:28,385
<font color="yellow">The idea then would be that the</font>
<font color="yellow">higher up the mountain you climb,</font>

85
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:32,145
<font color="yellow">the more your time would deplete,</font>
<font color="yellow">the way that oxygen might deplete.</font>

86
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:33,905
<font color="cyan">No. Stop trying to complicate it.</font>

87
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:36,305
<font color="cyan">It's simple. Questions and answers.</font>

88
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:39,385
Paul, for crying out...
This isn't 1955.

89
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:42,145
Everyone else is making shows where
you spy on strangers in a house

90
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:44,665
or throw them out of helicopters.
<font color="cyan">Yeah. Crap. Desperate.</font>

91
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:46,305
<font color="cyan">This is the show</font>
<font color="cyan">we're going to pitch.</font>

92
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:47,785
<font color="cyan">Re-pitch.</font>

93
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:49,585
We could set it on actual mountain.

94
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,745
Well, like a little one.

95
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:53,025
Like in...

96
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:54,225
Wales or...

97
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:56,385
<font color="#008000">Look, right, I'm with Paul.</font>

98
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:58,145
<font color="#008000">It's what we did</font>
<font color="#008000">on the radio show with Chris.</font>

99
00:04:58,185 --> 00:05:00,345
<font color="#008000">Answer a question,</font>
<font color="#008000">you get it right, you double it,</font>

100
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:03,225
<font color="#008000">so you keep doubling,</font>
<font color="#008000">so the higher up you go,</font>

101
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:06,185
<font color="#008000">the more you can earn,</font>
<font color="#008000">but the more you can lose.</font>

102
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:07,385
<font color="#008000">People love it.</font>

103
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:08,905
<font color="yellow">But the networks don't.</font>

104
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:10,945
<font color="yellow">That's why they all</font>
<font color="yellow">turned it down the first time.</font>

105
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:12,665
<font color="yellow">Fusty old game show.</font>

106
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:15,985
<font color="cyan">It's not a game show, it's a quiz.</font>

107
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,945
<font color="cyan">That's the joy of it.</font>

108
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,225
<font color="cyan">People love a good pub quiz.</font>

109

111
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:33,465
<font color="cyan">Nope. Fine.</font>
<font color="cyan">You write it down, then.</font>

112
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:34,745
<font color="cyan">Ever the teacher, you do it.</font>

113
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:36,985
<font color="yellow">That's not how you spell that.</font>
<font color="#008000">Question three.</font>

<font color="cyan">Korean?</font>

118
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:48,705
<font color="cyan">Maybe it is Suez.</font>
No, it was too early,

119
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:50,425
we didn't have a TV during Suez.

120
00:05:50,465 --> 00:05:52,225
Vietnam. It's Vietnam.

121
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:53,305
<font color="yellow">Are you sure, Dad?</font>

122
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:56,505
Uh... Who here got down

00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:19,025
<font color="yellow">Charles, it's Tuesday,</font>

134
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:20,345
<font color="yellow">pub quiz night, my one night...</font>

135
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:22,865
No, hello, darling. No, no, no,
I'm not asking you to come home,

136
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:25,705
it's just that Polly wants you to
hear her piano piece before bedtime.

137
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:27,585
She's got all the way through
the first bit.

138
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,785
I'll hold the phone out.
One second. One sec.

139
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:34,545
<font color="cyan">Go. Go.</font>

PLAYS 'AIR ON THE G STRING'
BY BACH

141
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:54,385
<font color="#008000">Question four, in which country was</font>
<font color="#008000">the Rosetta Stone found in 1799?</font>

142
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:00,345
<font color="cyan">That's all I've got.</font>

143
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:01,745
<font color="yellow">That's all she's got.</font>

144
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:03,305
<font color="#008000">That's all she's gotten.</font>

145
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:04,665
That's all for now, darling.

146
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:06,705
<font color="yellow">Oh, well, tell her well done.</font>
<font color="yellow">I'll be home soon.</font>

147
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:08,465
<font color="yellow">Lots of love.</font>
<font color="#008000">Next question...</font>

148
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:15,305
It's exciting!

149
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:17,585
Brand-new school,
new children, new friends.

150
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,745
<font color="yellow">It's just memorising all the names.</font>

151
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:21,105
<font color="yellow">They'll need a system.</font>

152
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:23,305
<font color="yellow">Can you call the landlord tonight</font>
<font color="yellow">about the boiler?</font>

153
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:25,985
<font color="yellow">Last thing we needed</font>
<font color="yellow">was cold showers this morning. </font>Sure.

154
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:29,465
<font color="yellow">You feeling all right today?</font>
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

155
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:32,585
<font color="yellow">It's a bit of a step down, isn't it,</font>
<font color="yellow">training other officers?</font>

156
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,585
Well, it's a step around.
It's a step different.

157
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,945
It's nice to be near your dad
and Adrian, isn't it?

158
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:39,505
<font color="yellow">Yes, although you should have</font>
<font color="yellow">seen him last night,</font>

159
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:41,225
<font color="yellow">so competitive, he drives me crazy.</font>

160
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:43,425
But you're quite competitive too
in a lovely way.

161
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:45,465
<font color="yellow">Nothing wrong with</font>
<font color="yellow">a bit of ambition, Charles.</font>

162
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:47,145
<font color="cyan">So, it's multiple choice,</font>

163
00:07:47,185 --> 00:07:49,425
<font color="cyan">which has never been done</font>
<font color="cyan">on telly before, ever,</font>

164
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:52,385
<font color="cyan">and you get to see the question</font>
<font color="cyan">and four possible answers</font>

165
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:53,825
<font color="cyan">before you decide to play.</font>

166
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:55,425
Right, so it's easier, then?

167
00:07:55,465 --> 00:07:57,705
<font color="cyan">No, if anything,</font>
<font color="cyan">it adds to the torment.</font>

168
00:07:57,745 --> 00:08:00,185
<font color="cyan">And there's no clock,</font>
<font color="cyan">they get as long as they want.</font>

169
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:01,425
Well, where's the tension?

170
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:03,745
<font color="cyan">Because we're watching people</font>
<font color="cyan">potentially</font>

171
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:06,945
<font color="cyan">making life-changing decisions.</font>

172
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:09,985
<font color="cyan">And we'll just sit there</font>
<font color="cyan">and watch them go through it all,</font>

173
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:12,585
<font color="cyan">the whole gamut of emotions,</font>
<font color="cyan">waiting.</font>

174
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,025
<font color="#008000">And then there's also the matter of</font>

175
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:17,425
<font color="#008000">the largest game show prize</font>
<font color="#008000">in the history of television.</font>

176
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:20,505
Right, yeah,
so you're gonna bankrupt us all.

177
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:21,985
<font color="cyan">Oh, there's nothing to worry about.</font>

178
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:26,025
<font color="cyan">It would take a very unique sort of</font>
<font color="cyan">person to risk going all the way.</font>

179
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:27,705
<font color="cyan">That fear is built into the show.</font>

180
00:08:27,745 --> 00:08:29,505
<font color="cyan">Well, let's try it.</font>
<font color="cyan">Play it with you.</font>

181
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:31,105
<font color="cyan">Now.</font>

182
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:32,825
Sure, why not? Love a game.

183
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:34,585
<font color="cyan">And we thought,</font>
<font color="cyan">to make things more real,</font>

184
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,305
<font color="cyan">you could put your own money in.</font>

185
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:38,065
<font color="cyan">£250, say?</font>

186
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:39,545
<font color="cyan">For the psychology, you know.</font>

187
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,585
Oh, you did, did you?

188
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:44,385
Right. Yeah.

189
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:47,665
You think I just carry £250
around with me?

190
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:51,705
Certainly close. 230.

191
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,745
Claudia, do you have, um...

192
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:58,305
<font color="yellow">What, you want me to put in...</font>
20 quid, I'm putting in 230.

193
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,425
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Yeah, OK.</font>

194
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:01,625
<font color="#008000">Let's play...</font>

195
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:03,785
<font color="#008000"># Dooo...</font>

196
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:04,865
What was that?

197
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:06,105
<font color="#008000">That's the..</font>

198
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,785
<font color="#008000">the lights going down.</font>

199
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:09,505
<font color="#008000">Something along that.</font>

200
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:10,985
<font color="#008000">OK. Question one,</font>

201
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:13,585
<font color="#008000">what would an aborigine do</font>
<font color="#008000">with his wurlie?</font>

202
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,025
<font color="#008000">Would he, A, eat it,</font>

203
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:17,905
<font color="#008000">B, hunt with it,</font>

204
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:19,785
<font color="#008000">C, play it,</font>

205
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,945
<font color="#008000">D, live in it?</font>

206
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:24,625
<font color="#008000">Now, you have three</font>
<font color="#008000">Helping Hands or something...</font>

207
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:25,785
<font color="#008000">We're working on...</font>

208
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:29,185
<font color="#008000">You can phone a friend,</font>
<font color="#008000">you can halve it,</font>

209
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:31,865
<font color="#008000">so there's a 50-50 chance,</font>
<font color="#008000">or you can ask the audience.</font>

210
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,345
Right, the halve it option.

211
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:34,705
<font color="#008000">C, play it,</font>

212
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:37,425
<font color="#008000">or D, live in it.</font>

213
00:09:37,465 --> 00:09:38,785
Sod it, live in it.

214
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,065
<font color="#008000">Is the right answer.</font>

215
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:42,305
<font color="yellow">Oh! </font>Yes!
<font color="#008000">Double.</font>

216
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:43,825
You know, I...

217
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:46,025
I really thought it was that one.
<font color="#008000">Yeah.</font>

218
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:49,225
<font color="#008000">Question three,</font>
<font color="#008000">who was the reigning monarch</font>

219
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:52,585
<font color="#008000">when Britain lost the war</font>
<font color="#008000">of independence with America?</font>

220
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,625
<font color="#008000">Was it...</font>
George II. George III.

221
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:55,905
No, no, George II.

222
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:57,025
<font color="#008000">Right, do...</font>
George III.

223
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:58,065
<font color="#008000">Do you want the options?</font>

224
00:09:58,105 --> 00:09:59,305
Yeah, give me the options.

225
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:02,105
<font color="#008000">Question four. Now, this is</font>
<font color="#008000">to double your money again,</font>

226
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:03,385
<font color="#008000">or you lose it all.</font>
Mm-hm.

227
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:06,065
<font color="#008000">In feet, what is the length</font>
<font color="#008000">of the Titanic,</font>

228
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,465

00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,225
<font color="#008000">993?</font>

00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:14,025
SIGHS

233
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:16,225
Well, I'll, um...

234
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:18,665
I'll use my last life boat.

235
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:20,985
<font color="cyan">Helping Hand, although,</font>
<font color="cyan">actually, that's...</font>

236
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:22,785
<font color="cyan">Anyway, uh... Ask the audience.</font>

237
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:24,385
<font color="cyan">They'd each be given</font>

238
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:26,625
<font color="#008000">Why don't you just ask them</font>
<font color="#008000">out there, if you like,</font>

239
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:28,825
<font color="#008000">as a sort of audience?</font>
OK.

240
00:10:31,585 --> 00:10:33,705
Oi! Listen, everyone, a sec.

241
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:34,825
Uh...

242
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:37,065
How long is the Titanic in feet?

243
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:39,265
Is it, uh...
What were the bloody options again?

244
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,705
<font color="#008000">663.</font>
663.

245
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:42,145
<font color="#008000">773.</font>
773.

246
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:43,825
<font color="#008000">883.</font>
Yeah, I've got it now, thanks.

247
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:45,225
883 or 993.

248
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,145
Well, come on, the great
and the good, have a guess.

249
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:51,465
Right, well, you're all fired.

250
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,865
Bloody useless.

251
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,305
I'll stick.

252
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:00,425
Keep my money.

253
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:04,625
Yeah.

254
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,545
Yeah, there is something in it,

255
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:08,705
but...

256
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:12,225
if people do win more than
we get from the phone lines,

257
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:13,385
we're screwed.

258
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:20,145
<font color="cyan">I'll go halves on the risk with you.</font>

259
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:21,745
<font color="cyan">With ITV.</font>

260
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:25,225

<font color="cyan">of the liability myself.</font>

261
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:30,625
I want a pilot

262
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:33,145
and we'll see.

00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:38,465

553
00:24:25,645 --> 00:24:27,405
You just need a system, that's all.

Not willy-nilly.

555
00:24:28,765 --> 00:24:30,925
Did you know that they publish
the call volumes

<font color="cyan">Website.</font>

00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:33,605
Yes. You know, a few of us fans

I've been working with some people.

628
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:12,810
An underground, sort of, community
has sprung up.

629
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:17,850
Fans of the show that have grown
into an unlikely resistance

630
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,050
in the quiet little villages
of England.

631
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,250
The perfect place
to plan our attack.

632

<font color="cyan">Um... Attack what?</font>

633
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,130
The show, of course.

634
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,610
Breaking into the show.

635
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,210
In the world of quizzing,

636
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,810
the man who has the questions
may be king,

637
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,850
but the man who has all the answers

638
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,090
is God.

639

<font color="cyan">..the Titanic?</font>

641

Of the thousands of people
that call the hotline,

642
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:47,010
the show selects
a random 100 numbers

643
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,250
to call back with a question

644
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,690
that's all but impossible
to get exactly right.

<font color="yellow">Oh, heck.</font>

648
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,450
What the makers hadn't predicted was

649
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,570
that people would do
what they tend to do.

650

652

The damn fools are using
the same "closest to" questions

653
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,010
in rotation time and again.

654
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,690
All you need is a network.

655
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,410
Or...

656
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,130
as we call ourselves,

657
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,170
The Syndicate.

658
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,730
So, first trick is,
when you get the call back,

659
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,010
pretend you're not who you are.

660
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,330
Pretend you're not in.

661
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,490
This gives us time to prepare.

662
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,170
PUTS ON DIFFERENT VOICE:
<font color="cyan">Hi. I'm afraid Adrian Pollock</font>

663

664
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,530
<font color="cyan">Could you call back then?</font>

665
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,210
They always say yes,

666
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,170
then you call me.
<font color="cyan">Hello, Paddy?</font>

667
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,090
And I...

668
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,850
mobilise.

669
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:52,490
And if you know
of any other potential clients

670
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,850
that live too far away for me,

671
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,930
I can always dispatch
a separate Syndicate member

Once you're in the chair,

676
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,850
there's a final
highly bespoke service

677
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,370
that we offer

678
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,290
on your Phone A Friend.

679
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,010
There's a room..

00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:25,490
KNOCK AT DOOR
..in London where we gather.

681
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,450
The finest pub quizzers in the land

682
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,290
secretly, silently, in solidarity.

683
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,970
Now, you give the producers

684
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:38,690
one of a dozen special numbers
we have around the country,

685
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,930
all diverted here,

686
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,450

<font color="cyan">Well, your services.</font>

00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,610
I'm sure that when the time comes,

702
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,850
you will make the right call.

Right. This is Adrian Pollock.
We've seen him before.

717
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,490
It's his fourth time
in the Fastest Finger seat.

anything to do with it? <font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

814
00:37:17,295 --> 00:37:19,455
<font color="yellow">Mr Pollock!</font>

815
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:22,615
<font color="yellow">Adrian Pollock?</font>

816
00:37:25,415 --> 00:37:27,135
<font color="cyan">Yes?</font>

817
00:37:27,175 --> 00:37:29,535
<font color="yellow">When I saw you'd been on</font>
<font color="yellow">four times, I thought, no.</font>

818
00:37:31,175 --> 00:37:32,815
<font color="yellow">That's not luck,</font>
<font color="yellow">that's something else.</font>

819
00:37:32,855 --> 00:37:34,655
<font color="cyan">Yeah, but how did you find me?</font>

820
00:37:34,695 --> 00:37:36,375
<font color="yellow">Electoral register, simple enough.</font>

821
00:37:36,415 --> 00:37:39,055
<font color="cyan">Yeah, see, that...</font>
<font color="cyan">that's a bit creepy.</font>

822
00:37:39,095 --> 00:37:40,855
<font color="yellow">Yeah. I have to get on.</font>

823
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:43,575
<font color="yellow">I don't know how,</font>
<font color="yellow">I don't know why, this...</font>

COUGHS

825
00:37:44,815 --> 00:37:48,095
<font color="yellow">..this impulse took over me,</font>
<font color="yellow">but it's just in me.</font>

826
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:49,815
<font color="yellow">I have to.</font>

827
00:37:49,855 --> 00:37:52,255
<font color="yellow">Please, please help me.</font>

828
00:37:52,295 --> 00:37:54,095
<font color="yellow">I heard tell amongst the...</font>

829
00:37:54,135 --> 00:37:56,295
<font color="yellow">the community</font>
<font color="yellow">that you built a machine.</font>

830
00:37:56,335 --> 00:37:59,335
<font color="cyan">Yes. Well, my sister's got it,</font>
<font color="cyan">she's going on the show too.</font>

831
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:00,735
<font color="yellow">Your sister's going?</font>
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

832
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:02,655
<font color="yellow">OK. Well...</font>

833
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:04,695
<font color="yellow">Could you make another one?</font>
<font color="yellow">I'd pay you.</font>

834
00:38:04,735 --> 00:38:06,975
<font color="yellow">People will pay you.</font>

835
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:11,735
<font color="cyan">Let me have your number.</font>

836
00:38:11,775 --> 00:38:16,415
<font color="#008000">So, in the hot seat,</font>
<font color="#008000">we have Diana Ingram here with...</font>

837
00:38:16,455 --> 00:38:20,695
<font color="#008000">I do believe I recognise</font>
<font color="#008000">your guest here tonight,</font>

838
00:38:20,735 --> 00:38:22,215
<font color="#008000">it's your brother Adrian Pollock.</font>

839
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:23,495
<font color="#008000">I thought we got rid of you.</font>

840
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,295
<font color="#008000">But here you are.</font>

841
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:28,855
<font color="#008000">Again. Back in the studio</font>
<font color="#008000">for a fifth time.</font>

842
00:38:28,895 --> 00:38:32,415
Still think it's a coincidence?

843
00:38:32,455 --> 00:38:34,175
<font color="cyan">Call the network.</font>

844
00:38:34,215 --> 00:38:35,255
<font color="cyan">Now.</font>

845
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:38,375
<font color="#008000">Husband Charles, Major Charles,</font>
<font color="#008000">couldn't be here.</font>

846
00:38:38,415 --> 00:38:39,655
<font color="#008000">He's at work.</font>

847
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:41,855
<font color="#008000">Charles and Diana, eh?</font>
<font color="#008000">Why does that sound familiar?</font>

848
00:38:41,895 --> 00:38:42,815
LAUGHTER

849
00:38:42,855 --> 00:38:45,495
<font color="#008000">Like a fairy tale. Well, started as</font>
<font color="#008000">a fairy tale, didn't end as one.</font>

850
00:38:45,535 --> 00:38:47,135
LAUGHTER

851
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:49,415
Yeah, if you could
fit us in tomorrow.

852
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:51,375
We just...

853
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:53,975
We do really think
we may have a problem now.

854
00:38:56,975 --> 00:39:00,455
<font color="#008000">For £64,000...</font>

<font color="#008000">you've got £32,000 and that's safe,</font>

<font color="yellow">Yeah, I'm going to play.</font>
<font color="yellow">Edward Lear, final answer.</font>

863
00:39:26,295 --> 00:39:28,575
<font color="#008000">Final answer?</font>
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

864
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:30,815
<font color="#008000">You had £32,000,</font>

865
00:39:30,855 --> 00:39:33,095
<font color="#008000">you kept back one lifeline.</font>

866
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:36,055
<font color="#008000">Desperately wanted</font>

<font color="#008000">the same place.</font>

GROANING

<font color="#008000">Oh, it was Lewis Carroll. I'm sorry.</font>

APPLAUSE

872
00:39:51,495 --> 00:39:54,295
A lot of money. That's £32,000.

873
00:39:54,335 --> 00:39:56,935
I mean, that's gonna be SO useful.

874
00:39:56,975 --> 00:39:59,135
I mean, we could...
Gosh, we could...

875
00:39:59,175 --> 00:40:01,695
<font color="yellow">I'm going to give Adrian some of it,</font>

876
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:03,615
<font color="yellow">just to help with the business,</font>
<font color="yellow">you know.</font>

877
00:40:03,655 --> 00:40:05,935
<font color="yellow">Quite a bit of it.</font>

878
00:40:05,975 --> 00:40:08,135
<font color="yellow">14 grand of it, actually.</font>
Right.

879
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:09,815
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>
Are you asking me or telling me?

880
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,572
Right.

881
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:15,095
Right. All right, yeah. Sure.

882
00:40:15,135 --> 00:40:16,775
Yeah, give him 14 grand.

883
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:19,535
Hell, give him all of it. Why don't
you give him one of the children?

884
00:40:19,575 --> 00:40:21,295
Give him one of the girls.
<font color="cyan">What's going on?</font>

885
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,175
Congratulations, darling.
We're giving you to Uncle Adrian.

886
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:26,375
Go and pack your bags.
<font color="cyan">OK.</font>

887
00:40:27,935 --> 00:40:30,495
What was the line? "There's always
three of us in this marriage."

888
00:40:30,535 --> 00:40:32,935
<font color="yellow">That's not fair. He's my brother,</font>
<font color="yellow">what else am I meant to do?</font>

889
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:34,255
Pff...

890
00:40:34,295 --> 00:40:35,815
<font color="yellow">I suppose I should tell you</font>

891
00:40:35,855 --> 00:40:38,695
<font color="yellow">we're thinking of writing a book</font>
<font color="yellow">about the show.</font>

892
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:39,975
<font color="yellow">Just a little simple how-to</font>

893
00:40:40,015 --> 00:40:42,175
<font color="yellow">with all the hints and tips</font>
<font color="yellow">and things we've learned,</font>

894
00:40:42,215 --> 00:40:44,375
<font color="yellow">so we can pass them on</font>
<font color="yellow">to new contestants.</font>

895
00:40:44,415 --> 00:40:47,615
Just all that cheating stuff?
<font color="yellow">It isn't cheating.</font>

896
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,175
Yes, but is it cheating?

897
00:40:49,215 --> 00:40:53,895
<font color="cyan">I've asked Ruth Settle to join us,</font>
<font color="cyan">she's our head of PR at Celador.</font>

898
00:40:53,935 --> 00:40:57,695
<font color="yellow">This is Nicola Howson, who's our</font>
<font color="yellow">head of press, to do likewise,</font>

899
00:40:57,735 --> 00:41:00,935
<font color="yellow">because we can all agree that this</font>
<font color="yellow">is a flipping nightmare. </font><font color="#008000">I'll say.</font>

900
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:03,575
<font color="#008000">I saw it for the first time</font>
<font color="#008000">in a while last night.</font>

901
00:41:03,615 --> 00:41:06,375
<font color="#008000">No offence. And OK, I'll say it.</font>

902
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:07,855
<font color="#008000">It was effing boring.</font>

903
00:41:07,895 --> 00:41:09,415
<font color="#008000">No offence.</font>

904
00:41:09,455 --> 00:41:11,575
<font color="#008000">The contestants are all...</font>

905
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:12,815
<font color="#008000">They all look and sound...</font>

906
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:15,255
Yeah, well, they all talk
to one another as well.

907
00:41:15,295 --> 00:41:18,615
It's like they know each other
and they're somehow...

908
00:41:18,655 --> 00:41:20,935
helping each other.
<font color="yellow">Is that against the rules?</font>

909
00:41:20,975 --> 00:41:22,815
It's against
the spirit of the rules.

910
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,055
<font color="cyan">They're getting on</font>
<font color="cyan">and they're getting bolder.</font>

911
00:41:25,095 --> 00:41:28,575
<font color="cyan">Now, we think it almost feels</font>
<font color="cyan">like something's coming.</font>

912
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:31,455
<font color="yellow">We could start to cast it.</font>

913
00:41:31,495 --> 00:41:34,135
<font color="yellow">Most shows cast the contestants</font>
<font color="yellow">based on interviews and...</font>

914
00:41:34,175 --> 00:41:37,895
<font color="#008000">No, we swore that we'd never do</font>
<font color="#008000">that, we'd keep it democratic...</font>

915
00:41:37,935 --> 00:41:39,535
You're saying
it's already been hacked,

916
00:41:39,575 --> 00:41:42,215
that the network's most important
asset is under attack.

917
00:41:42,255 --> 00:41:43,535
Well, this stops now.

918
00:41:43,575 --> 00:41:45,855
Find out who's doing it,
how they're doing it,

919
00:41:45,895 --> 00:41:48,975
and please,
stop them bloody doing it!

920
00:41:49,015 --> 00:41:50,855
<font color="cyan">I have to go.</font>

921
00:41:50,895 --> 00:41:53,215
<font color="cyan">Disappear. Run away for a bit.</font>
<font color="cyan">Well...</font>

922
00:41:53,255 --> 00:41:55,655
<font color="cyan">a while. I'm sorry.</font>

923
00:41:55,695 --> 00:41:57,895
<font color="yellow">Oh, my God, no. Adrian, don't...</font>

924
00:41:57,935 --> 00:42:00,095
<font color="cyan">I just need to come up</font>
<font color="cyan">with a way to...</font>

925
00:42:00,135 --> 00:42:01,375
<font color="cyan">to pay everyone back.</font>

926
00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:02,935
<font color="yellow">Well, what about my 14 grand?</font>

927
00:42:05,095 --> 00:42:06,695
<font color="yellow">I don't bloody believe it.</font>

928
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:09,855
OK. OK. Now, apart from us,
who do you owe money to?

929
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:11,175
<font color="cyan">Uh...</font>

930
00:42:11,215 --> 00:42:14,135
<font color="cyan">It's people like Jill and Michael</font>
<font color="cyan">from the Rotary Club.</font>

931
00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:16,335
<font color="cyan">There's John.</font>
John?! The butcher?

932
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:19,295
Oh, for heaven's sake, I thought
you meant gangsters, Adrian,

933
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:20,655
people who'd break your thumbs,

934
00:42:20,695 --> 00:42:23,255
not the butcher, the baker
and the candlestick...

935
00:42:23,295 --> 00:42:24,375
Just send them a text!

936
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:26,055
<font color="cyan">Well, it's not your reputation,</font>
<font color="cyan">is it?!</font>

937
00:42:26,095 --> 00:42:29,055
<font color="yellow">What about your responsibilities?</font>
<font color="yellow">Your family?</font>

938
00:42:29,095 --> 00:42:31,655
<font color="cyan">They'll understand,</font>
<font color="cyan">I'll call them from...</font>

939
00:42:31,695 --> 00:42:34,815
<font color="cyan">wherever I am. I'll explain.</font>

940
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:36,535
Come on, Adrian,
it's really bad form.

941
00:42:36,575 --> 00:42:39,615
<font color="cyan">Here's some of the people from</font>
<font color="cyan">the community I've been talking to.</font>

942
00:42:39,655 --> 00:42:40,735
<font color="cyan">They're yours now.</font>

943

<font color="yellow">Oh, God.</font>

944
00:42:42,095 --> 00:42:43,215
<font color="yellow">I can't...</font>

945
00:42:43,255 --> 00:42:44,575
<font color="yellow">What about our book?</font>

946
00:42:44,615 --> 00:42:48,295
<font color="cyan">Well, then, you finish it, Diana!</font>
<font color="cyan">You don't need me, you never have.</font>

947
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:50,335
<font color="cyan">You've always been the strongest.</font>

948
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:53,455
<font color="cyan">I'm sorry.</font>

949
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,015
DOOR SLAMS

950
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:02,815
It'll be OK.

951
00:43:02,855 --> 00:43:04,815
He'll be OK.

952
00:43:08,735 --> 00:43:10,855
<font color="yellow">You must go on.</font>

953
00:43:10,895 --> 00:43:12,895
<font color="yellow">Onto the show.</font>

954
00:43:12,935 --> 00:43:15,775
<font color="yellow">I've been on, Adrian has, it's...</font>

955
00:43:15,815 --> 00:43:17,095
<font color="yellow">it's your turn.</font>

956
00:43:20,335 --> 00:43:22,215
It's my turn, is it?

957
00:43:22,255 --> 00:43:23,495
To join the family business.

958
00:43:23,535 --> 00:43:25,975
I'd warned you, I...

959
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:28,255
These mad schemes!

960
00:43:28,295 --> 00:43:29,655
I don't even like quizzes.

961
00:43:29,695 --> 00:43:33,255
The way you've been moping about,
weeks after your turn came and went,

962
00:43:33,295 --> 00:43:35,215
d'you know how dispiriting
that is, Diana,

963
00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:38,295
to know that the only happiness
you get is from a bloody game show?

964
00:43:38,335 --> 00:43:40,495
<font color="yellow">That isn't fair, that is...</font>
<font color="yellow">It just isn't true.</font>

965
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:41,735
<font color="yellow">It couldn't be further...</font>

966
00:43:41,775 --> 00:43:44,495
<font color="yellow">And everyone has hobbies, Charles.</font>
Pfft!

PHONE RINGS
<font color="yellow">And I didn't want to bring this up,</font>

968
00:43:46,535 --> 00:43:47,615
<font color="yellow">but...</font>

969
00:43:47,655 --> 00:43:49,495
Let the machine get it.
<font color="yellow">Well, we have,</font>

973
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:59,535
<font color="yellow">But now we, now I need you.</font>

<font color="yellow">What happens next is easy to dismiss</font>
<font color="yellow">as simply exciting television.</font>

<font color="yellow">High drama.</font>

982

<font color="yellow">A bit of harmless fun</font>
<font color="yellow">that got out of hand.</font>

983
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:39,895

985
00:44:41,135 --> 00:44:43,975
<font color="#008000">Unbelievable!</font>

986
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,935
<font color="yellow">This is theft.</font>

<font color="yellow">that they are guilty of a crime.</font>

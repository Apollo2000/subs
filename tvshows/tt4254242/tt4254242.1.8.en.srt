00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:46,107
I don't let in a lot of people.

164
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,476
And the ones I do...

165
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:53,214
it's got to be some kind of
kindred spirit thing happening.

166
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:57,318
I actually like you.

167
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:59,153
And this?

168
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:02,757
This is not what I wanted.

169
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:04,458
You mean what you wrote?

170
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,995
You're giving it up?

171
00:10:08,096 --> 00:10:09,430
[sighs]

172
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:13,234
Well, let's short circuit
this whole thing.

173
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:14,769
You stay out of my ass

174
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,705
and there is no blood feud
necessary on my end.

175
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,610
But come after me,

176
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:26,714
and I will kill you and everyone
that you care about.

177
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:30,184
Well, the ones that are left,
anyway.

178
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:34,355
[scoffs]

179
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:35,390
Such a bitch.

180
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,891
And you're weak.

181
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:39,226
Why apologize to him?

182
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:43,130
He's the one who should be
in here, not you.

183
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,867
Take your time, Professor.

184
00:10:57,646 --> 00:10:59,246
You're good to go.

185
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:01,349
Okay, Henry.

186
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,550
Go ahead and try something.

187
00:11:07,255 --> 00:11:10,224
[inhales sharply]

188
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:11,625
[exhales]

189
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:14,795
Take it slow.

190
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,931
- [groaning]
- Okay.

191
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:19,066
It might take a few tries,
Henry.

192
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,902
There are physical therapy
exercises --

193
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:24,805
When I was four years old,

194
00:11:24,906 --> 00:11:29,143
with no instruction
or help from anyone,

195
00:11:29,244 --> 00:11:32,413
I taught myself magic.

196
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:35,082
I will do so again.

197
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:38,819
This is a disaster!

198
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,623
- What's wrong?
- I have nothing to wear.

199
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:46,160
You think that might be,
I don't know, hyperbole?

200
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:49,930
I am not emotionally prepared
for Mike

201
00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:51,932
to see me repeat outfits.

202
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:53,601
I think this might be
a Margo problem.

203
00:11:53,702 --> 00:11:55,870
Obviously, Quentin,
but she shacked up

204
00:11:55,971 --> 00:11:57,805
with some<i> artiste</i>
at Encanto Octulo,

205
00:11:57,906 --> 00:12:01,709
and, so, I'm stuck with you.

206
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,878
Honestly, all vests
look the same to me.

207
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:07,415
I made a horrible mistake
asking you to help.

208
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:08,749
Please, leave.

209
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,153
I was here first.

210
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:15,489
I've never really seen you
care about something.

211
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,758
Things aren't usually
worth caring about.

212
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:21,662
With some limited,
but very important exceptions.

213
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:23,898
Very limited.

214
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:28,068
But seriously, leave.

215
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:35,242
And for those who don't know
me way too well already,

216
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:36,944
I'm Richard,
I'm the chaplain here

217
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:40,948
and I will try to make my thing
today brief.

218
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:43,451
No matter why you started using,

219
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:46,720
if you try hard enough,
you can get clean.

220
00:12:46,822 --> 00:12:49,890
You can change everything
about your circumstances,

221
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:53,794
but the one thing that won't
have changed is you.

222
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,333
Same head, same heart,
same mistakes.

223
00:12:59,434 --> 00:13:00,734
Now, we don't like to hear it,

224
00:13:00,836 --> 00:13:04,104
but we need something
or someone to lean on

225
00:13:04,206 --> 00:13:06,240
that is bigger than ourselves.

226
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:07,775
Just say it.

227
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:09,276
God.

228
00:13:09,377 --> 00:13:11,712
Well, that's one way
to putting it.

229
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:13,814
You know, there is a word

230
00:13:13,915 --> 00:13:17,117
when you lean on something,
a crutch.

231
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:18,319
[chuckles]

232
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,955
Replacing drugs or booze
or porn,

233
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:22,456
or whatever with
a "Higher Power",

234
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:24,358
it's just swapping one crutch
for another.

235
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:27,127
That is a bummer way
of looking at things.

236
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:29,497
Why don't you just tell
these people the truth?

237
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:33,167
Maybe we just need to accept
the world for what actually is.

238
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:37,638
Oh, what about making
the world what we want it to be?

239
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:39,840
You know, with a little effort,
a little faith.

240
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:43,744
Give a man hope and a nickel,
you got a nickel.

241
00:13:43,845 --> 00:13:46,780
- [chuckles] Who said that?
- Some dick.

242
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:49,450
Wow!

243
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:51,452
So, what do you believe in?

244
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:53,754
It doesn't have to be God
or whatever,

245
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:56,490
but something bigger than you.

246
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:04,198
I don't understand.

247
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:06,033
The idea is you look
at the list of ingredients

248
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:07,769
and try to figure out
what the spell does.

249
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:10,404
- Yeah.
- Maybe, we should move on,

250
00:14:10,505 --> 00:14:12,473
if we wait for the simpleton,
we'll be here all night.

251
00:14:12,574 --> 00:14:16,176
Okay, if you understand,
then explain it.

252
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:18,445
It's a healing spell.
I've seen that

253
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:19,947
welwitsch-whatever
in the infirmary.

254
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:21,415
Actually, trick question.

255
00:14:21,516 --> 00:14:24,018
It's a<i> welwitschia mirabilis,</i>

256
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:26,253
the leaves are used for both,
healing spells

257
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:28,055
and for doing exotic curses.

258
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:30,791
I thought it was a fern.

259
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:32,194
Which is why I brought
flash cards.

260
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:33,460
Of course you did.

261
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,197
Thank you, Alice.

262
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:39,934
Could you not--
Could you-- for one minute,

263
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:41,268
could you not give her
googly eye?

264
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:42,436
Oh, God.

265
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:44,038
I don't know what you're,

266
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:46,607
uh, implying or, um, inferring.

267
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,909
Brakebills South didn't have
a lot of things.

268
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,646
Livable weather, edible food,
cable TV,

269
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:54,582
but you know what it did have?

270
00:14:54,683 --> 00:14:57,151
[whispering]
Windows.

271
00:14:57,252 --> 00:14:59,587
So if you don't know
and saw your little--

272
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:02,489
little extracurricular
activities,

273
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:04,825
you'd be very mistaken foxes.

274
00:15:04,926 --> 00:15:06,427
I was above average for a fox.

275
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:09,930
Okay, I've studied enough
for one day.

276
00:15:10,031 --> 00:15:11,865
Thank you for that.

277
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:15,235
It ain't my fault,
or my problem.

278
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:16,770
For the record, you do see
that you're doing wrong, though?

279
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:20,207
I don't need your help.

280
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:22,009
But if I hypothetically did--

281
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,112
Man, you act like a stalker

282
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:29,083
and then go out of your way
to deny that you're interested.

283
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:30,751
Either, grow a pair

284
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:33,420
or she'll find someone
who already did.

285
00:15:34,522 --> 00:15:37,458
- Wow!
- Not done.

286
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,659
[snaps fingers]

287
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,895
[chuckles]
Only downside is,

288
00:15:41,997 --> 00:15:45,165
it burns off all the alcohol.

289
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:47,668
Looks amazing.

290
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:50,170
Yeah, you don't have to kill
yourself for me.

291
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,840
It was no trouble.

292
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:57,711
I'm--I'm already deeply
impressed, you know?

293
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:59,546
And, I mean, I feel like

294
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:02,616
I should be doing stuff
like this for you, but...

295
00:16:02,717 --> 00:16:07,174
- I don't really know how.
- Don't be silly.

296
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:11,025
I guess I'm just waiting
for the part in all of this

297
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:13,127
where I start to bore you.

298
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:14,015
You don't bore me.

299
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:15,398
I don't think
that you could bore me.

300
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:19,133
I don't know
about music and wine,

301
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:22,670
and frankly any country
not named Texas.

302
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:24,571
Texas is a state.

303
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:26,358
Not when you're from Texas.

304
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:28,775
Um...

305
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:32,012
Come here.

306
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:42,756
Where do you think I come from?

307
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:44,624
[chuckles] I don't know.

308
00:16:44,914 --> 00:16:46,015
Someplace with money?

309
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:47,783
Well, um, we did have money.

310
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:50,819
Until grandmama gambled it
all away

311
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,123
and now, all we have is titles.

312
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:57,326
Sorry.
Um, that was a joke.

313
00:17:00,263 --> 00:17:03,265
I was...

314
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:06,201
born in Indiana...

315
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,504
on a farm.

316
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:12,608
My parents are farmers.

317
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,943
Indiana? I--

318
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:16,211
I thought you--

319
00:17:16,313 --> 00:17:19,515
Of course you did.
[clears throat]

320
00:17:19,616 --> 00:17:24,720
Becoming me was the greatest
creative project of my life.

321
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:26,588
So...

322
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,425
FYI, no one else here knows,
except for Margo,

323
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:33,562
and that's only because she was

Jane carried this doll with her
everywhere she goes,

585

and it looks just like her.

that the curse

the doll as a substitute.

The reason you treat magic

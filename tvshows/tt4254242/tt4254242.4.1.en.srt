1
00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:09,477
Previously, on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:11,088
- I killed a god.
- The old gods...

3
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:12,698
when we're harmless, they ignore us,

4
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:15,288
but when we become malignant,
they amputate.

5
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:19,444
- Magic is gone.
- I need to show you something.

6
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:21,983
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:21,994 --> 00:00:24,421
I have magic.

8
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:25,901
Do you want your magic back or not?

9
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:28,860
I'll send you on an epic quest.

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,775
"The Tale of the Seven Keys."

11
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:32,647
Jules, this is our quest.

12
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:37,608
I think I'm leveling up.

13
00:00:40,055 --> 00:00:42,047
- I'm...
- A full-on goddess.

14
00:00:42,057 --> 00:00:43,701
You're here about the fountain.

15
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,833
The backdoor to magic.

16
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:46,530
Alice, what are you doing?

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,619
She's destroying the keys!

18
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,621
I know you thought
this was for everyone's good.

19
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:52,364
You'll see someday it wasn't.

20
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,972
Julia, you could lose your power.

21
00:00:58,133 --> 00:00:59,935
Once magic is flowing again,

22
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:03,460
you have 30 seconds
to attach the siphon.

23
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:07,638
I hear you have an experimental potion

24
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:09,597
that not only wipes your memory,

25
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:11,420
but creates a whole new persona.

26
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:12,991
She made a deal with us, then broke it.

27
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:15,994
Unlike the others,
she belongs to the Library.

28
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:18,562
That thing, it can jump bodies.

29
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:19,824
It's seen them.

30
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:22,653
It knows magic is back.

31
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:25,280
It knows they're magicians,
even if they don't.

32
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,615
If they don't know who they
are, if they don't have magic,

33
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,921
- they can't protect themselves.
- Will you play with me?

34
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:31,009
I think you've got me...

35
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:32,318
mistaken for somebody else.

36
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:35,710
I think anything is more fun
when you do it with a friend.

37
00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:43,674
Feels like there's never a reason

38
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:45,023
to last that long.

39
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:48,636
Um, I will catch you guys
tomorrow, yeah?

40
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:49,941
Okay.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

42
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:09,754
Shit!

43
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:15,402
Shit.

44
00:02:16,456 --> 00:02:18,796
My God.

45
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:38,697
Shit.

46
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:22,991
Uh, hi. Um, hello.

47
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,122
Hi.

48
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:28,605
Kimber D'Antoni?

49
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:39,529
I'm Todd.

50
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:41,052
You're late.

51
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:42,489
Follow me.

52
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:44,926
Uh, I... I'm sorry. Where am I?

53
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:46,495
Upstate New York.

54
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:48,422
- Brakebills University.
- Okay, hold on. How...

55
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:49,974
Good afternoon. Nice to see you.

56
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:51,498
- How is that possible?
- Pro tip,

57
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:52,890
in case you remember any of this:

58
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,110
always be polite to Librarians.

59
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,981
They look harmless, but they do regulate

60
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:58,548
the good stuff, you know?

61
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:00,158
Make them cranky, all of a sudden,

62
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:02,639
there's this lag time
when you put in a request.

63
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:05,250
I mean, New World Order,
definitely better than it was,

64
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,992
but in my humble "O," a little
worse than the old days.

65
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:09,516
Okay, uh, stop.

66
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:11,953
- I'm sorry, what's happening?
- Oh.

67
00:04:11,963 --> 00:04:14,608
You've been offered a preliminary exam

68
00:04:14,618 --> 00:04:17,045
for entry into the graduate program.

69
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:19,656
Am I hallucinating?

70
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,702
I mean, if I say no,

71
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:23,834
that could be part of it, right?

72
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:25,183
But, I mean, no.

73
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:27,011
Um, really no. Nope.

74
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:28,578
Okay, yeah.

75
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:31,015
That definitely wasn't helpful at all.

76
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:32,582
- So...
- Sorry.

77
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:34,584
Come on. We gotta hustle.

78
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,022
Late!

79
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:41,993
Welcome.

80
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:46,683
You may address me as Dean.

81
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:49,556
I know you all have questions.

82
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:52,820
They will be answered in time.

83
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,735
For the next hour,

84
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:58,347
your task is to complete your test.

85
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:01,959
Best of luck to you all.

86
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,179
Begin.

87
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:14,743
You know, this would go faster

88
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:17,845
if we could just do them all
in one batch, like we used to.

89
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:20,630
You know we don't have
that kind of supply.

90
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,719
Yeah. I'm just saying.

91
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:25,679
I mean, how many extra hours
of our time is this taking,

92
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,290
when the Library
could just give it to us?

93
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,129
Come on. You know you're thinking it.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,090
Well, looks like the weird one's a dud.

95
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:44,393
- Is the one you said...
- Shorted out the globe?

96
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:46,090
Yeah.

97
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,875
Never seen that before.

98
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,009
It was late in the day, no?

99
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,402
Supply runs low.

100
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:55,099
Could be that.

101
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:56,318
True.

102
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:59,974
I'll pull her and wipe her as soon
as she's done the written portion.

103
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:04,631
Ah, damn it.

104
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:06,328
What was that?

105
00:06:06,338 --> 00:06:08,199
- I'm not quite sure.
- Let me see...

106
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:10,071
I'd advise against it.

107
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:12,160
I didn't see anything.

108
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,902
I've got a splitting headache.

109
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:16,338
Okay.

110
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:17,992
I'll take your word for it.

111
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,038
- So keep or lose the migraine?
- Let's keep.

112
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:24,128
For now.

113
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,763
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

114
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:51,025
- Saw it with my own eyes.

115
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,070
Periplaneta Americana.

116
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,489
- Huge.
- Wow.

117
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,953
- A cockroach can't be good for the books.
- Exactly.

118
00:06:56,964 --> 00:06:58,859
I'm thinking of posting a sign
to remind everyone

119
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,293
that their mother doesn't work here,

120
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:02,384
and they should clean up
their own crumbs.

121
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:03,994
That's funny. Very clever.

122
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:05,057
Thank you.

123
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:07,302
Should I use Helvetica
or Times New Roman?

124
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:09,260
Would Comic Sans communicate good cheer

125
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,785
or undercut the seriousness
of the message?

126
00:07:29,464 --> 00:07:32,283
Even your breathing is depressing today.

127
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:33,720
You know that, Alice?

128
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,069
Hey, I have an idea.

129
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,071
- Yeah?
- Yeah, go fuck yourself.

130
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,812
I'm not here to entertain you.

131
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:42,424
If you say so.

132
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:45,775
'Cause the other day, when you
tried to escape, that was funny.

133
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:47,864
All that kicking and shrieking.

134
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:49,997
Gives me a big chuckle
every time I think of it.

135
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,647
Good day, Ms. Quinn.

136
00:07:57,658 --> 00:07:58,746
Lunch.

137
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:02,226
I thought you had slaves for that.

138
00:08:02,236 --> 00:08:04,151
Junior Librarians.

139
00:08:05,457 --> 00:08:07,449
I must insist you eat today.

140
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:10,157
Fine. Insist away.

141
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:18,025
You nosy bitch.

142
00:08:18,035 --> 00:08:19,766
Excuse me?

143
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:21,245
You read my book, huh?

144
00:08:21,255 --> 00:08:23,465
Right up to the great blank spot.

145
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:26,024
Did you read that whole chapter, hmm?

146
00:08:26,035 --> 00:08:29,786
You wanna talk about all the
positions Quentin and I were in?

147
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:34,007
Did my book tell you
how many times I came?

148
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:36,565
I can't let you starve,

149
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:38,959
and I don't want to force you to eat.

150
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:40,840
Neither of us would enjoy that.

151
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,319
Keep cooperating,
and you may continue to receive

152
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:54,201
approved reading material.

153
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,109
Wait.

154
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,904
I have a question.

155
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,592
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:05,778
Dean Fogg's not coming.

157
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:17,867
Dean Fogg.

158
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:19,096
The new students?

159
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:21,131
Appreciate you coming

160
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:22,916
all the way here to deliver this.

161
00:09:22,926 --> 00:09:26,006
Yes, well, you did... what's the word?

162
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:27,964
Mandate that I do so.

163
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:29,052
A formality.

164
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:30,140
We have the utmost faith

165
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,315
in your selection methods.

166
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:33,361
This is merely for our records.

167
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:38,366
This one.

168
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:41,064
Professor Lipson reported
she caused an unusual reaction

169
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:42,631
on your globe.

170
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:44,328
Do you know why?

171
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:46,287
I'm sure it'll become clear.

172
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:47,941
She shows great potential.

173
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:49,256
In what way?

174
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:52,423
I'm not sure yet,

175
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:55,393
but that's why she's at Brakebills.

176
00:09:56,524 --> 00:09:58,299
Well, I trust your instinct.

177
00:09:58,309 --> 00:09:59,343
Approved.

178
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:00,398
Always a pleasure.

179
00:10:04,663 --> 00:10:06,046
Alice is fine.

180
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:09,179
Depressed, surly.

181
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:11,007
Still asking to see you again.

182
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:14,387
She's fixated on the thing
she says she saw in the castle.

183
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:15,807
You told her, didn't you?

184
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:19,668
That your independent contractors
are looking into the threat, yes,

185
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:22,323
but she's not worried
about mass destruction.

186
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,064
She's worried about her friends.

187
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:26,936
I can't think of anyone
better protected than they.

188
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:35,510
Let's be frank, Zelda.

189
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,034
My students saved magic.

190
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:40,297
The world may throw flowers
at the feet of the Order

191
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,951
and Irene McAllistair,

192
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:44,606
but you and I both know
the goddamn truth.

193
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:47,217
The Order stepped into
an oversight position.

194
00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:49,654
Everything we do
is to preserve knowledge,

195
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,047
to make things safer.

196
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:52,919
I'm not arguing the benefits.

197
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:55,018
But you are,
because they come at a cost.

198
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,533
If your students resurface,

199
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:00,578
I can't stop Irene
from doing what she will

200
00:11:00,588 --> 00:11:02,145
to ensure their silence.

201
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:03,973
We have certain...

202
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:05,975
agreements with her as well.

203
00:11:08,988 --> 00:11:10,980
So...

204
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,037
they must stay where they are,
as they are.

205
00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:16,072
They'll be fine.

206
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:18,553
Your spellwork was...

207
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:20,086
masterful.

208
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:24,646
You know my one solace, Zelda?

209
00:11:24,656 --> 00:11:26,604
When my attempts to protect them

210
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:28,519
inevitably fail,

211
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:31,696
their blood will be on your hands.

212
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:50,541
Have a good day, Zelda.

213
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,991
Don't tell me to relax. I'm pissed.

214
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:09,515
Okay. I get it.

215
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:11,736
- But you're overreacting.
- I should throw this at you.

216
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:13,007
Sam, come on.

217
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:14,652
You made three very strong arrests.

218
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:17,524
And this douchewater just walks away,

219
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:20,222
based on what? Explain that to me.

220
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:22,442
That douchewater always gets away.

221
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:23,748
What are you talking about?

222
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:25,358
Seen him booked six times.

223
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:26,707
Never sticks.

224
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:28,535
Hey, what can I say?
Some people are lucky.

225
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:30,406
Or their lawyers are.

226
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,201
My advice is, let it go.

227
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:20,631
Uh, excuse me, miss?

228
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:22,391
Can I help you?

229
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:49,877
That guy.

230
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:51,028
He was just here.

231
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,726
Oh, I must not have heard.

232
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:01,367
Have a good day, sir.

233
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,402
"Hedge witch."

234
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:38,414
Oh, shit.

235
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:45,726
Oh, come on.

236
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:48,772
Piece of shit.

237
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:59,338
Damn it.

238
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:01,698
Get your shit together, Cunningham.

239
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:08,826
Shit!

240
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:10,784
Of course.

241
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:14,357
- Hi, Mark.
- Listen, I know you're a cop.

242
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:17,024
Yeah, and, uh, I know what you are.

243
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:18,338
I was just, uh, leaving.

244
00:16:18,349 --> 00:16:20,090
Yeah, I've noticed you're good at that.

245
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:21,627
Six arrests, nothing ever sticks.

246
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:23,901
Look, I don't hurt anyone.
It's all strictly side hustle.

247
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:25,685
Cut the shit.

248
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:27,556
I know there's more of you.

249
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:28,732
That you call yourself, what?
Hedge witches?

250
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:32,997
What the hell?

251
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:35,521
I'm not stealing anything
that's gonna hurt anyone.

252
00:16:35,531 --> 00:16:37,349
Minor shit. Charms, enhancements.

253
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:39,568
Nothing dark and... look,
I have no interest

254
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:41,962
in poking whatever kind
of witness-protection spell

255
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:43,427
you've got going, okay?

256
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:45,705
That thing tried to kill me
for looking at it.

257
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:47,794
What are you talking about?

258
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:49,535
Charms, enchantments.

259
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:51,416
What, is that French for "crystal meth"?

260
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:54,588
You have no idea, do you?

261
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:57,108
You just think you're you.

262
00:16:57,118 --> 00:16:58,674
Not so fast.

263
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,980
What is that?

264
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,226
Spelling bee medal?

265
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:03,157
- Give that back.
- What is it?

266
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:04,985
Protection.

267
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:06,054
From?

268
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:07,509
You.

269
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:08,607
Wait, stop!

270
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:23,920
Yoo-hoo!

271
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,096
Arise, Your Majesty.

272
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:28,229
Arise.

273
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,466
What the hell?

274
00:17:53,482 --> 00:17:56,953
You may approach, High King.

275
00:17:56,963 --> 00:17:58,128
Come, come.

276
00:17:58,138 --> 00:17:59,739
Let's take a look at you.

277
00:18:04,144 --> 00:18:06,441
Hi.

278
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:08,922
What the fuck is going on?

279
00:18:08,932 --> 00:18:11,011
Mm, it's a little bit worrying

280
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:13,013
that you don't seem
to know, considering.

281
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:15,058
"Considering"?

282
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:17,539
Are those horns?

283
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:19,019
Wait.

284
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:22,631
Am I at Jeff Goldblum's house right now?

285
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:23,806
What did I take?

286
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:25,634
You are asleep.

287
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:28,594
I, Ember, greatest ever God of Fillory,

288
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:30,596
am blessing a visitation of my person

289
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:33,555
on your prone and receptive state.

290
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:35,688
Well, more technically,

291
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,734
I, an energetic emanation

292
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,954
previously placed here
by the great God Ember,

293
00:18:40,964 --> 00:18:43,260
have been activated to contact you.

294
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,573
"Activated."

295
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:46,489
Activated, mm,

296
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,920
by a disturbance of great magnitude.

297
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,967
Alarums, Majesty!

298
00:18:53,977 --> 00:18:56,012
I have emanated to warn you.

299
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:58,841
Great ill is afoot.

300
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:00,343
Okay.

301
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:03,223
We're gonna have to take this
from the top, all right?

302
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:05,282
Because I literally haven't
been this confused

303
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:07,676
since the time I woke up
in bed with Banksy.

304
00:19:07,686 --> 00:19:08,895
This is concerning.

305
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:10,200
Which part?

306
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,681
For one thing, you look awfully like...

307
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:14,683
a female.

308
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:16,119
It's chilling.

309
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:17,817
No matter.

310
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:20,297
You must get to work
immediately, High King.

311
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:22,082
Great, sure.

312
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:23,213
Work on?

313
00:19:23,223 --> 00:19:25,694
Well, this glorious emanation

314
00:19:25,704 --> 00:19:28,131
can only be triggered by world war,

315
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:30,699
pandemic, arrival of hostile

316
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:33,248
or uninvited gods onto Fillorian soil,

317
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:36,130
revolt of dwarves,
or mass rising of the dead.

318
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:39,108
Not sure they'd be able
to do much, the dead.

319
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,362
They're sort of feeble and rotting.

320
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:45,235
It just struck me as creepy, and
I'd rather you put a stop to it.

321
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:47,934
Okay, horn person?

322
00:19:47,944 --> 00:19:49,705
My name is Janet.

323
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:51,067
I'm not a king.

324
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:52,676
I'm an editor, a fashion editor.

325
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:56,246
You're not even wearing pants. I
don't think this message is for me.

326
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:57,344
Wait.

327
00:19:58,171 --> 00:20:01,817
I am Ember, you insolent little Janet.

328
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,468
There is no walking away.

329
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:05,995
Only doing what I say. Quickly.

330
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,954
I'm telling you, I don't know...

331
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:10,130
Fix this now!

332
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:15,928
Fuck me.

333
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:23,893
Fuck it.

334
00:20:27,113 --> 00:20:29,376
Okay.

335
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:55,175
What?

336
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:03,063
- What the...
- Fuck!

337
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:09,406
The color correction on this
model is so bad, it's racist.

338
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,293
Set a call.

339
00:21:11,674 --> 00:21:13,410
Did Dr. Liu call back?

340
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,368
Yes, he... he said that
all the tests were normal.

341
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:18,459
My eye is weird.

342
00:21:18,469 --> 00:21:20,527
Colors are weird.

343
00:21:20,538 --> 00:21:22,985
How is that normal, Sophie?

344
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:26,859
Well, uh, he suggested this,

345
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,911
and he says he can see you next week

346
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:30,566
if the problem doesn't resolve.

347
00:21:30,577 --> 00:21:32,125
Next week?

348
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:34,354
Perfect.

349
00:21:36,226 --> 00:21:37,913
Well...

350
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:41,830
Now I've definitely seen
this year's ugliest accessory.

351
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,832
It... it was the only one they had.

352
00:21:43,842 --> 00:21:45,007
I'll deal with it.

353
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:46,269
It's fine.

354
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,358
Oh, and Sophie.

355
00:21:50,196 --> 00:21:51,981
Did you order those books for me?

356
00:21:53,156 --> 00:21:54,364
"Fillory and Further."

357
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:56,062
Oh, um, the Amazon account

358
00:21:56,072 --> 00:21:57,367
locked me out, and... sorry, I...

359
00:21:57,377 --> 00:21:58,847
I'm calling around,

360
00:21:58,857 --> 00:22:00,414
but bookstores are sold out of it.

361
00:22:00,424 --> 00:22:02,111
I'll keep trying.

362
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:04,113
That was a lot of words.

363
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,734
Just get it done.

364
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:25,787
Hey!

365
00:22:25,797 --> 00:22:27,789
What the hell?

366
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,322
Janet Pluchinsky?

367
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,717
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

368
00:22:34,327 --> 00:22:36,755
Well, what's going on, then?

369
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:39,496
And why are you wearing that
ridiculous spelling bee medal?

370
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:40,880
It's a magical amulet.

371
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:43,928
Look, I am not crazy, okay?

372
00:22:43,939 --> 00:22:45,309
There's something you need to know,

373
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,243
and as soon as I start
telling you about this,

374
00:22:47,253 --> 00:22:49,419
bad shit is gonna start
flying at our heads,

375
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:51,465
and this helps...

376
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:52,868
but not completely.

377
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,861
That makes no sense.

378
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:59,918
Would you just keep your mind
open for two seconds, okay?

379
00:23:03,922 --> 00:23:06,915
My name is Sam Cunningham.

380
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:09,449
I'm a narcotics officer
with the Seattle P.D.

381
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:12,931
Flip to chapter three.

382
00:23:14,237 --> 00:23:15,881
It's your life.

383
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:17,703
And mine.

384
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:21,408
Look, this medal thing,

385
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:24,411
it has some sort of...
I don't know what to call it...

386
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:27,111
like, a field of effect, and it
is bouncing shit away from us.

387
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:29,459
I'm sorry, do... do you hear yourself?

388
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:31,592
Tell me things haven't
been weird for you lately.

389
00:23:31,602 --> 00:23:34,652
- Well...
- Something was done to us.

390
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:38,164
This guy, he told me that he is a witch,

391
00:23:38,174 --> 00:23:40,906
and I know how that sounds,
but he was real.

392
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,951
And, okay... and I know how that sounds.

393
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:44,474
Just spit it out.

394
00:23:44,484 --> 00:23:46,128
He told me that I wasn't me.

395
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:48,087
That this...

396
00:23:48,097 --> 00:23:50,306
wasn't my identity.

397
00:23:50,316 --> 00:23:52,787
And then I found this.

398
00:23:52,797 --> 00:23:54,484
Well, I've never heard of this book.

399
00:23:54,494 --> 00:23:56,521
It's super obscure,

400
00:23:56,532 --> 00:23:58,582
but my whole life is in it.

401
00:23:58,593 --> 00:24:02,231
My parents, the Academy,
my last shitty boyfriend.

402
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,059
"Janet Pluchinsky

403
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,453
had stabbed her way to
the accessory editor's desk."

404
00:24:06,463 --> 00:24:07,889
That's a dumb way of putting it.

405
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:09,282
The writing isn't award-winning.

406
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:11,327
And my boobs look insane
in this drawing.

407
00:24:11,337 --> 00:24:12,981
A man wrote this, correct?

408
00:24:12,991 --> 00:24:15,984
Correct, but the details.

409
00:24:15,994 --> 00:24:18,857
Did you have a pet sugar glider
when you were eight?

410
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:21,642
Ate white cheddar popcorn
with Tabasco for breakfast?

411
00:24:21,652 --> 00:24:25,167
You have a dedicated closet
for wigs and fetish underwear?

412
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:29,998
Come on!

413
00:24:31,531 --> 00:24:33,393
It's okay.

414
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:37,943
What the hell?

415
00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:40,680
I don't know, but there are other
characters that are out there, too.

416
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:43,185
Look, I think we need to find them.

417
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:45,197
Let's get the fuck out of here! Come on!

418
00:24:48,852 --> 00:24:50,506
Hey.

419
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,501
Hey.

420
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:57,199
I know you're not sleeping.

421
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:59,506
- Go away.
- Love to.

422
00:24:59,516 --> 00:25:02,248
Locked in a cell.

423
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:04,380
Look, uh...

424
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:07,219
I'm not good at comforting...

425
00:25:08,394 --> 00:25:11,605
But for what it's worth,
it's gonna be okay.

426
00:25:11,615 --> 00:25:13,955
- No, don't lie.
- I'm not.

427
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:15,478
I've been where you are.

428
00:25:15,488 --> 00:25:19,047
Did I ever tell you
why they locked me up?

429
00:25:19,057 --> 00:25:20,570
Talking too much?

430
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,226
I was obsessed
with perfecting this spell.

431
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:26,315
You ever hear of Diogenes?

432
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:29,666
Yeah, sad-sack philosopher
with a lantern,

433
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:32,582
in search of one honest man.

434
00:25:32,592 --> 00:25:34,976
I was finishing his work

435
00:25:34,986 --> 00:25:37,500
to find good people.

436
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,719
Why?

437
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:40,513
Feel less alone.

438
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:43,376
Biggest obstacle being that

439
00:25:43,386 --> 00:25:45,431
almost no good people exist.

440
00:25:46,432 --> 00:25:48,163
Anyway, I kept refining it,

441
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:51,210
and I realized that
I had to focus on children,

442
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,603
because sometimes,

443
00:25:53,613 --> 00:25:55,920
they're not rotten to the core yet.

444
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:59,348
Anyway, that's all I wanted,

445
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,263
was to find some good kids,

446
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:04,092
and in some small way, reward them.

447
00:26:04,102 --> 00:26:07,226
Come to a point
where I needed this book.

448
00:26:07,236 --> 00:26:08,306
Restricted.

449
00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:11,665
They kept it in a place they call, uh...

450
00:26:11,675 --> 00:26:14,450
The poison room.

451
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,323
Yeah, killed one of my friends.

452
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,107
Yeah.

453
00:26:19,117 --> 00:26:22,067
It killed some of mine, too.

454
00:26:22,077 --> 00:26:25,635
I was working with these elf gentlemen.

455
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:28,290
Uh, it was bad.

456
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,032
- Elves... elves are real?
- Sweet guys.

457
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:34,775
All that weird sex stuff you hear
about is only partially true.

458
00:26:34,785 --> 00:26:38,605
Anyway, the Library came after me.

459
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:42,304
Possession, uh,
murder on Library property,

460
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:44,654
like... like I personally
murdered anyone.

461
00:26:44,664 --> 00:26:46,395
Please.

462
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,441
Wait.

463
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:51,226
A spells that rewards good children,
and you and your elves...

464
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,108
That was a long time ago.

465
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,018
Are you Santa Claus?

466
00:26:57,047 --> 00:26:59,039
Well...

467
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,956
Well, I'm not, not that.

468
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:03,456
But I don't like that name.

469
00:27:03,466 --> 00:27:06,425
It got very commercial,
very shopping-mall.

470
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:09,418
Look, just call me Nick, asshole.

471
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:14,510
I tried to escape early on.

472
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,471
Ended up lost in the stacks.
They found me, of course,

473
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:20,657
and that's when I tried to kill myself.

474
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,895
Really?

475
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:25,886
How... how did you cast in your room?

476
00:27:25,897 --> 00:27:27,703
- I can't do any magic.
- Of course you can't.

477
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:29,984
I mean, the entire cell
is coated with deadening paint.

478
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:33,121
I mean, you'd have to scrape off
an entire wall to get anywhere.

479
00:27:33,132 --> 00:27:34,313
How?

480
00:27:34,323 --> 00:27:37,751
Uh, I did it the old-fashioned way.

481
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:41,798
I pulled the edge off of my food tray.

482
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:44,725
Well, the point is...

483
00:27:45,725 --> 00:27:47,771
Is that I'm glad I'm not dead.

484
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:52,026
I'm not gonna die in here...

485
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:53,901
And neither are you.

486
00:27:53,912 --> 00:27:55,991
We're both smart.

487
00:27:56,127 --> 00:27:57,737
We'll figure it out.

488
00:27:59,739 --> 00:28:02,080
Why do you care?

489
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,395
Okay.

490
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:08,216
Christmas 2004.

491
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:10,262
The pink diary that your parents

492
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,742
thought your brother got you
and vice versa...

493
00:28:12,752 --> 00:28:14,788
Wait, are you saying that that was you?

494
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,400
Alice, you are good.

495
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,533
You're nice.

496
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:22,491
Honestly, most kids as smart as you

497
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,885
were naughty as shit.

498
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:26,713
I... I know...

499
00:28:26,723 --> 00:28:29,107
you hurt people,

500
00:28:29,117 --> 00:28:32,327
and you think that means
you should hurt...

501
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:36,244
but I know.

502
00:28:36,254 --> 00:28:39,639
I know you are not a bad person.

503
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,644
Promise me.

504
00:28:44,654 --> 00:28:48,256
Promise me you'll hang in there.

505
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:54,523
I promise...

506
00:28:56,753 --> 00:28:58,658
Santa.

507
00:29:06,348 --> 00:29:08,898
Hey! Help! Guard!

508
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:10,553
Help! Help!

509
00:29:10,563 --> 00:29:11,902
Alice!

510
00:29:11,912 --> 00:29:14,688
Help! Somebody, help!

511
00:29:14,698 --> 00:29:16,603
Help me! Over here!

512
00:29:16,613 --> 00:29:19,214
Here! Alice!

513
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,520
Alice!

514
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,522
- Help! Help!
- Alice?

515
00:29:22,532 --> 00:29:23,914
We need help in here!

516
00:29:23,924 --> 00:29:25,829
Alice! Help!

517
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,483
Alice.

518
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:38,337
I should have seen this coming.

519
00:30:38,347 --> 00:30:39,675
You're here

520
00:30:39,686 --> 00:30:42,993
because you knowingly broke
a contract with the Order.

521
00:30:43,003 --> 00:30:45,039
Not for causing what happened
to your friends.

522
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:47,041
You didn't cause that.

523
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:49,227
They made their own choice.

524
00:30:50,272 --> 00:30:51,882
I know...

525
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:55,886
Something about guilt.

526
00:31:02,371 --> 00:31:04,276
You wonder why I care.

527
00:31:04,286 --> 00:31:06,427
After all, you betrayed the Order.

528
00:31:06,438 --> 00:31:09,247
You probably think I've singled
you out for punishment.

529
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:13,894
I did single you out.

530
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:16,254
For rehabilitation.

531
00:31:17,864 --> 00:31:21,771
You have the makings of a Master.

532
00:31:21,781 --> 00:31:24,774
You could go further
than anyone, you know.

533
00:31:24,784 --> 00:31:26,950
Fogg, your father,

534
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,440
Mayakovsky.

535
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:32,521
That can happen here. There's work.

536
00:31:32,531 --> 00:31:35,611
Some in your situation
may be invited to participate,

537
00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:37,396
and then...

538
00:31:37,406 --> 00:31:39,354
this isn't a prison,

539
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,877
because what could be more fulfilling

540
00:31:40,887 --> 00:31:43,716
than immersion in the great
work of the Order?

541
00:31:46,632 --> 00:31:49,103
I know you hate this place.

542
00:31:49,113 --> 00:31:50,800
Given what you did to those keys,

543
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,465
I gather you hate magic itself, so...

544
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:55,989
I won't ask...

545
00:31:57,643 --> 00:31:59,428
until you're ready.

546
00:32:01,647 --> 00:32:03,475
I hope that day comes.

547
00:32:06,043 --> 00:32:08,601
I'm also not going to let you
kill yourself.

548
00:32:08,611 --> 00:32:10,047
Don't try that again.

549
00:32:11,744 --> 00:32:13,468
The wounds should be healed.

550
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:16,348
Rona will bring you back to your room.

551
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:44,506
I thought you were smart.

552
00:32:44,516 --> 00:32:46,682
That was so stupid.

553
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:48,031
Sorry if I scared you.

554
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,511
No, you didn't scare me.

555
00:32:50,143 --> 00:32:54,385
You disappointed the shit out of
me, you histrionic little idiot.

556
00:32:54,396 --> 00:32:56,126
I thought you were strong.

557
00:32:56,136 --> 00:32:59,042
I don't know why you would think that.

558
00:32:59,052 --> 00:33:02,176
Uh, well, yeah, me neither.

559
00:33:02,186 --> 00:33:03,873
Look, I wasn't trying to kill myself.

560
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:05,235
Really?

561
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:06,789
Look, I was just trying to figure out

562
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,714
a way out of here, and I think that...

563
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:16,896
I... I just need to think.

564
00:33:26,773 --> 00:33:27,808
Kim.

565
00:33:27,818 --> 00:33:29,984
Have a seat.

566
00:33:31,996 --> 00:33:35,511
I just wanted to talk to you
about my progress.

567
00:33:35,521 --> 00:33:37,861
See, everyone got
their discipline today.

568
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:40,472
Oh, yes. Always an interesting day.

569
00:33:40,482 --> 00:33:42,474
Except for me.

570
00:33:42,484 --> 00:33:44,781
I heard.

571
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:46,740
It's not super surprising,
given the fact

572
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,786
that I haven't been able
to do a single piece of magic.

573
00:33:49,796 --> 00:33:52,354
Well, so far.

574
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:53,670
Heard that as well.

575
00:33:54,845 --> 00:33:56,455
They're calling me a squib.

576
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:58,839
I even heard Professor Lipson say it

577
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:00,710
when she thought I was out of the room.

578
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:03,582
I'll talk to her about that.

579
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:05,367
We discourage that term.

580
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,717
It's considered hate speech.

581
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:09,632
I mean, but don't you agree?

582
00:34:09,642 --> 00:34:11,547
Do you?

583
00:34:11,557 --> 00:34:13,027
Well, I...

584
00:34:13,037 --> 00:34:14,898
I mean, I think I got
the highest math scores

585
00:34:14,908 --> 00:34:17,031
in the history of my high school,

586
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:20,556
and I graduated Harvard
on my 19th birthday.

587
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:21,959
Who didn't?

588
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,388
I... I'm just saying, I...

589
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,661
look, of course I want to keep trying.

590
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:33,525
It's like... the moment that I found out

591
00:34:33,535 --> 00:34:36,485
- magic was real...
- Mm.

592
00:34:36,495 --> 00:34:39,803
That was the moment
that I discovered who I am.

593
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,840
You remind me
of a young woman I once knew.

594
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,800
Similar tenacious mind.

595
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,725
I rejected her from Brakebills.

596
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,501
Why?

597
00:34:52,511 --> 00:34:53,937
Suffice to say,

598
00:34:53,947 --> 00:34:56,461
I had much evidence
I was doing the right thing,

599
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:59,029
but out on her own,

600
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,989
she got hurt, badly.

601
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:05,644
I had chosen not to protect her.

602
00:35:05,654 --> 00:35:08,788
I'm simply not willing
to repeat that choice with you.

603
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:11,747
So...

604
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,697
Patience.

605
00:35:14,707 --> 00:35:17,004
Magic is real.

606
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,876
Magic is real!

607
00:35:19,886 --> 00:35:23,010
This is the trippiest thing
I have ever seen.

608
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,403
I gotta say, you're
taking this pretty well.

609
00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:27,101
Well, you know,

610
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:28,798
it's all an illusion.

611
00:35:28,808 --> 00:35:30,713
The Grand Maya.

612
00:35:30,723 --> 00:35:32,933
Right, yeah.

613
00:35:32,943 --> 00:35:34,891
The Grand Maya. Of course, man.

614
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:36,545
Can I just say one thing?

615
00:35:36,555 --> 00:35:38,373
- I cannot believe...
- Hey.

616
00:35:38,383 --> 00:35:40,766
- You're DJ Hansel.
- Stay close, okay?

617
00:35:40,776 --> 00:35:42,865
This medal thing, it works
better the closer you are.

618
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:44,901
I've been listening to your
Taylor Swift remix nonstop.

619
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:46,073
Is it true that you guys hooked up?

620
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:47,599
Um, Janet?

621
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:49,688
- Sorry.
- You always do that.

622
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:51,055
I was just wondering

623
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,953
what you want me to say
about all these plane tickets.

624
00:35:52,963 --> 00:35:54,824
I don't want you to say anything.

625
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:56,957
I want you to expense them.

626
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:59,607
Oh, well, it's just that they
don't usually allow so many.

627
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:02,571
Yeah, huge feature, okay?

628
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:04,965
- That's DJ Hansel.
- Hey, how you doing?

629
00:36:04,975 --> 00:36:06,531
Yeah, these are his minions.

630
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:07,968
Put that, okay?

631
00:36:07,978 --> 00:36:09,675
And lattes, Sophie,
from the other place.

632
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:11,623
You know, the one that...
the little thing I like.

633
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:12,973
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah, yeah, and...

634
00:36:12,983 --> 00:36:14,691
and almond milk, please,
if you don't mind.

635
00:36:14,702 --> 00:36:16,846
She's young. I'm working with her.

636
00:36:16,856 --> 00:36:19,457
You were working with her.

637
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:21,068
Now, who knows?

638
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,114
Who knows anything?

639
00:36:24,124 --> 00:36:27,639
- Right, 'cause magic is real.
- You know?

640
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:28,989
Literally.

641
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:31,513
Like in movies, except literally real.

642
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,168
So no one can find Kim the architect;

643
00:36:34,178 --> 00:36:37,040
Nigel, the bastard son
of a British lord,

644
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,129
was reported missing by his family;

645
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:41,653
and, uh, Brian the English professor,

646
00:36:41,663 --> 00:36:43,256
also reported missing.

647
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,147
- Not worrying...
- Or another way to look at it

648
00:36:45,158 --> 00:36:46,929
is that the whole
goddamn thing is worrying

649
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,965
and no one thing
is any more or less worrying

650
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:50,227
than anything else.

651
00:36:50,237 --> 00:36:52,109
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

652
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,590
You need breath work, man.

653
00:36:57,157 --> 00:36:59,628
So how do we figure out who we really...

654
00:36:59,638 --> 00:37:02,109
Don't say it.

655
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,633
Okay, just...

656
00:37:04,643 --> 00:37:07,244
I don't know how we're
supposed to talk about this

657
00:37:07,254 --> 00:37:09,725
if we're not allowed to talk about this.

658
00:37:09,735 --> 00:37:11,901
Yeah, I mean, shouldn't all of us

659
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:13,479
being in a room together be enough to...

660
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,991
- I don't know, I mean...
- Okay, look.

661
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:18,821
Apparently, you have to poke
the fake ID aspect

662
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:21,041
of the situation pretty directly.

663
00:37:21,051 --> 00:37:22,999
Okay, just talk around it, okay?

664
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:25,262
Okay, okay, okay. Okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay.

665
00:37:25,272 --> 00:37:30,006
I say we find the writer
of this comic book, right?

666
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:32,139
James Tyberius R. Martin
is clearly a penname,

667
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,836
but whoever he is,
maybe he knows something

668
00:37:33,846 --> 00:37:35,490
- that can help us.
- Yeah, but...

669
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,882
but that written 14 years ago.

670
00:37:36,892 --> 00:37:39,581
I mean, what does that even mean?

671
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,844
Because I have memories from before,

672
00:37:41,854 --> 00:37:44,847
but they're not really mine
because I'm...

673
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,113
Uh, never mind!

674
00:37:50,123 --> 00:37:51,995
Never mind, I said!

675
00:37:52,952 --> 00:37:54,639
Oh, God.

676
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:57,043
You know, the guy
that got hit by a truck...

677
00:37:58,088 --> 00:38:00,873
- Did he die?
- He's still in the hospital.

678
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:04,867
Well, if he's alive,

679
00:38:04,877 --> 00:38:07,217
then we can ask him some questions.

680
00:38:07,227 --> 00:38:08,871
Oh, I wish you wouldn't.

681
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:11,569
I really feel
you've done enough for him.

682
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:13,049
Hi.

683
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,616
I'm Marina.

684
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:18,750
You almost killed a good friend of mine

685
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,057
and stole that from him,
which he was borrowing.

686
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:23,320
So, really, you stole it from me.

687
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,105
Okay, relax.

688
00:38:25,115 --> 00:38:27,204
I'm here to help.

689
00:38:32,818 --> 00:38:34,461
Are you even listening?

690
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:36,159
Yeah, of course.

691
00:38:36,169 --> 00:38:38,683
Of course I am.

692
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:41,398
We should get you cleaned up.

693
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:43,401
You've got so much blood on you

694
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:45,882
from that boring waiter.

695
00:38:45,892 --> 00:38:48,367
Anyway, we'll have to do it
once we get there.

696
00:38:48,378 --> 00:38:50,210
We have to hurry now.

697
00:38:50,221 --> 00:38:52,518
Where... where are we going?

698
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:54,520
Scoop of pistachio with jimmies.

699
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:57,566
- I said I wanted sprinkles.
- Jimmies are sprinkles.

700
00:38:57,576 --> 00:38:59,351
No, stop, jimmies are sprinkles!

701
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:04,569
Hmm, jimmies aresprinkles.

702
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:07,446
Anyway, Greece. A temple.

703
00:39:07,456 --> 00:39:09,535
He'll be there for his transit.

704
00:39:09,545 --> 00:39:10,973
It's the only time to catch him.

705
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:13,944
Flay that bastard's flesh
clean off his bones.

706
00:39:15,716 --> 00:39:19,892
Oh, remind me to get a coat.

707
00:39:19,903 --> 00:39:21,373
Am I remembering

708
00:39:21,383 --> 00:39:24,233
you kill these little bodies
if you get them too cold?

709
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:28,455
Hey, is there another game
that we can play?

710
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:32,384
One where we don't flay anybody?

711
00:39:32,394 --> 00:39:36,344
Oh, but he deserves it, sad
little man we are calling Brian.

712
00:39:36,354 --> 00:39:38,216
- Why? What did he do?
- He knows.

713
00:39:38,226 --> 00:39:41,480
Just like how all your...

714
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,047
friends know too.

715
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:44,574
Friends? What... what friends?

716
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:47,660
Oh, but we can't talk
about it, Brian-Not-Brian.

717
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,413
Your glamour gets very angry if
I even say your name too much.

718
00:39:52,414 --> 00:39:54,449
Look, it's better

719
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,081
you have no idea what I'm talking about.

720
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:58,689
These friends, I'm going to kill them,

721
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,596
and we have to assume it's going
to happen in front of you.

722
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:05,218
It will hurt less
if you don't know who they are.

723
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:08,811
I like you.

724
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,875
Make yourselves at home.

725
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,403
- Nice digs.
- Thank you.

726
00:40:36,413 --> 00:40:39,058
I worked really hard to steal them.

727
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:51,864
What is that?

728
00:40:52,614 --> 00:40:53,943
Protection.

729
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:55,379
From?

730
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:57,391
Whatever the hell's going on
with you people.

731
00:40:58,827 --> 00:41:01,395
Well, I didn't say you could move in.
Come on, let's go.

732
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:04,780
All right.

733
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,782
Well, we know it's big.

734
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:08,174
Big magic.

735
00:41:08,184 --> 00:41:10,046
Wow, okay.

736
00:41:10,056 --> 00:41:13,832
We know that you don't know
what the fuck it is.

737
00:41:13,842 --> 00:41:15,268
That's fun.

738
00:41:15,278 --> 00:41:17,314
And we know if we poke it,

739
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:20,022
it pokes us back with a truck.

740
00:41:22,068 --> 00:41:23,668
Oh, wow.

741
00:41:23,678 --> 00:41:25,452
Now I know how
the gold prospectors felt.

742
00:41:25,462 --> 00:41:27,682
It's just dripping off you.

743
00:41:29,902 --> 00:41:32,068
And you have no idea what that means.

744
00:41:32,078 --> 00:41:33,156
That's fine.

745
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:35,898
You're all just very, very,

746
00:41:35,908 --> 00:41:39,031
extremely juiced up on a level that's,

747
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:41,033
quite frankly, not legal these days.

748
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:43,340
I'm just a little curious
how you all got like this.

749
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,439
You... you and us both.

750
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:50,042
Okay, let's take a peek underneath

751
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:51,715
and see what you really look like.

752
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:53,350
I don't think that whatever that is...

753
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,868
Spell, illusion, charm, whatever.

754
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,498
Yeah, I don't think it's gonna let you.

755
00:41:56,509 --> 00:41:59,010
Relax, sweetie. This place
is warded up to the vag,

756
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:00,370
- and I'm very good...
- Hey.

757
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,370
At what I do.

758
00:42:04,763 --> 00:42:06,755
Just hold still.

759
00:42:06,765 --> 00:42:09,018
So you're like some powerful,

760
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:12,151
- benevolent white witch?
- Uh-huh.

761
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:14,023
Oh, well, that's good.

762
00:43:12,265 --> 00:43:16,922
What in creation is the
matter with you, High King?

763
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,392
Where to start with that?

764
00:43:19,402 --> 00:43:20,872
This is out little game.

765
00:43:20,882 --> 00:43:22,831
I have to ask you to do things twice

766
00:43:22,841 --> 00:43:26,051
because you're such a handsome king.

767
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,140
Enough flirtation.

768
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,274
It's unseemly that a simulacrum
of this magnificence

769
00:43:31,284 --> 00:43:34,103
should be bothered so repeatedly.

770
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:35,452
Fix it.

771
00:43:35,462 --> 00:43:37,933
Fix what?

772
00:43:37,943 --> 00:43:40,500
I don't know what you want me to fix!

773
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:43,808
Whatever the matter is
in Fillory, you simple boy!

774
00:43:43,818 --> 00:43:45,114
Find the bother.

775
00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:47,246
Find it, fix it.

776
00:43:47,256 --> 00:43:48,857
A, fuck you.

777
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:51,120
B, I'm not in Fillory.

778
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,208
What?

779
00:43:52,218 --> 00:43:55,994
I'm in New York City, along with
everyone else that matters.

780
00:43:56,004 --> 00:43:57,517
Fillory is fiction.

781
00:43:57,527 --> 00:44:00,216
- It's a kid's book.
- Why didn't you say so?

782
00:44:00,226 --> 00:44:02,044
Time to wake up, High King.

783
00:44:02,054 --> 00:44:04,394
Many blessings.

784
00:44:12,238 --> 00:44:13,979
Guys?

785
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,897
Sam?

786
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,553
Hansel?

787
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:28,515
What the high holy Jesus freak?

788
00:44:29,907 --> 00:44:33,204
Wake up. Wake up.

789
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:34,511
Wake up.

790
00:44:34,521 --> 00:44:38,307
Wake the fuck up! Wake up!

791
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:43,922
Fuck!

792
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,360
Hello?

793
00:44:48,137 --> 00:44:49,878
Hello?

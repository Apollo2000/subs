club to free myself?

00:36:37,467 --> 00:36:40,468
All anyone's offering you
is a chance to participate

Ever since that trip to
Savannah with your real mom,

830
00:36:50,847 --> 00:36:52,780
you've been desperate
to prove your worth.

831
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:55,284
Yeah, okay, you and
everyone else down here

that's read my book...
what, you just think you know me?

833
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,492
But it's why you're always sacrificing

834

yourself for people, right?

835
00:37:01,003 --> 00:37:03,991
To remind them how important
you are to the group?

836

move on and maybe somehow

838

if you stay down here,

842
00:37:18,126 --> 00:37:21,415
you've got an amazing
destiny ahead of you.

843

You've just gotta choose it first.

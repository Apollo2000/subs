00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:08,484
Previously, on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,485 --> 00:00:10,907
On Earth, barely any time has passed,

3
00:00:10,908 --> 00:00:13,899
while here, it's been 300 years.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,160
High King Fen and Josh the Fresh Prince

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,859
were overthrown 300 years ago.

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,957
The Dark King reigns. Glory to his rule.

7
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,626
So, tell me, did you happen
to bring any food with you?

8
00:00:22,627 --> 00:00:25,079
A monster rode you around for months

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,670
while he murdered people,

10
00:00:26,673 --> 00:00:28,632
and then one of your
closest friends died.

11
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:29,919
The surges are getting worse.

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,261
I'm just saying,
this is the type of thing

13
00:00:31,262 --> 00:00:33,119
I should be using my magic to fix.

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,847
The apocalypse is happening,

15
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:37,179
but you won't accept my help

16
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,379
- because I'm a woman?
- Quite right.

17
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,769
My name is Professor Adiyodi.

18
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,379
It's not a voice.
It's more like a signal.

19
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,049
I'm gonna take down my
wards so you can show me.

20
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,059
Professor?

21
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,559
This building, it's missing.

22
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,365
Do you know what kind
of skills it would take

23
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:55,299
to steal a building
with level five wards?

24
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,036
I miss him every day too.

25
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,872
No one gets to tell you
how to grieve, Alice.

26
00:00:59,873 --> 00:01:02,199
If you need to do something crazy

27
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,299
to get through it...

28
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,450
do something crazy, okay?

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

30
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,840
Quentin?

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,550
Where am I?

32
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,730
Where are my pants?

33
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,579
If this is a dream...

34
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,121
which it seems like it's a dream...

35
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:06,372
shouldn't knowing it's
a dream wake me up?

36
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:07,979
Unless it's a lucid dream

37
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,751
like that episode of "Voyager."

38
00:03:09,752 --> 00:03:11,319
Or I've been kidnapped by aliens

39
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,499
who are trying to get secrets out of me,

40
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,841
like that other episode of "Voyager."

41
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,759
- Something wrong?
- No.

42
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,389
It's just, you sound like
someone I used to know.

43
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,359
I feel like...

44
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,436
I'm supposed to be helping
you with something.

45
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:28,460
Is that weird?

46
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,020
No, it isn't weird at all.

47
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,619
You're right. This is a crazy dream.

48
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,239
See, this belonged to my friend,

49
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,324
and I can't read it.

50
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:43,399
But you can, and you're
supposed to tell me

51
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,205
what it says and then you'll wake up.

52
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,504
- What language is it in?
- I was hoping you knew.

53
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:58,801
I've never seen it before.

54
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,699
What?

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,969
Sorry.

56
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,339
If it was Elvish or Klingon...

57
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,299
This is a really weird dream.

58
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,439
Do you have a car?

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,981
Can you take me to Taco Bell?

61
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:27,497
Where the hell is that portal tree?

62
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,279
You are doing such a great job.

63
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,003
Will you promise me something?

64
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:35,919
When this is all over...

65
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,219
we can still be friends?

66
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,257
Meh.

67
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:40,759
No!

68
00:04:43,262 --> 00:04:44,720
Whoa.

69
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,299
This isn't real.

70
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,379
Eliot!

71
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,769
- Hey!
- Hey.

72
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,579
How are you talking right now?

73
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,526
I'm dead, not rude.

74
00:04:57,527 --> 00:04:59,274
- Oh, you're a ghost.
- Am I?

75
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:01,259
- Sorry.
- It's hard to be mad.

76
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,319
I was a terrible High King.

77
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,319
Or that's what a lot of
people screamed at me,

78
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,279
and a lot of strangers screaming at you

79
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,779
- can't be wrong.
- Right.

80
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,879
Anyhoo, they hung me.

81
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,460
Fen out, bitches.

82
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,119
For what it's worth,

83
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,130
I am sorry that I wasn't
here to save you.

84
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,899
It's okay, really.

85
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,959
The last I heard,

86
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,719
you were still possessed by The Monster.

87
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,499
And I figured if they did save you,

88
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,889
you'd probably be off drinking.

89
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,519
Honestly, I was counting
on Margo to save me.

90
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,819
Or Quentin or Alice or Penny

91
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,519
or Julia or Dean Fogg,

92
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,611
but I know the man I married.

93
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,260
Too well, it seems.

94
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,574
Oh, no, look at your sad face.

95
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:47,909
Don't be hard on yourself.
I'm already dead.

96
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,245
It's not like you can
do some kind of magic

97
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:52,960
to turn back time...
wait, unless... can you?

98
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:55,749
Eliot, if you can save
me, you have to do it.

99
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,160
- The buzzards are coming soon...
- Wha...

100
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,999
To peck out my eyes! My poor dead eyes!

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,019
- Okay, fine. Jesus, ch... chill.
- Oh, God!

102
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,049
Oh, God!

103
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,089
Eliot!

104
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,992
Which one of you beefy twats
built a magician-proof dungeon?

105
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:31,954
All right, let's
brute-force this mother.

106
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,720
Oh, my God.

107
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,499
"My friends, if you're reading this,

108
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,539
"it's because I'm dead

109
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,539
"or I escaped and forgot
to get rid of this letter,

110
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,812
"but probably the first one.

111
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:58,799
"R-I-P me.

112
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,299
"We knew something had
gone right on your end

113
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,760
"when magic came back
stronger than ever,

114
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,699
but then we didn't hear from you."

115
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,113
- News from the Northern Marsh.
- What about our friends?

116
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:08,616
Have any of the messenger
bunnies returned?

117
00:07:08,617 --> 00:07:09,779
Not as of yet.

118
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,299
The rabbits believe the connection

119
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,119
between our world and yours
has been disturbed somehow.

120
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,560
They're refusing to come
out of their burrows

121
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,454
no matter how many
cigarettes we offer them.

122
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:20,739
"Days turned into months
with no word from anyone

123
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,899
and no way for us to return to Earth."

124
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,359
Her languorousness Abigail

125
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,716
advises we send our armies
to the Northern Marsh

126
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:28,678
to investigate the reports
of these creatures.

127
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:31,589
The locals call them The Takers.

128
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,460
Look, man, I may be drowning
my sorrows in fried chicken,

129
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,489
but I'm not an idiot.

130
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,560
We're in over our heads.

131
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,339
That's why we need to
get a message to Margo.

132
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,459
"We spent so much time
trying to get you back

133
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,693
"that we didn't see the real
problem right in front of us.

134
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:46,139
The people rose up against us."

135
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,019
On the count of three, we charge.

136
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,620
- I don't have a weapon.
- You are the weapon!

137
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,949
I'm just saying, you have two.

138
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,493
One, two, three, charge!

139
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,122
"It did not go well for us."

140
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,739
"Like a dope, I had
done some renovations

141
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,249
"and made the dungeon magician-proof.

142
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,549
"Oops.

143
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,619
"Margo, I hope it's
you who finds this...

144
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,699
"And I hope you understand,

145
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,860
I did it all for you."

146
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:18,849
"Good-bye."

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,579
Did your pig visitor tell
you about the nature

148
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,579
of this apocalyptic whatever-the-hell

149
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,379
that's coming to kill us all?

150
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,859
No, but magicians are
blowing themselves up

151
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,059
all over the place.

152
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,399
So many that civilians have caught on.

153
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,959
- I think...
- There's too much goddamn magic.

154
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,165
Yes, I know.

155
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,359
Some surges come and go
and hardly anyone notices.

156
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,839
And sometimes it's a clusterfuck

157
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,334
of catastrophe and death.

158
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,679
I'm trying to find a pattern.

159
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,579
Why some surges and not others.

160
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,999
Well, if you'd had a proper
Brakebills education,

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,119
you'd know the answer.

162
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,719
Circumstances, dear.

163
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,684
The phase of the moon,
the nearest body of water.

164
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:01,643
You must factor them
all into your casting.

165
00:09:01,644 --> 00:09:04,359
Even us filthy hedges
know about Circumstances.

166
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,559
Trick is, certain Circumstances

167
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,959
make casting easier.

168
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,899
Others make them much more difficult.

169
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,529
Some of the surges must be lining up

170
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,199
with particularly
favorable Circumstances.

171
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,839
Is there any way to predict them

172
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,519
so we can warn people in advance?

173
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,179
I may know someone who can help you.

174
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,499
Professor Ex.

175
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,039
Wait, like the X-Men?

176
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,919
No, she's my ex-lover.

177
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,479
I like calling her that
because she hates it.

178
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,919
She's a genius at metamath.

179
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,013
- Do you feel that?
- Surge.

180
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,268
Damn it.

181
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,896
That was Professor Ex's
classroom blowing up.

182
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:47,315
I picked a hell of a
week to quit drinking.

183
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,679
I asked around.

184
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,617
Nobody knows who stole
the Book Depository.

185
00:09:56,618 --> 00:09:58,701
Did you ask David Copperfield?

186
00:09:58,702 --> 00:10:00,199
Yeah.

187
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,419
Oh.

188
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,916
But a job this big,
somebody should have seen it.

189
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,219
All right, look.

190
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,669
My brain is fried, so...

191
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,339
I either need to get some sleep

192
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,499
or to fry it some more recreationally.

193
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,719
Well, club soda is as crazy
as I get these days, so...

194
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,513
- Casual sex, then?
- Good-night, Pete.

195
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,186
Good-night, boss.

196
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,989
Your friend is like if
cocaine was a person.

197
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,639
Well, it's a hedge bar.

198
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,569
That description fits
half the people here.

199
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,614
Not you.

200
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,199
What am I?

201
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,979
A Mossad assassin
undercover as a lumberjack?

202
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,460
And you play bass in a J-pop
hard metal cover band?

203
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,369
Close. K-pop.

204
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,382
Yu-jin.

205
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,410
Kady.

206
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,979
Oh, good morning.

207
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,539
Is it?

208
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,315
Yeah, I know what you mean.

209
00:11:13,316 --> 00:11:15,560
Haven't had a night
like that in a while.

210
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,698
I'll just, um... pants.

211
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,869
Uh, if you, uh... wanna
hang sometime or...

212
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,125
You know, I'm just gonna stop talking.

213
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:30,836
Yeah, I'll just, uh...

214
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,339
Um...

215
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,305
C-call me.

216
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,579
Finally getting that GED?

217
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,519
Have some respect. I'm a professor.

218
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,680
Oh, "Chapter Seven:
Traveling Against Your Will."

219
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,260
That sounds like a problem.

220
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,984
One of my students was
hearing this signal,

221
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:57,071
and when I listened
to it, I just traveled.

222
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:58,979
No idea where, no idea why,

223
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,033
and none of this can explain it.

224
00:12:02,034 --> 00:12:05,529
So just don't listen
to the signal again?

225
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,439
- Wow, thank you.
- Shut up.

226
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,919
Except now I hear it all the time.

227
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,019
This here helps quiet
it down a bit, but...

228
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,999
It's kind of terrifying

229
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,049
to lose control of yourself like that.

230
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,439
Yeah.

231
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,599
Are you okay?

232
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,359
You know, hangover remedies are...

233
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,891
kind of a specialty of mine.

234
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:28,139
I remember.

235
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,649
No judgment or anything,
but I thought...

236
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,230
I'm sober.

237
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,349
Well, I was.

238
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,299
Almost a year, and here I am,

239
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,529
and my head feels like
it's gonna explode.

240
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:44,519
And if I remembered deciding
to have that first drink...

241
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,819
I would tell you why I did it.

242
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,871
You're human. Dust yourself off.

243
00:12:47,872 --> 00:12:50,039
Maybe keep searching for leads

244
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,439
on that vanishing Book
Depository or whatever.

245
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,499
What?

246
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,339
That library branch that got heisted.

247
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,507
You spent all day
yesterday looking for it.

248
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,095
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

249
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:05,556
Are you sure you're just hungover?

250
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,470
Did you get my tacos?

251
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,310
I got one of everything they had.

252
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,060
- Whose house is this?
- My mom's.

253
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,865
Where is she?

254
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:26,452
She's at a sex... she's camping.

255
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,870
This is a really long dream.

256
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:31,122
Mm-hmm.

257
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,649
- Hey.
- Oh, God.

258
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,999
- What?
- Oh, hi.

259
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,979
Um, look, I need help
with a metamath problem.

260
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,399
The professor who specializes
in it at Brakebills

261
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,079
blew herself up, so I figured,
uh, next best thing, right?

262
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,264
Yeah, you know, uh,
now's not a good time.

263
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,684
My cousin's here from Canada and, well,

264
00:13:50,685 --> 00:13:52,469
he's Canadian. So anyway,

265
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,770
- I gotta go.
- Alice.

266
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,939
That's... that's Quentin.

267
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,400
What the hell did you do?

268
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,090
Hello.

269
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,920
Shit.

270
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,219
So what do you say?

271
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,559
Wanna go back in time, save my friends,

272
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,359
and unfuck history for old times' sake?

273
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,299
If I change anything,
it could undo every sacrifice

274
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,814
we've all made to stop The Beast.

275
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:43,579
Why did you build a workshop
full of time travel gadgets

276
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,944
if you aren't willing to use them?

277
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:46,399
The lesson that I've learned

278
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,160
from a life of trying to change the past

279
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,911
is, well, you almost
always make things worse.

280
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:55,790
Speaking of, where is my
little volunteer tomato?

281
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,500
Volunteer, um...

282
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:59,044
Quentin, my dear.

283
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,923
He died saving me.

284
00:15:04,174 --> 00:15:06,218
Saving everybody.

285
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,989
Stiff upper lip, eh?

286
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,969
Positively British of you.

287
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,600
Someone's gotta keep it together.

288
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:16,353
Is that what you think you're doing?

289
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,769
Back when Quentin first came to Fillory

290
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,760
in the very first timeline,

291
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,309
he was running from grief.

292
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,959
His best friend had died tragically.

293
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,323
Julia.

294
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:30,993
You.

295
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,619
A victim of your own vices.

296
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,059
I was worried that I was
taking advantage of him,

297
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,019
of his sorrow.

298
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,419
So the first change I
made was to save you

299
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,379
to see if he would still
answer Fillory's call.

300
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,999
And he did.

301
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,299
And then he died...

302
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,259
39 times.

303
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,852
I had hoped this time
would be different.

304
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:58,919
It still could be.

305
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,599
You saved him 39 times.

306
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,689
Why not 40?

307
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,019
Because he won.

308
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,479
If you took away his sacrifice,

309
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,363
you'd lose everything
that it bought you:

310
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:11,620
your life and the lives
of everyone around you.

311
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,119
Same with your friends,
Josh and... was it Flen?

312
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,779
It was not.

313
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,499
You have to let go of the past, Eliot.

314
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,879
Let the dead stay dead.

315
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,120
Time is a motherfucker, isn't it?

316
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,930
Ah, tea is ready.

317
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,990
Oh, shit.

318
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,919
Why are you staring at me?

319
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,699
Because...

320
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,010
Holy shit.

321
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:15,939
You look like somebody I know.

322
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,140
My friend Julia...

323
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,601
her grandma.

324
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,199
Yeah, okay, great.

325
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,499
Um, you know, I actually
have to talk to Alice,

326
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,942
so maybe you could go play
with rocks or something.

327
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,099
So you built a golem out of living clay

328
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,919
and used the book of Quentin's life

329
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,480
to fill it with his memories?

330
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,919
It's not so crazy.

331
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,699
And then you animated the whole thing

332
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,079
with his essence?

333
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,999
No, it's just a tiny grain of Q's soul

334
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,879
that I pulled from the Underworld.

335
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,179
You wouldn't help me with a séance,

336
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,464
and then you go and do this?

337
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:55,479
Well, I... I knew it was
risky, but it worked.

338
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,439
But it didn't.

339
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,182
That is not the Quentin
you knew. That's...

340
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:02,519
how could you do something like this?

341
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,960
I found this in Q's stuff at Brakebills.

342
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,519
What is this?

343
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,158
I don't know. It's in a language
I've never seen before.

344
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:19,452
It could be a... a letter or a diary

345
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:21,989
or a project he was working on.

346
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,339
I thought maybe he left
it for me to find.

347
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,168
So you built the version of Q
that could read this for you.

348
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:28,586
Right, but...

349
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:31,339
He's 12, so he can't.

350
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,959
Get rid of it.

351
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,959
Put back the piece of Q's
essence that you stole

352
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,303
and let him be at rest.

353
00:18:36,304 --> 00:18:38,469
It's not that simple.

354
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,599
The spell keeps the golem alive

355
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,145
until he completes the task
I brought him here to do.

356
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:47,519
So the spell can never be finished

357
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,519
'cause he can't read Q's letter.

358
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,569
This was so insanely selfish.

359
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,199
I can't sleep.

360
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,709
I can barely breathe.

361
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,679
I... I needed to fix something,

362
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,999
finish something for him.

363
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,332
Yeah, well, you fucked up.

364
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,750
Maybe if we can figure
out how, we can fix it

365
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:10,962
and you can put back the
piece of Quentin's soul

366
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:13,700
where it belongs.

367
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,800
I'm glad you called.

368
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:22,515
Last night was a bit of a blur.

369
00:19:22,516 --> 00:19:24,142
I was hoping for a second chance.

370
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,890
Kind of a blur for me too...

371
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:29,815
- Mm.
- Which is why I called.

372
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:31,439
See, I'm sober.

373
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,149
I don't remember drinking last night,

374
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,379
but I've got gaps in my memory,
and not just last night...

375
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,239
I can't remember things
that happened days ago.

376
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,060
What are you saying?

377
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,359
I want to know if you can explain.

378
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,913
Wait, you want to know if I drugged you?

379
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:46,779
I left you my number.

380
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,659
I... I showed up for a second date,

381
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,859
which is big for me, since I
am terrified of settling down.

382
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,699
Oh, maybe I took a chance on you

383
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,119
because you remind me of my cousin,

384
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,439
who I've been obsessed
with since we were 13.

385
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,879
Yes, my first cousin,
but our moms are twins.

386
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,889
So genetically my half-sister,
which makes it worse.

387
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,222
Why am I saying all this?

388
00:20:03,223 --> 00:20:05,225
Because I "truthied" your drink.

389
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,060
You drugged me to see if I drugged you?

390
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,019
You are insane.

391
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,139
But I swear, whatever happened
to you, I didn't do it.

392
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,152
I... I mean, I did some
stuff to you. O-on you.

393
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:19,479
I mean, with you! Th-the sex stuff!

394
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,819
Because you asked, for the record.

395
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,367
God, fucking truth serums.

396
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,739
Wait, wait. Kady, Kady.

397
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,699
Um...

398
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,899
I got to my building this morning,

399
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,044
and I couldn't remember
which apartment was mine.

400
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:37,279
I... I thought, "Hey, crazy night."

401
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,140
But it seems like if
your memory was changed,

402
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:43,180
so was mine.

403
00:20:43,184 --> 00:20:44,681
I need to know why.

404
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,499
If the beheading didn't kill Josh,

405
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,940
the room service would have.

406
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,779
I'll take your complaint to the manager.

407
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,760
Eliot?

408
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,159
Just in time.

409
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,327
The cell is Margo-proof,

410
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,040
and when the Dark King gets
back from his summer palace,

411
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:09,919
I'm gonna be executed.

412
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,999
What's that?

413
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,100
The contents of Jane Chatwin's garage,

414
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,819
which we will use to
take back our kingdom.

415
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,599
My kingdom.

416
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,709
But sure.

417
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,759
What is this?

418
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,279
"Permanence,"

419
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,129
for men and women.

420
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,380
Ugh, God, could you ask first?

421
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,720
Says this will protect us
from timey-wimey-whatever.

422
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,889
So we can change the past

423
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,399
and not erase ourselves in the future.

424
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,019
Clutch.

425
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,479
- What's that?
- A smoker.

426
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,640
Beekeepers use them to
calm down their hives.

427
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,660
So that's super applicable
to our current situation.

428
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,399
Wait.

429
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,621
Josh would never shut up

430
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:51,419
about the Royal Bees of Whitespire.

431
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,659
They make all the honey
for the castle's kitchens.

432
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,659
And they're talking bees.

433
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,879
Okay, all you have to do

434
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,840
is get the bees to deliver a
message to Josh in the past

435
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,217
and then smoke them out.

436
00:22:03,218 --> 00:22:05,469
Huh, time bees.

437
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,060
Hello, there, bees.

438
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,109
Time bees activated.

439
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm not sure it feels
like we changed the past.

440
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:24,609
At least, not yet.

441
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,780
What are you doing?

442
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,659
There used to be a letter in here.

443
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,744
Huh.

444
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,790
It's Fen's.

445
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,479
High King Fen here giving you an update

446
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,509
on life in Castle Whitespire.

447
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,919
Babadook hats and open-toed shoes

448
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,719
are the style this season.

449
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,879
Ooh, hey, Josh.

450
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,189
- Hey, get in my Insta story.
- Uh, no.

451
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,105
- There is no Insta on Fillory, Fen... 
- But...

452
00:22:57,106 --> 00:22:58,309
So this is...

453
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,419
- I have three bars.
- We're on a different planet.

454
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,999
That's not even po...
how do you have three bars?

455
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,821
This is... what phone is this?

456
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:07,699
- The time bees.
- Oh, God, do you hear that?

457
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,560
Well played, sister.

458
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,619
- Oh, they're saying something.
- Fen, I'm allergic to bees!

459
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,270
Or maybe not.

460
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,179
- Oh, God!
- Please help me!

461
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,584
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- I'm being killed...

462
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:19,819
by so many bees!

463
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,380
Did Josh say he was allergic?

464
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:24,329
Right.

465
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,009
That's why Josh would never
shut up about the bees.

466
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,790
Oops.

467
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,950
I had a friend who used to do that.

468
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,959
Once he got to the end
of his favorite book,

469
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,666
he'd go back to the beginning again.

470
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:59,839
Endings are the worst part.

471
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,460
Characters grow up, they move on.

472
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:04,672
Some of them die.

473
00:24:04,673 --> 00:24:07,059
- It feels like...
- Your best friend in the whole world's

474
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,800
abandoned you.

475
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,389
- I've had this conversation before.
- So have I.

476
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,199
The therapist my mom sends me to

477
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,939
says I have transition anxiety.

478
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,479
As if it's too much to ask
that nothing ever change.

479
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,599
Well, your real friends
won't abandon you.

480
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,359
That will never change.

481
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,619
My best friend will start
dating skeevy guys

482
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,819
who smoke and spit, and
she'll forget I ever existed.

483
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,249
You're just gonna have
to trust me on this one,

484
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,930
but the "skeevy guys" thing?

485
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,708
It's just a phase.

486
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:43,500
She needs you just as
much as you need her.

487
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,670
Um, excuse me.

488
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,460
I tried to find a flaw in the casting,

489
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,599
but I couldn't.

490
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,769
That's him.

491
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,979
It's Q.

492
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,819
The one I knew at that age.

493
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,149
But the spell...

494
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,999
I've been doing a lot of
reading on Circumstances.

495
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,864
Not all of them are astrological.

496
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:14,242
- Some of them...
- Are inside you.

497
00:25:17,328 --> 00:25:18,953
I think you did that spell perfectly.

498
00:25:18,954 --> 00:25:21,339
Your brain might have asked
for the version of Q

499
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,779
that could his letter, but...

500
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,160
your internal Circumstances
asked for something different.

501
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:30,550
Maybe you need to ask him
a different question.

502
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,439
What's that?

503
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,272
"A History of Fillory,"
from the Royal Library.

504
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:47,230
What does it say?

505
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,569
"After the Fresh Prince
was stung to death

506
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,940
"by a swarm of honey-drunk assassins,

507
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,259
High King Fen... "

508
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,869
My God, she listened to the bees.

509
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,539
"She sent an army of soldiers
to hunt down the Dark King,

510
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,959
"a massive manhunt that was viewed

511
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,699
"as tyrannical overreach
by the people of Fillory.

512
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,939
She was overthrown and executed."

513
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,979
The Takers invaded,
the Dark King still rose.

514
00:26:19,265 --> 00:26:22,509
So... that's it, then?

515
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:27,809
I-in what conceivable
universe is that it?

516
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,319
I'm just saying, we're doing all of this

517
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,760
to save a man you ostensibly love

518
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,439
who died of a bee sting because
you forgot he was allergic.

519
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,679
What is your fucking point?

520
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,439
I was gone, you were alone...
and you hate being alone...

521
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,779
and so you grabbed the first
dick that crossed your desk,

522
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,707
and you're having a
hard time letting go.

523
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:49,249
You think I should let go
of our friends' lives?

524
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,299
I think you have a textbook case

525
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,249
of cock blindness.

526
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,012
You are Margo the Destroyer,
not Margo the Pining Girlfriend.

527
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,679
I'm gonna let your bullshit slide

528
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,819
on account of you so
recently being possessed

529
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,855
by a homicidal monster...

530
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,899
But I'm not changing my plan.

531
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,527
Okay. Okay.

532
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,650
Go for it.

533
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,160
Wait.

534
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,130
I recognize these.

535
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,060
The first time Jane came
to Fillory by herself,

536
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,479
she was homesick and
missed her brothers.

537
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,973
A forest crone gave her these stamps.

538
00:27:41,974 --> 00:27:45,299
Put them on a letter,
address it whoever,

539
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,779
wherever, whenever, and it gets to them.

540
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,062
This could be our chance.

541
00:27:49,063 --> 00:27:51,649
I can just tell Josh how to fix things.

542
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,159
Find an envelope!

543
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,299
Address it to "Josh Hoberman,
Castle Whitespire,

544
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,070
before he was killed by bees."

545
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,139
"Dear Josh, hello from your friends

546
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,539
"300 years in the future.

547
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,559
"The bad news is, we can't
come back to get you.

548
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,619
"The good news: if you
do exactly what I say,

549
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,179
you won't be overthrown and executed."

550
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,539
Uh, Fen, you're gonna want to see this!

551
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,019
"Those reports you've been ignoring

552
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,379
"about an invasion of creatures

553
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,761
"in the Northern Marsh?

554
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:22,929
Stop ignoring them.
Send an army, today."

555
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,379
- I told you we should have.
- Just shush!

556
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,099
Summon the guards!

557
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,679
Everyone, we did it!

558
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,279
We scared The Takers back

559
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,773
to wherever the hell they came from.

560
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:33,950
Go us!

561
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:36,439
"And somehow, when we fix the past... "

562
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,740
"I hope we can see each other again.

563
00:28:40,744 --> 00:28:42,080
Love, Margo."

564
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,679
The letter disappeared the
moment I closed the mailbox.

565
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,180
It worked.

566
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,479
Josh and Fen did a banishment spell

567
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,359
to scare off The Takers... they thought.

568
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,801
Then the creatures came back

569
00:28:59,802 --> 00:29:01,119
and killed Josh and Fen

570
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,470
and everyone in Whitespire.

571
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:06,889
Don't say anything.

572
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,879
Okay, it's working.

573
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,339
So how does a homemade
psychic amplifier help

574
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,657
if I'm not a psychic?

575
00:29:23,658 --> 00:29:25,529
Lowers the bar just
enough for the two of you

576
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,899
to be able to connect your minds.

577
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,409
We're both missing memories.

578
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,469
If we combine the ones we have,

579
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,789
it might be enough to give us an answer.

580
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,750
Huh, so it's like, uh, memory VR.

581
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:36,249
- No.
- So you're sure about this?

582
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,759
I'm sure I need to know
what happened to me.

583
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,879
You?

584
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,470
- Same.
- Don't touch.

585
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Hands together, please.

586
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,350
So where should we start?

587
00:29:56,357 --> 00:29:58,943
Last night, the bar.

588
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,519
Your friend is like if
cocaine was a person.

589
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,299
Well, it's a hedge bar.

590
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,599
That description fits
half the people here.

591
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,340
Not you.

592
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,179
Oh, come on, this is totally memory VR.

593
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,219
Shh.

594
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,540
All right, now what?

595
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,959
A Mossad assassin undercover as...

596
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,239
Now we watch.

597
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,599
And you...

598
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,065
play bass in a J-pop
hard metal cover band?

599
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,230
I could look away.

600
00:30:44,238 --> 00:30:46,820
You clearly already remember it.

601
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,989
I don't know.

602
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,180
No drugs slipped into our drinks,

603
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,829
no head injuries.

604
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,880
Whatever happened to us,
it seems like we both forgot.

605
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,059
Whoa, what the hell?

606
00:31:29,296 --> 00:31:30,700
Stop! What are you doing?

607
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,439
Kady, I... I know that looked bad.

608
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,289
What the hell was that?

609
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,669
What, some kind of memory spell?

610
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,329
I mean, it looked like it,
but I don't know.

611
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,340
I don't remember.

612
00:31:49,345 --> 00:31:51,553
Well, what the hell do
you remember, then?

613
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:54,039
- Why were you at the bar?
- To drink.

614
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,139
T-to...

615
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,894
to meet a friend.

616
00:31:57,895 --> 00:31:59,604
- Who?
- A... a hedge

617
00:31:59,605 --> 00:32:01,356
I know from my first safe house.

618
00:32:01,357 --> 00:32:02,525
Show me.

619
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,199
That's my friend. She's...

620
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,741
The woman that Pete left with.

621
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,790
What are you?

622
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,709
What, some kind of Manchurian Candidate?

623
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,460
A sleeper agent that gets activated

624
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,439
to attack women in their bedrooms?

625
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,548
This doesn't make any sense.

626
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:28,008
What's on the card?

627
00:32:33,514 --> 00:32:36,308
I-I can't make it out.

628
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:37,710
Damn it.

629
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,270
I know what's on the card.

630
00:32:40,271 --> 00:32:42,059
How?

631
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,469
You put your phone number on it...

632
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,760
Whoa, K-Kady, wait...

633
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,530
So show me who you really are.

634
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,719
Someone sent you to
erase my memory. Who?

635
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,119
I have no idea.

636
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,799
I never do.

637
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,599
I get a job, I do it,

638
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,460
and when it's over,

639
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,062
I make sure I don't remember.

640
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,139
You walk around having no idea

641
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,394
what you do for a living?

642
00:33:24,395 --> 00:33:26,540
Why would I want that on my conscience?

643
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,279
Because that's what a conscience is for,

644
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,540
to keep you from doing fucked up shit.

645
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:35,299
The world is painful.
That's not gonna change.

646
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,179
So I use whatever crutch I have to

647
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,239
to keep going.

648
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,460
The point is,

649
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,199
you can take the shiv from my throat,

650
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,379
because I can't rat out
someone I don't remember.

651
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,679
Well, my friend's a psychic.

652
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,279
Why don't I have him root around

653
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,385
and see what you do and don't remember?

654
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,305
Then you don't leave
me much choice, Kady.

655
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:58,389
Mortem.

656
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,219
No, no! Damn it!

657
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,500
Who sent... who sent you?

658
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,059
Who...

659
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,242
What the hell happened?

660
00:34:16,243 --> 00:34:19,870
I don't know. He just...
self-destructed.

661
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,000
He's gone.

662
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:30,422
Telling them to kill the
Dark King was a bust.

663
00:34:30,423 --> 00:34:32,720
Same with going after The Takers.

664
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,639
We need a new plan.
We only have two stamps left.

665
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,259
One stamp. After your
last letter to Josh,

666
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,449
I had an idea.

667
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,999
I gave it a shot. It didn't work, so...

668
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,309
one stamp.

669
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,314
And you didn't tell me?

670
00:34:47,315 --> 00:34:48,990
I'm not your subject.

671
00:34:48,996 --> 00:34:51,019
- I'm your friend.
- Fine.

672
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,945
Then what would you tell Josh to do?

673
00:34:52,946 --> 00:34:56,740
Run to the nearest dive and
drink himself to death?

674
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,079
Yes.

675
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,489
I would run away,

676
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,139
because you try to save your friends

677
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,079
and they die anyway.

678
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,760
You can't stop The Takers,

679
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,252
and you can't stop the Dark King.

680
00:35:09,253 --> 00:35:11,320
And if we don't focus
on getting you out,

681
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,799
you're gonna get decapitated.

682
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,840
Fillory is fucked because it always is,

683
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,899
and I don't get why you keep
trying to fix something

684
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,049
that wants to be broken.

685
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,840
It may be broken, but it's my home.

686
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,019
It hasn't been your home for 300 years.

687
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,769
You are right about one thing.

688
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,941
I have gone soft.

689
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,839
I've been telling myself

690
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,859
that if I can just keep Josh from dying,

691
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,359
somehow I can get him
and my kingdom back.

692
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,617
But that's not possible, is it?

693
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:47,249
What are you telling him?

694
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,979
I told him he needs to stay here.

695
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,080
He can use the information
from this history book

696
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,659
to fight the Dark King and The Takers

697
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,721
wherever they show up
for the rest of his life.

698
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,680
I told him good-bye.

699
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,200
I'm not dreaming, am I?

700
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,339
I ask because it's been,
like, a full day,

701
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,540
and if you sleep for that long,
it's 'cause you're dead.

702
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,039
I had this friend...

703
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,050
who I loved very much...

704
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:48,810
And he died, and I didn't
get to say good-bye.

705
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,299
And I honestly don't know

706
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,219
how I'm gonna go on without him.

707
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:58,070
And he gave me this
gift I can never repay.

708
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,479
What was the gift?

709
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,910
His life.

710
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,990
He gave it up for mine.

711
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:16,250
I brought you here
'cause I wanted closure.

712
00:37:16,259 --> 00:37:19,169
You know, I just... I wanted to...

713
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,859
fix something or finish
something for him.

714
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,760
But the letter I showed you,

715
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,639
you couldn't read it, so...

716
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,499
You're skipping to the
beginning of the book.

717
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,269
What?

718
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,619
I can't help you

719
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,599
because you don't want me to.

720
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,110
Because then your
friend's story is over.

721
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,640
My dad says when I get
sad about something

722
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,320
that's gonna end...

723
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,460
I should just imagine
this is the first page

724
00:37:55,461 --> 00:37:56,749
in a new book.

725
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:03,219
The gift your friend gave you...

726
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,969
It wasn't his life.

727
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,979
It was yours.

728
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,950
That story just started.

729
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,389
What?

730
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,939
I just shouldn't be surprised
that, even at age 12,

731
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,610
Quentin Coldwater is still
the smartest person I know.

732
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,790
I'm feeling tired.

733
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,120
Really tired.

734
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:42,460
Hey, do you want to see a trick?

735
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,010
Sure.

736
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,990
- That was cool.
- Yeah.

737
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,920
There's just one more
thing I wanted to say.

738
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:20,070
I...

739
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,299
Good-bye, Quentin.

740
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,563
He's gone.

741
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,560
You okay?

742
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,119
I'm sorry he couldn't give you

743
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,822
the answer you wanted.

744
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,570
No, he did.

745
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,120
Maybe I can still help
you with your problem.

746
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,499
My dad had a friend with a...

747
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,119
really rare discipline,

748
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,540
predicting Circumstances.

749
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,859
They lost touch years ago,

750
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,259
but she wrote this.

751
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,439
_

752
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,080
If anyone can find the
pattern you're looking for,

753
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,738
it'll be her.

754
00:40:29,336 --> 00:40:30,574
Thanks.

755
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,069
I don't remember any of it.

756
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,979
The Book Depository,

757
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,957
the mystery woman who
apparently wiped my memory.

758
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,626
All I know is what you told me, which...

759
00:40:40,627 --> 00:40:43,519
Isn't enough to do anything with.

760
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,859
Somebody's out there with enough power

761
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,439
to steal a building,
paranoid enough to send

762
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,511
mind-wiping sleeper agent
assassins after you...

763
00:40:50,512 --> 00:40:51,719
It's not nothing.

764
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,719
Well, I need a drink.

765
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,499
Sorry. Insensitive.

766
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,980
I'll show myself out.

767
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:08,529
How are you feeling?

768
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,840
You know, I thought that
if I took on more power

769
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,799
and more responsibility...

770
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,949
that I'd want heroin less.

771
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,679
But the truth is,

772
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,459
when I thought I'd relapsed,

773
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,219
I wasn't disappointed.

774
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,959
Wasn't mad at myself.

775
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,970
I was relieved.

776
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,380
It gave me permission
to relapse some more.

777
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,699
And trying to lead the hedges,

778
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,930
it's only gonna get harder.

779
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,689
And I'm not sure I can
do it without a crutch.

780
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,899
Which maybe means
I shouldn't do it at all.

781
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,790
No, don't.

782
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,420
You never quite get used to the smell

783
00:42:12,426 --> 00:42:14,802
of Fillorian plumbing, do you?

784
00:42:14,803 --> 00:42:16,470
Josh...

785
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,339
You're alive.

786
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,894
Thanks to you. I got your letter.

787
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,849
Right. The letter.

788
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:26,999
Did exactly what you said.

789
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,239
I went to the Clock Dwarf,
brought him a ham sandwich,

790
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,154
and told him to send
me forward 300 years.

791
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,859
- Just you?
- No, Fen came too.

792
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,620
And Tick, and Rafe,

793
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,379
and a few guys from my bowling league...

794
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,139
I started a bowling league...
and a dozen other people.

795
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,859
Nobody cool wanted to stay in the past

796
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,620
once they knew what was coming.

797
00:42:47,891 --> 00:42:49,587
I can't believe it.

798
00:42:49,588 --> 00:42:51,632
Look behind the stone.

799
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,725
I hid it there before I left.

800
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,440
Margo, thank you.

801
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,569
May I present the government

802
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:20,560
of High King Margo in exile.

803
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,500
Let's get out of here
before we all get killed.

804
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,309

1
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,331
Mrs Marbury? 'Ya

2
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:55,021
Mr Cust.

3
00:03:02,276 --> 00:03:05,490
Rent is two and six a week,
you pay up front and a week in hand.

4
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:09,530
Some parcels got delivered for you.
We took them up.

5
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:12,251
I trust you're not going to
be expecting that service

6
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,021
regularly, carrying parcels.

7
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:15,971
What do you think I am, a pack horse?

8
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,811
You should have left them for me to carry.

9
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:19,891
And have brown paper
items littering my vestibule?

10
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,381
This is no post office.

11
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,251
I'm very sorry to
inconvenience you, Mrs Marbury.

12
00:03:26,276 --> 00:03:28,740
The front door is bolted at ten o'clock sharp.

13
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:31,131
I don't hold with none of
my gentlemen out carousing

14
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:33,921
half the night.
I don't hold with no topers and sots neither.

15
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:37,410
Nor no bad language,
profanities and blasphemies and the like.

16
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:39,971
What I do hold with is old-fashioned manners.

17
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:42,771
You mind your Ps and Qs
and we'll get along nicely.

18
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:48,211
The privy is in the yard.

19
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:51,301
I prefer my gentlemen to
not be cavalier in their use

20
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:53,941
of the lavatory paper. It blocks up the pipes,

21
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:56,851
and then who's got to get in
there with a stick and break it up?

22
00:03:58,276 --> 00:03:59,740
Me, that's who.

23
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:06,131
Are you just passing through

24
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:09,709
or do you expect to be a long-term resident?

25
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,150
That all depends.

26
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:14,882
On what?

27
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:17,122
The success of my enterprise.

28
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:29,322
Bed bugs?

29
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:33,292
I run a clean house, Mr Cust.
A very clean house. No foreigns.

30
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:35,812
Not like some round here
- take in all sorts,

31
00:04:35,837 --> 00:04:38,092
don't know whose air you're breathing.

32
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:54,562
Mr Treadgold. One of my long-term residents.

33
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:57,682
Got a bad back. My daughter Lily is helping him.

34
00:04:57,707 --> 00:05:00,562
Very skilled she is,
with gentlemen what have aches.

35
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:07,762
A shilling for ordinary.

36
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:09,531
You book through me. You pay me.

37
00:05:12,227 --> 00:05:14,562
She knows her stuff,
won't give you no argument.

38
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,372
I'll let you get unpacked.

39
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:15,172
I followed you the other day.

40
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:19,601
You looked old and tired.

41
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:25,042
You walk as if your feet hurt.

42
00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:32,842
I was rather concerned for you.

43
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:41,962
I stood so close behind you.

44
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:46,682
Could you feel my breath on your neck, Hercule?

45
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:01,012
Plenty will say that it is vanity.

46
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:05,092
"That puffed up, pompous
peacock Poirot," they'll say.

47
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:09,842
And they'll laugh at you behind your back,

48
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:12,092
but I'm not laughing

49
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:14,812
because it's not vanity.

50
00:07:18,347 --> 00:07:20,922
I think you're trying to roll
back the time to when you were

51
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:23,731
a famous detective.

52
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:28,042
When you were celebrated,
when you were wanted

53
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:32,922
when you were loved.

54
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:43,252
I have never been loved,

55
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:44,731
but I will be feared.

56
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,842
I will be a faceless beast,

57
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:52,972
leading lambs to the slaughter.

58
00:08:11,197 --> 00:08:14,762
I need to speak to Inspector
Japp on a matter of urgency.

59
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:17,172
I know the way. He's not here.

60
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,122
Where is he?

61
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:21,281
Hoeing his cabbages, most like.

62
00:08:21,306 --> 00:08:23,281
Just a regular civilian now.

63
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:27,731
He retired? Mm-hm. Who took over from him?

64
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:30,372
That'll be young Inspector Crome, sir.

65
00:08:30,397 --> 00:08:32,972
Then I'll speak to him.
He's out on a case at the moment.

66
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:37,731
Take a seat with the other members
of the public, if you'd be so good.

67
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:06,531
Inspector Crome, sir.

68
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:11,092
Hercule Poirot.

69
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:42,082
I will be a faceless beast
leading lambs to the slaughter.

70
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:44,922
Inspector Japp-

71
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:48,252
"I'm going to do something
for both of us, Hercule.

72
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:51,452
"I'm getting my ducks in a row, as they say.

73
00:09:51,477 --> 00:09:53,172
"I'll let you know when I'm ready.

74
00:09:53,197 --> 00:09:57,812
"Until then, chin-chin. ABC."

75
00:09:57,837 --> 00:10:02,022
Every letter from ABC has a different postmark.

76
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:05,922
I keep the envelopes.
They're different from the others.

77
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:08,812
What others? THE others.

78
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:14,052
A small selection, presented solely
for comparison of tone and intent.

79
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:22,281
"You're not better than us. Piss off, Froggy."

80
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:27,502
19 years I've lived here,
and still people think I'm French.

81
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:29,922
Are they all like this? Mm.

82
00:10:31,636 --> 00:10:35,332
You should have said you were retiring.

83
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:37,562
I would have raised a glass to you.

84
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:42,781
Ah, didn't want to make a big
song and dance. Just did it quietly.

85
00:10:45,717 --> 00:10:50,692
Japp, why wouldn't Inspector Crome see me?

86
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:54,202
Well, you know what young men are like.
Want to make their name.

87
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:57,281
He's a good lad, though. Just give him time.

88
00:10:57,306 --> 00:10:59,411
Why do you keep these?

89
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:02,411
You should chuck them in
the bin where they belong.

90
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:04,452
They come every day, Japp-

91
00:11:06,077 --> 00:11:10,692
The letters from ABC are polite, sympathetic,

92
00:11:10,717 --> 00:11:12,531
almost friendly.

93
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:14,972
They scare me the most.

94
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:17,812
And there is something wrong about them.

95
00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:21,611
I cannot put my finger on
what is wrong about them.

96
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:25,281
Something wrong with them?
Everything's wrong with them!

97
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:28,892
"I will be a faceless beast."
This bloke's off his crust!

98
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:33,361
You're out of sorts.

99
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:37,332
Too much on your own.

100
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:41,172
Now, if you were busy,
you'd see these for what they are -

101
00:11:41,197 --> 00:11:43,052
nasty, cruel people,

102
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,692
and some mad bloke playing
a vicious game with you,

103
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:47,812
and you'd chuck the whole sorry lot of them.

104
00:11:56,636 --> 00:11:58,812
I've baked a ham.

105
00:11:58,837 --> 00:12:00,531
Got some spuds.

106
00:12:00,556 --> 00:12:02,462
Nice red cabbage.

107
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:04,462
Come and have supper.

108
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:07,002
Jam roly-poly with custard for pudding.

109
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:10,332
Quelle horreur! English food. Come on.

110
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:12,462
We'll set the world to rights.

111
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:14,741
Even got some brandy left over from Christmas.

112
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:19,972
I could use the company too, if I'm honest.

113
00:12:19,997 --> 00:12:22,852
If it is a favour to you, then I accept.

114
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:24,281
Smashing.

115
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:27,252
But first, I'm burning these.

116
00:12:27,277 --> 00:12:30,611
Every last single one of them.

117
00:12:30,636 --> 00:12:31,642
Japp

118
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:34,491
thank you, my friend.

119
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,132
Close the shed for me
and we'll head straight off.

120
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:05,052
Japp?

121
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:09,572
Japp? Japp?

122
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:17,972
Good morning to you, madam.

123
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:20,621
Do I have the privilege of
addressing Mrs Alice Asher?

124
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:24,052
Yes, but don't waste your
breath on the patter, sunshine.

125
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:28,262
I'm not buying anything and I've a
sandwich waiting, so on your way.

126
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:31,411
You don't know what I'm selling yet, Mrs Asher.

127
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:19,652
The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.

128
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:21,132
Blessed be the Lord.

129
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:27,462
Man that is born of woman
hath but a short time to live

130
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:10,182
Inspector Crome! Do not make me
chase you through a graveyard!

131
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:12,212
It's beneath both our dignities!

132
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:18,491
Mr Poirot. I need you to speak
to your colleagues in Andover.

133
00:17:18,516 --> 00:17:20,052
About what?

134
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:21,291
Murder.

135
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:33,822
This was Japp's office.

136
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:35,491
It was.

137
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:42,212
You still do those murder
parties, in the big houses?

138
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:44,732
Like when you were a celebrity?

139
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:46,062
Odd thing to do -

140
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:49,012
rich people pretending to be murdered.

141
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:50,411
Grisly.

142
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,291
There's no longer the demand.

143
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:55,132
Mr Poirot

144
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,092
you appear to be melting.

145
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:07,012
Must have been jolly though,

146
00:18:07,037 --> 00:18:09,291
cavorting with the gentry.

147
00:18:09,316 --> 00:18:11,452
The bright young things.

148
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:12,702
The aristos.

149
00:18:13,757 --> 00:18:15,732
Playing at death.

150
00:18:15,757 --> 00:18:18,182
Fun while it lasted.

151
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:22,291
Inspector Crome,
have I caused you some offence?

152
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:27,512
Do you mean me personally,
or me collectively, as in the force?

153
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:29,572
Both.

154
00:18:29,597 --> 00:18:32,541
What offence do you think you
might have caused, Mr Poirot?

155
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:35,902
You're the great detective,
the solver of impenetrable clues.

156
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:38,132
You work it out.

157
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:39,732
Yelland.

158
00:18:39,757 --> 00:18:43,132
So I've spoken in depth to
our colleagues at Andover, sir,

159
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:45,291
and received details of all crimes committed

160
00:18:45,316 --> 00:18:47,541
on the 31st of March, 1933, to wit:

161
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:51,012
a dog running off with some laundry,
a bicycle thrown in a river,

162
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:54,182
an altercation involving a
set of dentures. Dentures?

163
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:58,371
Yes, sir, the miscreant being one
Herbert "Humpy" Morris, who

164
00:18:58,396 --> 00:19:02,732
requested that a passing lady give
him a smile to which she responded

165
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:06,782
with some choice Anglo-Saxon,
whereupon Morris threw his dentures

166
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:11,212
at her, the lady stamped on them
and it all turned into quite the to-do.

167
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:14,732
What else? The usual run of drunk
and disorderlies and breaches of

168
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:18,262
the peace, punch-ups,
soliciting and a boy broke the window of

169
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:21,782
Asher's tobacconists but Mrs
Asher didn't answer the door

170
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:25,212
so the constable concluded
she was in the public house,

171
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:28,212
as she was often wont to be,
taped some cardboard over

172
00:19:28,237 --> 00:19:32,092
the window and let the young lad
off with a clip round the lug-hole.

173
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:34,491
No murders. No, sir.

174
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:36,491
No corpse in the library.

175
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:40,652
No silver candlestick rammed
in some heiress' eye socket.

176
00:19:40,677 --> 00:19:43,572
No twitching guts in the conservatory.

177
00:19:45,597 --> 00:19:47,062
No, sir.

178
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:50,371
Well, there we are then.

179
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:54,142
I hope that puts your mind at rest.

180
00:19:56,117 --> 00:19:58,782
You know what day it is today, don't you?

181
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:00,452
The first of April.

182
00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:01,982
Fools' Day.

183
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,421
I think you've just been taken.

184
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:10,572
Your time and effort in
this matter are appreciated.

185
00:20:10,597 --> 00:20:14,062
Your time and effort in
this matter are appreciated.

186
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:20,062
Why's his chin all grey?

187
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:21,262
Don't ask.

188
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:02,621
Je vous salue, Marie, pleine de grace.

189
00:21:02,646 --> 00:21:04,862
Le Seigneur est avec vous.

190
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:07,452
Vous etes benie entre toutes les femmes

191
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:10,342
What offence do you think
you might have caused, Mr Poirot?

192
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:28,491
Je vous salue, Marie, pleine de grace.

193
00:21:28,516 --> 00:21:31,851
What offence do you think you
might have caused, Mr Poirot?

194
00:21:33,186 --> 00:21:34,771
What offence?

195
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:42,691
Je vous salue, Marie, pleine de grace.

196
00:21:42,716 --> 00:21:43,891
Le Seigneur est avec vous.

197
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,921
Breaches of the peace, punch-ups,

198
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:49,641
soliciting, and a boy broke the
window of Asher's tobacconists,

199
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,771
but Mrs Asher didn't answer the door
so the constable concluded she was

200
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:55,161
in the public house.

201
00:21:55,186 --> 00:21:56,851
Why is his chin all grey?

202
00:21:56,876 --> 00:21:59,081
Don't ask.

203
00:21:59,106 --> 00:22:02,181
What offence do you think you
might have caused, Mr Poirot?

204
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:04,931
What offence do you think you
might have caused, Mr Poirot?

205
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,571
The window of Asher's tobacconists.

206
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:09,211
What offence do you think you
might have caused, Mr Poirot?

207
00:22:09,236 --> 00:22:11,771
What offence do you think you
might have caused, Mr Poirot?

208
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:18,161
Assassin!

209
00:22:19,996 --> 00:22:22,081
Assassin.

210
00:22:36,276 --> 00:22:39,771
"I hope you're as excited as I am, Hercule.

211

The usual run
of drunk and disorderlies

Get in!

245
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:47,171
Going to the rope for this, you know that?

246
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:49,212
Going to crack your neck.

247
00:28:49,237 --> 00:28:50,702
It wasn't me.

248
00:28:50,727 --> 00:28:53,291
Balls. It isn't him.

249
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:57,371
Use your eyes, Detective Bunce.

250
00:28:57,396 --> 00:29:01,171
Alice Asher's neighbour said he
was always threatening his wife,

251
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:04,621
that he said he was going to cut her throat,

252
00:29:04,646 --> 00:29:07,012
then he was going to cut her head clean off

253
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:10,251
and he practically did cut her head clean off.

254
00:29:10,276 --> 00:29:12,782
Her head? Her head was cut off?

255
00:29:12,807 --> 00:29:14,262
Like you don't know.

256
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:18,371
To inflict such a mortal wound with
a weapon inadequate to the task

257
00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:20,652
requires great strength.

258
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:23,092
Monsieur Asher is a dipsomaniac.

259
00:29:23,117 --> 00:29:25,212
He has delirium tremens.

260
00:29:25,237 --> 00:29:28,371
He could not strike a match,
let alone wield a knife.

261
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:32,092
And where is the blood?
He's not washed his hands.

262
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:35,782
There would be blood ingrained
in the beds of his fingernails,

263
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,452
the skin of his knuckles, his wrists,

264
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:42,621
the cuffs of his shirt.
There would be blood everywhere.

265
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:44,932
It isn't him.

266
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:48,572
He bought some gloves and
then he chucked them after.

267
00:29:48,597 --> 00:29:53,812
Mon dieu, Detective Bunce,
you are no student of human frailty.

268
00:29:54,316 --> 00:29:58,062
Any money he has, he spends on his demon.

269
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,982
On alcohol.

270
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,782
He would not buy gloves.

271
00:30:01,807 --> 00:30:04,572
And the cash register was undisturbed.

272
00:30:04,597 --> 00:30:07,342
If money were the motive,
he would have taken it.

273
00:30:11,597 --> 00:30:15,371
You reckon you know it all, don't you? Hm?

274
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,291
Well, you don't.

275
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,892
Case closed.

276
00:31:12,157 --> 00:31:14,972
If Mum knew what you were really like, Betty.

277
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:19,241
If Donald knew.

278
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:20,802
He'll find out.

279
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:24,052
But not before I get bored of him.
Because he is boring, Megan.

280
00:31:24,077 --> 00:31:27,882
The only thing interesting
about him is his pay packet.

281
00:31:27,907 --> 00:31:29,882
He is so boring.

282
00:31:29,907 --> 00:31:31,932
It's like talking to a plate.

283
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:34,052
How did you put up with him?

284
00:31:34,077 --> 00:31:35,212
I loved him.

285
00:31:37,157 --> 00:31:41,882
All I had to do was click my
fingers and he came running.

286
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:44,361
Threw you over like you were nothing.

287
00:31:44,386 --> 00:31:47,002
I did you a favour there, Megan.

288
00:31:47,027 --> 00:31:51,002
One day you'll see that and
maybe then you'll stop being

289
00:31:51,027 --> 00:31:54,212
such a sour, joyless, vinegar tits.

290
00:31:54,237 --> 00:31:56,932
Anyway

291
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,052
sweet dreams.

292
00:33:05,677 --> 00:33:10,491
"Hello, Hercule.
What did you think of Mrs Asher?

293
00:33:10,516 --> 00:33:12,962
"She made a terrible mess."

294
00:33:12,987 --> 00:33:17,161
"You know what's next, don't you?

295
00:33:17,186 --> 00:33:19,052
"B"

296
00:33:19,077 --> 00:33:22,161
"But which B? And when?"

297
00:33:23,547 --> 00:33:24,652
"Chin-chin."

298
00:33:28,077 --> 00:33:30,132
“A-

299
00:33:30,157 --> 00:33:32,522
B-

300
00:33:32,547 --> 00:33:33,602
C"

301
00:33:48,757 --> 00:33:51,772
I should see the other chap, eh?

302
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,602
Were you fighting over a girl?

303
00:33:53,627 --> 00:33:55,491
No.

304
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:57,082
Oh, that's a shame.

305
00:33:57,107 --> 00:33:59,802
Girls love being fought over.

306
00:33:59,827 --> 00:34:02,411
Makes us feel all wanted and desirable.

307
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:06,732
What you got in there?

308
00:34:06,757 --> 00:34:08,522
Family silver?

309
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:12,012
I'm in sales.

310
00:34:12,037 --> 00:34:13,371
I travel

311
00:34:13,396 --> 00:34:14,602
with what I sell.

312
00:34:14,627 --> 00:34:17,692
It's polite to use a girl's name, you know.

313
00:34:20,107 --> 00:34:21,882
Betty.

314
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:23,802
Now we're friends.

315
00:34:23,827 --> 00:34:25,852
What do you sell, then?

316
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:40,241
Miss Barnard, table nine is waiting.
Just coming, Mrs Welk.

317
00:34:40,396 --> 00:34:43,732
Oh, I'm definitely keeping these.

318
00:34:43,757 --> 00:34:45,491
They're lovely.

319
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,442
And very reasonably priced.

320
00:34:50,597 --> 00:34:52,652
I mean, if you're too busy now to get your purse,

321
00:34:52,677 --> 00:34:54,932
I can come back when
you've finished your shift?

322
00:34:54,957 --> 00:34:58,012
Oh, no, I don't pay for things.

323
00:34:58,037 --> 00:34:59,882
Men give them to me.

324
00:34:59,907 --> 00:35:03,962
I can't. This is my livelihood.

325
00:35:03,987 --> 00:35:06,291
You're a virgin, aren't you?

326
00:35:07,436 --> 00:35:08,772
What?

327
00:35:08,797 --> 00:35:12,452
You should be grateful that anything
you've touched is now touching me.

328
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:18,572
This is the closest you're
ever going to get to my legs.

329
00:35:18,597 --> 00:35:21,652
Now slither off and play with
yourself thinking about that.

330
00:36:12,657 --> 00:36:15,271
And that's how you play backgammon.

331
00:36:29,097 --> 00:36:30,632
Not your night.

332
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:35,752
You're breaking my heart.

333
00:37:07,817 --> 00:37:10,192
Thank you.

334
00:37:10,217 --> 00:37:12,192
Get your sweaty hands off me.

335
00:37:12,217 --> 00:37:14,122
You owe me for the stockings.

336
00:37:19,097 --> 00:37:22,151
Debt paid. Virgin.

337
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:42,351
Donald. You're coming home with me.
Let go, you dozy bastard.

338
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:45,872
You stay here, we're through
- I won't marry you.

339
00:37:47,457 --> 00:37:50,151
Oh, my broken heart.

340
00:37:50,176 --> 00:37:53,872
I have a chap in here who's got
more about him than you'll ever have.

341
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,021
So off you trot and stop getting on my nerves.

342
00:38:02,937 --> 00:38:04,712
Don't run after him, Megan.

343
00:38:05,897 --> 00:38:07,792
Have some bloody dignity.

344
00:38:37,787 --> 00:38:41,072
"You know what's next, don't you?

345
00:38:41,097 --> 00:38:42,912
“B.

346
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:45,712
"But which B?"

347
00:40:16,506 --> 00:40:18,481
Who is she?

348
00:40:18,506 --> 00:40:20,021
Elizabeth Barnard.

349
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:21,992
Known as Betty.

350
00:40:22,017 --> 00:40:24,351
She works down at the Ginger Cat Cafe.

351
00:42:02,506 --> 00:42:04,351
My darling.

352
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:07,642
My special darling baby!

353
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:11,351
Who? Who would do something like this?

354
00:42:11,376 --> 00:42:12,762
Who?

355
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:18,151
I've just been told.

356
00:42:18,176 --> 00:42:19,842
It can't be true.

357
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:25,062
Someone took our girl from us,
Donald. Our perfect angel!

358
00:42:27,817 --> 00:42:29,512
What are we going to do without her?

359
00:42:31,587 --> 00:42:33,592
I'll make some tea.

360
00:42:40,306 --> 00:42:43,281
I thought you might require some assistance.

361
00:42:46,056 --> 00:42:48,312
"Our special darling.

362
00:42:48,337 --> 00:42:49,872
"Our perfect angel."

363
00:42:49,897 --> 00:42:52,592
Betty wasn't either of those things.
My sister was a slut.

364
00:42:52,617 --> 00:42:55,361
Mademoiselle, your sister is dead.

365
00:42:55,386 --> 00:42:57,512
She was still a slut.

366
00:42:57,537 --> 00:42:59,481
I can make the tea by myself.

367
00:43:15,947 --> 00:43:18,392
Do you want your walk? Mm?

368
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:21,562
Do you? Oh, very well.

369
00:43:23,337 --> 00:43:24,922
I've finished my work.

370
00:43:24,947 --> 00:43:26,922
Would you mind if I joined you, Sir Carmichael?

371
00:43:26,947 --> 00:43:29,922
Not at all, but it is quite wild out there.

372
00:43:29,947 --> 00:43:31,952
Well, I could use the fresh air.

373
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:34,082
And wild weather is exhilarating.

374
00:43:34,107 --> 00:43:37,872
Ha! Well, in that case, we'd love your company.

375
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:40,722
Come on, Wilbur. Come on.

376
00:43:40,747 --> 00:43:42,432
Come on.

377
00:43:42,457 --> 00:43:43,512
Franklin?

378
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:49,872
Go with them.

379
00:43:53,617 --> 00:43:56,592
You're the best brother-in-law a girl could have.

380
00:43:56,617 --> 00:43:59,592
Darling, I'm the only brother-in-law you have.

381
00:44:21,256 --> 00:44:26,512
♪ I think of you, night and day

382
00:44:27,867 --> 00:44:30,512
♪ Day and night ♪

383
00:44:31,867 --> 00:44:34,442
You're Mr Cust.

384
00:44:34,467 --> 00:44:35,562
Yes.

385
00:44:37,027 --> 00:44:38,952
Is there something you want?

386
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:45,442
Is your mother in? She's out.

387
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:48,031
One of her meetings. She'll be ages

388
00:44:48,056 --> 00:44:51,002
and be rat-arsed when she gets in.

389
00:44:51,027 --> 00:44:52,122
I see.

390
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:56,752
Did you want to book?

391
00:45:00,176 --> 00:45:02,512
Cos if you did, you could book direct with me.

392
00:45:02,537 --> 00:45:04,231
Then I could keep the money.

393
00:45:04,256 --> 00:45:06,312
It could be just our arrangement.

394
00:45:12,947 --> 00:45:15,562
She tell you what it was?

395
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,952
Shilling for ordinary.

396
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:20,231
This isn't ordinary.

397
00:45:20,256 --> 00:45:22,082
It never is, Mr Cust.

398
00:45:22,107 --> 00:45:23,752
It never is.

399
00:45:59,977 --> 00:46:02,442
I see what you're doing! Whore!

400
00:46:02,467 --> 00:46:04,642
For God's sake! I see what you are! Capstick!

401
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:08,002
She's the secretary, she's staff.

402
00:46:08,027 --> 00:46:10,361
She's trying to take you away from me, Car.

403
00:46:10,386 --> 00:46:12,842
Come on, my darling.
Come on, let's get you to bed.

404
00:46:12,867 --> 00:46:18,082
She can't wait for me to be dead.

405
00:46:28,157 --> 00:46:30,802
Sorry, Thora. She doesn't mean any of it.

406
00:46:30,827 --> 00:46:32,281
It's not really her speaking.

407
00:46:42,587 --> 00:46:43,722
Thank you, Lily.

408
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:45,562
Mr Cust.

409
00:47:04,587 --> 00:47:06,752
Yes, Mr Treadgold.

410
00:48:24,177 --> 00:48:27,232
Warrant to search and seize
evidence pertaining to crime,

411
00:48:27,257 --> 00:48:29,873
evidence which you have withheld
from the proper authorities.

412
00:48:29,898 --> 00:48:35,093
When I tried to tell you about it,
you told me it was April Fools' Day.

413
00:48:35,377 --> 00:48:38,843
Please listen to me, Inspector Crome.

414
00:48:38,868 --> 00:48:41,563
A copy of the ABC railway guide

415
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:46,763
was left beside the bodies of both
dead women. Do you know why?

416
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:51,352
It is the killer telling us "les regles du jeu"

417
00:48:51,377 --> 00:48:53,313
the rules of the game.

418
00:48:53,338 --> 00:48:55,352
Every railway line,

419
00:48:55,377 --> 00:49:00,513
any station, in the country,
all letters of the alphabet.

420
00:49:00,658 --> 00:49:03,793
That is private! Warrant.

421
00:49:11,538 --> 00:49:14,923
"Dear Monsieur Poirot, my wife and I think

422
00:49:14,948 --> 00:49:16,743
"you're really rather marvellous."

423
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,232
Old fan letters. Sweet.

424
00:49:22,698 --> 00:49:24,873
Pack the lot. You don't need them.

425
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:26,843
He knows you,

426
00:49:26,868 --> 00:49:28,102
the killer

427
00:49:30,127 --> 00:49:32,073
so we'll be going through everything.

428
00:49:32,098 --> 00:49:34,383
Nothing's private any more.

429
00:49:34,408 --> 00:49:36,713
This was on the mat.

430
00:49:36,738 --> 00:49:38,032
I'll read it to you.

431
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,232
What is the postmark?

432
00:49:43,738 --> 00:49:46,352
Cricklewood.

433
00:49:46,377 --> 00:49:48,563
"Hello, Hercule."

434
00:49:48,588 --> 00:49:51,152
"Betty was a pretty girl, wasn't she?

435
00:49:51,177 --> 00:49:52,463
"There was a moment

436
00:49:52,488 --> 00:49:56,232
"when she realised that death
was waiting with open arms.

437
00:49:56,257 --> 00:49:58,563
"She surrendered to me

438
00:49:58,588 --> 00:50:02,563
"and I leaned over her
and inhaled her last breath

439
00:50:04,618 --> 00:50:08,793
"..drew it into my mouth and it tasted so sweet.

440
00:50:08,818 --> 00:50:11,393
"I felt my blood sing with its sweetness.

441
00:50:12,978 --> 00:50:14,793
"But I'm tired, Hercule,

442
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:18,563
"so we'll have a little rest and
we'll pick up where we left off.

443
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:22,393
"Chin-chin."

444
00:50:32,257 --> 00:50:35,313
Telephone the doctor now.
I'm not here for domestic duties.

445
00:50:35,338 --> 00:50:38,352
You telephone the doctor or
get one of the maids to do it.

446
00:50:38,377 --> 00:50:40,753
I am carrying a bowl of her
ladyship's blood that she's

447
00:50:40,778 --> 00:50:44,073
just coughed up and the maids are
changing her blood-soaked sheets

448
00:50:44,098 --> 00:50:47,313
so get off your skinny arse
and telephone the doctor. Now.

449
00:51:11,177 --> 00:51:13,313
Thora, tell him to hurry.

450
00:51:13,338 --> 00:51:15,203
She's in a lot of pain.

451
00:51:15,228 --> 00:51:17,003
Of course.

452
00:51:46,498 --> 00:51:49,593
I'll send a constable morning
and evening to collect your post.

453
00:51:49,618 --> 00:51:52,362
And don't make any more
day trips to crime scenes.

454
00:51:52,387 --> 00:51:54,643
You will not catch ABC without me.

455
00:51:54,668 --> 00:51:55,923
Yes, I will.

456
00:51:57,208 --> 00:52:00,753
My friend Inspector Japp had the grace and wit

457
00:52:00,778 --> 00:52:04,593
to know the limitations of his intellect.

458
00:52:04,618 --> 00:52:07,232
I wish you had one ounce of his humility.

459
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:11,593
Your friend, Japp, who you deceived,
who you lied to for years.

460
00:52:11,618 --> 00:52:12,953
I never lied.

461
00:52:12,978 --> 00:52:15,923
You told him you were a
policeman in Belgium before the war,

462
00:52:15,948 --> 00:52:17,923
a detective, but you weren't.

463
00:52:17,948 --> 00:52:21,393
Questions were asked about you,
high up in the food chain.

464
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:25,032
Questions about me? Why?
I have served this country.

465
00:52:25,057 --> 00:52:29,003
People don't like it when the force
are made to look like half-wits

466
00:52:29,028 --> 00:52:30,593
by a foreigner.

467
00:52:30,618 --> 00:52:34,003
It's out of step with the public
mood so questions were asked.

468
00:52:34,028 --> 00:52:36,313
Japp swore that you were genuine.

469
00:52:36,338 --> 00:52:39,003
That was him, loyal as a dog.

470
00:52:40,307 --> 00:52:44,313
But you were looked into
and there's no record of you.

471
00:52:44,338 --> 00:52:48,433
You are lucky you never
lived through an invasion.

472
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:51,112
Things are burnt. Buildings. People.

473
00:52:51,137 --> 00:52:53,003
Records turned to ash.

474
00:52:53,028 --> 00:52:55,953
No-one had ever heard your name.

475
00:52:57,468 --> 00:52:59,593
No Hercule Poirot registered

476
00:52:59,618 --> 00:53:02,723
anywhere in the Belgian police before 1914.

477
00:53:02,748 --> 00:53:05,643
Japp staked his reputation,
his whole career on you

478
00:53:05,668 --> 00:53:07,193
and that was him over.

479
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:10,833
His funeral should have been
packed, a guard of honour,

480
00:53:10,858 --> 00:53:14,753
but all he got was a handful
of old timers and you and me.

481
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:19,793
He didn't die of a heart attack.
I reckon he just broke.

482
00:53:19,818 --> 00:53:22,473
And that's down to you and your lying.

483
00:53:22,498 --> 00:53:23,923
He told me none of this.

Inspector Crome,

485
00:53:25,948 --> 00:53:28,443
I gave my word to the dead.

486
00:53:28,468 --> 00:53:32,282
I cannot abandon them. I must not.

487
00:53:34,057 --> 00:53:36,313
Your word is worthless.

488
00:53:37,778 --> 00:53:40,563
You're not who you say you are.

489
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:42,032
Who the hell are you?

490
00:53:58,538 --> 00:54:00,193
Ils arrivent!

491
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:03,673
Ils arrivent!

1
00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:09,286
"Barbarian's Gate 3"
is being released today,

2
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:11,251
so I need everybody on their A-game,

3
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:13,887
as this store is going to be
packed with video game nerds.

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,656
And we don't want to risk a trampling.

5
00:00:15,658 --> 00:00:17,841
Well, we're never going
to totally prevent tramplings.

6
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:20,994
Oh, no, obviously we're never
going to have zero tramplings,

7
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:23,464
but we can have fewer tramplings.

8
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:25,321
Um, can I set one of
the video games aside

9
00:00:25,322 --> 00:00:26,392
before we sell out?

10
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,770
Amy, employees can't reserve
merchandise, you know this.

11
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:32,506
- You're into video games?
- After a long day of work,

12
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:34,508
It's nice to have a glass
of wine and reach into

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,477
a stable boy's chest and pull
out his still-beating heart.

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,432
Feed the birds.

15
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:38,779
I just don't get how

16
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:41,615
murdering people is considered fun.

17
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:43,917
I mean, what happened
to all those innocent games?

18
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,287
You know, like "Frogger,"
and "Qbert," and "Donkey Kong."

19
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:49,823
Innocent? "Qbert" is about
a big-nosed, creepily little

20
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:52,226
freak that commits suicide
when things get hard.

21
00:00:52,228 --> 00:00:54,561
"Frogger" is basically a frog Holocaust.

22
00:00:54,563 --> 00:00:58,307
I remember a glitch in
the original "Donkey Kong"

23
00:00:58,307 --> 00:01:00,938
where it looks like the ape has a penis.

24
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:04,498
Sometimes when I'm playing "The
Sims," I give myself a family.

25
00:01:07,376 --> 00:01:08,475
Jesus Christ.

Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

27
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,382
The nerd smell is overwhelming.

28
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:22,876
It's like a potent blend of

29
00:01:22,877 --> 00:01:24,704
BO, pizza rolls, and misogyny.

30
00:01:25,063 --> 00:01:28,465
Hey, Dina, so I know that
employees aren't supposed

31
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:30,595
to set aside merch,
but I was just wondering

32
00:01:30,596 --> 00:01:32,657
if maybe you'd want to make an exception

33
00:01:32,658 --> 00:01:33,879
for your best friend?

34
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,613
My old best friend
is currently in prison

35
00:01:35,614 --> 00:01:37,019
for cheating on her taxes.

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,428
Ask her if I'm willing
to "make an exception."

37
00:01:40,922 --> 00:01:43,250
Ugh, hair gel and urine.

38
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:45,905
I can't, I can't.

39
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:50,097
Oh, come on, three of them?
That's not fair.

40
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:52,099
They're going to sell out
before my shift is over.

41
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:53,917
Why don't you just
sneak one out of the cage

42
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:55,869
- and put it aside for later?
- No, it's fine.

43
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:57,905
I guess I'll just wait
until we get another restock.

44
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:59,707
Oh, but you shouldn't have to.

45
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:02,229
- You des...
- Don't say "you deserve this."

46
00:02:02,878 --> 00:02:04,862
- I wasn't going to say that.
- What were you going to say?

47
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:07,096
You... deserve this.

48
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:09,550
Okay, you're right, I do deserve this.

49
00:02:09,552 --> 00:02:11,485
I deserve to disembowel warlocks.

50
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:12,920
Yes, you... do.

51
00:02:12,922 --> 00:02:14,738
- Then let's do this.
- Let's do this.

52
00:02:15,773 --> 00:02:17,291
Oh, yep, urine.

53
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:20,686
Thank you so much for coming by.

54
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:23,364
Hey, how you doing, Mr. Evans?

55
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:24,832
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

56
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,301
I'm a huge fan of your voiceover work.

57
00:02:27,303 --> 00:02:30,217
In fact, my text alert
is you from "Alpha Strike"

58
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:32,406
saying "Decapitation bonus!"

59
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:35,142
Decapitation bonus!

60
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:37,812
That is awesome!

61
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,154
- Thanks.
- Yeah, cool, well, hey.

62
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,434
That's all I wanted to say.

63
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:42,989
You know, I just think you're great,

64
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,119
and you know, you mean the world to me.

65
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:46,920
- Okay.
- That's...

66
00:02:46,922 --> 00:02:48,576
that sounded weird.

67
00:02:48,577 --> 00:02:50,577
I mean, not the world,
but a lot, you know?

68
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,527
You, you mean a lot to me.

69
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:57,017
Oh, my mouth, my mouth is so dry.

70
00:02:59,785 --> 00:03:02,689
Yeah, yeah, I can taste it.

71
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,909
If we could just, like, move,
and make a line to the side.

72
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:10,778
And then people could pass on this side.

73
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,715
And if we then...
if we could all go this way.

74
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:16,669
Sandra, we need this area clear.

75
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,427
- This is a fire hazard.
- I know.

76
00:03:18,428 --> 00:03:20,926
I told them and they told me
that my butt's a fire hazard.

77
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:22,228
I'm trying to think of a comeback.

78
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:26,621
Okay, guys, I really need you
to make a line that way.

79
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:28,201
Okay?

80
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:32,616
Attention, all soft boys.
Get off your butts,

81
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:34,709
and move to the side, now!

82
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:37,226
The first person to step out of line

83
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:39,745
is going to get my foot in their throat.

84
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:42,773
Use... less.

85
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:44,128
Useless.

86
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:49,915
Come on.

87
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:53,904
You try. Your arms are longer.

88
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:54,993
Me? Yeah, but you know,

89
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,063
I think my bicep
might be a little big for...

90
00:03:57,135 --> 00:03:58,864
Oh, hey. Slipped right in there.

91
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:00,833
Mmm, not long enough.

92
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:09,038
Well, I guess I'll just stick to
"Barbarian's Gate 2," like a commoner.

93
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,370
Wait, what's that back there?

94
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,041
- Is that a door?
- Um, maybe.

95
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,869
It kind of just looks like a closet.

96
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:19,030
Or it's another way into the cage.

97
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:21,171
- Like an access tunnel.
- You know,

98
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:24,350
Glenn does still have the plans
from the renovation.

99
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:28,111
We could break into his
office, steal the blueprints,

100
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:29,562
and navigate our way around the...

101
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:31,397
Okay, you don't have to mock me.

102
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,208
We crawl through the tunnel
and then we jimmy the door...

103
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:36,179
- I was only trying to help...
- I'm agreeing with you!

104
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,590
Oh. Cool, all right.

105
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:40,599
Well, uh, let's do this, then.

106
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,008
It'll be like a little adventure.

107
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,960
Yeah, it's going to be
the adventure of a lifetime.

108
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:45,755
- Was that...
- Sarcasm.

109
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:46,701
Definitely.

110
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,160
Okay, so it seems like
there's another access point

111
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:52,478
on this floor right around...

112
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:55,575
- uh, this office.
- Really, where?

113
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,655
According to this, it's right there.

114
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:01,066
Well, there's clearly nothing there.

115
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,328
To the naked eye.

116
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:04,417
There might be a false wall, you know?

117
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:06,386
The thing about drywall is,
you have to listen to it.

118
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:08,121
- Because it sings a song.
- Oh.

119
00:05:08,123 --> 00:05:10,537
It lets you know where you need to go.

120
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:11,475
Uh-huh.

121
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:14,815
What I'm trying to do right now
is find a hollow spot, okay?

122
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:18,626
They're pretty much all hollow spots.

123
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,567
Maybe this is it?

124
00:05:22,082 --> 00:05:22,826
Oh.

125
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:24,666
I'm just guessing.

126
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:27,607
I see what I did there.

127
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:30,972
I confused the title block
and the revision block.

128
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:33,391
Totally, yeah,
that happens all the time.

129
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,995
Do you know why
we're always the victims?

130
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:37,917
Because...

131
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:40,999
I'm sorry, Glenn, I don't know.

132
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:43,802
It's because we make
ourselves the victim.

133
00:05:43,804 --> 00:05:45,904
But I am done being a doormat.

134
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:47,365
It would be nice
not to get pushed around.

135
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:49,415
- Yeah.
- My mailman uses the bathroom

136
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,069
in my apartment every day.

137
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:54,289
He used to knock, but then
he made me make him a key.

138
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:55,647
So...

139
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:57,410
Well, no more.

140
00:05:58,361 --> 00:06:00,552
Yeah, from now on,

141
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:02,671
we are going to stand up for ourselves.

142
00:06:02,673 --> 00:06:03,905
Okay, I guess.

143
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:05,724
Come on, say it like you mean it.

144
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:06,858
Okay, I guess!

145
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,235
That's the spirit!

146
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:10,377
Ah, got to get back to work.

147
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:11,429
- Right.
- Good talking with you.

148
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,226
No problem.

149
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,886
Do you have any idea
who you were just talking to?

150
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:17,502
- Who, that guy?
- Yeah, that's Erick Evans.

151
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:19,804
He's been nominated for like,
five DICE awards.

152
00:06:20,342 --> 00:06:21,973
- Okay.
- He's a legend.

153
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:24,064
That's like if you met J. Lo.

154
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:26,560
Oh, what, just because
I'm gay, I like J. Lo?

155
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:29,704
I mean, I do, she's flawless.
But expand your mind.

156
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:30,887
What did you guys talk about?

157
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:32,416
I don't know, just small talk.

158
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:35,825
Tell me everything he said.

159
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:37,577
Fine, ugh.

160
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:38,928
He was like,

161
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,864
"There's so much traffic
on Delmar this morning."

162
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:43,433
And I was like, "You're right,
Delmar was bumper to bumper."

163
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:44,734
- Forget it.
- No, no, wait.

164
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:45,869
I haven't gotten to the juicy part yet.

165
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:47,470
So, apparently,

166
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,472
he doesn't think his Taurus
has enough power.

167
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:50,623
Yeah, whatever, dude.

168
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,333
Hi, ma'am.

169
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:56,362
Once again, mouth breathers,
this is not personal.

170
00:06:56,846 --> 00:06:58,381
It's not about who you are.

171
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,350
It's about how you smell.

172
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:02,869
And your stench is overwhelming.

173
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:06,184
This is not attacking
any one individual.

174
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:08,769
Although if I had to
single out the stink king,

175
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,308
it would for sure be
fatty in the purple hoodie.

176
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,650
Ugh.

177
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:14,681
Whoa.

178
00:07:15,556 --> 00:07:17,005
I can't believe I've never been

179
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:18,546
in this part of the store before.

180
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:21,402
Figured at some point during
your illustrious Cloud 9 tenure

181
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:22,612
you would have ventured back here.

182
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:24,138
No, I think they give you access

183
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:27,572
to the bowels of the store at
15 years, so I'm almost there.

184
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:30,057
Well, this is weird.
According to the blueprints,

185
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:33,575
there should be a ladder,
like, right here.

186
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:39,916
Oh, yes, right there.

187
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:12,537
- Hey, Sandra.
- Mm-hmm?

188
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:14,398
You think all these other sweaters

189
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,669
are just going to magically
get up and fold themselves?

190
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:21,503
No, Glenn, because magic
doesn't [bleep] exist!

191
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:25,607
One per customer.

192
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:31,680
- Aww.
- Oh, my goodness.

193
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:34,263
The sign says "do not sit."

194
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,336
But I'm feeding my child, so...

195
00:08:36,338 --> 00:08:38,121
- Oh.
- "I'm feeding my child, so."

196
00:08:38,123 --> 00:08:39,596
No one cares. You're not special.

197
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:42,628
- Yeah, so could you scram?
- I'm trying, I'm just...

198
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:44,394
- Oh, you're trying? Vertical.
- You and your bag

199
00:08:44,396 --> 00:08:46,429
and your baby and your boobs need to go.

200
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:47,831
Tell you what, why don't you take

201
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,688
your cold French fries with you?

202
00:08:50,502 --> 00:08:52,435
This is ridiculous.

203
00:08:52,437 --> 00:08:54,281
- This is fun.
- I know!

204
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:55,528
Enjoy.

205
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:58,108
Hey, do you want coffee?

206
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,226
I accidentally got an extra one.

207
00:09:00,228 --> 00:09:01,592
So it's just going to go to waste.

208
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:03,212
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

209
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:05,389
- Oh, is there any...
- Almond milk.

210
00:09:06,307 --> 00:09:07,684
Because I know you're
lactose intolerant.

211
00:09:07,686 --> 00:09:09,185
- Yeah, yeah.
- Not because I'm stalking you

212
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:11,988
or anything like that, I just,
I read an interview, so.

213
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,039
- Right.
- Right.

214
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,547
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

215
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:26,553
This is an adventure.
It's like "The Goonies."

216
00:09:27,054 --> 00:09:29,355
- I never saw that.
- "The Goonies"?

217
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:31,595
How have you never seen "The Goonies"?

218
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:33,346
Well, it's a funny story actually,

219
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:36,059
when the movie came out,
I just didn't see it.

220
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,783
Oh, my God. It's Dina.

221
00:09:38,158 --> 00:09:39,890
Answer it. No, don't answer it.

222
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:41,544
Answer it.

223
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:42,709
How is this helpful?

224
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:46,559
Amy, where are you?
I need you in electronics.

225
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:49,084
One of the gamers is trying
to teach Alexa racial slurs.

226
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:51,018
Sir, if you put that
magnet on your armor,

227
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,641
you are buying it, I swear to God.

228
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:55,268
Um, I'm... I'm right here.

229
00:09:55,683 --> 00:09:57,270
<i>- Where?</i>
- Here.

230
00:09:57,272 --> 00:09:59,138
You can't see me?

231
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,906
Yeah, I don't see you.

232
00:10:00,908 --> 00:10:02,191
<i>Dina, I am right here.</i>

233
00:10:02,193 --> 00:10:04,460
Just, um, turn left.

234
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:06,479
<i>No, not, uh, the other way.</i>

235
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,248
<i>No... no, turn around, Dina.</i>

236
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,449
<i>I'm behind you.</i>

237
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:12,488
Oh, my God, um, can you hold on?

238
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:15,338
There's a customer who's
trying to get my attention.

239
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,974
<i>Hang on? No, Amy, I need you right now.</i>

240
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:21,160
I... I need a lawnmower.

241
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,663
Okay, I'm going to go help him, bye.

242
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:25,996
Amy? Amy?

243
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:29,502
- What is that voice?
- I'm sorry.

244
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,971
I never pass up an opportunity
to do a character.

245
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:33,523
- No.
- That's when I shine.

246
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:34,839
That is not okay.

247
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,493
- I was shining.
- No.

248
00:10:36,495 --> 00:10:38,691
Did you hear what that guy called me?

249
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:39,850
Sir!

250
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:42,621
I could get used to that, boy.

251
00:10:42,868 --> 00:10:45,637
"Oh, hello, sir. Good-bye, sir."

252
00:10:45,638 --> 00:10:47,036
And people could call me "ma'am."

253
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:48,471
"Get out of my way, ma'am."

254
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:50,749
That's the only one
I could think of, but...

255
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:02,285
Oh, hi. I came back with friends.

256
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:04,921
Say hi, say hi.

257
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,457
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, baby.

258
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:12,041
So, apparently, what's
happening is called a nurse in.

259
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:14,022
It's meant to promote
breastfeeding rights.

260
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:16,163
Wait, so they're going to
be doing this in public?

261
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:18,252
That's gross.

262
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:21,551
All I'm saying is that, from
a hetero male perspective,

263
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:23,804
the female breast is a beautiful thing.

264
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:25,290
And when we see milk
squirting out of it,

265
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:26,912
- it's a real boner-killer.
- all: Oh, my God.

266
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:29,640
I just want everyone to know
that I do not agree with this guy.

267
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:31,979
We allow breastfeeding,
so why are they protesting?

268
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,327
No one knows. Yeah, women are crazy.

269
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:36,744
- Well, it might be because...
- Shut up, Sandra.

270
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:38,680
No one knows, so why
don't we just move on?

271
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:40,932
Okay, so if women can show
their boobs in the store,

272
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,823
can I walk around
with my penis hanging out?

273
00:11:42,877 --> 00:11:44,759
You can't feed a baby with your penis.

274
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,046
But if I did, then it would be okay?

275
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,163
Wait, you're fighting for the right

276
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,209
to walk around the store
with your penis hanging out?

277
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,450
No, I'm just trying to figure
out where the line is here.

278
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:52,714
Yeah, I think the line is somewhere

279
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,366
between breast and penis.

280
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:56,342
Okay, these are all good points,

281
00:11:56,343 --> 00:11:59,504
but I think that maybe
we need a woman's perspective.

282
00:11:59,505 --> 00:12:02,075
- Well, I think, historically...
- I think a woman would say

283
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:04,010
she's just happy to be
a part of the conversation.

284
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:04,992
Why do they have to do it in public?

285
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:06,414
Why can't they just do it in their cars,

286
00:12:06,415 --> 00:12:08,248
or by the dumpsters? Right? Up top.

287
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,383
No, never gonna happen.

288
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:13,566
Again, maybe we could have
a woman's perspective?

289
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:17,826
In my day, we called a gal
who took her top off a whore.

290
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:20,202
There you are, the woman's perspective.

291
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:21,587
If breast milk is so healthy,

292
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:23,763
then why aren't we all
drinking it all the time?

293
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:25,015
Or making cheese with it?

294
00:12:25,017 --> 00:12:27,200
Hold on, business idea.

295
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,631
Human cheese.

296
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:30,837
Nobody steal that. I call patent.

297
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,572
- Oh, so gross.
- Gross?

298
00:12:32,574 --> 00:12:34,424
Are you telling me you'll
have sex with a woman,

299
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:36,525
but not a cow, but drink a cow's milk

300
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:37,561
and not a woman's?

301
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:39,696
Is that a real question? Of course.

302
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:40,930
Oh, boy.

303
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:42,582
We eat cows.

304
00:12:42,584 --> 00:12:44,384
I think what Garrett's
trying to say is that,

305
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:47,520
if we ate human women,
then we could drink their milk.

306
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:48,816
Oh, wow, Garrett,

307
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,106
- that is way too far.
- No, I'm not saying that...

308
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:51,671
Disgusting.

309
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:53,943
I want everybody to know,
I am not with this guy.

310
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:55,919
So, Chunk, a child, wants to adopt

311
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,790
a full-grown man with severe
physical and mental disabilities,

312
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,016
and his parents are just
like, fine with that?

313
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,886
Wait, what is this?

314
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,522
I'm not sure.

315
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:11,394
- Huh.
- What?

316
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:14,063
"Cindy Silly Stove."

317
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:15,343
Yikes.

318
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:19,865
Oh, my God, this must be the room

319
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,977
where they used to put
all the recalled merch.

320
00:13:21,977 --> 00:13:23,573
That explains "Border Hopper,"

321
00:13:23,574 --> 00:13:25,450
the zany illegal alien game.

322
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:26,290
So zany.

323
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:28,711
Shut up.

324
00:13:28,713 --> 00:13:31,180
Sugar Logs?

325
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:33,629
Do you remember Sugar Logs?

326
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:35,696
Expires 2023, score.

327
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,080
I don't.

328
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:39,105
Oh, I used to love these
when I was a kid,

329
00:13:39,107 --> 00:13:40,973
before everything
had to be so damn healthy.

330
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:42,842
300 grams of sugar?

331
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:45,778
A can of soda has like, 40.

332
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,815
Mmmm, oh, my God, it's so good!

333
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:52,051
Most of these ingredients
are just colors.

334
00:13:52,474 --> 00:13:53,864
- What is this?
- I don't know,

335
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:56,372
- but I want to put them on me.
- Put it on!

336
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:06,556
This is supposed to be a family store.

337
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:08,825
My child shouldn't have to see
a bunch of women

338
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:12,712
flaunting their bare breasts.
It's disgusting.

339
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:14,931
Let's get your game signed
and get out of here.

340
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:17,480
We're on it. Have a heavenly day.

341
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:20,103
Hey, what's up, skinny?

342
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:21,871
What?

343
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:24,313
You look like you lost like,
20 pounds or something.

344
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:26,509
Okay, you obviously
want something from me,

345
00:14:26,956 --> 00:14:27,577
but I still like it.

346
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:30,580
You know, I was thinking, since
you're so close with Erick,

347
00:14:30,582 --> 00:14:32,713
if you wouldn't mind
introducing me as a friend.

348
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:34,617
Wait, you want me to be your wingman

349
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:36,060
for that middle-aged guy in Crocs

350
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:37,641
who I've had one conversation with?

351
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,195
Hey, look, hey, all you need
you to do is set it up,

352
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:41,997
and I'll knock it down.

353
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,665
What is that? Is that a black thing?

354
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,958
Can I start saying it?

355
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,400
No, it's bowling.

356
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,570
- Yeah.
- Okay, then, just,

357
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:50,005
hold on to the thing.

358
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:51,656
Over, over.

359
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:59,948
Ha-ha!

360
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:04,280
It burns, it burns, it
burns, it burns, get it off.

361
00:15:04,282 --> 00:15:07,132
This is just a witch's broom.
Why would they recall this?

362
00:15:07,134 --> 00:15:09,885
Oh, I remember this. Here.

363
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:14,807
Oh, oh, I see it, got it, good recall.

364
00:15:16,827 --> 00:15:19,295
Okay, I reloaded!

365
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:22,431
That's very funny, but I can't...
I need your help.

366
00:15:22,683 --> 00:15:24,066
Stop!

367
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:27,836
- I got you know, you...
- Boom, oh, in your face!

368
00:15:27,838 --> 00:15:29,939
You're turning violet, Violet.

369
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:34,276
But Daddy, I want an Oompa-Loompa now.

370
00:15:36,814 --> 00:15:38,814
Hyperdrive!

371
00:15:43,637 --> 00:15:44,837
That's enough of that.

372
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:50,009
♪ I'm a jalapeño I'm a jalapeño ♪

373
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:52,478
All right, jalapeño, your
border tunnel caved in.

374
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,848
- Oh, come on.
- Move back two spaces.

375
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,416
There is just no way to win this game.

376
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:58,785
- Sorry, jalapeño.
- Mm.

377
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:00,220
You know what's funny?

378
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:02,856
We actually drank these
in the parking lot

379
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:04,757
at the end of my first day here.

380
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,027
Oh, yeah, I remember that.
God, that was a long time ago.

381
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:10,230
It was back when you really hated me.

382
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:12,730
- Come on, I didn't hate you.
- Oh, you hated me.

383
00:16:12,731 --> 00:16:14,033
- No, I didn't.
- Okay.

384
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:18,204
I just thought you were like,
naive and useless..

385
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:20,540
- Naive and useless?
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:22,616
Oh, okay, wow. I can take that.

387
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:23,843
- And now?
- And now...

388
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:25,845
Uh-huh.

389
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:28,365
- Same, but I...
- Okay.

390
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:31,005
I'm not so bothered by it.

391
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:32,551
See?

392
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:35,966
- I grow on a person.
- Or wear them down.

393
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:38,301
- Whichever one you prefer.
- Either way,

394
00:16:38,303 --> 00:16:40,203
there's some sort
of a progress happening here.

395
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:42,973
Progress, that's right.

396
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:45,976
And you never know,
one day you might even like me.

397
00:16:45,978 --> 00:16:48,678
Ah.

398
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,458
I didn't take off my boots
in the river and I've drowned.

399
00:16:58,577 --> 00:16:59,642
This game is dark.

400
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:03,543
So the door to the cage should
be right around this corner.

401
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:05,043
There it is.

402
00:17:05,412 --> 00:17:07,673
- Oh, my God, you did it!
- Hah.

403
00:17:07,673 --> 00:17:09,080
I thought you would never find it.

404
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,917
If that's Amy for thank you,
then you're welcome.

405
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:15,600
Goonies never say die!

406
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:18,488
- Hi.
- Hi.

407
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:19,841
Hi.

408
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:23,818
Uh, I read the blueprints wrong.

409
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:26,348
I'm getting coffee with my ex-wife.

410
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,281
Excuse us.

411
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:31,853
Sorry.

412
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:35,072
Hey, Jill.

413
00:17:36,728 --> 00:17:37,836
Hey.

414
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:40,776
I am not trying to shame anyone,

415
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:44,115
but I need you
to move out of this aisle.

416
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,010
- Please?
- Pretty please?

417
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:49,617
With a cherry on top
and rainbow sprinkles?

418
00:17:49,617 --> 00:17:52,829
Or chocolate, you choose,
whatever you want.

419
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:54,111
Oh, you're pathetic.

420
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:56,177
I can't believe I'm having your baby.

421
00:17:57,374 --> 00:17:59,407
- My... what?
- What?

422
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:00,979
You're pa-the-tic.

423
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,815
No, no, no, no, I know that.
What about the baby?

424
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,197
Didn't you get my text?

425
00:18:05,198 --> 00:18:06,887
The implantation worked. I'm pregnant.

426
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:08,817
Or preggers, as my
horrid niece would say,

427
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:11,234
trying to make herself sound
like she has a personality.

428
00:18:13,356 --> 00:18:15,309
That's the most beautiful, magical thing

429
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,258
anyone has ever said to me.

430
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:19,096
I'm just so happy for you.

431
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:19,812
Thank you.

432
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:21,278
No, I am sure I texted you.

433
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:22,491
It was like a week ago.

434
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:25,005
I see what happened.
Texted the wrong Glen.

435
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:29,311
"Sorry, pregnant with Glenn with two Ns.

436
00:18:29,737 --> 00:18:30,653
LOL."

437
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:32,586
My mechanic.

438
00:18:32,587 --> 00:18:35,859
My assistant manager and I,
we're going to have a baby.

439
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,495
Oh, boy.

440
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:39,816
Oh, God, I can't wait to tell my wife.

441
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:42,853
- What is happening here?
- I don't know.

442
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,926
I'm going to be a daddy.

443
00:18:46,122 --> 00:18:48,151
Who's pathetic now?

444
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:54,177
I was, um...

445
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:57,182
No, no, never mind.

446
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:04,954
Um, set them up and knock them down?

447
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:07,388
Soap.

448
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:10,714
Soap.

449
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:15,800
So, this is... this is cool.

450
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,707
I'm so glad we're doing this.

451
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:21,403
Yeah, it's... it's very cool.

452
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:25,006
No, it's not cool.

453
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:27,175
Normally I'm the cool guy.

454
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,482
They call me the Samuel L.
Jackson of this store.

455
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:31,121
- Who calls you the...
- But for some reason,

456
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:32,794
around you, and I don't know what it is,

457
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:34,397
because you're just some guy
who stands in a booth

458
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:35,883
and does a bunch of silly voices,

459
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:37,554
so I don't know why
you think you're so great.

460
00:19:37,562 --> 00:19:39,125
I don't... I don't... I never said that.

461
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:41,886
You know, I met Scott Bakula
at an Outback Steakhouse,

462
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:45,125
and it was smooth sailing.
And that guy, he quantum leapt.

463
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:48,319
Or leaped, or whatever it was.
I don't care, because I'm cool.

464
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:50,294
You're not better than me!

465
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:53,883
So enjoy losing another
DICE award to Troy Baker.

466
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:54,668
Jerk.

467
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:56,965
Taurus-driving loser.

468
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,902
I mean, the sad thing is,
he is the cool one.

469
00:20:05,032 --> 00:20:05,394
So...

470
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:08,401
Oh, no.

471
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:11,117
- It's over, huh?
- Yeah.

472
00:20:11,305 --> 00:20:13,531
It's fine, I made too
big a deal out of it.

473
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:16,306
Oh, okay, then I guess
you won't want this.

474
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:19,192
- What? How?
- I bribed some kid

475
00:20:19,193 --> 00:20:20,892
with a couple of cans
of that malt drink.

476
00:20:20,893 --> 00:20:23,132
He was a bigger kid, so I think
his heart can handle it.

477
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:25,448
Jonah, thank you!

478
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:27,899
Oh, my God, I can't wait
to decapitate somebody.

479
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,774
Yeah, well, I am happy to help.

480
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:30,985
Do you want to see how it's done?

481
00:20:30,986 --> 00:20:32,443
I could put it in the demo,

482
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:33,611
and I could show you really quick.

483
00:20:33,697 --> 00:20:35,593
- It's so much fun.
- Oh, uh...

484
00:20:35,594 --> 00:20:39,087
I kind of promised Kelly
that I would meet her tonight.

485
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:40,223
I so would, though.

486
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:42,141
- Oh, my God, of course.
- Yeah, no.

487
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,070
But tomorrow.

488
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:44,481
- Yes.
- Let's do this.

489
00:20:44,482 --> 00:20:47,570
Let's do it tomorrow. Play the game.

490
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:49,848
- Okay.
- Okay, have a good night.

491
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:52,400
- You too, enjoy that.
- I will, thank you.

492
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,385
Thank you.

493
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:56,896
Ugh.

494
00:20:57,794 --> 00:20:59,256
I can still smell them.

495
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:01,348
It's like Cool Ranch and scrotum.

496
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:04,566
Hey, Rodriguez,
pay attention, I'm talking.

497
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:08,031
What, have you got a crush
on Jonah or something?

498
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:13,317
Yeah, I think I do.

499
00:21:16,585 --> 00:21:18,573
It's the smell. It's not this.

Hey!

What are you... what are you doing?

00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:13,828
Um, just some stuff.

5
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:16,765
No, you were...
you're trying to rob the store.

6
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:18,835
Yeah.

7
00:00:19,204 --> 00:00:21,140
Well, you...
put it back.

8
00:00:21,757 --> 00:00:23,539
Uh, I don't think I'm gonna.

But th... that's how this works.

00:00:32,172 --> 00:00:34,787
No, don't just... no. Don't take more.

13
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:35,857
Do you have a gun?

14
00:00:35,915 --> 00:00:37,295
No! Maybe.

15
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:38,739
Maybe I do.

16
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:42,678
Uh, I-I don't think you do.

17
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:46,326
Well, I don't think you do,
so, you know, it's a tie.

What do you think about that?

19
00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:52,356
Okay. Excuse me.

00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:53,885
Oh. Wait!

- He's a stealer...

- uh, thief. He's a thief.
- You can run, but you can't hide!

00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:25,186
I saw immediately
it was a 487 in progress.

31
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:26,819
The perp appeared to be unarmed.

32
00:01:27,147 --> 00:01:29,462
I did not see him violate
my colleague, however,

33
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:31,890
he could have violated him
before I arrived on the scene.

34
00:01:32,097 --> 00:01:34,821
- Is that what happened?
- No, he did not violate me.

35
00:01:34,954 --> 00:01:37,084
Well, you just had such
a shameful look on your face

36
00:01:37,142 --> 00:01:38,146
when I showed up.

37
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:39,588
I don't know what he could have
done to you beforehand,

38
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:40,885
- but it is not your fault,
- Okay,

39
00:01:40,942 --> 00:01:42,767
- if he touched you.
- Okay. Nothing happened.

40
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:44,473
All right? I caught him stealing.

41
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:45,683
End of story.

42
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:47,507
And you made no attempt to stop him?

43
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:50,962
No, I mean, I told him
to stop, but he didn't.

44
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:53,765
And then he asked me to
move and just took off.

45
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:55,306
Wait, I'm sorry.

46
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,756
He asked you to move out
of the way so he could leave

47
00:01:57,823 --> 00:02:00,126
with the cash, and you just did it?

48
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:02,530
He... well... he said,
"Excuse me," you know?

49
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:04,269
So it was for of, like, a reflex.

50
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:05,956
Oh, wow.

51
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:08,171
What is going on in this neighborhood?

52
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:10,265
We got robbed, Home Depot got robbed,

53
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:12,561
that weird store that
only makes copies got robbed.

54
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:15,218
I'm scared to even walk
to my car alone at night.

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,226
That is why everyone
gets a rape whistle.

56
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,780
- That's a kazoo.
- Yeah, we had an overstock.

57
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,609
So everyone gets a rape kazoo.

58
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:27,452
I also think
we need parking lot buddies

59
00:02:27,632 --> 00:02:29,866
so that no one has to walk to
their car alone at night.

60
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,686
I'll be paired with anyone
but Sarah.

61
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:33,345
That girl's got, like, a huge

62
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:35,173
restraining order against me.

63
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:38,827
I'll take any guy who's 6'2"
with blue eyes.

64
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:41,788
Wait, we're talking about
picking boyfriends, right?

65
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:44,046
I'll take Justine.

66
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:45,948
The robbers will probably
kill her before they kill me.

67
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:47,944
Since I don't drive,
could you assign someone

68
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:49,751
to walk me to the bus stop
and wait with me?

69
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:51,632
We're not picking.
We're drawing names

70
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,804
so that it's fair.
I will go first.

71
00:02:53,862 --> 00:02:57,399
Mine is... Myrtle,
so I'm gonna go again

72
00:02:57,506 --> 00:02:59,140
because everybody gets one re-do.

73
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:02,895
So my real one is Cheyenne,
and that one's final.

74
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:05,164
Can I be paired with Mateo, actually?

75
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:07,171
We usually go to trivia night together.

76
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:08,804
Oh, you guys do a trivia night?

77
00:03:08,862 --> 00:03:09,905
That sounds fun.

78
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:11,554
I still say I got robbed last week.

79
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:14,405
Women do not produce eggs.
That's chickens.

80
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:17,030
Garrett mocked you
so hard for that.

81
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:21,772
He was all like,
you know, funny stuff.

82
00:03:21,913 --> 00:03:25,085
So, like, almost everyone
goes to this trivia night?

83
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:27,835
- Yeah.
- Solid crew.

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,249
I love trivia.

85
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,225
Sorry.

86
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,614
I'm not being raped.

87
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:39,249
I just was trying to play
"Camptown Races."

88
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:41,905
- It's not a toy.
- It is not.

89
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:44,577
Dude, you need to
do something about Ken.

90
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:46,143
He's a terrible security guard.

91
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,273
He wasn't even here this morning
when the store got robbed.

92
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,843
Yeah, look,
I know he's not the best.

93
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:53,991
But he is such
a sweet man.

94
00:03:54,064 --> 00:03:56,054
Look, I know it sucks to fire somebody,

95
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,929
but what's worse...
Waiting for some lunatic

96
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,856
to come in here and kill a customer,

97
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:02,186
or having
an uncomfortable conversation?

98
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:08,968
Security, report to Customer Service.

99
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:11,662
- Security to Customer Service.
- Stop it.

100
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:13,694
He's taking a selfie, Glenn.

101
00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:16,461
The dude's taking a selfie.

102
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:21,952
My parking lot buddy is Jonah.
How is he gonna protect me?

103
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:25,163
"Oh, stop. Don't attack us."

104
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,046
I'm literally right here, Myrtle.

105
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:28,305
Listen,
her mind's mostly gone,

106
00:04:28,362 --> 00:04:29,435
but she raises a good point.

107
00:04:29,492 --> 00:04:32,460
You froze
while a guy robbed the store.

108
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:36,038
Okay, again, I didn't freeze.
He was being calm,

109
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,226
so I was being calm.
The robber sets the tone.

110
00:04:39,332 --> 00:04:41,472
Oh, so are you just going to
be calm when a group

111
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,835
of methed-out serial killers
stabs Myrtle to death

112
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:44,903
- in the parking lot?
- No,

113
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,725
because that would be
a different tone.

114
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,202
- Come on.
- Hey, everybody.

115
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,885
Can I get you to meet me
in the break room

116
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:51,147
for a quick chat?

117
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:53,835
Is it about your boots?

118
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:56,249
Uh, no.

119
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:58,069
Um, it's about
this morning's incident.

120
00:04:58,186 --> 00:05:00,598
Is that
when you bought your boots?

121
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:05,022
Just... if everybody would just
meet me in the break room.

122
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:15,272
Okay, so, I wanted to bring Dina up here

123
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:17,569
so we could discuss
this morning's incident.

124
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,319
Listen, I don't need an attaboy

125
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:23,202
just for doing my job, okay?
But I do think it's positive

126
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,233
that this can open a
conversation about self-defense

127
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,925
and how each of us
need to take action...

128
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,761
What I'm saying is,
don't do what Dina did.

129
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,207
- Ooh.
- I'm sorry, what?

130
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:35,960
He said, "Don't be like you."

131
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:38,354
Dina took it upon herself to
physically confront the thief.

132
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:40,015
And while it worked out okay
this time,

133
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,930
it could have turned into
serious injury, or death,

134
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:43,577
or God forbid, a lawsuit.

135
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:47,086
I'm obviously joking.
A lawsuit would not

136
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:48,954
be as bad as death. The point is,

137
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:50,929
we have a policy for this.
So if you see

138
00:05:50,987 --> 00:05:52,655
something suspicious,
report it.

139
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:54,585
Don't try to handle it yourself.

140
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:56,074
Yeah,
we all know what the policy is,

141
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:57,302
but what was I supposed to do?

142
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:59,827
Just stand there and
make brown, like Jonah?

143
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:01,174
What did Jonah do?

144
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:03,444
Well, I didn't actually do anything...

145
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:05,204
Exactly. He just sat there

146
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,640
and watched a guy rob the store.

147
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,165
Thank you. That is what you

148
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:10,483
should all do in the future.

149
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,979
Thank you, Jonah,
for actually following protocol.

150
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:17,108
Oh, well, yeah. I mean, you know,

151
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,726
you guys came up with the policy.

152
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:20,390
I just knew it and followed it.

153
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:21,817
- It's appreciated.
- Oh, my God,

154
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,098
just sleep with him, already.

155
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:24,210
- What?
- Okay,

156
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:25,773
what if someone steals a baby?

157
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:28,030
What then?
Do you want me to just sit there

158
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:30,499
and watch someone take a baby?

159
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:32,837
What if the baby is wearing
a bomb?

160
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,890
Then wouldn't you want him to steal it?

161
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:36,564
I'm trying to picture
a scenario in which

162
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:38,956
- somebody planted...
- Oh, what if it's baby Hitler?

163
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:41,335
- Oh.
- That's a very good question.

164
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,108
- Is it?
- I think you gotta kill

165
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,390
- that baby Hitler.
- Yeah.

166
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:46,671
But how would you know that
that baby was gonna grow up

167
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:48,741
to be Hitler?
What if that baby was gonna

168
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:51,460
grow up to be the exact
opposite of Hitler?

169
00:06:51,518 --> 00:06:53,132
- Churchill?
- No.

170
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,705
- Lance Bass.
- Interesting.

171
00:06:55,788 --> 00:06:57,903
- Oprah.
- Yeah, Oprah.

172
00:06:57,993 --> 00:06:59,727
- Oh, yeah.
- Gotta save that baby.

173
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,169
- Gotta save it.
- I'm more of an Ellen person.

174
00:07:04,796 --> 00:07:08,468
- It's fun when she dances.
- Anyway, what I'm saying is,

175
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:11,693
don't be a Dina. Be a Jonah.

176
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:13,201
- Oh. Different.
- Wow.

177
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,341
Wait, you guys.
What if it's baby Oprah,

178
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:19,278
but the person
stealing it is Beyoncé?

179
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:23,908
I need a pen and paper.

180
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:31,013
Ken, you...
You know how much I love you.

181
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:32,390
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

182
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:35,592
But a thief just wandered into
the store this morning.

183
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:38,369
I know. Crazy, right?

184
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,820
I just heard about that.

185
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:44,053
And I... hate to be
such a Sally Stickler,

186
00:07:44,111 --> 00:07:47,120
but... technically, you were
supposed to be here.

187
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:49,710
Yes, yes.
And I'm so sorry.

188
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:51,936
You know,
it just... it takes me forever

189
00:07:51,994 --> 00:07:53,290
to get going in the morning.

190
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:55,173
'Cause I don't believe in alarm clocks.

191
00:07:55,252 --> 00:07:58,265
I like to wake up when my body is ready,
you know what I mean?

192
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:01,857
But we've... talked about this before.

193
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,962
And I think it's time for you to go.

194
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,767
- Oh.
- I'm so, so sorry.

195
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:11,716
No, it's nothing to be sorry about.

196
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:14,180
God bless.

197
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:22,096
Jerusha, how was it? I feel sick!

198
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,287
All right. Here you go.

199
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,896
Hey, you know, you can just
take this stroller and leave,

200
00:08:27,954 --> 00:08:30,053
if you want.
Just right out the store.

201
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:31,742
This little girl won't try and stop you.

202
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,595
- Ow, what are you doing?
- Just explaining that

203
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:36,345
you're a sackless wuss
that would even let

204
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:38,732
- this pipsqueak rob us.
- You know what?

205
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:40,482
I'm just...
I'm gonna go pay for it.

206
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:43,068
- Yeah, enjoy that.
- Sorry. Congratulations.

207
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:46,404
- What the hell was that?
- "What the hell was that?"

208
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:47,847
I'm a little baby."

209
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:49,783
Look, I can tell you're upset...

210
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:52,162
- No, you can't.
- Okay, look,

211
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:55,224
maybe, uh, Jeff calling you out
in the meeting this morning

212
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:57,256
- was a little embarrassing...
- Uh, the only thing

213
00:08:57,285 --> 00:09:00,024
that's embarrassing is how far
Jeff is up your butt.

214
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,509
Hello, Jeff? Are you in there?

215
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:02,662
- Okay.
- Try not to scuff

216
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,170
- your ridiculous boots.
- Oh, wow, right?

217
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:08,522
- How insane...
- We are not on the same team.

218
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:12,623
Hey.

219
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:16,011
Oh, turkey sandwich.

220
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,107
Hey, did you know that
the sandwich was invented

221
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,802
- by the Earl of Sandwich?
- Okay.

222
00:09:23,804 --> 00:09:25,748
That's just a little
random fact that I knew.

223
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:28,242
My head's full of all kinds
of things like that.

224
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,844
- Who invented salad?
- Good question.

225
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:32,359
I have another one.
Remember how we were just

226
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,677
talking about turkey?
Which founding father

227
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:37,802
wanted to make the turkey
our national bird?

228
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:39,253
- Um...
- Huh?

229
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,818
Anyone? Benjamin Franklin,

230
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:44,170
who, as we all know, also
invented the Franklin Stove

231
00:09:44,228 --> 00:09:46,530
- and bifocals.
- Really?

232
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:49,248
- I don't think that's true.
- Well, it is true.

233
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:51,201
I know it's true because
I just looked it up.

234
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:52,443
Okay.

235
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:55,927
So did he invent salad?

236
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:59,356
No. No, that was someone else.

237
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,279
Ken? You're... you're here.

238
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,013
Big time!

239
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:14,232
Okay, um, look, maybe I wasn't clear,

240
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:15,685
and that's my fault.

241
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:18,880
But what I meant to say was,

242
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:22,279
I don't want you to be
the security guard here anymore.

243
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:25,482
Oh. So you're thinking

244
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,693
move me over to what? Like, sales?

245
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,466
- I wasn't...
- 'Cause I do think that

246
00:10:29,524 --> 00:10:31,826
would be a better fit
for my particular skill set.

247
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,560
'Cause if I'm being honest
with myself,

248
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:35,452
I don't know anything
about security.

249
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:37,077
Okay. Okay.

250
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,763
Yes, thanks. Yes, yes.

251
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,545
Oh, hey, Jonah.
I just wanted to tell you,

252
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,395
I really liked the way you
handled yourself this morning

253
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:46,631
- with the robbery.
- Oh, thank you.

254
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,657
Um, but that... that wasn't really...

255
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,451
I get it. But it's just nice to know

256
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,662
we've got some level-headed,
calm people working here.

257
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,880
So good job.

258
00:10:54,148 --> 00:10:55,716
Uh, hey. Hey, um...

259
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:59,404
You know what?
This... this might sound weird,

260
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:04,185
but, um, could you not
compliment me in front of Dina?

261
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:06,837
- I'm sorry?
- I appreciate everything

262
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:08,664
that you're saying, but, um,

263
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,146
I think Dina was a little
embarrassed about what happened

264
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,615
this morning.
And when Dina gets embarrassed,

265
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:18,201
- she can be a bit of a bully.
- Dina's bullying you?

266
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:20,045
No, no. That's not what I...

267
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:23,857
No, I just meant that she
can be a bit of a bully.

268
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:25,692
Thank you for coming forward.

269
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:27,615
I will talk to HR.

270
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:29,022
No, no, no, no. You don't need

271
00:11:29,144 --> 00:11:30,945
to get HR involved. No.

272
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:32,834
Okay, but you understand
you just informed me

273
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,694
that a superior is bullying you.
Legally, that's something

274
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:36,686
I have to report. We've just had

275
00:11:36,915 --> 00:11:38,076
too many suicides.

276
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:39,591
Not necessary, no.

277
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,771
Okay, I take no joy in getting
Dina in any kind of trouble.

278
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:44,846
Really? 'Cause you're... you're smiling

279
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:46,154
- a little.
- Am I?

280
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,804
Huh.

281
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,715
It's been brought to my
attention that there has been

282
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:55,880
some bullying in the store.

283
00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:57,552
I have spoken to the person responsible,

284
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,951
but I would like
to remind everybody

285
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:01,552
that Cloud 9 has a zero tolerance policy

286
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:04,764
against bullying of anyone
under any circumstance.

287
00:12:04,885 --> 00:12:06,459
What if you're bullying Hitler?

288
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:08,878
Bullying's probably
what made him Hitler.

289
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,698
Actually, I think it was
not getting into art school.

290
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:13,423
Okay,
can we just forget about Hitler?

291
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:16,218
No,
we can't ever forget about Hitler.

292
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,294
- She's right.
- Okay, I'm fine.

293
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:20,560
- I was not bullied.
- Believe me,

294
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:23,334
If I had bullied Jonah,
Justine wouldn't be the only one

295
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:24,928
- with a broken nose.
- Heyo!

296
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,171
Okay, bullying's not
just beating people up.

297
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:29,552
It's... it's any behavior that's
hostile or intimidating.

298
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,232
Like when your ex buys $300 boots,

299
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:32,741
but all he got you on your
birthday was a cake

300
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:33,774
from the store bakery?

301
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:35,228
You said you didn't want anything.

302
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:36,883
So, you know what,
that doesn't matter.

303
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:39,013
The point is, we all know
what bullying is;

304
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:40,828
harassment, name-calling...

305
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,653
Sometimes it seems like you're
calling someone a name

306
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:45,687
but then it's their actual name.

307
00:12:45,794 --> 00:12:49,363
I once met a Greek guy named
Herpes, or something like that.

308
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:52,732
- I thought you fired that dude.
- I did. Twice.

309
00:12:52,928 --> 00:12:55,232
Okay, so,
what are some other examples?

310
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:57,737
- Moron, A-hole...
- Bimbo.

311
00:12:57,795 --> 00:12:58,810
Bald jerk.

312
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:00,768
Herpes when their name is
not Herpes.

313
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:03,966
- Va-Jonah.
- Opus Dei. Pasty freak.

314
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:07,827
Okay, I meant other examples
of bullying, not name-calling.

315
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:10,302
But nobody here should
be calling you those.

316
00:13:10,443 --> 00:13:12,378
Oh, no. That was just my doctors.

317
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:14,474
How about being excluded socially?

318
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:16,057
Sure, especially if they're

319
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:17,677
purposely targeting an individual.

320
00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:19,069
What if it was more like
a group of people

321
00:13:19,126 --> 00:13:20,112
who were planning an event

322
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,154
and they just weren't
inviting a specific person?

323
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:26,559
Um, I think maybe what you're
describing is just a loser.

324
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:28,864
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's a loser.

325
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:31,802
A lot of interesting
opinions today, Kelly.

326
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:33,810
- Thank you.
- Sometimes the bus driver

327
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:36,310
opens the door and,
when I try to get in,

328
00:13:36,474 --> 00:13:39,537
he drives forward a little
and then I try to get in again,

329
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:43,709
but then he drives a little more
and we're all laughing,

330
00:13:43,898 --> 00:13:45,415
but still...

331
00:13:46,761 --> 00:13:50,240
Yes, that is bullying, Sandra.

332
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,412
Um... Jesus.

333
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:06,685
Wow.

334
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,404
You really got this firing thing down.

335
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:10,398
I think he's gonna make
a fine associate.

336
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,966
Stop. Ow, you're breaking my arm.

337
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:16,318
Just trust me. It's gonna fit, okay?

338
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:17,630
Stop fighting, man.

339
00:14:18,297 --> 00:14:21,216
- There you go.
- You're right, he's good.

340
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,732
- Hey, hey.
- Ken.

341
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,726
- Hey, it's the cool kids.
- Where?

342
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:30,295
You. You're the...

343
00:14:30,388 --> 00:14:31,728
You're the cool kids.

344
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:34,849
- Oh.
- So, um, any of you cats

345
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:37,068
heading to this trivia thing tonight?

346
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,865
Oh, no. None of us get invited to that.

347
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,630
That thing is lame anyway.

348
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,795
Hey, what if we did something?

349
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:46,545
- Together?
- Yes.

350
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:50,545
I always wanted to try that
bowling alley down the street.

351
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:51,972
Yes! All right.

352
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:54,326
Let's do it! Bowling night!

353
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:55,701
I bet they have those wings,

354
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,424
and they serve them with ranch dressing.

355
00:14:57,672 --> 00:14:59,232
Feels like you're British or something.

356
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,177
Yeah. Maybe.

357
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:03,966
I love bowling alleys. They're so dark,

358
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:06,435
so you can make any kind
of faces you want.

359
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:10,805
- Okay.
- What should our team name be?

360
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,373
We should be
the Best Friends.

361
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:16,029
'Cause we are best friends.

362
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:19,376
Wow. Yeah.

363
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,271
Oh, darn it.
I just remembered, um,

364
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:28,998
Emma has a thing tonight.

365
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,433
So...

366
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:32,932
I can't.

367
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:35,521
- Can we come?
- Oh.

368
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,029
Um, oh. Uh, no.

369
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,937
Hey, buddy.
Guess what this is?

370
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:49,132
It's my first write-up. Ever.

371
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,709
So thank you so much for that.

372
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:53,099
Look, I'm sorry.
I genuinely did not mean

373
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,345
- to get you in trouble.
- Hey, it's all in the past.

374
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:58,966
I just came over to ask you
in the most polite way possible

375
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:01,279
to please clean up the
spill in aisle nine.

376
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:03,232
Uh, this is aisle nine.

377
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:06,624
Jesus! What is wrong with you?

378
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,235
- Oops.
- You know what?

379
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:10,720
I'm glad you got written up.
You are a bully.

380
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:14,274
Well, I'd rather be a bully
than a castrated garden gnome.

381
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,001
A garden gnome?
What would you even castrate?

382
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,378
Well, who knows what's under
those little pants?

383
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,138
That's not the point. The point is,

384
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:22,902
at least I'm not too weak
to stop a simple robbery.

385
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:26,544
That was an awkward situation.
I could have destroyed that guy.

386
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:28,378
With muscles like those? Come on.

387
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:31,247
I'm wiry because I work out
with resistance bands,

388
00:16:31,305 --> 00:16:33,575
but believe me.
They can get the job done.

389
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:35,365
So, you think you could kick my ass?

390
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:37,146
Your ass? Yeah, uh,

391
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:39,096
obviously, I could... sure.

392
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:40,731
Oh. Well, then come at me.

393
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:42,463
- Come at you?
- Come at me!

394
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:43,427
- Come at me, bro.
- What are you doing?

395
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:45,412
- Oh, are you too scared?
- I'm not scared.

396
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,646
I'm at work, and I don't wanna

397
00:16:46,703 --> 00:16:47,966
lose my job, Dina.

398
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:49,691
Then let's take this thing off campus.

399
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:51,107
- What?
- Fight!

400
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,766
Fight, guys. Jonah's fighting Dina.

401
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:56,408
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight...

402
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:58,642
Guys, say it with me. It's so much fun.

403
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:01,033
Fight, fight, fight...

404
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:03,774
You guys are the worst.

405
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,362
So what's the best case scenario,
here?

406
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,876
Dina beats you up,
or everyone gets to see

407
00:17:11,982 --> 00:17:13,974
- you hit a woman.
- It's not gonna come to that.

408
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,534
Bullies just need to be confronted.

409
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,502
There. Officially off Cloud 9 property.

410
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:20,967
Now we're just a couple of civilians.

411
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:23,846
- So show me what you got.
- Look, Dina, I'm not

412
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,421
I'm not fighting you. This is...

413
00:17:25,488 --> 00:17:26,723
Why? Because I'm a woman?

414
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:28,424
Because if you were really a feminist,

415
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:29,580
you'd punch me in the face.

416
00:17:29,638 --> 00:17:32,327
What does that... Okay, what are you...

417
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,940
What are you doing?
I'm not gonna do that.

418
00:17:33,997 --> 00:17:36,561
- It's been a long time coming.
- Wh-what?

419
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:38,268
Since this morning.

420
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:39,902
- I... I won't...
- Wait, guys.

421
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:42,631
Just stop. This is crazy.

422
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:44,875
- Thank you.
- Now we're good.

423
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:46,652
Garrett, you don't need to...
You can turn it off,

424
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:48,145
- because...
- Ooh!

425
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:49,946
- Dina, what are you doing?
- Yeah, yeah.

426
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:51,853
- Get him to the ground.
- Dina, I'm not gonna-

427
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:56,419
- Hit him!
- Okay, all right.

428
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:58,121
- Come on.
- Oh.

429
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:00,724
Stop rolling. Your skin is very smooth,

430
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,241
- like a dolphin.
- I don't wanna do this.

431
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:03,256
- Just fight me.
- No.

432
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:05,228
- Come on. Fight me.
- Ow. Stop, Dina, get off.

433
00:18:05,286 --> 00:18:07,669
- Dina, get off!
- What the hell is that?

434
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,479
- Nothing.
- What's wrong, man?

435
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,885
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

436
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:12,756
I'm good.
I just... just gimme a minute.

437
00:18:12,814 --> 00:18:14,728
- Did you just get an erection?
- What? No.

438
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:16,986
- No, no.
- He did, it's true.

439
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,285
We got a boner, everyone.

440
00:18:19,343 --> 00:18:21,344
No, no, it's not.
It's... the friction

441
00:18:21,402 --> 00:18:24,633
- from the pants are really soft.
- Boner. Boner. Boner. Boner.

442
00:18:24,743 --> 00:18:25,758
Really? None of you?

443
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:28,455
Nice to get off early, huh?

444
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:31,187
Have the whole night to do whatever?

445
00:18:31,254 --> 00:18:33,156
- Uh-huh.
- Totally.

446
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:35,958
Like, maybe some laundry.
Oh, no, I did that yesterday.

447
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:38,294
So, ugh, what to do?

448
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:39,821
What to do?

449
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:42,479
I'll see you guys over there.

450
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:44,550
Let's get trivial!

451
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:46,503
- All right.
- Whoo!

452
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:50,012
Seriously?
You guys invited that girl?

453
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:52,442
I am way smarter than that girl.

454
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:54,315
Okay, girl,
what are you getting all

455
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:55,512
- "Real Housewives" about?
- I'm talking about,

456
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:57,261
why aren't you inviting me
to trivia night?

457
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,992
'Cause we figured
you weren't interested.

458
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,492
Why wouldn't I be interested?

459
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,565
I love trivia. I love nights.

460
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,387
You never wanna do anything
after work.

461
00:19:04,454 --> 00:19:06,042
Yeah,
you're always like, "No,"

462
00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:08,110
and then you did that weird,
like, sarcastic thing.

463
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:09,735
Oh, like I would say
no to trivia night.

464
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:12,004
- You're doing it right now.
- Okay, that's beside the point.

465
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:14,664
I said no because I was married
and I had Emma to look after.

466
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:17,101
But now I'm separated and
Emma has her own thing,

467
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:18,660
and I spend most of my nights by myself

468
00:19:18,717 --> 00:19:21,659
and I would really just like
to have a social life again.

469
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:24,440
Okay, great. Just come to trivia night.

470
00:19:24,574 --> 00:19:26,706
- Okay, great.
- Great.

471
00:19:26,804 --> 00:19:28,004
I will. Thank you.

472
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:29,808
Okay, we'll see you at 10.

473
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,558
- Bye!
- Wait, uh, what... 10:00 p.m.?

474
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:37,800
Who starts trivia at...
10:00 p.m. is an awesome time

475
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:40,116
to start trivia. I love that idea.

476
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:44,128
Maybe you'll get that
hard salad question.

477
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:46,397
- Oh.
- Ooh.

478
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,930
I'm so tired.

479
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:55,184
- Hey.
- Uh, Dina, I really don't...

480
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:57,246
Listen, I'm feeling
so stupid for not realizing

481
00:19:57,304 --> 00:19:59,104
why you've been messing with me so much.

482
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:02,026
It's like a school boy
pulling your pigtails.

483
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:04,621
- I'm sorry?
- You're still attracted to me.

484
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:07,433
I get the message hard and clear.

485
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,097
And hard.

486
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,546
- Um...
- Here's the thing...

487
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:13,968
It's terrible timing,
because I just ended this thing

488
00:20:14,026 --> 00:20:16,058
with Garrett, and I need to
lone wolf it for a while.

489
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,414
Yeah, I feel like you're...

490
00:20:17,472 --> 00:20:20,196
You and I are just two ships
passing in the night.

491
00:20:20,263 --> 00:20:22,066
But that's not to say down
the road those two ships

492
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:25,827
won't meet up in some harbor
and just drop anchor.

493
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:28,620
- You know?
- It's a beautiful sentiment.

494
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:30,354
- It is.
- Yeah.

495
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:33,151
Oh, and speaking of ships,

496
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,417
your mast... very impressive.

497
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:39,034
Well done.

498
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:45,964
Hey, parking lot buddy.
Ready to go wait at the bus stop with me?

499
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:49,882
Oh, um, you know what,
I'm actually gonna catch up

500
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,636
- with the trivia night guys.
- But you said it was lame.

501
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:56,378
- Yeah, I did say that.
- Yeah.

502
00:20:57,886 --> 00:21:00,206
But you're good to walk alone, right?

503
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:02,518
We'll start buddies tomorrow.

504
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:04,361
Okay.

505
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,253
It's just a little dark, but...

506
00:21:10,078 --> 00:21:12,304
and I don't know who that is.

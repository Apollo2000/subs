1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:02,447
Okay, those of you
who were working

2
00:00:02,532 --> 00:00:04,758
the day that Carol was
electrocuted by the robot,

3
00:00:04,843 --> 00:00:07,165
you're gonna be deposed
by Carol's lawyer today.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,824
Now, Cloud 9's lawyer
will also be present.

5
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,468
He advises we answer
every question honestly

6
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:14,925
but try and downplay
their liability.

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,692
So, feel free to get creative
walking that perjury line.

8
00:00:18,777 --> 00:00:21,184
How much is Cloud 9
gonna have to pay Carol?

9
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,500
Oh, I heard about a guy
who got his butt sliced off

10
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:24,617
when a shelf fell.

11
00:00:24,702 --> 00:00:26,149
Voop! 10 million.

12
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,565
- What?
- No, no...

13
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:28,827
Dang, that's a nice payday.

14
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:30,961
I'm sorry... a guy got
his butt sliced off,

15
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:32,484
and we didn't hear about it
in the news?

16
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:35,967
Wait, so Carol could get
$10 million?

17
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:38,258
Okay. That makes sense.

18
00:00:38,343 --> 00:00:39,576
T-the world makes sense.

19
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:42,044
She'll be able to do that
thing where you buy a car

20
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:43,233
and you just drive it once.

21
00:00:43,317 --> 00:00:44,593
Like, when you get to
where you're going,

22
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,409
you just toss the keys
to whoever and leave.

23
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:47,836
No, she's the kinda person

24
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:49,625
who'd blow it all
on exotic animals,

25
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,676
then die broke in the bathroom
of a Red Robin.

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,157
Carol, you can probably
just go start your shift now.

27
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:55,515
No, I'm good.

28
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:57,132
Is this what today's
gonna be like,

29
00:00:57,217 --> 00:00:58,860
everyone talking about me?

30
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:01,148
God, I'm gonna hate this!

31
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:05,132

Aired on: <font color="#00ffff">February 25, 2021</font>

33
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,825
You're looking at a boot?

34
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:13,274
- You're not a boot guy.
- I know.

35
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,568
Everyone knows that.

36
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:17,296
But I'm just seeing
what's out there, because...

37
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:19,791
someone's getting their
ankle monitor off today!

38
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,402
Oh, my God, Mateo,
that's huge!

39
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:25,328
- I know, right?
- Girl, it has sucked!

40
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:27,687
Feeling like a criminal
every time I tied my shoes...

41
00:01:27,773 --> 00:01:30,110
Ooh! Why not get yourself
some capri pants, too,

42
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:31,281
so you can show off
your ankle?

43
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:32,717
I'd rather go back to jail.

44
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,915
Excuse me.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,398
Can you help me find
Carol Malloon?

46
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,364
I'm her attorney,
Hannah Connelly?

47
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:39,932
Well, hear this.

48
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:42,977
Carol's gonna do everything
she can to pin this on me,

49
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:45,187
but if she wants to
make this ugly,

50
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,058
I will drag it
all the way to hell!

51
00:01:50,014 --> 00:01:51,351
I think she's in floral.

52
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,843
On your left, just ahead
towards the register.

53
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:54,362
Okay. Thank you.

54
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:56,455
Okay.

55
00:01:56,828 --> 00:01:58,003
Oh, hey, Glenn.

56
00:01:58,087 --> 00:02:00,701
You're, uh, dripping something
green there, buddy.

57
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:02,680
Ah! This is the third
stress ball

58
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:04,618
I blasted through today.

59
00:02:04,702 --> 00:02:08,056
Wow. Maybe today should be
more of a Koosh day for you.

60
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,536
It's just these depositions.

61
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,234
You know,
lawyers make me anxious.

62
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:13,609
- It's nothing to worry about.
- You know, maybe it would help

63
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:14,880
if we practiced a little bit.

64
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:16,591
Oh, yeah, good idea. Okay.

65
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:18,850
So you be me,
and I'll be the lawyer.

66
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:21,583
Uh, maybe you should be you.

67
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:23,444
'Cause I'll be me
in the deposition.

68
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:25,419
Okay. Good catch.

69
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,253
- Hey, Dina, did ya see?
- Lazer Maze finally reopened.

70
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:29,598
Yeah! Took 'em long enough.

71
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,443
What, one black light
falls on a kid,

72
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:33,164
and you have to close
for a year?

73
00:02:33,296 --> 00:02:34,735
Well, COVID...

74
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,414
- Oh, right. Well, listen.
- We should go later tonight.

75
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:39,357
Yeah. And there's that
Mediterranean place next door.

76
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:40,630
We could fuel up first.

77
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:42,438
I mean, if that's... cool.

78
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:43,614
Why wouldn't it be?

79
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:45,355
Because of my views
on the Greeks?

80
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,169
 What? No.
I'm just trying to be good

81
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:48,756
about the boundaries
that you and Brian set up.

82
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:50,037
Oh, no, it's not like a date.

83
00:02:50,122 --> 00:02:52,037
As long as whatever we're doing
ends in sex,

84
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:54,390
it's like the laser tag
is just extended foreplay.

85
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,834
Right. Foreplay
surrounded by teenagers

86
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,323
and cardboard aliens.

87
00:02:58,408 --> 00:03:00,412
- I been turned on by worse.
- Me, too.

88
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,241
Okay, state your name
for the record.

89
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:03,848
Glenn Sturgis.

90
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:06,841
Why are you writing that down?
That's the right answer.

91
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:09,537
No, no, this is what lawyers
do... they might take notes.

92
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,513
But you can't let that
distract you.

93
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,108
Oh, mind games!

94
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,471
Oh, okay, well,

95
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:16,365
sure, yeah... game on.

96
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,324
Check and mate.
Ohh...

97
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:21,434
Sure. Also, they might
let a quiet moment hang

98
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:23,262
after you've answered
a question.

99
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:24,698
Silences are uncomfortable,

100
00:03:24,782 --> 00:03:26,787
and so people
will try to fill them

101
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:28,572
and then end up saying more.

102
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:31,013
Oh, okay. Got it.
No problem.

103
00:03:34,786 --> 00:03:36,486
Ha. What is this?

104
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:38,818
Are you doing it now?

105
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:44,912
Are you mad at me?
Did you find out

106
00:03:44,997 --> 00:03:46,747
that I accidentally hit your
car in the parking lot?

107
00:03:46,832 --> 00:03:49,099
Because it was just a scratch!

108
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:52,061
You think you're so perfect,
you know?

109
00:03:52,146 --> 00:03:54,685
Well, I used to have
a body like that once.

110
00:03:54,953 --> 00:03:58,280
So, you know,
so check out your future,

111
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:00,862
you fart face!

112
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,127
Okay. So, some things
to work on.

113
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:10,685
Hey, Mateo, it's Eugene.

114
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,505
This is what I look like
in a mask.

115
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:14,269
- Yeah, I can tell it's you.
- Hi.

116
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:15,880
I got a subpoena.

117
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,404
I guess 'cause the lawyers
think I'm Glenn's assistant

118
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:19,536
and wanna depose me?

119
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,798
Oh, crap. Right.

120
00:04:21,883 --> 00:04:23,263
- Don't worry.
- I'm just gonna go in there

121
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:25,689
and explain our situation...
How, on paper, you know,

122
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:27,255
you still work in
the Vision Center

123
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,779
and I'm "Glenn's assistant."

124
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:30,721
- What? No.
- Eugene, you can't.

125
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:34,183
Our arrangement
isn't exactly... above board.

126
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,044
Just... pretend
you're Glenn's assistant.

127
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:39,591
But if I lie under oath,
they'll send me to jail.

128
00:04:39,676 --> 00:04:42,253
If you tell them the truth,
it's gonna ruin my whole life.

129
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:43,677
Please?

130
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:45,910
I'm supposed to get
my ankle monitor off today.

131
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,781
I might even be
a boot guy now.

132
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:50,305
- You're not a boot guy.
- People change!

133
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:51,916
Whatever.
You can't go in there.

134
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,266
Well, I kinda have to
'cause of the subpoena,

135
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,115
but I'll them that you really
don't wanna be in trouble.

136
00:04:59,388 --> 00:05:00,490
Hey.

137
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,138
You gotta do what you
believe is right.

138
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:04,189
- Right.
- Why don't you stay here,

139
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:06,017
and I'll go see
if they're ready for you.

140
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:07,494
Okay.

141
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:17,681
Eugene?
Did you lock me out?

142
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:20,118
No! I didn't even
touch the door!

143
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:22,599
Oh, no!

144
00:05:22,683 --> 00:05:24,772
The door must be stuck!

145
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,952
Hey, Dina,
Brett wants to go home

146
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,258
because of his sciatica?
Is that a real thing,

147
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:32,260
or is it like when
Isaac needed Friday off

148
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:34,132
for an appointment
with his Mandalorian?

149
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:35,525
Hang on. What do you
think's going on

150
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:37,265
between Garrett and that woman?

151
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,785
- Uh... I don't know.
- Looks like he's helping

152
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,995
some girl with a dead tree.

153
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,542
Yeah, but it seemed like
she was laughing.

154
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:44,159
If anything, he should
be laughing at her

155
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,588
for that ridiculous return.

156
00:05:45,673 --> 00:05:47,541
- Oh, my God.
- Are you jealous?

157
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:49,837
What? No, I'm dating Brian.

158
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,237
- I don't know.
- You and Garrett

159
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:53,417
have been hanging out
a lot lately, so...

160
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:56,051
kinda feels like you guys
"like" like each other.

161
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:57,675
No, we don't "like" like
each other

162
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,591
because we're not 12-year-olds
at archery camp.

163
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:01,190
We are adults
in a complex relationship

164
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,503
where I am the hinge
between a romantic primary

165
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:04,875
and a sexual secondary.

166
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:06,566
I've never been a hinge
before.

167
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:09,114
Well, one time, the
exterminator walked in on us

168
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,648
and, like, kinda lingered,
but I guess that doesn't count.

169
00:06:11,732 --> 00:06:13,301
No. That's just
exterminators.

170
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:14,564
Jesus! What is this...

171
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:17,001
Ladies' Night
at Customer Service?

172
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,277
On the day of the incident,

173
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:20,176
Glenn Sturgis
was floor supervisor.

174
00:06:20,261 --> 00:06:21,418
Yes, he was.

175
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:22,942
To the best of your
knowledge,

176
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:25,468
did Mr. Sturgis make any
modifications to the robot?

177
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:27,950
Uh, no, Glenn would never
do anything like that.

178
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:30,144
Glenn's a bit of a technophobe,
you know?

179
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:33,208
He keeps his radio dialed
to the Christmas station

180
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:34,627
all year round
'cause he's worried

181
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:36,368
he's not gonna be able
to find his way back.

182
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:37,761
So it's your understanding

183
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:39,719
that he generally
avoided the robot.

184
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:40,902
Oh, absolutely.

185
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:43,157
So that would include
performing

186
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:45,925
the required maintenance
and software updates.

187
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:48,226
Uh... I'm sorry?

188
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:51,155
That's the responsibility
of a floor supervisor.

189
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,003
Oh, uh... huh.

190
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:57,094
I...
I did not know that.

191
00:06:57,536 --> 00:07:00,585
A skipped or improperly
performed update

192
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,544
could have resulted
in the electrocution

193
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:04,910
of my client, so...

194
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:06,652
Yeah, well, I-I mean,
I'm sure Glenn

195
00:07:06,737 --> 00:07:08,391
tried to do the updates.

196
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:15,074
Thi... this is not like
to... to, you know,

197
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:17,628
fill the silence...
or whatever.

198
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:19,892
But just to say it,
shouldn't there have been

199
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:22,575
like a technician
or something involved?

200
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,047
I mean, I feel like it's unfair
to expect somebody like Glenn...

201
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:26,753
"Somebody like Glenn."

202
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:29,108
Is there a competence issue?

203
00:07:29,193 --> 00:07:30,371
No! No, no!

204
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:32,566
Glenn is... can be...

205
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:35,757
uh, competent, uh,
in... in a lot of ways.

206
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:38,224
Could... do you wanna...
Do you wanna jump in here?

207
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:41,506
This lawsuit is against
the Cloud 9 corporation.

208
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:43,457
But it sounds like
you're saying

209
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,107
that Mr. Sturgis,
as an individual,

210
00:07:46,192 --> 00:07:47,809
is responsible for the injury.

211
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:49,293
It's not your turn
to ask questions.

212
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:51,208
- Thank you.
- But I like that question.

213
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:53,856
- So I'll ask it.
- I... objection.

214
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,191
O-overruled.
Yeah. Yeah.

215
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:01,429
You know what? I can
take care of this for you.

216
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:02,506
Why don't you just pick out

217
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:03,881
- a different size?
- Trying to get her into

218
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:06,274
something more form-fitting?
Man, Customer Service

219
00:08:06,358 --> 00:08:08,631
is just your own sick
little candy store, isn't it?

220
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:11,037
Uh... and bereavement cards
are on aisle three.

221
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,672
I'm sorry about your sister.

222
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:15,827
What was that? Did you really
think I was flirting with her?

223
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,444
Well, it looked like there
was less blood in your face.

224
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:19,919
- It had to go somewhere.
- I was being pleasant.

225
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:22,161
And even if I was flirting
with her, who cares?

226
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:23,918
We're not dating,
so I can flirt with

227
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,207
or date whoever I want.

228
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,895
- No, totally.
- I mean, if that's...

229
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,161
what you want,
then knock yourself out.

230
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:30,239
Date a hundred women.

231
00:08:30,324 --> 00:08:32,244
And you wouldn't have
a problem with that, right?

232
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,325
No! No, I'd be fine.

233
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,576
You'dbe the person
with the problem,

234
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,675
because you're so bad
with names.

235
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,701
Regardless, I'm fine,
you're fine.

236
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,577
That lady can throw it
around as much as she wants.

237
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:42,753
We're all fine!

238
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:44,492
Anyway...

239
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,463
Hey! I got you a little
congratulations gift

240
00:08:49,548 --> 00:08:51,118
for getting your ankle
monitor off...

241
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:52,243
Some fun socks!

242
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:54,657
Okay, great. Just drop 'em
on the ground and walk away.

243
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,086
- Thanks so much.
- Aw, man, fun socks?

244
00:08:57,356 --> 00:08:58,708
Takes me a pic!

245
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:00,916
Why is Eugene in your office?

246
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,613
Eugene got stuck!

247
00:09:02,697 --> 00:09:04,805
Apparently,
my door got jammed.

248
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,344
He was gonna blab
to the lawyers

249
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,444
about our work arrangement.

250
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:08,793
So you kidnapped him?

251
00:09:08,877 --> 00:09:10,534
No! You can't be kidnapped

252
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:12,101
if you don't know
you're being kidnapped.

253
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,657
Oh. Okay.

254
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:15,191
So what's your plan?

255
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:16,627
I don't have one yet!

256
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:18,001
While you were out there
buying socks,

257
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:19,812
I was busy dealing with this!

258
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:22,374
Love the socks, by the way.
So thoughtful.

259
00:09:22,717 --> 00:09:25,288
Uh, hey, uh, quick heads up.

260
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:27,981
It's... it's looking like
they're targeting Glenn

261
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:30,091
to take the fall
for Carol's lawsuit.

262
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:31,396
- Ugh.
- Yeah!

263
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:32,771
The lawyer, she's just like...

264
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:34,614
Like anything you say,
she's just gonna twist

265
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,356
to make it sound like
Glenn's incompetent.

266
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:38,231
What did you say
that she twisted?

267
00:09:38,387 --> 00:09:41,089
Oh, me? Uh, well,
f-for me, it was, uh,

268
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:44,224
I might've... I said something
along the lines of Glenn...

269
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:46,115
uh, being incompetent.

270
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,943
Mm. Don't see
how that got twisted.

271
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:49,595
Jonah, why would you
say that?

272
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,127
Glenn can't afford
to get sued.

273
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:52,314
He has a two-year-old,

274
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,353
and his health is, like,
sobad.

275
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:56,017
- Yeah. Yeah, got it.
- Yeah, no.

276
00:09:56,102 --> 00:09:57,910
Stomach cramps
on full blast already.

277
00:09:57,995 --> 00:10:00,087
Oh, hey, there's Carol,
everybody.

278
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:02,007
Hey, Carol, can you
talk to your lawyer?

279
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:03,221
Jonah screwed up royally,

280
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:04,462
and now
she's going after Glenn.

281
00:10:04,547 --> 00:10:06,397
Oh, no, I hate to hear that.

282
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:08,965
But gotta let the lawyers
do their job, right?

283
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:11,490
Now, what should I name
my boat?

284
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:13,144
I'm leaning toward
"Wet Ride,"

285
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:14,841
but I'm open
to other ideas.

286
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:17,148
Look, all you guys
have to do is go in there

287
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:19,541
and make Glenn sound like
he's, you know,

288
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,204
good at his job...
which, he is!

289
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:26,418
And when the system
went down,

290
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:29,346
Glenn put in everybody's
hours for the previous week

291
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:30,408
from memory.

292
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:31,634
- Hmm.
- And why did the system

293
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:32,994
- go down?
- Because somebody

294
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,390
spilled juice
on the clock-in machine.

295
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:37,009
- Oh, was there a...
- child in the back area?

296
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:40,132
No. It was an adult that was
running away with juice

297
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,650
'cause they weren't
supposed to be drinking it.

298
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:43,962
And this adult was...

299
00:10:44,283 --> 00:10:46,462
Bad at running with juice.

300
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:48,351
Would you say
that Glenn Sturgis

301
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:49,788
is a competent manager?

302
00:10:49,873 --> 00:10:51,182
Is this off the record, or...

303
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:53,358
- This is all under oath.
- Under... great.

304
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:55,011
Oh, boy. Okay...

305
00:10:55,095 --> 00:10:57,362
Glenn is...
what is Glenn?

306
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:59,015
Glenn I... you know, ha!

307
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:01,105
He is... it's... the thing...

308
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:03,829
the thing is, about him...

309
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:06,326
Glenn and I, we're top dogs
in this doghouse.

310
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:07,937
Why? Competence.

311
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:10,592
Jonah's... the most competent.

312
00:11:10,676 --> 00:11:12,159
Then Dina, obviously.

313
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:14,509
Preeti is probably
up there too.

314
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:15,771
Uh...

315
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:18,252
Oh, Mateo.
Jeez. Okay.

316
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:21,560
- Glenn can...
- handle phone calls,

317
00:11:21,644 --> 00:11:25,041
uh, keep things in binders...

318
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,790
Oh! He wears clothes.
Uh...

319
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:30,126
honestly, when you add it up,
he can do, like,

320
00:11:30,236 --> 00:11:31,874
probably hundreds of things.

321
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:39,055
- Uh, I said... Garrett yet?
- Did I mention Garrett?

322
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:42,711
So there's gonna be
Jonah, Dina, Garrett,

323
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:46,672
Preeti, me...
Depending on the week...

324
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:49,065
Glenn Sturgis is...

325
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,939
Mm...

326
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:54,593
Could you repeat the question?

327
00:11:54,677 --> 00:11:56,247
He has a weird voice.

328
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:59,337
Like...
"Okay, everybody..."

329
00:11:59,421 --> 00:12:01,817
So, Eugene,
you're Glenn's assistant.

330
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:04,255
Eugene O'Malley
is Glenn's assistant, yes.

331
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:07,040
Oh, well,
you can just say "I."

332
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:09,751
Eugene O'Malley just thinks
a little differently.

333
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:11,072
Have you met Alan?

334
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:12,857
Oh, my God,
I forgot about Alan!

335
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:15,339
Okay, do you have
a whiteboard?

336
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,530
- This isn't working.
- Carol's lawyer is relentless.

337
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,880
W-we can't let them
pin it all on Glenn.

338
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:22,556
Pin what on me?

339
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:26,165
Not something, I hope.

340
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:31,759
Why is this happening
to me?

341
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:33,510
Why do people think
that I'm at fault

342
00:12:33,595 --> 00:12:37,057
- for Carol's electrocution?
- Uh, well, so, uh,

343
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:40,001
when I was trying to
defend you,

344
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:42,822
uh, we were talking about
the robot malfunction,

345
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:45,932
and I may have suggested
that youwere...

346
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:49,900
a little less than
100% competent.

347
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,572
You said that?

348
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:52,338
Yeah...

349
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:53,540
You don't think
I'm competent?

350
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,353
No, Glenn, that's...

351
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:56,666
- It came out wrong...
- No, no.

352
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,759
I'm... I'm happy to find out
what you really think of me.

353
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:02,682
But I may have to take your
picture out of my wallet.

354
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:05,815
- Glenn, come on.
- What picture is this again?

355
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:07,818
One, two...

356
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:10,262
Ooh!

357
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,364
Oh, no! I can't believe
that didn't work.

358
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:14,541
Looks like I'm really
stuck, you guys.

359
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:19,066
I think I may have to
reschedule my deposition.

360
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:23,074
Oh, hey, I just spoke
with Carol's lawyer,

361
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,381
and she said Eugene
could do his deposition

362
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:27,297
through the door,
if you wanted.

363
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:28,951
- What?
- She gave me the questions

364
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:30,300
to ask and everything.

365
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:32,563
He could do his deposition
now with us

366
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:33,781
and be done with it.

367
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:36,654
Well, i-it's a little
unorthodox,

368
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:38,785
but I'll allow it.

369
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,308
Uh, so, the first
question is...

370
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:46,015
- Where were you born?
- Where was I born?

371
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:48,144
Yeah, I know.

372
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,929
It seems like it has nothing
to do with Carol's lawsuit.

373
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:53,366
But that's the first question.

374
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,804
Well, it's a pretty
crazy story, uh...

375
00:13:56,888 --> 00:14:00,983
I was born in a hospital
in Jefferson City, Missouri.

376
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:04,812
White mom, white dad.

377
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:06,989
Hey, Dina, a lot of people
have questions

378
00:14:07,073 --> 00:14:09,121
- about this email you sent.
- Really?

379
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:10,906
"Due to recent complaints,

380
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,126
"employees at Customer Service
are hereby off-limits

381
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,172
in regards to flirting
and/or dating."

382
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,608
Which concept
are ya fuzzy on?

383
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:19,305
Our question is
why did you send it?

384
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:20,741
Yeah. And did Garrett

385
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,439
like specifically
say something about me?

386
00:14:22,523 --> 00:14:24,615
'Cause we've been vibing
for a while.

387
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:27,183
- No. This is just...
- standard procedure.

388
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,446
From corporate.
About dating in the workplace.

389
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,622
I think they just wanna stay
a step ahead since it's spring

390
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:33,667
and, you know, everybody's
getting horned up.

391
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:36,624
Hmm. Damn. I really
thought we were vibing.

392
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:39,725
Dina, this email's wack.

393
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:42,294
Come on, just admit it.
You're jealous.

394
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:43,851
I mean, it makes sense.

395
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:46,807
Garrett's like a really nice
guy and funny and cute.

396
00:14:46,892 --> 00:14:48,143
Well, he's off-limits,
Cheyenne.

397
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:50,127
- I just sent the email.
- Okay.

398
00:14:50,212 --> 00:14:52,739
Sorry. It's just I...
I guess I have been

399
00:14:52,824 --> 00:14:55,534
spending more time with Garrett
and, I don't know, I...

400
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:57,039
I liked it, I...

401
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:59,215
I like him.

402
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,043
Aw. Well, that's great.

403
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:02,869
Oh, but, yeah,
probably confusing.

404
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,733
Yeah. 'Cause there's
still Brian,

405
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:06,474
who I also like, so...

406
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,581
Mmm. In tenth grade,
I was caught between Bo

407
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,923
and this guy Darius that
he used to freestyle rap with.

408
00:15:12,007 --> 00:15:14,447
- What did you do?
- I told Bo how I felt,

409
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:17,102
and then...
he took a poo in the backseat

410
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:20,714
of Darius's mom's
station wagon.

411
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:22,629
Cheyenne,
I had such high hopes,

412
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,354
and have truly no idea
what to take from that story.

413
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,363
I'm just saying that you
should tell Garrett

414
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:30,019
how you feel because
maybe he feels the same way.

415
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:31,291
And if he's not willing

416
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:33,512
to take a crap in the backseat
of Brian's car,

417
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:35,947
then... pfft...
There's no decision to make.

418
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,197
And April was kinda fun

419
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,432
because the ducklings
were having a tea party,

420
00:15:41,604 --> 00:15:43,433
and, you know,
just imagining them

421
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,478
trying to drink that tea
with their beaks...

422
00:15:45,562 --> 00:15:47,521
there's no way
they got all of it.

423
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:51,267
- Excuse me.
- You can't be in here.

424
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,443
Yeah. I am not leaving

425
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:55,445
until you hear me out.

426
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:56,794
This is totally
inappropriate.

427
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:58,926
What's inappropriate,
Hannah,

428
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,799
is youall trying to
squeeze out a big payday

429
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:03,279
from this good, kind man.

430
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:04,541
- Jonah...
- No, Glenn, I got this.

431
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,151
Look at your ducklings.

432
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:08,458
Sir, could you point to
the motherboard

433
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:10,236
on this robot for me?

434
00:16:10,384 --> 00:16:12,476
- No, I can't.
- No, you can't.

435
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,940
Hannah, can you update
the sim card on the robot?

436
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:17,380
- No.
- No?!

437
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:18,990
Huh! That's interesting.

438
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:21,601
Because you all have had the
exact same amount of training

439
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:23,429
that Cloud 9 gives
its floor supervisors...

440
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:25,083
Jonah, I did it.

441
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:26,302
S-sorry?

442
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,130
Well, not at first,

443
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:30,349
but I watched hours
of online videos

444
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:32,395
and eventually,
I figured it out.

445
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:34,266
That's what I was
just showing them.

446
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,616
I kept records of everything...
Every update,

447
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,401
every new hardware install...

448
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:40,441
It's all right here
in my calendar.

449
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:43,232
I did everything
that corporate asked me to do.

450
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:44,807
So I don't know
what happened with Carol,

451
00:16:44,892 --> 00:16:47,201
but it is not on me.

452
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:51,022
Anyway, if there are
no further questions,

453
00:16:51,106 --> 00:16:54,373
I have been nervously
holding my pee for six hours,

454
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:56,332
so I really need to get to
a men's room.

455
00:16:56,627 --> 00:16:57,942
Oh, and Jonah,

456
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:01,029
I don't think I'll be needing
your help with that either.

457
00:17:02,696 --> 00:17:04,350
Glenn, you...

458
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:08,423
I-I'm not going to help...

459
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:09,702
It's... it's...

460
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:12,762
Good day.

461
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:18,859
Jonah.

462
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:24,190
- Glenn, hey, look, I...
- I'm sorry.

463
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,165
I should never have implied
that you were incompetent.

464
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,932
You've been doing this
for a long time, and...

465
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:35,901
and I should have
respected that.

466
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,480
Wow. Silence really works.

467
00:17:39,564 --> 00:17:42,570
I just said "Jonah,"
and you completely unloaded.

468
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:43,832
No, but Glenn, I-I mean it.

469
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,399
I-I should have known
that of course

470
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:47,445
you followed all the protocols
and maintenance.

471
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,882
- Mm.
- I trust you.

472
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:51,013
Aw.

473
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,992
Prove it.

474
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:54,089
What?

475
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,583
If you trust me, then
you should have no problem

476
00:17:56,668 --> 00:17:58,670
sticking your hand
inside that robot.

477
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:03,714
- Uh, okay, yeah.
- Yeah!

478
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,292
I will do that,

479
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,030
because I trust
that you made it safe.

480
00:18:08,114 --> 00:18:09,776
- Mm-hmm.
- Carol only got hurt

481
00:18:09,861 --> 00:18:11,779
because she used
a screwdriver, right?

482
00:18:11,864 --> 00:18:14,340
So, uh, yeah, I will do that

483
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:16,299
and... and... and let you know
how it goes.

484
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:17,820
Right now's good.

485
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:21,785
Yeah. Yeah! Great.

486
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,652
Yeah.

487
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:26,484
Yeah. This feels good.
This is...

488
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:28,525
- This feels... aah,!
- Oh!

489
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,513
- I am so...
- Aah!

490
00:18:30,598 --> 00:18:32,081
That should not have
happened!

491
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,055
What is wrong with this...

492
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:35,794
Aah! God! Fudge!

493
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:40,596
Hey, uh, maybe we should
talk about some things.

494
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,448
- Oh, yeah, I'll start.
- Why did I hear

495
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:44,042
from multiple people
that I used to date

496
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:46,916
that you emailed them and said
that we couldn't talk anymore?

497
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:49,496
- Yeah, here's the thing.
- Um...

498
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:52,597
our situation has gotten
a little complicated...

499
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,667
Okay, well, I'll make it
less complicated... I'm done.

500
00:18:54,752 --> 00:18:55,861
- What?
- Look,

501
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:57,993
I knew this thing
was gonna be fun and weird,

502
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:00,343
but I was really hoping
that fun would win.

503
00:19:00,427 --> 00:19:02,560
Turns out,
it's a blowout for weird.

504
00:19:04,562 --> 00:19:05,814
Fine with me.

505
00:19:06,216 --> 00:19:07,525
I'm with Brian, so...

506
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:09,875
Uh, I'm still gonna go
to laser tag tonight,

507
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:12,918
so if you go, maybe we should
do different slots, whatever.

508
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:18,013
- Okay.
- They left the break room.

509
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:20,799
The Cloud 9 lawyer said it was
"feeling like a wings night,"

510
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:22,583
so I think he's leaving.

511
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,194
- Eugene?
- Sandra and I are gonna try

512
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,759
one more thing, okay?

513
00:19:30,283 --> 00:19:32,375
I think we're getting close!

514
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:33,725
Pull harder, Sandra!

515
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:35,378
Okay!

516
00:19:36,594 --> 00:19:38,643
- Ah!
- Ah! Whoa!

517
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:41,123
Did you...
redecorate?

518
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:44,344
Yep. I felt so bad keeping
Mateo from his work.

519
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:47,477
I'm no gay guy,
but I hope you like it.

520
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,262
Thanks, Eugene.

521
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:50,655
See ya.

522
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:52,305
Wow!

523
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:55,921
Hey.

524
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:57,444
Don't feel guilty.

525
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,272
You're getting your
ankle monitor off!

526
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:00,839
And all Eugene knows

527
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:02,667
is that the door was stuck
and he got to

528
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:04,886
- redecorate an office.
- Right. You're right.

529
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,019
And I mean,
he was barely kidnapped.

530
00:20:07,103 --> 00:20:10,892
We didn't ask for a ransom or
do anything to his nipples.

531
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,286
I don't know... I think you're
gonna need more than sanitizer.

532
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,158
Big deposition fan, huh?

533
00:20:16,242 --> 00:20:18,508
I... sorry about all that.

534
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,771
Naw, it was fun.

535
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:21,555
It was kind of like
being in a haunted house.

536
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:23,470
I kept waiting for you to
pop out from somewhere else.

537
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:27,779
Look, I was just trying
to protect Glenn.

538
00:20:27,863 --> 00:20:30,172
From the big, mean lawyer
trying to get her payday.

539
00:20:30,256 --> 00:20:32,261
Look, I get it.
I get it.

540
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:34,263
But you should know
I'm not some

541
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:37,571
sleazy ambulance chaser
with her face on every bus.

542
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:39,617
- I never...
- I mean, my face is on one bus

543
00:20:39,701 --> 00:20:42,315
but I had to do it...
That's the industry.

544
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:43,795
- I was just doing my job.
- No, I know.

545
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:46,145
And I was just...
embarrassing myself.

546
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:47,799
- Big time!
- Yeah.

547
00:20:47,883 --> 00:20:50,715
I-I thought it was
kind of sweet, actually.

548
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,281
Hannah!

549
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:54,980
- Let's go get margs, girl!
- Oh, yeah!

550
00:20:55,064 --> 00:20:56,416
You're buying!

551
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,070
Oh, my God, she is the worst.

552
00:20:58,154 --> 00:21:00,246
You didn't hear me say that.

553
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,901
Oh, no, of course not.

554
00:21:02,985 --> 00:21:04,946
Hey, uh, Hannah, um,

555
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,645
let me know if you have
any other...

556
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:09,429
depositions I can crash.

557
00:21:09,513 --> 00:21:11,300
Oh, yeah.

558
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:13,607
I'll see what I can do,
Mr. Simms.

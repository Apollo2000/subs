1
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:08,967
I don't understand why
Glenn needs the shots

2
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:10,736
if you're the one carrying the baby.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,738
If I have to pump
myself full of hormones

4
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:14,206
in order to carry his child,

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,408
it's only fair that he go
through the same pain.

6
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:17,876
Yeah, but with saline, so that

7
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:20,546
my male parts don't
turn into female parts.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,714
Yeah, that's how it works.

9
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:24,883
I just can't believe you
guys are making a baby.

10
00:00:24,918 --> 00:00:26,518
You don't even like each other.

11
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:28,487
If I wanted to avoid doing
things with people I hate,

12
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:29,988
I would literally never leave my house.

13
00:00:30,023 --> 00:00:32,224
And believe me, I am only
doing it for the money.

14
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:36,662
And believe me, if there was
any other usable, affordable

15
00:00:36,696 --> 00:00:38,397
womb within 1,000 miles of here,

16
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:39,763
I would not be using hers.

17
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:41,733
It just sucks that you have
to get so many shots.

18
00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:43,835
Well, I had the option
of taking them orally.

19
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,270
Then why did you pick shots?

20
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:46,975
That's why.

21
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,942

00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:54,580
Amy, you're old, right?

23
00:00:54,614 --> 00:00:55,847
Um...

24
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:57,683
Like you were alive during the '90s.

25
00:00:57,717 --> 00:01:00,919
Yeah, I was. Yep, the roaring '90s.

26
00:01:00,954 --> 00:01:03,789
So, what would you say
would be the best piñata

27
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:06,692
for a Green Day-themed birthday
party for a two-year-old?

28
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:08,026
Um, okay.

29
00:01:08,061 --> 00:01:10,295
Let's back that up real quick.

30
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,863
Harmonica's into Green Day?

31
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:14,132
I doubt she's ever heard of them.

32
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:14,866
She's two.

33
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:16,868
But it's my mom's favorite band,

34
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:19,371
and it's just easier
not to argue with her.

35
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:20,806
Wouldn't your mom be okay

36
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,907
with something a little
more kid-friendly?

37
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:24,042
Like, I don't know, "Minions?"

38
00:01:24,077 --> 00:01:27,246
She just got out of jail.
Minions are criminals.

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,382
That could suck her right
back in to the lifestyle.

40
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,284
Good point. Um...

41
00:01:32,318 --> 00:01:35,320
All right, well, what
about, like, mermaids?

42
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:37,864
I don't know. My mom
really wants Green Day.

43
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:40,559
Mermaids are a lot like Green Day.

44
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:42,494
They're half-fish, half-human,

45
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:43,895
they're like rebels.

46
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,664
You know, down for whatever.

47
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:48,634
In fact, they used to call Green Day

48
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:50,969
the mermaids of '90s rock.

49
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:52,671
- Is that true?
- Mm-hmm.

50
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:53,673
It's totally true.

51
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:57,109
Jonah, which puzzle seems
more fun for the cabin?

52
00:01:57,143 --> 00:01:59,898
"Bubbling Mountain Brook,"
or "Ankylosaurs?"

53
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,290
Let's go "Bubbling Brook."

54
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,702
Ooh, bad boy. I like it.

55
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:07,753
Okay, I'm gonna go
hide it so nobody else

56
00:02:07,787 --> 00:02:08,754
buys it before we can.

57
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,322
Ooh, good idea.

58
00:02:10,356 --> 00:02:12,700
Pretty steamy weekend
you guys got planned.

59
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:14,459
Yeah, I'm excited.

60
00:02:14,494 --> 00:02:15,827
Not as excited as I am.

61
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:18,363
I got the apartment to myself,
Randy's gonna come over,

62
00:02:18,398 --> 00:02:20,165
we're gonna strap into
our video game chairs

63
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,263
and not move for 70 hours straight.

64
00:02:22,264 --> 00:02:23,419
Oh, um...

65
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:25,437
Randy's coming over.

66
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:26,795
Cool.

67
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:29,541
You're gonna be having sex on
a jigsaw puzzle in the Ozarks,

68
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:30,542
and you're jealous of Randy?

69
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:32,177
No, no, jealous? No.

70
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:34,946
I just didn't know he
was gonna come over,

71
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:37,640
so that's just, you know,
news to me, is all.

72
00:02:40,253 --> 00:02:40,929
Cool.

73
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:47,373
20,000, for the most beautiful gift...

74
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,161
Okay, I ran out of space again.

75
00:02:49,195 --> 00:02:51,396
I'm just gonna void this,
and I'll do another one.

76
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:52,740
It doesn't have to be perfect.

77
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:55,591
No, I am not starting out
this journey with a mistake.

78
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,376
Here, you can fill out the forms

79
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,338
while I write another one.

80
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:00,806
Forms?

81
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,041
"Gestational surrogacy agreement."

82
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:04,876
You're making me sign a contract?

83
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:07,145
It's what they say
you're supposed to do.

84
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,247
"Regular checkups," "custody release..."

85
00:03:09,282 --> 00:03:11,316
Okay, wait, you think
I want to steal your kid?

86
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:13,151
And then what?
Have to spend years explaining

87
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:15,153
why it's good thing to be
chosen last for dodgeball?

88
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:17,255
No, it's just better safe than sorry.

89
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,625
No, no, no, that's fine, that's fine.

90
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:20,158
You know what?
I am gonna give this a read,

91
00:03:20,193 --> 00:03:21,893
and I'll let you know
if I have any thoughts.

92
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:24,909
It should be fine.
It was the first one on Google.

93
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:27,199
Oh, look how cute!

94
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,900
Mermaid treasure for the treasure hunt.

95
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:30,335
The treasure is seashells?

96
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,837
Wouldn't mermaid treasure be something

97
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,238
they don't have general access to?

98
00:03:33,272 --> 00:03:36,174
Like, human garbage would
be treasure to them.

99
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,649
I wish I were a mermaid.
I would clean up.

100
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:39,982
I think you'd be a mer-man.

101
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:42,669
Yeah, I don't really
buy mermen as a thing.

102
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,153
Then how did they use to, you know...

103
00:03:45,563 --> 00:03:46,958
[bleep]?

104
00:03:47,263 --> 00:03:49,998
Unless that's why they went extinct.

105
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:51,800
They didn't go extinct.

106
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:54,236
They lost their tails over
the course of centuries

107
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,370
and turned into humans.

108
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:56,278
It's called evolution.

109
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,805
I don't think so.

110
00:03:57,806 --> 00:03:59,736
Okay, fine, God made us.

111
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:01,135
Look at the human eye.

112
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:03,078
It's too complicated.

113
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:05,047
No, I believe in evolution.

114
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:07,850
I'm just saying it's make
believe... it's like unicorns.

115
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:09,852
We don't know that
there were never unicorns.

116
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:13,488
I read that we discover like 50
new species of frogs each year.

117
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:15,591
Maybe scientists just haven't
discovered unicorns yet.

118
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,159
Frogs are tiny. I think somebody

119
00:04:17,193 --> 00:04:18,468
would've noticed a unicorn.

120
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:20,205
A lot of people believe unicorns exist.

121
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:22,164
A lot of people believe in Bigfoot.

122
00:04:22,198 --> 00:04:23,498
A lot of people believe in angels!

123
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,000
I believe in angels.

124
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:26,668
No, you don't.

125
00:04:26,703 --> 00:04:27,541
Yeah, I do.

126
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:29,825
I used to think kangaroos were real.

127
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:43,626
"Surrogate shall be reimbursed

128
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:45,254
for all tailoring expenses?"

129
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:46,688
I'm gonna have to have
my clothes converted

130
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:48,857
to maternity clothes and
then converted back after.

131
00:04:48,892 --> 00:04:50,759
"In the event of a baby
over eight pounds,

132
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:53,862
lessee will reimburse leaser
for vaginal reconstruction."

133
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:55,797
Hey, I was happy to have
a gentleman's agreement.

134
00:04:55,832 --> 00:04:58,934
You're the one who wanted
to get all formal about it.

135
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:01,703
I'm gonna have to take some
time to review these changes.

136
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:05,807
Sure, oh, FYI, clauses 30-49
are all vag-related,

137
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:08,371
and the last page is the before photos.

138
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:20,958
Whoa, Oreo really upped its
game while I was in prison.

139
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,677
It's like a fat kid's fever dream.

140
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,797
Oh, Amy, this is my mom.

141
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,497
Oh, my gosh! Hi!

142
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:29,898
You're the famous Amy.

143
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,166
I've heard so much about
you over the years,

144
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,301
I feel like I know you.

145
00:05:32,302 --> 00:05:35,264
I'm so sorry about the divorce
and how your life is going.

146
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:38,473
Oh, um, thank you.

147
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:40,976
Uh, so what brings you to the store?

148
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,471
Oh, she was just bringing me
this shirt that she got me

149
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:46,770
that I forgot to put on this morning.

150
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:48,055
It's more professional.

151
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,592
And I gotta get some
stuff for the party.

152
00:05:49,593 --> 00:05:52,254
Do you have a Green
Day-themed bouncy house?

153
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:54,638
Green Day? What happened with mermaids?

154
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,092
My mom thought we should
go back to Green Day.

155
00:05:57,126 --> 00:05:59,985
Mermaids is a little
juvenile, don't you think?

156
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,665
Well, I mean, it is a
two-year-old's birthday party,

157
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,500
and Chey really liked the idea...

158
00:06:05,535 --> 00:06:06,682
Amy, I don't mean to be rude,

159
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:08,537
I know you've been kind
of a mother figure

160
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:10,827
for Cheyenne while
I've been away, but...

161
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:12,816
I'm her actual mother,

162
00:06:13,142 --> 00:06:16,594
so don't you have some
shelving to do or something?

163
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:19,671
Yes, sure.

164
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:21,650
Yeah, sorry.

165
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:22,918
- Okay.
- Bye.

166
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:23,675
Bye.

167
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:26,523
Cinnamon bun Oreos?

168
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:29,928
Technology.

169
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,582
"I'm her actual mother."

170
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:37,583
with its miserable excuse
What does that even mean?

171
00:06:37,618 --> 00:06:39,051
Hard to say.

172
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:41,554
It either means she's the one
who gave birth to her,

173
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:42,216
or...

174
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:44,979
that's the only thing that it means.

175
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,379
Well, it doesn't give her
the right to just swoop in,

176
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,180
and start changing up
perfectly good shirts,

177
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:50,624
and perfectly good parties.

178
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,984
I mean, mermaids is a better
theme than Green Day.

179
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:55,886
Like, that's an objective fact, right?

180
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:57,388
- I like Green Day.
- Really?

181
00:06:57,422 --> 00:06:59,156
Name three of their songs.

182
00:06:59,191 --> 00:07:00,825
"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,"
"Good Riddance,"

183
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:02,093
"When I Come Around."

184
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:04,095
Okay, well, those are the
obvious ones... name three more.

185
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:06,363
"Basket Case," "Longview,"
"American Idiot."

186
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:08,032
You are a very irritating person.

187
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:09,667
I just don't think
that you should butt in.

188
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:12,169
You... you butt in all the time.

189
00:07:12,204 --> 00:07:14,029
That's why your butt is so big.

190
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:17,332
"Welcome to Paradise."

191
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:20,401
"Wake Me Up When September Ends."

192
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,057
I love Green Day.

193
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:26,517
I've never really hired a lawyer before.

194
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:28,726
But I just wanted to
make sure everything

195
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:30,421
Dina put in was kosher.

196
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:32,080
Yeah, well, that makes sense.

197
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,526
I'm sorry about using the word "kosher."

198
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,497
That wasn't a comment on your religion.

199
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,435
Oh, I'm not Jewish.

200
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,433
Okay.

201
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:43,675
I don't mind, though.

202
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:47,071
Well, is it basically okay?

203
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:49,907
Yeah, mostly there's just
a couple small, little nitpicky

204
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:51,709
things that might be
worth discussing with Dina.

205
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:54,645
Oh, okay. I could go get her right now.

206
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:55,720
Yeah.

207
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:57,381
I'll bring in a bagel and a smear.

208
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:58,897
Again, I am not, uh...

209
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,086
You know what?
An onion bagel would be great.

210
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,195
Onion bagel.

211
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:10,795
Do you think Green Day is a mistake?

212
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:16,000
Well, you know, I-I don't
want to butt in, or...

213
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:19,503
But yes, I do, it's crazy.
Cuckoo bananas, makes no sense.

214
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:20,938
You think mermaids would be better?

215
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:23,240
Yes, 100%, I think
you should do mermaids.

216
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:24,451
Look, Chey,

217
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:27,244
you don't have to do everything
your mom tells you to do

218
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,612
just because she's your mom.

219
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:31,315
I just... I have a hard time
standing up to her.

220
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:33,083
She never listens to what I want.

221
00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:36,320
Well, you just gotta sit
her down, and tell her,

222
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:39,333
"I am a grownup.
I make my own decisions."

223
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:42,827
You want me to brag about you to my mom?

224
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:43,828
Uh-uh.

225
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:44,967
Sorry.

226
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:47,364
You would say you were a grownup,

227
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,133
you make your own decisions.

228
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,830
She knows she's a grownup.

229
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,138
Why don't we go talk to her together?

230
00:08:54,172 --> 00:08:55,229
Okay.

231
00:08:55,507 --> 00:08:57,308
- Okay.
- All right, yeah.

232
00:08:57,342 --> 00:08:59,443
I was reading about our Airbnb,

233
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:01,612
and it said that the
toilet is sensitive,

234
00:09:01,646 --> 00:09:03,655
so maybe don't flush your baby wipes.

235
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:05,349
Yeah, of course, totally.

236
00:09:05,383 --> 00:09:08,118
Um, hey, earlier, uh, when
you were talking about

237
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:09,787
how you believed in angels,

238
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:12,990
you meant, sort of, like
a general, ineffable

239
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:14,725
sense of spiritual presence, right?

240
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,253
Not... not like magical little
creatures flying around?

241
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:20,164
What, you mean like fairies?

242
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:21,732
Yeah, I mean, I...

243
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:24,335
- Oh, no, no, I'm not a child.
- Okay, all right, okay.

244
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:25,836
Okay, I was just... I was just checking.

245
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:26,837
Yeah.

246
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,642
Yeah, no, by angels,
I meant like regular-sized,

247
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:34,044
celestial beings who look out for us.

248
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:35,496
Right.

249
00:09:36,047 --> 00:09:41,085
Right, yeah, but not... not with,
like, with halos and wings.

250
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,920
No, they have halos and
wings, they're angels.

251
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:45,512
Right.

252
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:48,859
Okay, cool, yeah, no, I was just, um...

253
00:09:48,894 --> 00:09:50,895
I was just checking, so.

254
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:53,497
Are they goat? Are they dog?
I don't know what they are.

255
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:56,030
- Okay, guys, guys, guys, guys!
- Shh! Shh!

256
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:57,935
Two chupacabra sightings,

257
00:09:57,969 --> 00:10:00,070
two remote Mexican villages,

258
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:02,273
same exact description.

259
00:10:02,307 --> 00:10:04,108
And you know those people
don't have the Internet.

260
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:05,342
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, I'm sold.

261
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:06,710
I'm putting it in real.

262
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:08,212
You know what should be in mythical?

263
00:10:08,246 --> 00:10:10,014
A man who knows where the G-spot is.

264
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:11,081
Justine,

265
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:12,549
contribute, or leave.

266
00:10:12,584 --> 00:10:14,701
It's the third time
you've made that joke.

267
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,521
Oh, so now, we're
lawyering up, is that it?

268
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:20,155
No, no, no, no. Bruce is a friend.

269
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,492
He's here to help us.

270
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:23,394
It's more like we're "friending" up.

271
00:10:23,428 --> 00:10:24,895
I'm not here to make
anything contentious.

272
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,263
I just want to make sure

273
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:27,464
there's no misunderstandings
down the road.

274
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:29,466
See? He's a nice guy.

275
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:30,935
So, as I understand it,

276
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:33,304
you both mutually agreed
to this surrogacy, so...

277
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:35,205
- Mm-hmm.
- If you were to fail to honor

278
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,473
your agreement, we would be forced

279
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:38,475
to go after you with extreme prejudice.

280
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,077
Wait...

281
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:41,478
Go after me?

282
00:10:41,513 --> 00:10:43,147
I'm sorry, maybe I wasn't being clear.

283
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:46,083
Um, we would sue you for
every penny that you're worth.

284
00:10:46,117 --> 00:10:48,085
We would own you, 'cause you
mess with Glenn Sturgis,

285
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:49,653
you get the horns!

286
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:51,755
Okay, this is not... this is
not what we talked about.

287
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,457
So you either sign this contract,

288
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:55,225
or we're gonna bury you
under so much paperwork

289
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,593
you're gonna need a machete

290
00:10:56,628 --> 00:10:58,495
to get from your bedroom
to your bathroom!

291
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,297
Well, the joke's on you,
because I keep a machete

292
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:01,999
in every room in my house.

293
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:03,667
Okay, we're losing the magic

294
00:11:03,702 --> 00:11:05,502
of the journey that
we're going on together.

295
00:11:05,537 --> 00:11:07,771
Sign the contract, Ms. Fox. You sign it!

296
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:09,139
You want to come after me, Glenn?

297
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:10,674
- No.
- Well, bring it on.

298
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:12,276
And as for you, I have a cousin
at the Bar Association,

299
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,746
so you better pray to God your
CLE credits are up to date.

300
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:19,316
Well, I think that was
a nice opening bid.

301
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:21,169
Oh, is this whitefish?

302
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:24,088
Do you believe in angels?

303
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:26,623
Uh, which answer leads
to no follow-up questions?

304
00:11:26,658 --> 00:11:27,825
Kelly believes in 'em.

305
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:29,626
Like believes believes, you know?

306
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:32,496
It's like wings and halos and harps.

307
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,932
Well, I didn't ask about
harps, but I assume...

308
00:11:34,966 --> 00:11:36,600
So she believes in angels. Who cares?

309
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:38,769
I don't care, no, I just...

310
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:40,137
I just think it's interesting, you know,

311
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:42,373
I mean, I don't believe in angels,

312
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:44,475
but if she wants to believe in angels,

313
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:46,977
then I respect that, you know?

314
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:48,345
Doesn't bother me.

315
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,816
Is that something
you think would bother you?

316
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:54,852
Maybe, I don't know.
Hey, when do you guys leave?

317
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:56,620
Because I'm about to
order a 22-foot sub,

318
00:11:56,654 --> 00:11:57,988
and I'd prefer to keep it intact,

319
00:11:58,023 --> 00:12:00,324
so one end has to start in your room.

320
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:02,993
So there are a couple issues.

321
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:04,770
Wow, that's complex.

322
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:07,031
That is [bleep] complex.

323
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:09,833
Um, your daughter is trying
to have a conversation

324
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:11,535
with you, so if you could
put the cookie down,

325
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:13,727
and try to engage meaningfully...

326
00:12:14,672 --> 00:12:17,141
I'm so sorry, I was just
recently in couple's therapy,

327
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:18,600
and that just popped out.

328
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:22,880
All right, I'm engaging meaningfully.

329
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:26,395
I don't want to do a Green Day party.

330
00:12:26,718 --> 00:12:28,252
I thought I asked you to
mind your own business.

331
00:12:28,286 --> 00:12:30,242
This is all Cheyenne,
I'm just here for support.

332
00:12:30,243 --> 00:12:32,423
But she agrees with me, okay?

333
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:33,757
Green Day is dumb.

334
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:36,693
And you know what?
I'm not going to college.

335
00:12:36,728 --> 00:12:38,929
What? Huh?
No, we didn't talk about that.

336
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:40,164
Cheyenne, you're going to college.

337
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:40,958
No, I'm not.

338
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:42,699
Just 'cause you're my
mom doesn't mean that

339
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:44,101
you get to tell me what to do.

340
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:45,119
Right, Amy?

341
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,039
Um, I mean, in general,
that seems true...

342
00:12:49,074 --> 00:12:50,340
See? She agrees.

343
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,876
I'm an adult, and I
make my own decisions.

344
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:55,546
And so, I'm gonna buy a motorcycle,

345
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,115
or, I don't know, a monkey, maybe both.

346
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,717
Um, could we just quickly
go back to the college thing...

347
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:02,286
You don't get to tell
me what to eat, either!

348
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,854
So if I want to eat peyote,

349
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:05,789
I am gonna eat all the peyote I want.

350
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:08,192
And I'm getting a full-sized back tattoo

351
00:13:08,226 --> 00:13:10,727
of the raccoon from
"Guardians of the Galaxy,"

352
00:13:10,762 --> 00:13:13,664
okay? 'Cause I love that movie, and...

353
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:27,302
So you're saying reindeers
actually exist,

354
00:13:27,337 --> 00:13:28,904
like, in the real world?

355
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:31,373
We had a reindeer in the
store on Christmas.

356
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:33,308
I didn't think it was a real reindeer.

357
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:34,576
I thought it was a normal deer

358
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,712
with antlers nailed to its head.

359
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:39,981
Oh, I don't think leprechauns
should be in the real column.

360
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:41,316
Who knows, though, right?

361
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:42,818
- What?
- What are you doing?

362
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:44,486
Is this still about the angel thing?

363
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,555
- Hm?
- Look, I get it.

364
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:48,623
I mean, it must be hard
to believe in angels

365
00:13:48,658 --> 00:13:50,325
if you've never seen one first-hand.

366
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,095
Wait, you've seen an angel?

367
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:54,679
- Sure have.
- When?

368
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,965
Shh! When?

369
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:59,634
Well, um, when I was five,

370
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:01,603
I fell into the indoor pool

371
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:03,171
at the Silver Dollar City Ramada Inn.

372
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:04,339
And I mean,

373
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:06,241
I sank like a brick.

374
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:09,845
And I remember thinking I'd
never seen my parents again.

375
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:12,914
When suddenly, this figure appeared.

376
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:14,282
Did he have wings?

377
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:15,350
He did have wings.

378
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:16,752
Knew it. I knew it.

379
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:19,354
And he sort of was like
floating above me,

380
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:22,625
as if to say, "You're safe now."

381
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:25,994
Next thing I know, I'm
back in our hotel room,

382
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:27,302
dry as a bone.

383
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,864
Oh!

384
00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:30,165
Wow.

385
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:32,501
That's real.

386
00:14:32,535 --> 00:14:36,304
Is it possible that
the figure was floating

387
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:39,040
because he was, you know, in a pool?

388
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:40,709
I know what I saw.

389
00:14:40,743 --> 00:14:44,212
Yeah, and I believe that
you believe that you saw that,

390
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:48,283
but you were also deprived of
oxygen for a little while...

391
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:49,500
Why are you doing this?

392
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:51,853
Because he's jelly
of your peanut butter.

393
00:14:51,888 --> 00:14:55,056
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not... I'm not jelly, no.

394
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:58,193
I just... I just think, you know,
maybe what you saw

395
00:14:58,227 --> 00:14:59,740
wasn't, um, an angel.

396
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:04,618
Maybe what you saw was just
a pasty hotel guest in a robe.

397
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:06,285
Yeah, maybe.

398
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:08,370
Mm-hmm. Maybe I'll consider that

399
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:10,405
when I'm home this weekend, alone.

400
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,934
Whoa, whoa, what are
we talking about, now?

401
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:15,710
Trouble in paradise.

402
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:17,546
Have you been in the break room all day?

403
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,581
Yeah, I'm just not feeling it today.

404
00:15:19,615 --> 00:15:22,050
Look, I'm sorry, I did not know that

405
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:23,385
she was gonna say those things.

406
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:25,320
All I said to her was that
she should be able

407
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:27,489
to make her own decisions.
But I am not her mom.

408
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:30,258
And if someone told my
daughter not to listen to me,

409
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:32,194
well, then, I would be pretty upset.

410
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:34,262
So, I am sorry.

411
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:35,530
I just get so worried

412
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:37,065
she's gonna make
the same mistakes I did.

413
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:38,667
- Yeah.
- I get so scared

414
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:40,101
she's gonna end up in jail,

415
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:43,205
or still working here
when she's our age.

416
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:44,673
Uh, yeah, I don't...

417
00:15:44,707 --> 00:15:47,108
I don't know that those two
are exactly equivalent.

418
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:48,376
I don't know which is worse.

419
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:50,278
Jail, probably.

420
00:15:50,313 --> 00:15:51,422
Well...

421
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:55,147
Hey, what do you think about Bo?

422
00:15:55,585 --> 00:16:00,288
Uh, I think he is an
interesting individual.

423
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:01,289
I think he's a loser.

424
00:16:01,324 --> 00:16:03,358
Clown. I mean, "clown"

425
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:05,427
is the first word that comes to mind.

426
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:06,795
When I think of him, like,

427
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:09,564
I half expect my hand to
buzz when he shakes it.

428
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,933
I don't think clowns do that any more,

429
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:13,201
but that's very funny.

430
00:16:13,236 --> 00:16:14,238
You're funny.

431
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:17,200
Hey.

432
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:20,942
Dina, I know things
got a little heated...

433
00:16:20,977 --> 00:16:23,271
Listen, I apologize if I overreacted.

434
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,981
Oh, thank God. Me too.

435
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:27,883
The things is, I'm gonna go have sex

436
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:28,984
- with Marcus in a few minutes.
- What?

437
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:30,886
What?

438
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,988
That's the special project
you needed help with?

439
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:34,422
Sweet!

440
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:36,224
- Why would you...
- There's just an attraction

441
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:37,425
there, I can't deny it,

442
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,581
blah, blah, blah, the point is,

443
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,295
maybe I get pregnant, maybe I don't.

444
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:41,237
Who knows?

445
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:42,733
So this could be all booked up.

446
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:43,990
No room at the inn.

447
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:44,756
You can't do this.

448
00:16:44,757 --> 00:16:48,670
Oh, I am going to with zero protection.

449
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:49,886
Zero?

450
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:51,973
Amy and I think you need

451
00:16:52,008 --> 00:16:54,009
to start getting serious
about your life.

452
00:16:54,043 --> 00:16:55,744
So now you're on her side?

453
00:16:55,778 --> 00:16:57,979
No, I'm not on anyone's side.

454
00:16:58,014 --> 00:17:00,348
I just agree with her on this stuff.

455
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:05,120
So, now I think it's time for
you to engage meaningfully.

456
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:07,989
You gotta be responsible,
and part of being responsible

457
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:09,124
means getting rid of Bo.

458
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:10,162
Wait, what?

459
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,793
He's a loser, Amy and I both agree.

460
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:12,761
You do?

461
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:15,530
No, uh-uh, I did never call him a loser.

462
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:17,198
Sorry, I think I'm the one
who called him a loser.

463
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,640
Amy called him a clown.

464
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:20,669
I don't... I don't know
how this is productive.

465
00:17:20,703 --> 00:17:21,703
How about we get back to the college...

466
00:17:21,737 --> 00:17:23,278
I can't believe you guys.

467
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:26,940
Amy and I are on the same
page about this one.

468
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,644
I felt like that went so well.

469
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,531
She is so attached to Bo.

470
00:17:32,315 --> 00:17:34,950
Yeah, they are married.

471
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:39,685
The same rules as last time?

472
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:42,291
No kissimg, no eye contact, I
leave as soon as you're done?

473
00:17:42,337 --> 00:17:43,670
We're not sleeping together.

474
00:17:43,705 --> 00:17:45,806
That was just a negotiation
tactic with Glenn.

475
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,275
Oh, right.

476
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:50,611
Of course. Smart.

477
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:52,571
I mean, if someone actually cared,

478
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:55,174
it could be super
hurtful, but it's not me.

479
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,043
Dina, I'd like you to
meet my new surrogate.

480
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,209
She's ready to rock.

481
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,442
Isn't that right, Sandra?

482
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:02,485
Yeah, I'm really excited.

483
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,539
And I have no problem
signing all the paperwork,

484
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,319
so let's do it.

485
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,426
Sandra, mm-hmm.
You're gonna go with Sandra?

486
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:10,157
Mm-hmm.

487
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:12,381
You are gonna leave your baby
at the mercy of a person

488
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,861
whose judgment is so bad
she moved from Hawaii

489
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:16,837
to St. Louis?

490
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:18,564
Yes, I am.

491
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,956
And as soon as I give Sandra the shot,

492
00:18:21,222 --> 00:18:23,197
our deal is over.

493
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:24,289
Fine, good.

494
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:25,580
Marcus!

495
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,495
That was just foreplay, all right?

496
00:18:28,502 --> 00:18:29,945
We're about to get this thing going!

497
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:31,911
Sandra, lift your shirt.

498
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,546
Marcus, take off your shirt!

499
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,714
Fair warning, I still have
a bit of a Thanksgiving paunch

500
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:37,883
I'm working off.
All right, this is happening.

501
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:40,452
Oh, oh, oh, well, you know
what else is happening?

502
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,021
This thing over here!
Yeah, look at this!

503
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,289
Here we go!

504
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,691
- Take this off!
- Come on, go, go, go!

505
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,560
Guys, guys, guys!

506
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,462
You both know what you're
doing, so stop pretending!

507
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:53,265
Glenn, you obviously
don't want to use Sandra.

508
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,234
Of course I don't want to use Sandra.

509
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,017
Who would want to use Sandra?

510
00:18:57,018 --> 00:18:58,625
You think I want to
have sex with Marcus?

511
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:00,272
He starts every time by saying,

512
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,772
"I'm not really sure what
I'm doing down there."

513
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,520
Oh, sorry for being honest.

514
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:06,398
Well, both of you clearly
want this, so just get over it.

515
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:07,716
Fine with me.

516
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,379
All right.

517
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:16,788
So...

518
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,240
I guess we should go back to work.

519
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:23,495
Are you hitting on me?

520
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,313
I honestly... I can't tell anymore.

521
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,758
Hey.

522
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:29,966
Hey, join us.

523
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,438
So you two are getting along.

524
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,773
Yeah, we worked it all out.

525
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:36,065
Good, good.

526
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:38,471
See? All it needed was a little
bit of communication...

527
00:19:38,472 --> 00:19:42,147
Amy, we're gonna need you
to engage meaningfully

528
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,148
for a minute.

529
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:43,982
I'm sorry, what?

530
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,853
Shh! You're not engaging.

531
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,320
Look, I love you, but sometimes,

532
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,623
you give a little bit too much advice.

533
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,292
Like, telling me how to spend my money,

534
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,160
or that my yearbook quote shouldn't be,

535
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,955
"Catch me outside, how 'bout that?"

536
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:59,331
Yeah, I was just saying that
yearbooks are permanent.

537
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,033
You're pushy, you're manipulative,

538
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,768
and you were super mean about Bo.

539
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:06,005
Ooh, are you burning Amy?
I got a good one.

540
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,155
Your hair. Boom.

541
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:10,637
That was harsh.

542
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:13,370
I don't know, man,
I mean, today it's angels,

543
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:15,781
tomorrow it's, let's go ghost hunting.

544
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,950
Look, man, Kelly is cool, she's fun,

545
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:19,115
you guys should go away together.

546
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:22,210
Yeah, well, maybe we will.
Just not this weekend.

547
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:23,892
No.

548
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,396
You have something special,

549
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:27,566
and you're gonna throw it all away

550
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:29,561
'cause she sees an angel or two?

551
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:30,693
Are you just saying this because

552
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:32,414
you don't want to miss out on
your epic gaming weekend

553
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:34,055
- with Randy?
- Screw the weekend!

554
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:36,702
This is about you and an amazing woman

555
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,024
that I don't want to see slip away.

556
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:40,539
Okay, you can drop
the cheesy Rom-Com routine.

557
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,166
Jonah, the world is a lonely place.

558
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,798
Now, when two people find love,
they need to celebrate...

559
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,313
Ironically, the content of everything

560
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,399
you're saying is true,

561
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,183
but you don't need to...
to dress it up in some...

562
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,851
You have a real shot at happiness,

563
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,353
you dumb son of a bitch.

564
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:57,189
If you don't take it,
I'll never forgive you.

565
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,549
But more importantly,

566
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,909
you'll never forgive you.

567
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,518
Okay, I'll go talk to Kelly.

568
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,031
You take that shot, man.

569
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:08,200
You go to her, and you never look back!

570
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:12,037
I'm going to, but not because
of this thing, okay?

571
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:13,285
You get her back.

572
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:19,545
Sorry about that, dawg.
Yes, we are back on.

1
00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:09,319
- This never gets old.
- Why are you doing this?

2
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:11,329
Because this job is
incredibly boring.

3
00:00:11,398 --> 00:00:13,994
So, Kelly, do you,
like, hate Amy now?

4
00:00:14,063 --> 00:00:15,095
What? No.

5
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:17,573
This was before I even
started working here...

6
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,377
- Yes.
- And... and it was just a kiss.

7
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:21,643
Yes, exactly.
Thank you, Kelly.

8
00:00:21,712 --> 00:00:22,746
Uh-oh...

9
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:25,236
Looks like we got ourselves
a catfight.

10
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:26,699
Amy frenched her man,

11
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:28,573
and now they're gonna
throw down.

12
00:00:28,642 --> 00:00:30,394
How did you get there from...

13
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:42,119
<font color=#FF00FF>*SUPERSTORE*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 03    Episode 15
</font> Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Amnesty"</font>

14
00:00:44,374 --> 00:00:46,473
So, then I go,
"I'm undocumented,"

15
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:48,377
and then Jeff goes,
"that's why you dumped me?"

16
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:51,137
And I go, "yeah,"
and he goes, "whoa,"

17
00:00:51,206 --> 00:00:52,542
And I go, "mm-hmm."

18
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:55,456
- And what'd he go?
- He was... Weird.

19
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:57,994
He said he didn't know
what to do and he just left.

20
00:00:58,063 --> 00:00:59,190
I mean, what if he hates me?

21
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,243
- He doesn't hate you.
- He might.

22
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:04,090
For all I know,
he's reported me by now.

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,097
I'm sure he didn't.
If he did, then,

24
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:07,606
You know,
a bunch of guys in uniform

25
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:09,431
would've busted in here by now
all like,

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,892
"everyone, down on the ground!

27
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:12,931
Black-bag that guy
and throw him in the van."

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,798
Soldiers would pop
out of the ceiling,

29
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,378
and just start
pounding on you,

30
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:18,088
like, knee to the face,
knee to the head,

31
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:19,696
Crotch-punch, crotch-punch!

32
00:01:19,765 --> 00:01:22,118
And then, you'd probably
get sent to guantanamo.

33
00:01:22,187 --> 00:01:23,220
Uh-huh.

34
00:01:25,095 --> 00:01:26,251
Probably.

35
00:01:26,723 --> 00:01:28,485
Man, how weird are sponges?

36
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:33,142
You guys looking for condoms?

37
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:36,563
- They're right here.
- Shut up, Corey.

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,790
You know I have the power
to fire you.

39
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:41,360
- Do you?
- I don't know.

40
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:42,751
I'm just so annoyed
with everybody

41
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,368
and this stupid video.

42
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,556
It'll pass.

43
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,602
You remember Robin
with that whole sexting thing?

44
00:01:48,748 --> 00:01:50,415
Nobody even mentions it
anymore.

45
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:52,321
Robin killed himself.

46
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,509
Oh...

47
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:56,478
- Still, though.
- Uh-oh.

48
00:01:56,547 --> 00:01:58,649
Back to the scene of the crime,
you guys.

49
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:03,276
That's... ♪ Pom, pom..♪ porn music,
it's not "seinfeld."

50
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:05,181
We get it. Point taken.

51
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,735
- Yeah, you really zinged us.
- You really zinged each other.

52
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,798
You should write
for Craig Ferguson.

53
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,732
- Just ignore it.
- That's what I'm doing.

54
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:13,571
You guys looking
for the condoms?

55
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,001
Corey already said that.

56
00:02:15,316 --> 00:02:18,032
Hey, corey,
you stole my condom joke.

57
00:02:20,194 --> 00:02:21,483
I just keep thinking about

58
00:02:21,552 --> 00:02:23,460
Jonah and Amy
kissing each other.

59
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:24,975
Okay...
are you imagining

60
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,375
that you're the Jonah
or you're the Amy?

61
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:28,850
What? No.
I mean, Amy was married.

62
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,387
I thought they were
both good people,

63
00:02:30,456 --> 00:02:32,127
and then... and then they...
they still wound up

64
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:33,262
committing adultery.

65
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:34,691
I don't know
why you're so shocked.

66
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,550
People are basically
just monsters hiding behind

67
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:38,019
the thin veneer
of social convention.

68
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:40,413
Oh, come on.
I mean, uh, yeah, sure,

69
00:02:40,482 --> 00:02:42,264
there's a few naughty nathans
out there,

70
00:02:42,302 --> 00:02:44,502
But most people
are basically good.

71
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:45,760
I watch security footage

72
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,535
of people who don't know
they're on camera.

73
00:02:47,604 --> 00:02:49,260
Do you have any idea
how many customers

74
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,010
have taken poops
on the floor of the store.

75
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,331
- Because they think they're alone?
- I don't wanna know!

76
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:56,104
- Is it zero?
- 17.

77
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:58,127
Well, that's on me
for asking.

78
00:02:58,196 --> 00:02:59,565
People are monsters.

79
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,996
Take away the threat
of punishment,

80
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:03,534
and you'd be horrified by
what people admitted to doing.

81
00:03:04,565 --> 00:03:07,559
One of you has committed
a serious malfeasance,

82
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:09,558
and I'm not talking
about Amy's adultery.

83
00:03:09,627 --> 00:03:12,030
All right,
"adultery" is a strong word.

84
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,129
Heck yeah it is.

85
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:15,207
What I'm talking about
is something else.

86
00:03:15,276 --> 00:03:17,276
This is a fireable offense.

87
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:20,112
However, we're giving
that person one chance.

88
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:22,449
You come forward today,
admit what you did,

89
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:23,737
and we will forget everything.

90
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:26,237
Okay, but how do we know
if the thing that we did

91
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,230
Is the thing
you're talking about?

92
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:30,431
That's why anyone
who comes to us today

93
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:32,174
and admits to doing
something wrong

94
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:34,391
will be granted full amnesty.

95
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:35,667
How do we know
if we tell you something,

96
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:38,112
you're not gonna,
you know, call corporate

97
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:40,955
- Or the government or something?
- Yeah, sounds like a trap.

98
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:43,641
No, I promise,
you will not be punished,

99
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:46,806
I swear on the...
On the grave of my father.

100
00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:49,805
I swear on my birds.

101
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:51,268
- Okay.
- Oh, wow.

102
00:03:51,337 --> 00:03:54,106
- She does love birds.
- Yeah.

103
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:05,318
What do you think
someone did?

104
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:07,712
- I don't know.
- Who do you think did it?

105
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,227
Still don't know.

106
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:11,116
- When do you think it even...
- I don't have

107
00:04:11,227 --> 00:04:13,516
any more information than
you do.

108
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:16,080
Man, I just wish I had known
that they were

109
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,375
giving out amnesty.
I would've broken a rule.

110
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:19,640
Hold on a second...

111
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:21,992
We have till the end of the day
to confess, right?

112
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,110
Yeah.

113
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,625
I think we may have stumbled
onto a "purge" type situation.

114
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:28,399
We can break one rule today
with no consequences.

115
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,750
Oh... Like,
we could wear hats.

116
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:32,047
That's against dress code.

117
00:04:32,116 --> 00:04:33,742
Okay, so you could do
anything you want,

118
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:35,274
and you wanna waste it
on a hat?

119
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:38,511
Okay, um...
How 'bout we steal a boat?

120
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,922
Well, we don't sell boats,

121
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:41,375
But I like that
you're thinking bigger.

122
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:43,170
Right.
Also, I just remembered,

123
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:44,481
I get kinda seasick,

124
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,427
So the boat thing is
definitely a no-go.

125
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:48,671
Okay, well, we were never
gonna do the boat thing,

126
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,287
- But cool.
- Okay.

127
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,443
Hey, Jeff, um, third call.

128
00:04:52,512 --> 00:04:54,592
Just still really wanting
to see how you were feeling

129
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,944
about the whole
undocumented thing,

130
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:58,810
or if you're mad at me or not,

131
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,568
of if you told anyone
or didn't,

132
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:01,841
or would or wouldn't.

133
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,138
I...

134
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,326
Sorry, this weird lady's
looking at me.

135
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,732
Well, it's been over an hour

136
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:10,502
and not one employee
has confessed,

137
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:12,509
and I found a dollar
on the floor,

138
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,193
- So eat peas.
- Ooh, an American dollar?

139
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:16,983
It's all cryptocurrency now,
ya dino.

140
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:18,662
Can someone please
open a register?

141
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:20,186
I have kind of
a shrimp emergency.

142
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,593
All the registers
should be open.

143
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:23,115
Well, I'm not being dramatic.

144
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,943
My wife is gonna murder me.

145
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:27,076
Where is everyone?

146
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:30,404
All right,
let's all take a number.

147
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:32,193
We're gonna get to everyone.

148
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,986
There's just so many of you.

149
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:40,386
So, I um... I might have done
something wrong.

150
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:41,534
But, um, I'm not sure

151
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:43,292
If it's the same thing
you guys are talking about.

152
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,334
Well, why don't you just
tell us what it is?

153
00:05:45,403 --> 00:05:46,652
Then we'll tell you
if your thing

154
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,945
is the same thing
we're talking about.

155
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:50,628
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, or, uh...

156
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:52,472
why don't you tell me
your thing first,

157
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,601
Then I'll say if it's
the same thing as... My thing?

158
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,772
I mean, that sounds
better to me.

159
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,905
How 'bout this, you tell us
the first letter of your thing,

160
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:00,894
and then we'll know
if we're on the same page.

161
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:02,513
Okay, fine.

162
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:06,579
- Um, the letter "U"?
- Yes, "U."

163
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:08,896
The thing we know about
also starts with "U."

164
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:10,179
Okay, now give me
the second letter,

165
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:11,200
and then we can just
go back and forth.

166
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:13,303
- Just tell us what you know!
- You tell me what you know!

167
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:14,405
Utah!

168
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:17,997
Hey. What are you doing?

169
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:19,474
Eating my lunch.

170
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,630
Trying to stay away
from all the looks

171
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:23,178
- and the comments and...
- Yeah.

172
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:26,044
kinda tired of telling people
to mind their own business.

173
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:28,188
So, I know this may
come as a surprise,

174
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,866
but I actually got teased a lot
in middle school.

175
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:31,945
No.

176
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:34,022
Yeah, I don't know
if it was the rattail

177
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:35,451
or the eighth grade
talent show

178
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,087
where I did
a bossa nova rendition

179
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:39,159
of "material girl"
on Alto Sax...

180
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:40,683
That. It was that.

181
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:43,066
But... the moment
I stopped fighting it

182
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:45,831
and... and actually just
laughed along with them,

183
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,753
- It wasn't fun for them anymore.
- Mm.

184
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:49,620
They started teasing
this fat kid instead,

185
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,636
which, long story short,
he's a male model now.

186
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,898
Wow. You're really
the hero of that story.

187
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,431
- I guess so.
- Uh-oh,

188
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,657
hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

189
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,024
What is that?

190
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:04,798
Sex.

191
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:07,032
No, it's not.

192
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:09,399
I think you mean this.

193
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:13,634
Oh, like this?
Yeah, there you go.

194
00:07:13,703 --> 00:07:14,884
Oh...

195
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:17,204
This is nice.

196

Okay, so, I'm the one

197

Who's been stealing
the shopping carts,

198
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:21,424
uh, but they're not for me.

199
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:22,720
I give 'em to the homeless.

200
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:25,532
- Tha... that's not too bad!
- I just give 'em the carts.

201
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:27,797
They do the battling
on their own.

202
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:29,679
What? Battling?

203
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:31,383
I've been smoking weed
in the stock room

204
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,868
- on wednesdays and fridays.
- Right under our noses. - What?

205
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:35,110
- How awful.
- And on Mondays

206
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:36,868
and Thursdays,
I just drink.

207
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:38,079
And on Saturdays,

208
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:40,280
I go to the cinnabon
and go nuts.

209
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:42,857
- It's so good.
- I stole a pack

210
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:44,856
of sour cherry bubblicious.

211
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:47,435
- Well, that's not too bad.
- I liked the sour cherry,

212
00:07:47,504 --> 00:07:51,895
because it reminded me of
a jollytime zabra-dabra.

213
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:55,866
My uncle Frank worked
for the jollytime factory.

So, you know how me
and Carol hate each other...

217
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:05,700
Well, I hate her.
Actually, she looks up to me.

218
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,540
Anyway, I paid four different
guys to come into the store

219
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:11,215
And ask her out
and then never show up.

220
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:12,497
Nice.

No, no, look, we were just
pretending we wanted to kiss,

314
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:41,305
Okay, so that people would stop
saying we wanted to kiss.

315
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,415
That sounds stupid.

316
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:47,381
♪♪

317
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:51,943
I mean... Seriously?

318
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,294
This is all Sandra.

319
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:55,732
I'm taking
a learning annex course.

320
00:11:58,238 --> 00:11:59,701
It's impressive.

321
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:07,419
Thank you all for coming
on such short notice.

322
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:09,280
Uh, glenn,
before we get started,

323
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:11,178
I just wanted to say
that I'm wearing a hat,

324
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:12,437
Which I know is
against the rules.

325
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:15,521
- And boom! Amnesty.
- Ok... okay.

326
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:17,858
Uh, as you all know,
from time to time,

327
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:19,076
We have a guest speaker...

328
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:21,124
We've literally
never done that.

329
00:12:21,193 --> 00:12:24,797
So... I would like to
introduce you to Pastor Craig.

330
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:26,577
You know the rules
about religion at work.

331
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:27,904
And I get amnesty today,

332
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:29,552
So why don't you go
kiss a table?

333
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:32,070
There is something wrong
with the souls

334
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:34,107
- of the people who work here...
- Amen.

335
00:12:34,177 --> 00:12:36,341
And I am not just
gonna stand back

336
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,579
and let this place become
Times Square, New York City!

337
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:41,038
- Hallelujah.
- Yeah.

338
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:42,357
- Pastor craig?
- Mm.

339
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:43,835
They're all yours.
All right.

340
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,419
Hmm...

341
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:52,732
All right, man, what is this?
What are you doing to us?

342
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:57,435
Stop it!
What's your name, Miss?

343
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,646
Justine.

344
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:00,966
Well, justine...

345
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:02,747
I love you.

346
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:06,013
- I love you too.
- I love all of you, all right?

347
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:08,716
And I don't care
what you've done.

348
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,966
God hates the sin,

349
00:13:12,378 --> 00:13:14,333
but he loves the sinner.

350
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,747
Example, Sandra...

351
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,888
Who is Sandra? Where is, uh...

352
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,286
All right.

353
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:23,122
Now, Sandra, it... it says here

354
00:13:23,247 --> 00:13:26,271
That you wanna kill
a coworker named Carol.

355
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:29,513
Yeah.

356
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:32,132
Oh. Oh, Sandra, I understand.

357
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:35,872
When I'm frustrated,
I wanna wring someone's neck.

358
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:38,155
Exactly. Wring it hard.

359
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:39,435
So, what do you do?

360
00:13:39,504 --> 00:13:42,607
What do you do when that
feeling comes over you?

361
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:47,469
Well, I... put on a hoodie
that covers my face.

362
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,678
Then I take the 47 bus line

363
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:52,005
to a library
in a far-away town.

364
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:55,661
Then I open a private browser
on one of their computers,

365
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,382
and google how I'm thinking
of killing her

366
00:13:57,451 --> 00:13:59,872
to see what mistakes
people usually make.

367
00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:04,023
Jesus.

368
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,888
♪♪

369
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:13,389
All right,
everybody blow it out.

370
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,655
Come on, blow it out.

371
00:14:14,724 --> 00:14:17,888
Blow out the sin!

00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:21,372
Blow it on out.
Blow it on out.

373
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:24,286
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
You feel that?

374
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,607
I think it just got
a little lighter in here.

375
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:28,582
I felt it, big time.

376
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:29,840
Hallelujah.

377
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:32,955
So, keep breathing,
blow out those sins,

378
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,715
and forgive yourself.

379
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:37,076
All right, amen.

380
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:38,437
All right, so,
I think, we're good here.

381
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:40,834
Uh, do you guys sell those
tire air-pressure tester...

382
00:14:40,903 --> 00:14:41,969
- What do you call those things,
- No, no,

383
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:43,733
- the small...
- that's it?   - Tire gauge.

384
00:14:43,802 --> 00:14:45,911
Yes, thank you.
I need a tire gauge.

385
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,257
I told ya,
you take away the punishment,

386
00:14:48,326 --> 00:14:49,725
You find out
what people really are.

387
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:51,358
Wait, what?
What are you talking about?

388
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:53,529
There was no
fireable offense.

389
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:55,811
Dina said that
people were monsters,

390
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,686
and as a christian, I wanted
to prove that they weren't.

391
00:14:58,754 --> 00:14:59,975
Actually,
we christians believe

392
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:00,975
that all people are sinners.

393
00:15:01,044 --> 00:15:02,217
It's, uh... it's kind of
our whole thing.

394
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:04,193
So, wait,
Jeff didn't say anything?

395
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:05,880
Why? What would
Jeff have said?

396
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:08,208
I don't know, he's a liar.

397
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:09,999
I mean, he's always
lying about stuff, so...

398
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:11,747
But dina was right.

399
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:13,880
We are all monsters,

400
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:15,857
Who love to watch bum fights

401
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:18,272
or put gross stuff
in each other's lunches.

402
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:20,857
Oh, I know that Carol
messes with my lunch.

403
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:23,122
That's why I always
make a decoy lunch.

404
00:15:23,286 --> 00:15:25,294
You don't think I know
about the decoy lunch?

405
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:28,372
And even Amy and Jonah...
You had an affair.

406
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:31,936
Glenn, it wasn't an affair,
it was one kiss,

407
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:34,333
and it happened because
we thought we were about to die.

408
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:36,505
We all thought
we were gonna die.

409
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:40,380
You didn't see me smooching the
first lady person I could find.

410
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:42,576
Weren't you praying to allah
the whole time?

411
00:15:42,645 --> 00:15:43,652
- Yes.
- Oh.

412
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:45,169
What... no, I didn't...
Glenn...

413
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:47,708
I am not
the one on trial here.

414
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:49,234
You know what,
nobody's on trial, okay?

415
00:15:49,302 --> 00:15:50,608
Nobody.
We all make mistakes.

416
00:15:50,677 --> 00:15:52,068
We all have lust in our hearts.

417
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:53,592
- That wasn't lust.
- I wouldn't say lust.

418
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,346
Well, I'm sorry, I don't know
you guys that well.

419
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:57,102
Maybe
you're in love then.

420
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:58,711
- No. We're not in love.
- No, definitely not love.

421
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,345
So you say,
but lord,

422
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:03,159
I'm sensing something
going on right here.

423
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,228
- Y'all feel that?
- Ooh!

424
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:05,388
Right up there.
Y'all feel that?

425
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:08,004
- Something good...
- Great, this again.

426
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:09,308
- Woo-hoo.
- No, uh, actually,

427
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:11,332
we're... we're dating, so...

428
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:13,333
Oh, uh, tire gauge girl.

429
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:14,668
Okay.

430
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:18,246
So, what is it, guys?
Is it love or lust?

431
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:20,107
All right, guys,
enough is enough.

432
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:22,605
It doesn't matter.
Even if they were soul mates,

433
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:24,738
it doesn't make it okay.

434
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:28,269
Look, Amy is not
my soul mate, okay?

435
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:29,926
Yes, fine, uh,

436
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:33,191
When I first started
working here years ago,

437
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,364
I... I had a little crush on Amy.

438
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,894
There, I said it.
Okay? Are you happy?

439
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,815
Exactly. And at one point,

440
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:42,152
I had a crush on Jonah,
and that's all in the past.

441
00:16:42,221 --> 00:16:43,269
Exactly.

442
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:45,652
Wait, what did... you...
When did you...

443
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:47,582
Did... what... you... yeah... no.

444
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:49,294
Never mind. Doesn't matter,
doesn't matter,

445
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:50,746
because if... even if we...

446
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:53,067
because it... with the timing
and everything, it's...

447
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:54,560
Yeah, so, you get it.

448
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:57,777
So... Stop.

449
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:03,660
- He didn't know.
- Do you still love each other?

450
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:05,785
- Wh... what?
- No! We never...

451
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:08,269
we've moved on.

452
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:10,988
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

453
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:12,582
And, you know...
And...

454
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:15,105
Anyway, it... it...
It doesn't matter, bec...

455
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:16,902
We've... we've all, you know...

456
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:19,117
And... and... and besides,
you know, I've...

457
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:21,637
I'm with... I've got...
I'm with, um...

458
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:23,043
- Kelly.
- I'm with Kelly.

459
00:17:23,112 --> 00:17:24,851
Yeah, no, I... I...
I know your name, obviously.

460
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,999
- Guys, this is amazing.
- Yeah.

461
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:28,436
Yeah, I'm generally a cynic.

462
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,859
But this? Wow.

463
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:33,757
She didn't know
that he didn't know,

464
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,070
And now he knows
that she knows ****

465
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,678
We get it, Sandra.

466
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:43,373
So the guys, I think
it should be with Kelly or Amy

467
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,334
- I'm kind of team Amy now.
- Yeah.

468
00:17:45,403 --> 00:17:47,148
I'm with you.
I'm fully shipping them.

469
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:48,553
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:50,326
Oh, hey, Ame.

471
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:51,475
'sup?

472
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:54,905
Oh, hey, guys. What's up?

473
00:17:56,187 --> 00:17:58,909
We're... we're just having
normal workplace conversations.

474
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,017
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

475
00:18:00,086 --> 00:18:00,919
- Mm-hmm.
- Sure.

476
00:18:00,987 --> 00:18:03,733
Yep. How are you doing
with everything?

477
00:18:03,802 --> 00:18:06,117
There it is. You know me.

478
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,116
Struggling to keep it
in my pants.

479
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:10,257
With Jonah roaming
around here somewhere,

480
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:12,842
I'm just like,
"give it to me, Jonah."

481
00:18:12,911 --> 00:18:13,928
- that's a good one.
- Yep.

482
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:15,452
- Mm-hmm.
- Yep,

483
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:16,889
gonna go find him now

484
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,530
And just, like, do him,
you know?

485
00:18:19,662 --> 00:18:22,725
Soft lines? More like
hard lines.

486
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:24,866
Get it?

487
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:31,162
Watching your
world view get shattered

488
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:32,992
has been the highlight
of my year.

489
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:34,756
And that includes meeting
that balki guy.

490
00:18:34,825 --> 00:18:36,898
- Bronson Pinchot.
- What does that mean?

491
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:38,342
Hey, guys, I'm taking off.

492
00:18:38,411 --> 00:18:41,679
Garrett...
Let's get this over with.

493
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:44,054
- Get what over with?
- What did you do?

494
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,037
Did you make two nuns
fight a prostitute?

495
00:18:46,106 --> 00:18:49,100
- Broil a child?
- Nah, I didn't do anything.

496
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:50,735
I'm very, very sorry to say,

497
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:52,507
but, uh, I haven't
broken any rules.

498
00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:55,608
Really? So, you've never
gotten stoned at work

499
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,944
Or... or hit golf balls
off the checkout?

500
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,530
You've never taken
a video game home,

501
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,341
Played it, repackaged it,
and put it back on the shelf?

502
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,428
No.

503
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:06,750
I mean, those are all things
I probably could've done,

504
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,670
But... did not.

505
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:13,334
Garrett...
You little rule follower.

506
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:17,336
I found a good one!

507
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:21,534
His ability to delude himself

508
00:19:21,602 --> 00:19:23,215
is the only impressive thing
about him.

509
00:19:23,284 --> 00:19:25,230
I think I was just
disoriented in the moment,

510
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,870
but I am not cool
with him kissing my head.

511
00:19:28,528 --> 00:19:29,589
Hey.

512
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:34,018
- Kelly.
- Uh... yes, I know your...

513
00:19:34,328 --> 00:19:39,026
Look, uh, I was just flustered,
you know, back there.

514
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,636
Yeah, sure.
Well, it's very flustering

515
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:45,158
When you find out that the girl
you like likes you back.

516
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,830
No, no, I just...

517
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:48,947
Everything just got
blown out of proportion.

518
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:50,229
Let me ask you this,

519
00:19:50,304 --> 00:19:53,033
If... if your crush had timed out
with Amy's crush,

520
00:19:53,102 --> 00:19:55,182
- would we be together right now?
- Yes.

521
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,455
- Really?
- Really.

522
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:59,358
Look, I don't want this whole
Amy thing to set us back.

523
00:19:59,427 --> 00:20:00,450
I wanna...

524
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:03,565
I wanna move forward with you.

525
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:05,423
Like move in together?

526
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:08,638
Yeah.
Why not?

527
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:10,514
I mean, if... if you want to.

528
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,099
Do... do you want to?

529
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:15,661
Do... well, sure, yeah.

530
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,757
I mean, I would... yeah.

531
00:20:17,826 --> 00:20:18,826
Yeah, great, okay.

532
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:20,983
Cool, then we're doing it.
We're... we're living together.

533
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:22,051
Oh. Uh...
All right.

534
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:30,300
Chad, it's Mateo.

535
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:33,684
Do... I know I've said
some horrible things about you

536
00:20:33,753 --> 00:20:34,755
in the comments
of your instagram,

537
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:36,667
but, you know,
I can't find Jeff,

538
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:38,270
And I've been calling
the office...

539
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:39,620
I quit my job.

540
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,393
Uh, chad,
I'm gonna call you back.

541
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:46,089
Uh, probably not, actually.

542
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:49,346
Jeff...
You wanna get a drink?

543
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:52,589
Sure.

544
00:20:54,229 --> 00:20:56,143
- Nice shirt.
- You think?

545
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,572
It's the one matt damon wore

546
00:20:57,641 --> 00:20:59,238
at the end of
"the bourne identity."

547
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:01,380
that's so cool.

548
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:02,696
Right on.

549
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:05,731
I can't do it...

1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:01,806
I'm pregnant.

2
00:00:03,289 --> 00:00:05,811
You're... pregnant?

3
00:00:06,426 --> 00:00:08,776
With... a baby?

4
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:11,329
Sorry, obviously that's... um.

5
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:13,464
Uh, who...

6
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:14,982
Uh, it's Adam.

7
00:00:14,983 --> 00:00:16,388
Oh, yeah, Adam. Adam.

8
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:18,077
It was just a...
it was a one-time thing.

9
00:00:18,078 --> 00:00:19,542
How's... how's Adam doing?

10
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:21,642
He's... he's good.

11
00:00:21,643 --> 00:00:24,077
Great, great.
That's... tell him I said hi.

12
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:26,647
Um.

13
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:34,711
I don't know what I'm
supposed to do with that.

14
00:00:35,922 --> 00:00:36,904
I don't know.

15
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:38,439
Why did you kiss me?

16
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:40,753
I just... I wanted to.

17
00:00:42,273 --> 00:00:43,911
Before everything changed.

18
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:45,383
I can't even...

19
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:54,603
You know what?

20
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:58,659
No. Forget it.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,433
Nope.

22
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:09,904
Uh-uh.

23
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:14,293
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

24
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:19,880
Just a reminder that it's
still Haitian Heritage Month.

25
00:01:19,882 --> 00:01:21,182
So if you have a customer

26
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:22,683
and you think they might be Haitian,

27
00:01:22,685 --> 00:01:25,152
feel free to offer them a sticker.

28
00:01:25,154 --> 00:01:28,589
Also, it is Mother's Day this weekend,

29
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:31,144
and corporate says mothers
are in this year.

30
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:33,226
So we're gonna be hitting that hard.

31
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,830
Well, that's it for the
prepared announcements.

32
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:37,765
Now I'll open it up to the room,

33
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:40,684
in case anyone has something
they'd like to say.

34
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:44,605
Maybe about Mother's Day?

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,509
Well, my mom broke parole,
so I think that this

36
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:49,630
- is gonna be the last...
- No, Cheyenne.

37
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:50,921
Amy has the floor.

38
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:52,421
Oh.

39
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:54,709
Okay, I see.

40
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:56,618
Hey guys, I'm pregnant.

41
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:58,786
- Oh, my God.
- What?

42
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:00,221
- Wow.
- What?

43
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:01,922
Oh, my God, out of nowhere.

44
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:04,391
I know what you're thinking,
but I only told, like,

45
00:02:04,393 --> 00:02:06,407
three people, so this is not on me.

46
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:07,495
It's fine. Everybody would have

47
00:02:07,497 --> 00:02:09,196
been able to tell soon anyway.

48
00:02:09,198 --> 00:02:12,032
I guessed last week when you plowed
through that pile of taquitos.

49
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:13,767
It wasn't a pile of taquitos.

50
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:16,170
It was a couple taquitos.

51
00:02:16,172 --> 00:02:17,855
Don't worry. I couldn't tell.

52
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:19,707
- Did you know?
- No.

53
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:22,600
Mm-mm. No, I didn't know until just now.

54
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,880
That is wild, and wacky stuff.

55
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:27,848
I did not know that.

56
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,389
Well, I could tell already.
I compared the pictures.

57
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,852
- What pictures...
- What pictures?

58
00:02:31,854 --> 00:02:34,288
Oh! That explains why
you didn't wanna come

59
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,323
on my "Gossip Girl" bar crawl.

60
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:37,825
Uh-huh. That was why.

61
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:39,560
We have a lot of work
to do, so let's just

62
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:41,228
burn through all of this.
Amy is pregnant.

63
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,264
The baby is Adam's.
I was the first to know

64
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,466
because I am her best friend,
and, Justine, no one went

65
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:48,269
to your bar crawl because you
are unpleasant to be around.

66
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:49,737
Unpleasant in bed.

67
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:52,339
- Lame.
- I'm gonna give it to her.

68
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:53,774
- Nice one.
- Thank you.

Attention Cloud 9 shoppers.
This weekend is Mother's Day.

72
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,497
I don't know your mother,
but given what women

73
00:03:06,498 --> 00:03:07,855
have gone through this past year I think

74
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:10,891
it's pretty safe to say, she needs this.

75
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:14,042
- Hey.
- Hey.

76
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:18,132
So, um, we should probably talk.

77
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:19,533
Honestly, it's fine.

78
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:21,468
I'm all good, really.
Nothing to talk about.

79
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:23,320
Okay.

80
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:26,941
Um, but, you know,
if we were gonna talk,

81
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:28,642
I might say something like,

82
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:32,379
"Ah, I was in a weird
place emotionally and..."

83
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:34,014
But we're not gonna talk, right?

84
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,398
So no need to do this.

85
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:39,353
There, that looks right.

86
00:03:39,355 --> 00:03:41,388
I'm gonna go help Kelly.

87
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,212
Hey, you.

88
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:51,031
And something else
you might want to know is,

89
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:53,767
Amy's pregnant!

90
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:57,944
<i>Um, "quarterly reports" really mainly
just refers to the financials.</i>

91
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:59,553
<i>I don't know who Amy is.</i>

92
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:01,342
- The floor manager.
- I'm her best friend.

93
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:02,710
- So.
<i>- Okay.</i>

94
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:04,211
<i>Uh, few things on our end:</i>

95
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:05,916
<i>we're figuring out which store will host</i>

96
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:07,713
<i>the next CEO Town Hall meeting,</i>

97
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,900
<i>and with your story of
rebuilding after the tornado,</i>

98
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:11,584
<i>you guys are on the short list.</i>

99
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:16,055
Oh. So, the CEO may come to this store

100
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:18,375
that we're in right now?

101
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:20,361
That's... interesting.

102
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,020
If he needs a place to stay,
he can have my master bedroom.

103
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:25,963
Jerusha and I could share
Timur's trundle bed.

104
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:26,875
My place is quieter.

105
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:28,067
Do you know what kind
of shampoo he uses?

106
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,003
- I usually make my own.
<i>- My guess is</i>

107
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:32,406
<i>that he would stay at
a hotel, but for now,</i>

108
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:34,102
<i>if you could send us a
photo of your team,</i>

109
00:04:34,103 --> 00:04:35,602
<i>that would help with
promotional materials.</i>

110
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:37,304
We'll get you 100 photos.

111
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:38,308
1,000!

112
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:40,218
<i>One's good.</i>

113
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,660
Attention Cloud 9 shoppers,
we have a bit of an emergency...

114
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:43,994
Garrett! Garrett! We need
to make an announcement.

115
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:45,529
I'm in the middle of
something right now.

116
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:46,964
This is urgent! Attention, employees.

117
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:48,093
We need you to assemble
in the front of the store

118
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:49,756
for a group photo in ten minutes.

119
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:50,349
Give me that.

120
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,813
And look sharp!

121
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:54,622
We... no! We have a chance to have CEO,

122
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:56,789
Neil Penderson, in our store!

123
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,516
This is not a prank.

124
00:04:58,517 --> 00:05:00,276
Neil! Penderson!

125
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:04,332
As I was saying,
there's a missing child.

126
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,721
His name is Caden. He has brown hair,

127
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:08,521
is eight years old,
and is wearing overalls.

128
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:10,868
So, uh, I guess those two things.

129
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:12,409
Group photo. Missing kid.

130
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,379
Hey, yo, Amy!

131
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:16,276
Heard you got a baby
all up in them guts.

132
00:05:16,277 --> 00:05:18,202
- Yeah, congrats.
- Thank you.

133
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:20,121
Mad props on not getting scooped out.

134
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:22,700
Choose life y'all, what's up?

135
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:23,528
Okay.

136
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:24,895
We brought you some of Harmonica's

137
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:27,120
old baby stuff we were
gonna give to Goodwill.

138
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:28,907
Then we were like, why deal
with the middle man

139
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:30,958
when we can just do the
charity right onto you?

140
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,079
Oh, okay. Thank you.

141
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,782
But I'm not a charity case.

142
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:37,214
Oh, there's some good stuff in here.

143
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:38,879
Oh, that baby. That's a good baby.

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,932
Oh, it's clean.

145
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,702
- It's clean.
- Oh!

146
00:05:41,704 --> 00:05:43,638
- Look, so cute.
- Aw, that's sweet.

147
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,408
Little bitch. Oh.

148
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,241
But what if it's a boy then?

149
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:48,923
It's like a pretty funny slam on him.

150
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:50,727
Little bitch.

151
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:52,596
- All right.
- Yeah.

- Hm?

158
00:06:06,376 --> 00:06:07,473
Could I be in the picture?

159
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:09,329
Oh, I wish that you could, Sandra,

160
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,448

Okay, it's just that I was the
one who took it last year

00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:15,884
and the year before that.

164
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:18,614
- Did you change for this?
- I want to shine.

165
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,318
Is it a crime to shine?

166
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:22,678
I like it. You look like
a car freshener.

167
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:24,328
- Thank you.
- Okay, Heather.

168
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,078
Sweetie, get some self-esteem.

169
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,236
Come up to the front. Amanda, way back.

170
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:29,797
Like you're going for a fly ball.

171
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:32,281
Jonah, you're gonna show off
your tight little bod right here.

172
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,309
This is more uncomfortable
than flattering.

173
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,546
Half-pint, right there.

174
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:37,802
Oh, how big of a smile do you want?

175
00:06:38,076 --> 00:06:40,605
It hurts a little, but I can
show all of my teeth.

176
00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:41,773
Let's go with all the teeth.

177
00:06:41,774 --> 00:06:44,384
Single mother, Rodriguez. Here we go.

178
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:46,430
They can't tell I'm
single in a photo, Dina.

179
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:47,000
Sure.

180
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:50,688
Okay, now let's look like a family.

181
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:53,023
Okay, everyone put your
arms around each other.

182
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:54,525
- Okay.
- Yeah.

183
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:57,432
Jonah, both arms.
Pregnancy's not contagious.

184
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:59,112
Have you two never taken a picture?

185
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:00,161
Some of us have to pee.

186
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:01,905
Okay, we're ready! Let's do this!

187
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,273
That's the spirit.

188
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,202
Okay, everyone. Big smiles.

189
00:07:05,204 --> 00:07:06,998
There's a spot open in the middle.

190
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:08,486
I could set a timer

191
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:10,841
- and run in and...
- Nope! I got it!

192
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,514
Oh, okay.

193
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,552
I guess that works too.

194
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:17,058
Okay, here we go.

195
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:22,598
That is a group photo. Of our group.

196
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,402
Yeah, doesn't exactly scream "CEO."

197
00:07:26,957 --> 00:07:28,790
- It seems fine to me.
- Exactly.

198
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:31,459
It's just fine. That's a
good way of putting it.

199
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:33,294
- That's not what I meant.
- You know what?

200
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:35,013
I just don't feel anything
when I look at it.

201
00:07:35,015 --> 00:07:37,465
I want to see tornado survivors.

202
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:40,218
Right! Like on "CNN Heroes,"

203
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,470
you get a sense of the struggle.

204
00:07:42,472 --> 00:07:44,472
This doesn't feel like "CNN Heroes."

205
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:48,059
Well, this is a still image,
and that's a television show.

206
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:49,193
You know, I agree with Garrett.

207
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:50,528
We should be doing a TV show.

208
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,480
- Not what I said.
- Oh, my God.

209
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:55,700
I bet none of the other
stores are doing a TV show.

210
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:58,403
- That seems excessive.
- Excess leads to success.

211
00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:01,039
- Well, that rhymes.
- Well, drop your concerns,

212
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,884
Ken Burns. Let's do this!

213
00:08:03,827 --> 00:08:04,624
Nice.

214
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:09,265
Oh, hey, Amy.

215
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:10,929
Did you drop that $20 bill?

216
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:13,501
- Uh, nope, that's not mine.
- Oh.

217
00:08:13,503 --> 00:08:16,504
Well, I mean, you saw it
first, so finders keepers.

218
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:18,840
No, I didn't. You found it.

219
00:08:18,842 --> 00:08:20,288
Why don't you just keep it.

220
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:24,012
Mateo, thank you.
That's very kind of you.

221
00:08:24,014 --> 00:08:25,513
But I don't really need handouts.

222
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:28,399
Handouts? I don't even know
what you're talking about.

223
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:30,018
Someone dropped that there.
I don't know who.

224
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,519
Oh, damn. Lucky day!

225
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:33,738
- No, that's mine!
- What? No, it's mine now.

226
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,356
- It's mine! It's mine!
- I just found it. It's mine.

227
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:36,858
I put it there for Amy to find, Bo.

228
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,026
Amy doesn't need charity.

229
00:08:39,446 --> 00:08:41,362
- I licked it! It's mine.
- No, I'll lick it.

230
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:50,433
Where did that come from?

231
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,514
I just wanted to kiss you.

232
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:54,937
I might do it again sometime.

233
00:08:55,545 --> 00:08:57,420
I'll considered myself warned.

234
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:58,685
Excuse me.

235
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:00,598
Where can I find the dog food?

236
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,750
- Oh, I'll show you.
- We'll show you together.

237
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:05,329
Hm.

238
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,280
Oh, um, th... we're...

239
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,394
Okay.

240
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:16,314
Cheyenne, tell us what you remember
about the day the tornado hit.

241
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:16,981
Um.

242
00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:20,329
Okay, I remember I had
Chipotle for breakfast.

243
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:22,787
And the guy who made my burrito

244
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:25,623
was like really creepy,
but kind of in a hot way.

245
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,657
He was like,

246
00:09:26,964 --> 00:09:28,667
"What kind of protein do you want?"

247
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,579
And I was like, "Carnitas."

248
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:33,608
No, more... what was it like here?

249
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:35,075
At work. In the store.

250
00:09:35,802 --> 00:09:38,378
Did you think you were going to die?

251
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,507
Yeah, totally.

252
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,257
Could you say that
as a complete sentence?

253
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:44,322
Uh, sure.

254
00:09:44,677 --> 00:09:47,261
I thought I was gonna die.

255
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,013
Cheyenne, we're getting nothing.

256
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:52,850
Okay? If you thought you were
gonna die, maybe act like it.

257
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,270
Oh, okay, yeah,
I can act like that, okay.

258
00:09:57,857 --> 00:10:01,109
I remember coming...

259
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:02,527
Sorry.

260
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:05,663
I remember coming into... to work.

261
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:08,282
Are you okay?

262
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:10,104
Ah. I'm sorry. I just...

263
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:15,123
Oh, my God, it feels like
my throat is closing up.

264
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,458
Oh, God.

265
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,831
I think someone poisoned my drink.

266
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:23,297
Oh, my skin is on fire.

267
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:27,247
I think we got it.

268
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:32,740
It's not like I walked in
planning to kiss you.

269
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:35,143
Can we not do this now? I'm working.

270
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:38,145
- I can take you over here.
- Sorry, ma'am, he's closed.

271
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:41,315
You can't just not talk to me.

272
00:10:41,317 --> 00:10:42,722
I'm not not talking to you.

273
00:10:42,723 --> 00:10:44,652
I just don't want to
talk about yesterday.

274
00:10:44,654 --> 00:10:45,946
We can talk about anything else.

275
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:48,239
You want to talk about SpaceX, I'm in.

276
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,323
Uh, okay.

277
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:50,741
I think it's really gross

278
00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:52,410
that only rich people
get to go to space,

279
00:10:52,412 --> 00:10:54,162
and also it's like,
focus on Earth problems

280
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:56,414
- before we set up shop on Mars.
- Interesting. Counterpoint.

281
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,249
Okay, I don't really
want to talk about this.

282
00:10:58,251 --> 00:10:59,500
I want to talk about yesterday.

283
00:10:59,502 --> 00:11:01,836
Well I don't, okay? Ma'am.

284
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:04,338
- It's fine.
- No, still closed, ma'am.

285
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,674
- Thanks.
- Okay fine.

286
00:11:06,676 --> 00:11:09,177
I got two minutes until my break. Go.

287
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:12,230
Um, uh, okay well

288
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:15,037
um, obviously there are...

289
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:18,519
feelings... I mean, not obviously.

290
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,087
I guess seemingly.

291
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:23,858
I just really didn't think this
would be a one-sided conversation.

292
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,410
- Look, what I want to say...
- Hey Ames.

293
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:28,213
Hi, Adam.

294
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:30,567
- Adam's here.
- I see that.

295
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:33,868
Hey, Adam. Uh, congratulations.

296
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,763
Thanks, man.

297
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:36,667
Congratulations on what?

298
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:37,825
♪

299
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:44,151
Uh. So what are you doing here?

300
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:46,903
You left a message saying
we needed to talk in person.

301
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:48,554
I meant, like, after work.

302
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:51,107
You said it was urgent.
I needed batteries anyways.

303
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:52,725
So I thought since you get a discount.

304
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:55,828
Well, I can't really use
my discount on friends, so...

305
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,969
Bigger fish to fry. Look, Adam.

306
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,119
Can we talk about this later?
It's kind of a long story.

307
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,406
Yo, Amy. I left that baby
stuff by your locker.

308
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:05,125
Now that you're pregnant,
it's no time to be stingy.

309
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:06,456
That guy's got great timing.

310
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:07,562
You're pregnant?!

311
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,153
I'm sor... who is?

312
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,831
- No, not...
- No, no, no, no, no.

313
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,636
- Of course not.
- No, not with Jonah.

314
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:16,541
No, don't worry. It's... it's yours.

315
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:18,958
Okay, good. What?

316
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:21,143
Yep. Surprise.

317
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:22,888
I'm sorry. How did this even...

318
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:25,591
I mean, I know how it... wow.

319
00:12:25,974 --> 00:12:27,676
I know. It's a lot to take in.

320
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:30,858
It just... this is not how I planned
on telling you that I'm pregnant.

321
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:31,980
Who's pregnant?

322
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:32,943
Damn it.

323
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:35,456
I think we should invest in
some dividers or something.

324
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,367
What's going on?

325
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:37,661
- Who is this guy?
- Um.

326
00:12:37,662 --> 00:12:40,167
This is... this is Alex,
our beverage rep.

327
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,830
Or I mean, and other things,

328
00:12:42,832 --> 00:12:44,235
but we just haven't really
discussed labels.

329
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:45,486
Well, I'll let you guys all talk.

330
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:46,828
No, no, no, no.
You're fine where you are.

331
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:48,485
I will move back in
with you if you want.

332
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:49,231
- What?
- Wow.

333
00:12:49,232 --> 00:12:50,343
Hold up. Who is this guy?

334
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:52,356
- Are you dating him too?
- No, no.

335
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:53,558
No, this is my ex-husband.

336
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,110
And we're having a baby together.

337
00:12:55,111 --> 00:12:57,261
- And maybe getting remarried.
- Oh, my God.

338
00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:58,320
Well, you've got your hands full.

339
00:12:58,321 --> 00:12:59,429
So I'm gonna take my break now.

340
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,899
No, I just really want
to finish our talk.

341
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,640
We can talk about SpaceX

342
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:04,672
- another time.
- No, we can't.

343
00:13:04,673 --> 00:13:06,804
Not at the rate that they're
burning through capital.

344
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:09,773
- Um, I can't find my mommy.
- Grownups are talking.

345
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:12,447
Hey, I'll help you find your mommy.

346
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:17,924
- What kind of beverages?
- It runs the gamut.

347
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:19,763
I love beverages.

348
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:23,188
We were all so scared.

349
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:26,154
And I made a promise to myself that day

350
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:29,891
that if I survived, I would let
the people that I love know

351
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,450
how much they mean to me.

352
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:33,446
Every. Day.

353
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:37,390
Okay, Mateo,

354
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:39,868
you seem to be hitting
the drama a little hard.

355
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,147
Oh okay.

356
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,123
You said you wanted emotion.
I gave you emotion.

357
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,954
Well, maybe less emotion.

358
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:48,784
All right, got it. No problem.

359
00:13:50,228 --> 00:13:52,861
It was chaos. People screaming.

360
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:54,984
Debris flying everywhere like locusts.

361
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:56,858
I started my shift a boy.

362
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,204
- But I clocked out a man...
- Okay, that's good.

363
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:01,024
That's good. I think we've seen enough.

364
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:01,811
Moving on.

365
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:04,098
- Gonna move on.
- Wait, I'm sorry.

366
00:14:04,099 --> 00:14:06,444
Okay? I'm trying to do
it normal, but it's...

367
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:10,561
It was crazy when I think
about that tornado.

368
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:12,930
You know, it's...

369
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,967
You think you know what
it's like to be scared.

370
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:19,137
But then when you feel true fear

371
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:23,434
for the first time, it envelopes you

372
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:25,768
and crushes you.

373
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:29,048
But then it sort of comforts you.

374
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:34,158
Like a hug, and I... I don't know,

375
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:36,643
it's hard to explain, but it...

376
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:39,213
Ugh.

377
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:43,367
Sorry.

378
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:45,555
Aw.

379
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,122
Are you kidding me right now?!

380
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:55,326
Hey. What's happening?

381
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,784
Mm, sorry I can't talk right now.

382
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:59,873
- I'm a blanket.
- Oh. Hm, okay.

383
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:03,835
Can you maybe be a blanket that
helps me stock body scrub?

384
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,555
Mm, blankets don't have hands.

385
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:06,910
Stop.

386
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,928
I, uh... I want to meet your parents.

387
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:11,688
Oh. Um...

388
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:15,425
I mean, it feels like
we're getting serious, right?

389
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:18,922
Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah.

390
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,555
Okay, um, how about
a Mother's Day brunch?

391
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:25,099
We doing brunch?
I'm always down for brunch.

392
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:27,394
Oh, uh, it's just us.

393
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:29,805
Oh, okay. Well we should
meet up afterwards.

394
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:31,625
I'm supposed to meet
my mom later that day,

395
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:33,631
but I can blow it off,
so it's totally fine.

396
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,470
Hey, Alex, it's Carol from Cloud 9.

397
00:15:36,472 --> 00:15:38,323
I got your number off
of the vendor list.

398
00:15:38,324 --> 00:15:41,182
I was the one that was vaping
by the Dumpster last Thursday,

399
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:42,936
and you said, "Are you vaping?"

400
00:15:42,937 --> 00:15:44,027
And I said, "Yeah."

401
00:15:44,831 --> 00:15:46,900
Anyway, I heard about the breakup,

402
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:48,531
and I just wanted to say sorry.

403
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:52,436
So let me know if you ever
want to go grab drinks

404
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:55,259
or you can just come by
for a massage or whatever.

405
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,589
So how did Alex take it?

406
00:15:57,948 --> 00:15:59,592
Relatively well, I guess.

407
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:01,551
I mean, I don't know how
you're supposed to take it

408
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:03,078
when you find out the
woman you're dating

409
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:04,636
is pregnant with another man's child.

410
00:16:04,637 --> 00:16:06,250
Oh, you should've asked me.

411
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:08,823
I've had that conversation
multiple times.

412
00:16:08,824 --> 00:16:10,754
Well, now that you're single again,

413
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:12,266
you and I should start hanging out more.

414
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:14,492
We can call each other
"slut" in like, the fun way.

415
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:15,758
Yeah, maybe.

416
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,281
I mean, Adam did offer to get
back together, so we'll see.

417
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:21,695
You're back with Adam. Yay, Amy.

418
00:16:21,696 --> 00:16:23,499
Well, no. Not really.

419
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,698
I mean, yes, he offered,
but I'm not gonna do it.

420
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:28,979
I'm sorry. The father of
your baby wants to step up?

421
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:30,924
Do you watch any daytime talk shows?

422
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:32,063
That never happens.

423
00:16:32,064 --> 00:16:34,411
There's clearly still an attraction.

424
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:36,152
You did go back for seconds.

425
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:39,383
I wouldn't say no to a man offering
to support me and my baby.

426
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:40,246
He can't support me.

427
00:16:40,247 --> 00:16:41,895
He works part time at a PetSmart.

428
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:43,630
- Which PetSmart?
- The one on Balson.

429
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:45,407
- Oh, that's the good one.
- Oh, wow.

430
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:48,142
I bet with his discount you can
get a lizard for like nothing.

431
00:16:48,144 --> 00:16:50,018
I'm willing to pay full
price for a lizard

432
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,408
if it means I don't have to
get back with my ex-husband.

433
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:56,265
I mean, I know it's not ideal, but given
the choice between Adam and no one?

434
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,982
Okay, I don't really want
to talk about this anymore.

435
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,230
So, uh, let's find something
else to talk about.

436
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:01,382
Just one more thing.

437
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:03,173
Ames.

438
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,196
I thought a lot about this,

439
00:17:05,197 --> 00:17:06,443
and you being pregnant

440
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:08,115
is not a deal breaker for me.

441
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:10,222
I may not be that baby's father,

442
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:13,169
but I'm willing to step
up and be its dad.

443
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,029
Thank you, Marcus. I'll let you know.

444
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:19,771
Okay, now two men are
willing to be the father.

445
00:17:20,046 --> 00:17:22,463

Yeah, I get that. You know,
I guess I'm just saying

479
00:19:01,636 --> 00:19:03,574
- everybody has problems...
- Oh, really?

480
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,293
What are your problems, Jonah?

481
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:07,669
Did the farmers market
run out of your yogurt?

482
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,500
Or... oh, your "New Yorker"
came late this month.

483
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:12,798
"The New Yorker" is weekly,

484
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,351
and yeah, fine, okay.

485
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:17,081
Maybe you have a little
more stuff than I do...

486
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:18,519
A little more stuff?

487
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,813
But that doesn't mean
that you get to just

488
00:19:19,814 --> 00:19:21,290
dismiss anything I say.

489
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,627
Oh, my God. Cry me a river.

490
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,999
This is what I'm talking about!

491
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,470
You love playing the martyr.

492
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:27,925
You get to just judge everybody else,

493
00:19:27,926 --> 00:19:29,829
but nobody gets to criticize
you on your crap.

494
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,309
Are you really that pissed
off that I kissed you?

495
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,613
No, I'm pissed off that
I waited around for you

496
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:37,764
for two years, and you waited
until I was in a relationship

497
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:39,206
and you were pregnant to kiss me.

498
00:19:39,518 --> 00:19:41,479
Who asked you to wait around?

499
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,835
I don't even know what you're
still doing here, Jonah.

500
00:19:43,837 --> 00:19:45,410
You can leave whenever you want.

501
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:48,538
So could you, but we all know
that's never gonna happen.

502
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:56,611
Go to hell, Jonah.

503
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:01,586
Here at Store 1217, we're a family,

504
00:20:02,474 --> 00:20:05,184
and we got through that
day like a family.

505
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:06,928

506
00:20:07,545 --> 00:20:08,780

That could seriously be on YouTube.

511
00:20:23,735 --> 00:20:25,797
Guys, I would watch a show about us.

512
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:28,070
Me too. I want to show Bo.

513
00:20:28,071 --> 00:20:29,978
He's never seen me in a
video with clothes on.

514
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,678
After watching it, I got to say,

515
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,787
a lot of the key choices were mine, so.

Cheesecake Factory on Sunday.

I don't know. What do you think?

I say we do both.

Throw in Panera,
and it's a brunch crawl.

I think we should break up.

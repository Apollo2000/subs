1
00:00:00,038 --> 00:00:02,009
To assist with housekeeping.

2
00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:04,584
We switched the isle six endcap

3
00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:05,968
so don't be alarmed.

4
00:00:05,998 --> 00:00:08,072
The softball team will once again

5
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:10,737
not be happening and...

6
00:00:11,365 --> 00:00:12,676
Last thing, ah...

7
00:00:12,706 --> 00:00:16,714
We got word that Jerusha has
an abnormally shaped uterus

8
00:00:16,744 --> 00:00:18,969
which will prevent her
from getting pregnant.

9
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:21,314
So if any of you know any women

10
00:00:21,347 --> 00:00:25,343
who might like to carry our
baby, you know, let me know.

11
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:27,603
Any questions about softball?

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,471
Okay then, well, Jeff,
the floor is yours.

13
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,064
Yeah, thank you.

14
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,535
Thank you for that warm reception.

15
00:00:37,565 --> 00:00:39,199
I mean, you're here a lot.

16
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:40,704
True. Today's not about me, though.

17
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:42,206
It's about something big.

18
00:00:42,236 --> 00:00:43,537
Bigger than all of us.

19
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:44,460
Is it your forehead?

20
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,379
No. Hi, Mateo.

21
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:48,179
Um, sales are up this quarter.

22
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:51,277
We are within $80,000
of reclassification.

23
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:53,117
If we can make that
by the end of the day,

24
00:00:53,147 --> 00:00:56,716
we will go from being
a triple-A store to a...

25
00:00:58,322 --> 00:01:00,128
- See where I'm going?
- No.

26
00:01:00,158 --> 00:01:02,693
Reclassified as a...

27
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:04,800
Nobody's following you. Just finish.

28
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,699
Quadruple-A, guys.
We're gonna be a Quad-A store.

29
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,030
We're gonna be a high volume store.

30
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,328
Whoo! Huh?

31
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:15,602
Any questions? Garrett.

32
00:01:15,636 --> 00:01:17,403
Abnormally shaped how?

33
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,211
Oh, okay, well, if a woman's
uterus is normally shaped

34
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:23,476
like a V, Jerusha's is
kinda like a corkscrew.

35
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,145
Kinda like a duck's.
Wait, I'll... I'll draw it.

36
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,184
I meant questions
about the reclassification.

37
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:29,253
What are we now?

38
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:31,884
Well, we're triple-A. I just said that.

39
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:34,220
So this would be one more A then?

40
00:01:34,255 --> 00:01:35,188
Exactly.

41
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:37,207
Believe me, you guys
are gonna love this.

42
00:01:37,237 --> 00:01:39,125
So do we get anything or...

43
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:40,297
Yes, you get a sense of pride,

44
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:41,933
a sense of accomplishment.

45
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:43,934
Quad-A stores are the first
to feature new products.

46
00:01:43,964 --> 00:01:45,569
Once they take our cafeteria

47
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,304
and transfer it into a
Pizza Hut, there's gonna be...

48
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:49,432
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you just say Pizza Hut?

49
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:50,712
Yeah.

50
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:54,869
Like we're famous or something?

51
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,065
Uh, a point of clarification, Jeff,

52
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:58,978
would it have the soda too?

53
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,115
Yeah, I believe so.

54
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:03,583
Oh!

55
00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:07,453
That's a formal Pizza Hut.

56
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,554
There she is.

57
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,933
Give me the marker

58
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:23,040
'cause someone just made
a thousand dollar sale.

59
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,341
- It was Brett.
- I know.

60
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:26,010
I just like filling in the thermometer.

61
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,044
It's very satisfying.

62
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:28,550
Is Pizza Hut that great?

63
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,948
When you've been here long
enough, any change is amazing.

64
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:32,983
Plus, it's like,
Where do you work? Cloud 9.

65
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:34,314
The regular one?

66
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:36,120
Uh, no, the one with the Pizza Hut.

67
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,133
It just... it seems odd that
Jeff waited until today

68
00:02:39,163 --> 00:02:40,495
to tell us about all this.

69
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:42,102
And he was selling it so hard.

70
00:02:42,132 --> 00:02:43,627
"Believe me, you're gonna love it."

71
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:45,029
That's what my dad said

72
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:46,374
before he moved out
and got his own place.

73
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:48,398
Oh, boo-hoo, poor Jonah.

74
00:02:48,428 --> 00:02:49,900
Both of his parents were homeowners.

75
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,040
What a tragedy.

76
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,636
Actually, it was his friend's condo.

77
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,971
That's not gonna help.

78
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:55,186
You're just looking for problems.

79
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,864
Maybe, but there's
a Quad-A in Crestwood.

80
00:02:57,894 --> 00:02:59,846
We could go over there at lunch.

81
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:02,241
Check it out, maybe. Just to be safe.

82
00:03:02,276 --> 00:03:03,671
I mean, it's not the worst idea.

83
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:08,701
Hey, keep your eye on the prize, okay?

84
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:10,817
- That's a good point.
- Is it?

85
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:13,490
You know, I honestly didn't
know how many candidates

86
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,474
we'd get from a Craigslist ad, but...

87
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:17,506
Wonderful things can happen
in all sorts of ways.

88
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:18,628
I agree.

89
00:03:19,285 --> 00:03:22,199
But you did see the part where
we said we couldn't afford

90
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:24,001
the going rate for surrogates?

91
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:28,167
I mean, I know the agencies say
it could be as much as $50,000.

92
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:29,666
But we've only saved 20.

93
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:31,738
Oh, 20's more than enough.

94
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:33,153
Oh.

95
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,175
Of which we can only give you 15.

96
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,543
It's not a problem.

97
00:03:37,578 --> 00:03:39,416
- Sorry, I meant ten.
- That's low, so...

98
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:42,014
Okay, no, 15, 15, 15. We agree on 15.

99
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:43,771
- Great.
- Okay.

100
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:45,637
You should go with this one.

101
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:46,741
It's 4K.

102
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:48,802
What does 4K mean?

103
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:50,587
Oh, um,

104
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,854
The first K is "knowledge."

105
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,847
And then the second K...

106
00:03:57,877 --> 00:04:00,547
4K televisions have 8.3 megapixels.

107
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:02,819
The human eye is literally incapable

108
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:05,037
of appreciating a
finer resolution than this.

109
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,354
Wow. Okay, I'll take it.

110
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:11,822
- There you go.
- Thank you.

111
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,060
It has all of the channels.

112
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,091
Okay, so Charles Marquard,

113
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:20,473
this is your American
Express Business card.

114
00:04:20,503 --> 00:04:21,268
Yep.

115
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,041
And you don't have an ID with you.

116
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:24,738
Left it at the office.

117
00:04:24,772 --> 00:04:28,617
You'd like to purchase an
Xbox One and a pile of candy.

118
00:04:28,743 --> 00:04:30,248
Yeah, you know, for the kids.

119
00:04:30,278 --> 00:04:31,952
What kinda business you in?

120
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:33,862
Oil and gas.

121
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:36,493
Oh, you know if it was me,

122
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:38,778
I might pick up a second
Xbox to have one upstairs,

123
00:04:38,808 --> 00:04:40,656
- have one downstairs.
- Okay.

124
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:42,870
You're a good dad, Mr. Marquard.

125
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:52,152
<i>♪</i>

126
00:04:52,182 --> 00:04:55,140
Okay, as soon as we hit
$80,000, drop the balloons,

127
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,070
hit the music, get a
candid picture of me

128
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,515
celebrating with everybody
to send to corporate.

129
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:00,793
Got it, got it.
Hey, now let's talk dancers.

130
00:05:00,823 --> 00:05:03,272
How many are we talking?
And... all dudes?

131
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,338
Maybe no dancers.

132
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,278
Music and balloons with no dancers?

133
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,076
That's... gonna look insane, but fine.

134
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,079
Jeff. Uh, new hat?

135
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:14,614
Yeah. I splurged.

136
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,254
You know, it's a huge day.
It's a very huge day.

137
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,190
Definitely. Um, we were wondering

138
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,625
if you could maybe
tell us a little bit more

139
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,858
about what we can expect
once this store becomes Quad-A.

140
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:27,260
Oh, uh, well, yeah, I mean,

141
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,233
things are pretty much
gonna be the same.

142
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,429
Well, but earlier you said
it would be better.

143
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:33,400
Yes, obviously better.

144
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,735
- Better and the same.
- Nice.

145
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,173
That sounds amazing.

146
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,304
Right.

147
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,208
Is there any possibility
that it could maybe get worse?

148
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:45,308
You know what, there's a lot
of liars out there, okay?

149
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:47,777
Look for people who
have scores to settle, perhaps.

150
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,720
And don't believe everything you hear.

151
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,551
What would we have heard?

152
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,230
Oh, I don't know, but whatever it is,

153
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,486
it would've been untrue.

154
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:56,389
That's why it's a paradox.

155
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,994
Believe me. It's gonna be great.

156
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:02,081
Trust me.

157
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:06,620
Man, I can't wait for it to be great.

158
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:10,069
So, what's next?

159
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,076
You write me a check
and I can have a baby for you

160
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:13,606
in as little as a week.

161
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,247
- A week?
- Oh, is that too long?

162
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:17,557
I mean, if you're really impatient,

163
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:18,672
I can get you one earlier,

164
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:21,202
but you're not gonna
get to choose the color.

165
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:24,969
Turns out that when
you can't pay top dollar,

166
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:27,768
the surrogates you get
are just a bunch of plops.

167
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,136
Aw, I'm sure you'll find someone.

168
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,129
I don't know.

169
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:33,707
Sometimes I think
that maybe God is trying

170
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:36,536
to send me a message that
people in their late 50s

171
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:38,241
shouldn't conceive a child.

172
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:40,224
That's crazy talk.

173
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:42,508
You guys are gonna have a killer baby.

174
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:44,202
Everyone's gonna wanna carry it.

175
00:06:44,232 --> 00:06:46,202
Yeah, right. Would you?

176
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,046
Of course, I would.

177
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:51,667
Really? You mean that?

178
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:54,199
Absolutely.

179
00:06:56,054 --> 00:06:58,456
Thank you! Oh, my God.

180
00:06:59,825 --> 00:07:04,295
Jerusha, this is a blessed day.
I found her.

181
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:05,997
<i>♪</i>

182
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:10,083
Wow, it is busy here.

183
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:11,819
Is it always like this?

184
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:16,290
Welcome to the show, people.
Welcome to the show.

185
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:18,096
Excuse me, hi, sorry to interrupt.

186
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:19,964
Uh, can I ask you a question? Oh, sure.

187
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:21,962
Do you like working here?

188
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:23,797
I love working here.

189
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:25,336
It's the best job I've ever had.

190
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:27,439
- Great. Thank you.
- Have a heavenly day.

191
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:30,337
All right. See? Best job she's ever had?

192
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:32,844
Where I come from, something
being the best thing

193
00:07:32,874 --> 00:07:34,345
usually means it's pretty good.

194
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,577
Oh, hey, sorry, just out of curiosity,

195
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:40,514
what's, uh, what's the
worst part of your job?

196
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:43,350
No part. It's wonderful.

197
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:45,089
It's the best job I've ever had.

198
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,920
Have a heavenly day.

199
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,193
Did you hear that? That was...

200
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,694
That was two "best job I ever hads"

201
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:52,030
It's a colloquialism.
Like, "It is what it is."

202
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,264
Or, "Women be shopping."

203
00:07:53,294 --> 00:07:55,095
Excuse me. Hi.

204
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:56,868
Um, how long have you been working here?

205
00:07:56,898 --> 00:07:59,170
Well, it's been
the best job I've ever had

206
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,168
for about 4 1/2 years.

207
00:08:01,202 --> 00:08:03,103
Best job I've ever had.

208
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:05,372
Have a heavenly day.

209
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:08,141
People love it here. Obviously.

210
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:14,815
Ah!

211
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:16,450
Oh, sorry about that.

212
00:08:16,484 --> 00:08:20,988
Jerusha is making embroidery of
your face on a rabbit's body.

213
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:22,494
- Mm.
- To say thank you.

214
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:24,562
You know, and she wanted
something she could work with.

215
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:27,060
Could you profile?

216
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:29,563
- So Jerusha's on board?
- Yeah.

217
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:34,134
It just means so much to us
that you're willing to do this.

218
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:36,003
Means so much to me.

219
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,178
So she doesn't think that I'm,
you know, too young,

220
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,038
or irresponsible? Or stupid?

221
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:43,710
No.

222
00:08:43,745 --> 00:08:46,417
'Cause, you know, if you guys
wanted to go with someone else,

223
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:48,715
I... I wouldn't be offended.

224
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:52,252
Cheyenne, do you still wanna do this?

225
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:53,537
Oh...

226
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:57,157
Yes. Definitely.

227
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:58,725
- Totally.
- Great.

228
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,028
You just, you know, try and stop me.

229
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,062
I won't.

230
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,567
Yeah. The thing is...

231
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:09,870
- Um...
- Ah, is it Bo?

232
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:14,441
Mm-hmm, yeah. It's Bo.

233
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:16,281
If it were up to me, I would just say,

234
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:19,046
You put a baby in me right now, mister.

235
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,784
But Bo, he just sucks, you know.

236
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:27,318
Yeah. Bo sucks.

237
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:39,533
Uh, hey, Len. I'm... I'm Jonah.

238
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:41,468
How's it going today?

239
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:44,602
Are you okay?

240
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:46,473
Mm-hmm.

241
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:49,376
Oh, she's fine. She does this every day.

242
00:09:51,913 --> 00:09:53,146
Nothing.

243
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,452
You guys aren't supposed
to be back here.

244
00:09:54,482 --> 00:09:55,816
Relax, we're legit.

245
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,514
We work at the Ozark Highlands store.

246
00:09:58,544 --> 00:09:59,849
And we're about to go Quad-A,

247
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,492
so we just wanted to see
what that was like.

248
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:04,091
They're quaddin' ya, huh?

249
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,892
Yeah. They're quadding us.

250
00:10:05,927 --> 00:10:08,428
So, um, what's it like?

251
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:10,797
Be straight with me. Polo to polo.

252
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:13,767
Honestly, you're screwed.

253
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:17,471
We cannot become a Quad-A.

254
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:19,777
- I don't understand.
- It's total chaos.

255
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:21,746
Everyday there is like Black Friday.

256
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:23,514
- It's hell.
- Hell on steroids.

257
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:26,146
Isn't hell bad enough
without adding steroids?

258
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,849
Everyone there
is exhausted all the time.

259
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:30,517
They are open 24 hours.

260
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:32,578
Which means they never
have a chance to catch up.

261
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:33,995
So when do they have time to clean?

262
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:37,933
No, guys, we've come too far.
We are this close to Quad-A.

263
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:38,696
Now is not the time to...

264
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:40,331
They don't let employees eat the pizza.

265
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:42,462
- Withdrawn.
- So what do we do?

266
00:10:42,497 --> 00:10:44,197
We need to slow down sales.

267
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:46,595
Guys, when do they have time to clean?

268
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,538
They don't.

269
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:49,344
Well, then it never gets clean.

270
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:50,642
All right, you heard Amy, guys,

271
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:53,707
let's cross that finish line
and become Quad-A.

272
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:55,213
Marcus, were you even listening?

273
00:10:55,243 --> 00:10:57,544
Sorry, I got a text earlier.

274
00:10:57,578 --> 00:11:00,218
Honestly, I missed a lot of
what you guys were saying.

275
00:11:00,248 --> 00:11:03,550
♪ Jah at the controller,
Bua bua bua yeah ♪

276
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:05,886
♪ Wha gwan rasta Control the simma ♪

277
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,522
- Bo?
- Oh, yo, what up, spouse?

278
00:11:08,743 --> 00:11:11,003
What're you doing here?
Where's Harmonica?

279
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:12,723
Ah, she's at the zoo. She's good.

280
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:15,454
Oh, good. Bo's here.

281
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,565
So, why don't we all go
have a chat, you know, and...

282
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:20,405
see if we can't change your mind?

283
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:21,873
- Yeah, let's do this.
- Okay.

284
00:11:21,903 --> 00:11:23,241
What're we gonna change my mind about?

285
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:25,539
- I think you know.
- Huh?

286
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:28,942
- I think I know?
- You think you know.

287
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:32,609
Yeah, I called you, and I was like,

288
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:35,065
"Please, Bo, let me have Glenn's baby."

289
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,305
And you were like, "Nah, girl,
no way, no how, okay?"

290
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:39,968
Squash that noise. Peace."

291
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:41,953
Wow, that's crazy, 'cause,
like, the way I remember it,

292
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:43,657
that never happened at all.

293
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:45,888
It's funny how perception is,
you know what I'm sayin'?

294
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:49,485
Bo, is there anything
that Cheyenne and I can say

295
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:51,356
to help you change your mind?

296
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:53,151
Mm, I don't know.

297
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:55,815
It's like, I wanna be
sex-positive, but, like,

298
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:57,668
on the other side of the hand,

299
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,782
thinking about my wife
banging an old couple...

300
00:11:59,812 --> 00:12:01,002
No, no, no!

301
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:02,680
And would I get to go with Jerusha?

302
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,475
Almost definitely not.

303
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:07,229
Well, I really wanna do this for Glenn.

304
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,150
Well, I guess I...

305
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,015
But I also understand your point that

306
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:12,566
me having another man's
baby might make you look

307
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:13,966
like some kind of...

308
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,072
I don't know...
a punk-ass chump or something.

309
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:18,261
Yep, uh-huh.

310
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,504
It... It's okay.

311
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,098
I... I accept your decision and...

312
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,913
Well, I'm disappointed, you know.

313
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:27,412
I respect that you guys
won't change your morals

314
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:29,271
for a measly $20,000.

315
00:12:29,537 --> 00:12:31,866
20 grand? Huh?

316
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:34,942
Of course, for Bo,
it's not about the money.

317
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:36,011
I didn't know there was money.

318
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,495
I thought this was like
a dare or something.

319
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:40,100
Yo, for 20 grand you can
stick whatever you want

320
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,197
in either of us.

321
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:45,514
Okay, everyone, I made some

00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:01,706
There are so many of these.

484
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,840
Where we at?

485
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,344
We're not Quad-A. We did it!

486
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,084
- Alright!
- You tiny little fool.

487
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,387
We're not number one.
We're not nu... no.

488
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,089
It doesn't work as well.

489
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:21,225
I guess it was when Mateo
dumped me, you know, I just...

490
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:22,698
I just dove into my work,

491
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,700
'cause I thought that would
be fulfilling, but...

492
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,598
So here I am, on the cusp of
having a Quad-A store

493
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:31,335
and it's like, I don't even
know if I want that, you know?

494
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:34,004
Oh, actually, we didn't make Quad-A.

495
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,606
What? Dammit.

496
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,243
- Oh, no, it's gonna be...
- No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

497
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:42,012
This is bad. I can't go home, Jonah.

498
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,515
I'm [bleep]. I'm [bleep].

499
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:47,451
I bought a Subaru! That money's gone!

500
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,191
Gone. I couldn't wait a week?

501
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,856
One week. No discipline.

502
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,524
[bleep]!

503
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,193
- Hey, Glenn.
- Mm.

504
00:19:56,223 --> 00:19:57,966
Just wanted to let you know
we didn't make the target.

505
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,322
No Quad-A.

506
00:19:59,352 --> 00:20:00,629
Oh, okay.

507
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,201
- You all right?
- Hmm?

508
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,576
Yeah, I'll be fine.

509
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,140
I was so close to having a baby.

510
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:09,959
But...

511
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,710
You wanna be my surrogate?

512
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,416
The idea of carrying your child

513
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,151
makes me wanna put
a bullet through my uterus.

514
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,782
I was joking.

515
00:20:17,812 --> 00:20:19,321
I wouldn't want you to carry my baby

516
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,379
if you paid me the $20,000.

517
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,455
Wait, you're paying $20,000?

518
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,661
Just for someone to squirt out your kid?

519
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:28,507
Well, yeah, a little bit more.

520
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:32,496
I mean, that's practically
what I take home in a year.

521
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,133
I could fix up my house.
Pay off my credit card bills.

522
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,974
I could put my mom away
for good with money like that.

523
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,182
Well, I mean...

524
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:44,642
If that's something you wanted,
I could think about it.

525
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,311
I mean, if <i>you were interested</i>

526
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,847
then <i>I</i> would think about it.

527
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:54,285
- It's not something I want.
- Oh, I would want it far less.

528
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,028
- Okay.
- Okay.

529
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,362
This is cool.

530
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,701
You know, I've always wanted

531
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:08,370
to have a family of my own someday,

532
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,538
so it'll be great
to have a practice baby

533
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,006
where nothing matters.

534
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,056
- Wait, wait...
- Like, whatever happens to it

535
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:15,506
happens to it, you know?

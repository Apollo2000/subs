00:00:00,335 --> 00:00:02,015
So without further ado,

2
00:00:02,046 --> 00:00:03,480
it's my great pleasure

3
00:00:03,554 --> 00:00:06,894
to welcome our newest
part-time employee,

4
00:00:06,954 --> 00:00:08,453
Emma Dubanowski.

5
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:16,342
That's very nice of you
and also very unnecessary.

6
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:18,761
Oh, there's more.

7
00:00:18,872 --> 00:00:20,613
14 years ago,

8
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:24,870
our Cloud 9 family
got a little bigger.

9
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:26,378
- Aww!
- Oh!

10
00:00:26,537 --> 00:00:27,600
Adorable.

11
00:00:27,683 --> 00:00:28,730
- Mom...
- I don't know

12
00:00:28,788 --> 00:00:29,847
how he got those pictures.

13
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:31,399
Oh, I keep a copy of all the photos

14
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:32,957
employees get developed here.

15
00:00:33,118 --> 00:00:34,527
- What?
- That's horrifying.

16
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:35,957
You don't have any of my photos,

17
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,332
because I don't pose for them.

18
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:39,175
You know,
if I ever got kidnapped,

19
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:40,813
the police would have quite a time

20
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:42,870
finding a current photo
to put on the news.

21
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:45,024
Anyway, over the years,

22
00:00:45,082 --> 00:00:48,761
we've watched Amy's daughter Emma grow.

23
00:00:50,012 --> 00:00:51,769
Who could forget the time

24
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:54,188
that she lost a tooth
right here in the store

25
00:00:54,246 --> 00:00:56,878
and Elias ate it 'cause he
thought it was a Chiclet?

26
00:00:56,948 --> 00:00:58,347
Glenn, you're drifting.

27
00:00:58,503 --> 00:01:01,902
Oh. Okay, well, we'll finish that later.

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,785
Anyway, Emma, we are so happy

29
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:09,035
that you're here, and we hope
you have a great first day!

30
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,437
Emma!

31
00:01:15,086 --> 00:01:17,253
Oh, also, starting today

32
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:19,230
is Kelly Watson.

33
00:01:19,457 --> 00:01:22,089

or stand over there,
what does it matter?

56

This whole job is standing places.

Wow. Pretty tough on her.

00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:37,350
I feel like I barely did
anything my first day.

69

- Yeah, we all felt that way.
- Hmm.

70
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,254
She just has such an attitude
since the divorce.

71
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,617
That's why
I'm making her work here.

72
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:44,046
I'm hoping she gets some discipline.

73
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:45,959
And you're not worried

74
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:48,636
that if you're too hard on her,
Adam gets to be the good guy?

75
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:49,824
What? No.

76
00:02:49,882 --> 00:02:51,618
It's just that when
my parents separated,

77
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:53,180
they both wanted to be
the favorite.

78
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:54,961
I came home one day
and my dad had gotten me

79
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,579
a ten-disc box set
of Churchill speeches.

80
00:02:57,637 --> 00:02:59,576
And that was something
you wanted?

81
00:02:59,662 --> 00:03:01,203
Uh, yeah.

82
00:03:02,331 --> 00:03:04,515
I'm still closer with him
than I am with my mom.

83
00:03:04,921 --> 00:03:06,874
Although that might be
because he doesn't send me

84
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:08,765
long, pointless texts
about book club.

85
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,915
Yeah, see,
Latino parents are different.

86
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:12,990
We don't really need
our kids to like us.

87
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:15,560

- Anyway,

103
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:49,202
I have been experiencing

104
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:51,523
some anxiety recently, and...

105
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:52,929
please don't spread this around,

106
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,890

107
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,166
Actually, two shrinks. One's a control.

108

Long story short,

109
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:00,814
I've been dealing
with some personal crap.

Yeah, that would probably be good.

At least until I get my head together.

126
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:37,659

127

129

No. So look, I was thinking maybe,

00:05:26,146 --> 00:05:27,602
I don't know, we could go see

164
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:00,986
he's more fun,
then she's gonna want

165
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:02,404
to live with him,
and before you know it,

166
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,112
it's, "Sorry, Mom, can't
make it to your birthday party."

167
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:06,611
I'm too busy listening to
Churchill speeches with Dad."

168
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,712
Oh,
that would be a crazy coincidence.

169
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:10,955
I don't know. Maybe I...

170
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:12,912
maybe I should be a little
less strict with her,

171
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,532
at least until I'm number one again.

172
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:16,192
You're an intense mom.

173
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,388
I do not want to be around
when Emma starts dating.

174
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:20,365
Why would you
even mention that?

175
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:30,485
- Oh, yeah, that's what we heard.
- No.

176
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:31,818
- Oh.
- Oh.

177
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,075
Hey.

178
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,677
Hey... Garrett.

179
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,537
How's it going, big guy?

180
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:40,669
I'm fine.

181
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,211
Listen, some of us
get together on Thursdays

182
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,766
and do a little wine club thing.

183
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,219
You could join us if you want.

184
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:48,211
Why would I do that?

185
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:50,946
Well, you know,
'cause of what happened.

186
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:53,571
With you and Dina.

187
00:06:54,777 --> 00:06:56,930
- How she dumped you.
- What?

188
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,703
You are going to find
someone so great.

189
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:01,462
I don't know what you guys heard,

190
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:04,516
but I did not get dumped.
It was mutual.

191
00:07:05,102 --> 00:07:06,567
No.

192
00:07:06,946 --> 00:07:09,203
- It's never mutual.
- It's never mutual.

193
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,352
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.

194
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:13,047
I know it's not Six Flags,

195
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,321
but go-backs can be fun.

196
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,914
♪ I like to go back, go back ♪

197
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,964
♪ I like to... go back! ♪

198
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:21,948
♪ I like to go back, go back ♪

199
00:07:22,104 --> 00:07:23,886
♪ I like to go back ♪

200
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:26,253
I like the enthusiasm!

201
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:27,659
♪ I like to go back ♪

202
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:29,326
♪ I like to go back ♪

203
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:32,401
♪ I like to go back, I like to go back ♪

204
00:07:32,588 --> 00:07:34,254
♪ Go way back, back ♪

205
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,347
So how's school?
What's going on?

206
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:37,911
What's the hot goss?

207
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:39,011
"Hot goss"?

208
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:41,313
You know what I mean.
Come on, spill it, girl.

209
00:07:41,371 --> 00:07:42,627
Excuse me.
You were gonna check to see

210
00:07:42,684 --> 00:07:44,122
if you had any floor cleaner
in the back?

211
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:46,579
- Oh, yeah, sorry, I forgot.
- You forgot?

212
00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:48,324
Listen, if you don't feel
like doing something,

213
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:49,441
don't waste my time.

214
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:50,607
Excuse me, sir.

215
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:53,489
- You need to back off. She is 14.
- Yeah, well...

216
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:55,430
Also,
you're upset about floor cleaner.

217
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,399
Who even uses
floor cleaner anymore?

218
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:59,583
What are you,
an orderly from the '50s?

219
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:00,821
- No.
- No.

220
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:02,259
Right. So go away.

221
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:06,269
Wow.

222
00:08:07,148 --> 00:08:08,247
That was awesome.

223
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:09,951
I can be awesome.

224
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,380
Stop, no, it's hideous.

225
00:08:13,438 --> 00:08:14,458
No, no, I'm serious.

226
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:16,235
Not everyone
can pull off a vest.

227
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,618
Oh, believe me, I know.

228
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,094
I work here.

229
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:21,185
I gotta run.

230
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:22,946
Uh, my break's almost over.

231
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:24,368
Hey, actually,

232
00:08:24,426 --> 00:08:25,513
do you think it'd be cool

233
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,180
if I borrowed your badge
to use the employee bathroom?

234
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:30,501
I mean, we have porta-potties,

235
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:32,157
but, uh, you know,
kinda gross, so...

236
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:34,094
Uh, yeah, yeah.

237
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,176
Of course. Not a problem at all.

238
00:08:36,742 --> 00:08:37,742
Just go to town.

239
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:38,874
Thanks.

240
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:40,403
You're the best.

241
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:45,559
It's happening!

242
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:47,848
Uh-huh.

243
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:49,432
Uh, okay.

244
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:51,254
What is that supposed to mean?

245
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:55,781
Just that... you know, sometimes
people flirt with people to get stuff.

246
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,587
Like, there's this cashier
at the Steak 'n Shake

247
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:00,868
who always gives me free
fries when I wear shorts.

248
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,419
Yeah, well, that's not
what's happening here, so...

249
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:05,067
- Okay.
- You can tell by his eyes.

250
00:09:05,146 --> 00:09:06,395
- Okay.
- You don't know him.

251
00:09:06,453 --> 00:09:08,453
I'm sorry. You're right, I don't.

252
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:09,850
Yeah.

253
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,356
Hey, Dina.

254
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:15,801
Ninja Turtles are still a thing, huh?

255
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:17,637
No wonder this country's a garbage fire.

256
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:19,923
Hey, why did you tell Justine
that you broke up with me?

257
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:21,615
Because she asked me,
"What's new with you,"

258
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:22,704
and so I told her.

259
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,372
One of my birds has pinkeye,
I broke up with you,

260
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:25,656
and I just signed up for golf lessons.

261
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:27,837
Okay, but you didn't break up with me.

262
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:30,043
It was mutual, and if anything,
I suggested it.

263
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:32,018
But I took you up on it.
If you had suggested it

264
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,692
and I said, "No, I don't want that,"

265
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,204
would we still be
sleeping together?

266
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:37,501
I-I don't know. I guess, but...

267
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,856
Well, there you go, champ.

268
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:44,495
Hey. Hi.

269
00:09:44,553 --> 00:09:47,114
I'm sorry. Do you know
what a softline is?

270
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:48,794
I don't have time for this.

271
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:50,779
Excuse me.

272
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:52,509
Do you know what a softline is?

273
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,590
I don't live here. I'm from Tampa.

274
00:09:57,053 --> 00:09:58,801
Haley's dating a junior.

275
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:00,085
Huh?

276
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:01,760
I mean, it's not really

277
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:03,481
"hot goss," but...

278
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:05,534
she doesn't sit with us
at lunch anymore,

279
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:07,589
and she goes off campus
with Connor.

280
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:09,270
Wow.

281
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,129
And, um, how does your
dad feel about that?

282
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,575
Oh, I haven't told him.

283
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:15,847
Nice.

284
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,700
Oh, uh, no, you're not done.

285
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:20,934
The floor's so dirty,
how can you even tell?

286
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,621
Well, because the floor
is still slippery.

287
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,114
Okay. Fine.

288
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:31,391
Actually, you know what?

289
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:34,332
It'd be kind of punk rock
if we just left it.

290
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,429
How about you and I
go get a soda?

291
00:10:36,894 --> 00:10:38,293
- Come on.
- Okay.

292
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:40,981
Slippery floors, that could be
our little inside thing.

293
00:10:41,177 --> 00:10:42,270
Like how?

294
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:46,929
Like, I could text you

295
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:49,941
the banana emoji, and you would
know what I was talking about.

296
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:51,062
- Huh?
- Sure.

297
00:10:52,091 --> 00:10:54,726
So now Justine might have
to get her jaw wired shut.

298
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:55,886
You see, this is what happens

299
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:57,882
when you try to be
friends with your kid.

300
00:10:58,006 --> 00:10:59,160
She could be zoning,

301
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:00,684
she could be cleaning, but no.

302
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:01,991
She's just standing there.

303
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,660
Do you think any of this
might be stemming

304
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:04,577
from the fact that you feel

305
00:11:04,646 --> 00:11:06,079
like you're losing control of...

306
00:11:06,148 --> 00:11:07,616
See, this is how it starts.

307
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:09,530
First, she's texting at work.

308
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:11,629
And then
she's not doing her homework.

309
00:11:11,773 --> 00:11:13,898
And then she's hanging out
with the bad kids.

310
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:15,976
And before you know it,
she's pregnant

311
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:18,984
and addicted to pills
and dancing for strangers.

312
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:21,671
Oh, those were...
those are really bad kids.

313
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:22,908
You want me to, uh...

314
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,475
want me to go yell at her?

315
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,855
Yes. Actually, yeah.
That would be great.

316
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:29,648
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I was just kidding.

317
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:31,249
I never yell.
Even when I'm mad,

318
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:33,334
I just push it down really deep,

319
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:35,712
and then sometimes I wake up
in the middle of the night,

320
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,898
panicked and sweaty
for no reason.

321
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:42,988
Oh. I'm, like,
obsessed with the gym.

322
00:11:43,046 --> 00:11:46,046
I live there. I'm really into, like,

323
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:50,886
core stuff and just
all sports in general.

324
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:53,085
I mean, whatever you're doing,

325
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:54,629
it's... It's working.

326
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:55,702
Oh.

327
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:59,695
Hey, um, you think I could get
that badge for the bathroom again?

328
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:03,373
Oh. Oof. Um. You know what?

329
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:05,909
I would love to, um,

330
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:08,234
but I could actually get
into trouble with my boss.

331
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:09,408
Oh.

332
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,938
Yeah, I mean,

333
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,007
I am a bad boy, but not that way.

334
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:16,890
Sure. I'll just, uh...

335
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:19,546
use the porta-potty, then.

336
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:22,092
Okay, well, don't take too long.

337
00:12:22,296 --> 00:12:24,517
We haven't even traded
stretching tips yet.

338
00:12:29,193 --> 00:12:30,471
- Excuse me, hi.
- Hey, listen,

339
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:31,841
I'm sorry about before.

340
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:33,222
I hadn't eaten anything,
and, uh,

341
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,605
I got a weird call
from my wife.

342
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:35,911
Okay,
let me stop you right there.

343
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:38,066
I was wrong
for yelling at you earlier.

344
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,812
That girl, she messed up,

345
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,222
and the only way she's gonna
learn how to do her job right

346
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,105
is if customers yell at her.

347
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,207
Okay.

348
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,933
So if you wanted to, like,
go over there

349
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:48,484
and really give it to her,

350
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,692
that would be fine.

351
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,304
I mean, like, don't hold back.

352
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:52,580
Obviously, don't hit her,

353
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,566
but if you wanted
to shake her a little,

354
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:55,773
that would be cool.

355
00:12:55,831 --> 00:12:57,191
I'm not gonna shake a little girl.

356
00:12:57,303 --> 00:12:59,687
No, no, I'm her mom.
I'm not gonna report it.

357
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:05,741
Little tip:

358
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,874
it works better if you scan
from, like, six inches away.

359
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:10,008
Oh, okay.

360
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,226
Thank you.

361
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,224
You're, like, the only person
who's actually helped me.

362
00:13:14,314 --> 00:13:16,155
Oh, aren't you sweet?

363
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:18,429
I think
we're gonna be good friends.

364
00:13:18,558 --> 00:13:19,624
I hope so.

365
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:20,889
Wanna hear a secret?

366
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:22,065
Sure.

367
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,898
I have a plan to get
Jerry back.

368
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,202
- I'm sorry. I don't know who...
- Sandra's boyfriend.

369
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,741
Well, my boyfriend
that she stole from me.

370
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:30,882
He's in a coma,
but I'm going to sneak

371
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,101
into his hospital room
when she's not there.

372
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:35,140
I climb up on the bed, and oopsy!

373
00:13:35,303 --> 00:13:36,695
I forgot my underwear.

374
00:13:36,803 --> 00:13:39,749
Next thing you know,
I'm pregnant with Jerry's baby.

375
00:13:40,744 --> 00:13:41,871
Now, stay with me,

376
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:44,015
because this is where
it starts to get a little dark.

377
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,082
That's okay.

378
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,124
- You don't want to hear the rest?
- No, I'm cool.

379
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,109
Oh, uh, no,
the tuna goes one aisle over.

380
00:13:53,204 --> 00:13:56,238
It's, uh... it's not a bean product.

381
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:57,570
It's a can.

382
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:00,343
Sure, yeah, yeah, it's a can,

383
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:01,877
yeah, but, um, you know,

384
00:14:01,946 --> 00:14:03,960
we don't really organize
things here by shape.

385
00:14:04,116 --> 00:14:05,914
So it's not like the cans go over here

386
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:08,351
and the boxes go over there.

387
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:09,686
Whatever.

388
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:12,054
N-no, not... no. No!

389
00:14:12,122 --> 00:14:13,816
Not whatever, okay...

390
00:14:13,874 --> 00:14:15,585
Missy, and you know what?

391
00:14:15,677 --> 00:14:17,158
You got to put that phone away too.

392
00:14:17,226 --> 00:14:18,254
You're not my boss.

393
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:21,210
Yeah, I'm... Well,
I'm the grown-up.

394
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:22,564
- Hey!
- You're not getting paid

395
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:24,961
to gossip with your little
girlfriends, okay?

396
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:27,175
So get back to work,
or your ass is grass,

397
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,687
and I'm... I'm the... lawn mower.

398
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:29,772
Jonah!

399
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,851
What... what is wrong with you?
She's a child!

400
00:14:32,937 --> 00:14:34,777
- Right, but she...
- You know, I am appalled!

401
00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:36,354
- You stay away from her.
- Okay, okay, Glenn

402
00:14:36,411 --> 00:14:38,499
Oh, oh, oh, you can dish it out,

403
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,851
- but you can't take it! Huh? Huh?
- You don't understand.

404
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:42,554
Well, I'm the one who's yelling now!

405
00:14:42,612 --> 00:14:44,646
Okay? How you like that, mister?

406
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:45,761
I don't... I don't...

407
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,562
Not so hot, huh?

408
00:14:48,107 --> 00:14:49,226
Huh?

409
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:55,909
Let me help you.

410
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:56,980
I can do it.

411
00:14:57,038 --> 00:14:59,015
Come on, come on, hey, hey.
Don't be a hero.

412
00:14:59,073 --> 00:15:00,606
Come on. I got it. I got it.

413
00:15:05,344 --> 00:15:06,538
Can I ask you something?

414
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:08,911
You can't use my bathroom pass.

415
00:15:09,037 --> 00:15:10,269
Bathroom pass?

416
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,715
Oh, is that not what you were gonna...

417
00:15:13,423 --> 00:15:14,558
Go ahead.

418
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,269
What are you doing here?

419
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:20,150
You seem like you are way
too pretty to be working here.

420
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:21,216
Come on.

421
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:24,613
Shut up. No, I'm not.

422
00:15:24,695 --> 00:15:26,722
You have a nice smile.

423
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:28,101
What?

424
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,792
What are you even saying?

425
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:32,199
You... you have a nice smile.

426
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:37,772
Thanks. Oh, sh... my shirt is soaked.

427
00:15:38,077 --> 00:15:42,050
O... Kay, what?

428
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:46,084
Hey, man.

429
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:50,923
<i>♪ I got a new life ♪</i>

430
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:53,332
<i>♪ You would hardly recognize me ♪</i>

431
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,574
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

432
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:56,756
It's kinda personal.

433
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,827
Yeah, sure, sure.

434
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,756
Okay, well, first of all,
you need to calm down.

435
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:02,795
I'm calm. Calm. Just, you know,

436
00:16:02,853 --> 00:16:05,021
my roomie's coming to me
for a little heart-to-heart.

437
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:07,037
It's, uh... it's a good day.

438
00:16:07,482 --> 00:16:08,960
It's a really... it's a really good day.

439
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:10,490
Basically, Dina and I

440
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,533
decided together to break up.

441
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:13,763
And now she's going around,

442
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:15,434
she's telling everybody
that she dumped me...

443
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:17,371
- Oh. Oh. Okay.
- Which is not true. It was mutual.

444
00:16:17,428 --> 00:16:18,936
Can you stop active listening?

445
00:16:18,994 --> 00:16:20,410
Oh, yes, sorry, continue.

446
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:21,787
And I feel

447
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:23,451
like I want to let everyone know,

448
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:25,375
but Dina's in a rough place,

449
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:27,721
and I don't want it to look like
I'm kicking her when she's down.

450
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,334
Got it, okay, so... unh.
Let's unpack this.

451
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:32,882
Uh, it sounds to me
like you're looking for a way

452
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,025
to let everybody know what
happened with you and Dina

453
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,272
without it reflecting poorly on you.

454
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,058
That's exactly what I just said.

455
00:16:42,116 --> 00:16:45,592
Okay. That's a toughie.
That is a tough, tough toughie.

456
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,272
Okay, this isn't gonna work.

457
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:49,195
Wait, no, no, no, no! I can do better.

458
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:50,945
Let me... Give me a do-over.

459
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:53,662
Come back. I'll pretend
like this didn't happen.

460
00:16:56,434 --> 00:16:57,586
All right.

461
00:16:57,644 --> 00:16:59,998
I, uh... I messed up before.
I'm sorry.

462
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:01,975
I-I was listening,

463
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,006
but I wasn't really hearing.

464
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,928
So here's what we're gonna do.

465
00:17:05,986 --> 00:17:09,100
Tonight, gonna pop open
a couple brewskis,

466
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:12,190
we're gonna get ourselves
a nice pie... pizza pie,

467
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:14,209
not pecan or whatever...

468
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:16,116
and we are gonna watch ourselves

469
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,386
a little movie called "Bad Boys 2"

470
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:20,772
and get you through
this breakup thing roomie-style.

471
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:21,868
Hmm.

472
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:24,631
All right. That's enough.

473
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:27,522
<i>Attention, Cloud 9 employees!</i>

474
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,173
<i>I am fine.</i>

475
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:31,491
<i>Dina did not break up with me,</i>

476
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,768
<i>and actually, if you want
to get real about it,</i>

477
00:17:34,864 --> 00:17:36,247
<i>it was my idea.</i>

478
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:37,916
<i>I was trying to be a nice guy.</i>

479
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:39,817
- If you could just...
- I got this.

480
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:41,882
<i>So if you want to feel bad for somebody,</i>

481
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,952
<i>feel bad for Dina,</i>

482
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,889
<i>'cause she's the one seeing the shrink.</i>

483
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,147
Whoa.

484
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,670
<i>That... was something
I shouldn't have said.</i>

485
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:53,538
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

486
00:17:53,631 --> 00:17:55,436
<i>Please pretend you didn't hear that.</i>

487
00:17:55,623 --> 00:17:56,935
<i>Have a good day.</i>

488
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:01,631
I'm gonna just put these back.

489
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:07,397
Oh, hey, is this where Justine fell?

490
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,678
Yeah.

491
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:12,517
I gotta write it up for
her workman's comp claim.

492
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,352
She says the floor was slippery,

493
00:18:14,421 --> 00:18:17,084
but you know Justine. Glug, glug, glug!

494
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:20,533
- Hey, Glenn.
- Mm-hmm?

495
00:18:23,123 --> 00:18:26,217
Do you think Emma's doing okay?

496
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:29,534
Emma? She's a delight. Why?

497
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:31,382
I don't know. I just...

498
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:34,572
Ever since the split with
Adam, I just feel like

499
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:36,307
everything I do is screwing her up,

500
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:37,816
or maybe I've already screwed her up

501
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:40,905
and it's too late, but
she talks back to me,

502
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,264
she sometimes wears a lot of eyeliner

503
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,661
and I don't know what that means.

504
00:18:44,718 --> 00:18:46,451
I just feel like I'm losing control.

505
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,651
Amy, can I ask you something

506
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:51,162
but
without you taking it the wrong way?

507
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,497
Sure.

508
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:54,030
Are you stupid?

509
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:58,452
- Um...
- She's a teenager.

510
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:01,694
Yeah, no, I know.
I know she's a teenager.

511
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:03,301
But it's just... it's more than that.

512
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:05,847
She's secretive. She's distant.

513
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:07,803
She doesn't listen
to anything I say anymore...

514
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:10,366
Oh my, God, I am stupid.
She's a teenager.

515
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:13,802
Thank you.

516
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:15,280
Anytime.

517
00:19:15,348 --> 00:19:16,745
I can go back to yelling at her.

518
00:19:16,803 --> 00:19:19,256
Mm-hmm. Fun.

519
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:22,428
When he smiles at you,

520
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:24,936
it feels like the sun is coming up.

521
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:26,626
You know, I'm not even mad.

522
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,280
I got to flirt with a cute guy.

523
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:30,006
That's the first time
that's happened since Jeff.

524
00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:32,012
Well, Scott is way cuter than Jeff.

525
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:33,537
Bo's a troll!

526
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:37,280
I'm sorry. Love you.

527
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:39,522
- I don't want to force you.
- Oh.

528
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:41,319
- Just be careful.
- All right.

529
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:43,944
You wouldn't want it to get... lost.

530
00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:45,372
Oops.

531
00:19:45,573 --> 00:19:46,623
Oh.

532
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:50,317
Why does he have to go
to the bathroom so much?

533
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:52,373
I don't know.

534
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:56,795
Hey, uh,

535
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,431
I'm sorry about the whole
intercom thing.

536
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,225
I got carried away, and...
it wasn't cool.

537
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:03,868
It's okay. Um...

538
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,044
maybe we both cared more
about this thing between us

539
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:07,399
than we wanted to admit.

540
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,857
It is possible, yeah.

541
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:12,102
And maybe what I actually need
as I'm processing this tornado stuff

542
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:15,702
is not to be alone but
to have some support.

543
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:18,929
Are you saying you want
to get back together?

544
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,467
I mean, is that crazy?

545
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:25,780
I don't think so. Let's do it.

546
00:20:26,321 --> 00:20:27,514
Okay.

547
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:31,604
Yeah, this isn't working out.
I'm dumping you.

548
00:20:31,662 --> 00:20:33,905
- What?
- You're dumped. Unambiguous.

549
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:36,440
Sir, did you just see that I dumped him?

550
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,008
<i>Attention, Cloud 9 employees.</i>

551
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:40,708
<i>We have a nonverbal confirmation</i>

552
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:41,924
<i>I dumped Garrett.</i>

553
00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:43,561
You're a monster.

554
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:45,202
Enjoy wine club.

555
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,545
Hey, Kelly!

556
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,331
I wanted to say good job today.

557
00:20:53,438 --> 00:20:54,665
- Really?
- Yeah.

558
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,353
I felt a little lost.

559
00:20:56,408 --> 00:20:59,787
I mean, I'm not even totally
sure what go-backs are.

560
00:20:59,873 --> 00:21:01,498
You did great.

561
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:03,402
Wow. I'm... I'm glad to hear that.

562
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:04,975
Yeah. Just, tomorrow,

563
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,448
try and remember to clock in,

564
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,272
'cause that way, you'll get paid.

565
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:10,545
But, you know, great dry run.

566
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:13,662
- Oh, nobody told me I needed to clock in.
- Good night!

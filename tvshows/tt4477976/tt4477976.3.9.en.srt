00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,576
Those were just the sounds
that they made as frogs.

160
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,645
I-I don't know how to
explain any more, okay?

161
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,959
But people in America thought it
was pretty darn impressive, so...

162
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,883
It was, like, a really big commercial.

163
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,651
Is this like a "Mannequin" situation?

164
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:54,655
Um, hey. Jonah, could I get
your help for a minute?

165
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:57,571
Uh, yeah, sure. Um, I'll be right back.

166
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:02,496
[wacky voice] Whassup?

167
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,999
- Whassup?
- Whassup?

168
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,902
- You remember that one.
- Oh, yeah.

169
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:09,570
Right?

170
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:14,174
So I put the food on the
grill three hours ago.

171
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:17,678
Turns out there was nothing
in the propane tank, so...

172
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:20,915
Mm. We could present it as tartare?

173
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,617
Okay, relax. You're putting
too much pressure on the food.

174
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,352
People aren't here to eat barbecue.

175
00:07:25,387 --> 00:07:27,554
They're here to hang out
and watch the Globes.

176
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:30,357
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, you're right.

177
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:33,527
Amy, um, your TV's not working.

178
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,124
- No.
- No.

179
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,392
Good to - I don't get it.Gyver.

180
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,560
Why do you have all these remotes

181
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,894
that do absolutely nothing?

182
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,189
I mean, this is a
straight-up calculator.

183
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,206
- Oh!
- You have another calculator.

184
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:48,261
You have a third calculator in here.

185
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:49,158
I mean, they're useful.

186
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,930
Hey, have you tried unplugging it

187
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,110
and then plugging it back in?

188
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:54,940
That always worked on
my aunt's breathing machine.

189
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,271
Why don't you just call Adam?

190
00:07:56,272 --> 00:07:58,671
I'm not going to call
up my ex and ask him,

191
00:07:58,713 --> 00:08:00,972
"How do I turn on the TV?"
That would be weird.

192
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:03,464
It could be the thing
that brings you back together.

193
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:05,249
Men love a woman in need.

194
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,815
When Glenn and I were dating,
I faked a lot of heart attacks.

195
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:11,651
[laughs] "Oh, my God,
don't die, don't die."

196
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:13,086
That's how we got to first base.

197
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,654
Oh, my God, I can't even with this.

198
00:08:14,688 --> 00:08:15,955
Okay, I'm going to go watch it at home.

199
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,161
No, no, no, no, no, no. Please stay.

200
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:21,055
Emma knows how to fix the TV.
I'll just call her real quick.

201
00:08:21,056 --> 00:08:22,393
Nobody go anywhere.

202
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:24,997
Oh, Amy, you remember Jerry.

203
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:28,964
Uh, yeah. Jerry, hi. You made it.

204
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:31,704
It's his first time out
since the coma, so...

205
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:32,871
Say hi, Jerry.

206
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,973
Just give him one second. He's got it.

207
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:43,268
- Hi, Jerry.
- [Sandra laughs]

208
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:45,630
- Oh.
- I heard "Amy."

209
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:47,010
[giggles] Good job!

210
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:48,511
- Great.
- That's really good.

211
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:50,013
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

212
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:52,415
He's doing good. That was really good.

213
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,183
- [car alarm blaring]
- We're doing this.

214
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:58,121
We can park this car.

215
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:03,192
Yes. Crank it... Oh.

216
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:05,995
Okay, one more time, one more time.

217
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:07,982
People are getting antsy.

218
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:09,851
Maybe we should just order pizza...

219
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:11,519
No, we're not ordering pizza.

220
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:13,054
I can't have the TV not work
and not do the barbecue.

221
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:14,956
That plays right
into this "shambles" narrative.

222
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,909
And we're just pretending
your life is fine?

223
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,726
Yes. I mean, it is.

224
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,971
That was good, I believed that.

225
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:22,607
Okay, I'm just going to microwave it.

226
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:24,609
- Oh, no, no, no, no
- I don't think that's...

227
00:09:24,643 --> 00:09:27,479
That's probably not going
to be very appetizing.

228
00:09:27,513 --> 00:09:29,647
It's fine, we'll just put sauce on it.

229
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,783
How thick is the sauce?

230
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:34,076
Who are you wearing?

231
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:37,188
Oh, I don't know. [Chuckles]

232
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:38,656
I can check the label.

233
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:40,959
It doesn't matter.
I don't know designers.

234
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:43,328
- I'm Jerusha.
- Kelly.

235
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:45,463
I feel like I overdressed.

236
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:47,132
When I saw you across the room,

237
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,881
I thought you were a prostitute.

238
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:51,436
That's a compliment.

239
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,638
Oh, thank you.

240
00:09:53,672 --> 00:09:55,013
You're welcome.

241
00:09:57,243 --> 00:10:00,478
I'm going to make you...

242
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:01,746
a squirrel.

243
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,124
Some people think squirrels
are just rats, but they're not.

244
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:08,269
Ok...

245
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:11,173
It was nice talking to you.

246
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:14,192
The reception in this area is horrible.

247
00:10:14,226 --> 00:10:16,528
Must be the old magnet factory.

248
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:18,496
- Oh, okay.
- I hope everyone's hungry,

249
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:20,331
'cause the meat looks real meaty.

250
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,000
Hey, Amy, what's your Wi-Fi password?

251
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:23,201
Oh, um, I don't know it.

252
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:24,569
You don't know your own password?

253
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:26,671
No, because Adam made the password,

254
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:28,006
and I can't remember it,

255
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,507
and you have to have
a password to get online

256
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,176
to change the password,
and I don't have the password,

257
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,625
- so I can't do that.
- Ugh, you know what?

258
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,443
We should just all go to P.F.
Chang's and watch it there.

259
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:36,048
No, no, no!

260
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:37,515
No, then you're going to miss

261
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,918
all my snarky comments
about the dresses.

262
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:41,519
Oh, you mean when you say
the person just looks like

263
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:43,388
whatever fruit
the color of the dress is?

264
00:10:43,422 --> 00:10:45,723
Remember, last time, when
Natalie Portman looked like

265
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:47,091
a sexy banana, and I was like,

266
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:49,360
"Girl, go on with your banana self"?

267
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:53,231
- [laughs]
- [laughs] Let's go.

268
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:55,433
<i>♪ You can do it,
put your back into it. ♪</i>

269
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,669
<i>♪ You can do it,

270
00:10:57,703 --> 00:11:00,572
<i>♪ You can do it,

271
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:04,741
Wait. What... No, what is that?

272
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,068
- Hmm?
- What are you doing?

273
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:07,271
We got to go... right now. Sorry.

274
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:09,137
No, no, no, dinner's almost ready.

275
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:12,017
Oh, yeah, no, it's a great
Golden Globes party.

276
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:13,842
Thank you. And it's going
to be even better

277
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:15,644
when you get the food
and the Golden Globes on.

278
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:17,179
No, but once you leave,

279
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:18,981
then everyone else is going
to think it's okay to leave.

280
00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:21,850
Yeah, I know, but Jerusha
is ovulating right now.

281
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:24,286
Amy, I don't know how
many good eggs she has left,

282
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,552
you know, what, with her age
and all that line dancing.

283
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,210
I'm sorry.

284
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:30,252
No.

285
00:11:31,661 --> 00:11:32,560
Do it here.

286
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:35,087
- What?
- Do it here.

287
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:38,315
- I-I couldn't.
- Yes, you can. Why not?

288
00:11:38,316 --> 00:11:40,188
Please, Glenn, please.

289
00:11:40,903 --> 00:11:42,938
If you've ever cared about me ever,

290
00:11:42,972 --> 00:11:45,030
then go have sex on my bed...

291
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:51,980
As many times as you want.

292
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:54,016
[breathes heavily]

293
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:57,119
How about a game, huh?

294
00:11:57,153 --> 00:11:59,124
Who wants to play Crazy Scabies?

295
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:01,038
Floor Shorts?

296
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,624
I guess there is enough of us,

297
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:03,859
we could play Hassle the Fishmonger,

298
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:05,326
but we'd have to move the couch.

299
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:07,940
Yeah, no one's ever heard
of any of those games.

300
00:12:07,941 --> 00:12:09,969
Seriously? None of you?

301
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,825
Well, what did you do as kids

302
00:12:11,826 --> 00:12:13,820
when your mom was out
with the men from the bank?

303
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:17,053
Hey, guys, Kelly knows a game
that she can teach everybody.

304
00:12:18,244 --> 00:12:20,158
What we played at your sister's.

305
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:22,014
Oh, yeah.

306
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:24,591
Okay. [Chuckles]

307
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:29,338
All right, so the game
is called Answers.

308
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,598
And you can only ask questions,

309
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:34,323
or you can only reply with questions.

310
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:38,278
Now, if you answer a question
or you question an answer,

311
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,869
then you lose points.

312
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,930
And you can only make it
to the next round

313
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:45,200
once everybody has put
in their bid or an overture...

314
00:12:45,234 --> 00:12:46,083
You know what?

315
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:48,769
Actually, we could just maybe
start playing the game,

316
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,772
and everybody will get it as we go.

317
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:52,811
I'm already annoyed.
Is that part of the game?

318
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:54,683
Two points! [Chuckles]

319
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:59,089
Oh, boy, and now Elias gets three points

320
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:00,981
because he located the conductor!

321
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:02,208
I thought I was the conductor.

322
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:04,368
No, no! Ahh! You gave it away.

323
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,479
Oh, that was a secret?

324
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,152
Does anyone understand this game?

325
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,706
Two questions in a row,
I call Founder. Triple Bridge.

326
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,207
Jerry gets it.

327
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:13,243
Okay, but why am I holding
hands with Brett?

328
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:15,242
I don't know.
I didn't ask you to do that.

329
00:13:15,243 --> 00:13:16,913
This is fun. This game is fun.

330
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:19,015
This party is fun. Fun game, fun party.

331
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:22,151
Fun everything! Everything is fun now.

332
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:24,020
It's still fun, because
it was fun before.

333
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,755
We could still play Floor Shorts.

334
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:28,091
All I need is 14 pairs
of shorts and a 12-sided die.

335
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,260
Okay, I came here to watch the Globes,

336
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:33,396
not sit around starving in some
sad, divorced woman's house.

337
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,697
Brett, let go of my hand!

338
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,099
Guys, if we take off right now,

339
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:37,667
we can still get spots
at the Chang's bar

340
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:39,068
before the dads on dates get there.

341
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:41,771
- Thank you.
- No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

342
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:43,540
Emma's going to be here
in, like, five minutes.

343
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:44,874
She's going to fix the TV.

344
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,276
And also, the food's almost ready.

345
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,945
And the food is going
to be, like, so good.

346
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:50,880
Like, P.F. Chang's
"get out of here" good.

347
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,845
Chang's level? Come on, girl.

348
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:53,957
Nobody move!

349
00:13:54,652 --> 00:13:56,452
Sit the [bleep] down!

350
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:58,555
Garrett, wheel it back in!

351
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:01,436
Now, we all committed
to coming here and having fun!

352
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:03,526
So we are going to have fun!

353
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:07,260
Stop complaining, and start
enjoying yourselves right now!

354
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:10,788
It's a great time.

355
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,005
[thumping]

356
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:19,510
[rap music playing over car stereo]

357
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:21,676
[horn honks]

358
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:24,221
[crying] Just go around!

359
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:27,608
I'm trying to park my car.

360
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,311
I don't even care. I didn't
want to go to the party.

361
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:35,224
This is like a hostage situation.

362
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:37,260
I mean, we can't leave.
They're denying us food.

363
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,095
Not allowed to watch the Golden Globes.

364
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,797
I hope they're done
before Emma gets here.

365
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:42,799
Emma's not coming! She never was.

366
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,233
We're on our own.

367
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:46,002
Can someone please just start talking?

368
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:48,455
I don't care what it is...
it could be literally anything,

369
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:50,273
just as long as it's at a raised volume.

370
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,774
That would be ideal.

371
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:53,443
[thumping]

372
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:55,105
I met God.

373
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:59,341
- Okay.
- Black guy.

374
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,788
- [objects clattering]
- Okay.

375
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:08,625
Okay, that looks good, right?

376
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,593
- [shuddering] Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

377
00:15:10,628 --> 00:15:12,729
Oh, yeah.

378
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:15,932
- Voilà.
- Pulls it all together.

379
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:17,667
Yeah, that's what it needed.

380
00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:22,138
[Jerusha giggling]

381
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,641
Hey, gang. With Jerusha's help,

382
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,876
I was able to fix the broken table

383
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,558
in, um, the bedroom there.

384
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,949
It was broken.
It was the front left leg.

385
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:34,884
Yeah. It was a two-person job,

386
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:37,302
so the two... the two of us did it.

387
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,814
We did it, together.

388
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:42,614
It was a big solid oak leg.

389
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,451
So...

390
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:52,535
[upbeat rock music playing]

391
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:54,037
Father God, we thank You

392
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:56,005
for this meal we're about to enjoy.

393
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,149
We ask You to bless it with Your light.

394
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:01,711
Father God, we pray that all
our efforts are rewarded

395
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:06,165
and that this food replenishes
our spent and tired bodies.

396
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,351
- Amen
- Amen.

397
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,687
- Father God.
- That was beautiful, Jerusha!

398
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,255
Yeah, nice and tight.

399
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:16,526
Okay, great. Well, who is
ready for some B-B-Q?

400
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,862
All: Yeah... oh.

401
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,698
Don't be shy.
I know you guys are starving.

402
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,465
So dig in. Garrett?

403
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:26,864
Uh, what, me? Wow, thank you.

404
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:29,409
Um, I am so hungry, I am.

405
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,608
But I am going to start with the bread.

406
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:37,192
- This coleslaw looks yummy.
- Yeah, coleslaw, me too!

407
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:41,084
Great. Uh, meat, anyone?
Sandra, would you like a rib?

408
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:43,352
Um, brisket? Some...
bawk-bawk... chicken?

409
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:45,888
I filled up on water before I came.

410
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,590
Ugh, always do that.

411
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:49,192
Well, I can't wait,

412
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:52,695
because this is the best sauce
in all of St. Louis.

413
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,958
I was surprised they had any,
usually they're sold out, so...

414
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:57,708
Mmm!

415
00:16:59,837 --> 00:17:01,339
That sauce is...

416
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:05,291
The more you chew, the better it is.

417
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,283
Anybody want any meat?

418
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:11,505
Nobody? Really? Nobody?

419
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:12,927
Nobody wants meat?

420
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:14,926
I'll take some.

421
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:15,810
Aren't you vegan?

422
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:18,066
Uh, yeah, just for, like, 20 years.

423
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,053
But when I see meat
that looks that delicious,

424
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:22,952
I have to make an exception.

425
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:24,941
No, Dina, you don't have to eat that.

426
00:17:24,942 --> 00:17:27,430
- Ugh.
- Oh, yeah.

427
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,332
I guess this is what
he used to stand on.

428
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:31,439
They just took off the little foot.

429
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:34,049
I'm going to eat a bird now.

430
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:36,857
I'm going to eat a bird now.

431
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:39,921
I'm gonna...

432
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:41,934
[all groan]

433
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,255
Wow, but is it worth it for that taste!

434
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:50,018
[pained laughter] Yum!

435
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,345
- [toilet flushing]
- Dina?

436
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:55,401
- Are you okay in there?
- I'm fine!

437
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:59,418
Just, um, save some of that sinewy meat,

438
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:02,073
'cause I'm going to want round two.

439
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:03,507
[sighs]

440
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:07,711
[sighs] Guys, look,
this party is a bust.

441
00:18:07,746 --> 00:18:11,782
You guys were right.
My... my life is... is in shambles.

442
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:13,617
Aw, sweetie.

443
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:14,869
Of course it is.

444
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,221
Hey, come on, y-you're overreacting.

445
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:19,594
So dinner was a little messed up,

446
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:21,119
and the TV doesn't work.

447
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,893
At a party where the two
things you're supposed to do

448
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:24,295
is eat dinner and watch TV.

449
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:25,729
Okay, yeah, but, you know,

450
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:28,723
it's not like somebody
died or something.

451
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:30,735
That's how you judge
the success of a party...

452
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:31,735
no fatalities.

453
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,371
Two people died at my prom.
We had it on a boat.

454
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:35,873
It was really sad.

455
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,842
And yet you kept the dress.

456
00:18:37,876 --> 00:18:38,909
[exhales sharply]

457
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:40,653
Just give yourself a break.

458
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:43,080
You've never been on your own before.

459
00:18:43,114 --> 00:18:45,015
It takes some getting used to.

460
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,130
Yeah, it's like,

461
00:18:46,131 --> 00:18:48,419
Jerry basically had
to relearn everything.

462
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:50,560
He thought it would
never get any better,

463
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:53,824
but he already knows the
difference between wet and dry.

464
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:56,360
[gasps] See? You're going
to be just fine.

465
00:18:56,394 --> 00:18:58,762
A woman from my church got divorced

466
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:00,731
because she married a man from Facebook.

467
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,215
It turns out he was already married

468
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:06,403
to several other women
and one man from Singapore.

469
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,439
Took all her money.
It was on "Dateline."

470
00:19:08,473 --> 00:19:11,208
At least you're not on "Dateline."

471
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:12,543
[sighs] Yeah.

472
00:19:12,577 --> 00:19:13,611
Hey, Amy.

473
00:19:14,263 --> 00:19:16,947
I'd say something supportive
'cause you're my friend,

474
00:19:16,982 --> 00:19:18,282
but that's not what I do.

475
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:19,479
I understand.

476
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:23,120
- Bye.
- Bye.

477
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:25,556
- Sorry about the... everything.
- It's...

478
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,124
Thank you for having us.

479
00:19:27,158 --> 00:19:28,692
We're going to wash your sheets.

480
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:31,295
It's just something
we like to do after parties.

481
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:33,297
- Keep them.
- [giggles]

482
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:36,200
[sighs] Do you want to go to Chang's?

483
00:19:36,234 --> 00:19:37,902
We can watch the losers
give drunken interviews

484
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:38,969
at the after-parties.

485
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:40,887
Mm. Want to come?

486
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:43,563
Kelly, you want to come?

487
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,144
Oh, I thought you were... Am I invited?

488
00:19:47,178 --> 00:19:50,614
Yeah, that's why I said,
"Kelly, you want to come?"

489
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:53,150
I would love that. Thanks.

490
00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:55,452
Uh, hey...

491
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,321
[clears throat] You guys want
to hit up Chang's?

492
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:59,723
The whole gang's going.
You feel like coming?

493
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:07,097
Oh, um, no, I-I got
a lot of meat to eat,

494
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:10,000
and, I, um... I got to clean up and...

495
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:11,468
- You sure?
- Yeah.

496
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:14,838
Um, pro tip... throw the microwave away.

497
00:20:14,873 --> 00:20:18,309
Yeah, I'm thinking
I'm just going to move.

498
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:21,145
[laughs] We should do this more often.

499
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,081
Yeah, next weekend, same chicken.

500
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:25,916
- Hey.
- Hi.

501
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:28,786
Garrett was like, "Kelly, you coming?"

502
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,591
- Oh, see? Scrappy Doo!
- [laughs]

511
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:57,824
Did you take a shower?

512
00:20:57,825 --> 00:21:00,672
Oh, trust me, you would not
have wanted me to take a bath.

519

00:21:18,324 --> 00:21:20,892
also some tops.

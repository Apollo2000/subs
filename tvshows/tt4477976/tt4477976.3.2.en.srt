D-Did Brett like Radiohead?

7
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,995
No, it's just the only song she knows.

8
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:32,445
- Her YouTube channel is so sad.
- ♪ I don't belong... ♪

10

Thank you, Sandra. That was... lovely.

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,092
We're gathered here today
to honor our dear friend

12
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:49,062
and co-worker Brett Kobashigawa.

13
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,533
He died doing what he loved
most... collecting carts.

14
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:54,500
We do not know he's dead!

15
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:56,369
- Glenn.
- They did not find a body.

16
00:00:56,438 --> 00:00:57,489
They found a foot.

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,272
Maybe it's somebody else's foot.

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,075
All we know is that
Brett was in the parking lot

19
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:04,710
collecting carts when the tornado hit.

20
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:07,346
And that no one has seen
or heard from him since.

21
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,682
- And the foot...
- Stop with the foot.

22
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:12,452
- We have addressed the foot.
- I agree with Glenn.

23
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,120
Brett wasn't killed by that tornado.

24
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:15,621
Thank you, Dina.

25
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,457
What usually happens is
all the air is sucked

26
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:19,158
from your lungs and then they
fill up with blood,

27
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:21,594
so, technically, he probably
drowned on his own blood.

28
00:01:22,497 --> 00:01:25,198
Why didn't we know about
Brett's death sooner?

29
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:27,066
Apparently someone
was clocking in for him.

30
00:01:27,135 --> 00:01:28,768
Guys, this is one of the reasons

31
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:31,137
that clock-in buddies is a bad idea.

32
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:33,174
Also, it could've been
blunt force trauma.

33
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:35,436
I mean, at those wind speeds,
even a coffee mug

34
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:37,238
could blow your chest plate wide open.

35
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:41,008
At any rate, we hereby
dedicate this bench to Brett,

36
00:01:41,077 --> 00:01:43,310
where he used to sit on his flip phone

37
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:45,479
and argue with his wife for hours.

38
00:01:45,548 --> 00:01:47,214
Yeah, now might not be the best time,

39
00:01:47,283 --> 00:01:49,183
but if anybody still hasn't
chipped in for the plaque,

40
00:01:49,252 --> 00:01:50,751
it's $6.83 each, so...

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,153
Just, you know, get it
to me when you can.

42
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:55,623
His body isn't even cold yet, Jonah.

43
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:58,559
Because he's probably still alive,

44
00:01:59,214 --> 00:02:02,467
basking on some beach
in the Mediterranean.

45
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:04,398
Yeah, just waiting for his
foot stump to heal.

46
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,191
Could've been impaled by a curtain rod.

47
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,659
I mean, for all we know,
he could be one of

48
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,194
several people on the same rod.

49
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:13,097
Hopefully, for his sake,
he was on one of the ends.

50
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,499
Okay, Sandra, how about another song?

51
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,536
Oh. Okay, uh, it's not a song,

52
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:21,105
but I-I did learn a new chord.

53
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,004
Nope, no... that's not it.

54
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:27,150
Nope.

55
00:02:28,712 --> 00:02:31,892
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

56
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:38,622
So that was a... Cloud 9 funeral.

57
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,039
Yep, there was way more fanfare

58
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,460
when Deborah got hit by a forklift.

59
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,507
Sorry I missed that.

60
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:47,932
You know, Brett's actually
the first person

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,667
I ever knew who died.

62
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:50,734
Really?

63
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,303
What about, like, your grandparents?

64
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:54,696
Nope. All still alive and healthy.

65
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,674
My Pop-pop can run an eight-minute mile.

66
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:58,922
That's a weird thing to brag about.

67
00:02:58,991 --> 00:03:01,424
I'm just saying. It's pretty fast.

68
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:02,926
I go to, like, three funerals a year.

69
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:04,661
It's a good excuse to see family.

70
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,329
I don't even know anybody
who's ever been in, like,

71
00:03:06,398 --> 00:03:07,564
a major accident.

72
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:08,965
Also a weird thing to brag about.

73
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:10,934
Except for Garrett, maybe.

74
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:15,633
That was an accident, right?
He was... how, uh...

75
00:03:15,874 --> 00:03:17,607
Huh. I don't know.

76
00:03:17,676 --> 00:03:18,991
Me neither.

77
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,311
- I feel like I should know that.
- Why?

78
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,447
Because he's, you know,
one of my best friends.

79
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:26,016
And my roommate.

80
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:28,785
We're definitely close
enough for me to know.

81
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:30,387
We pee with the doors open.

82
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:32,222
I don't pee in front of anyone.

83
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,004
Well then, I guess you
don't have any best friends.

84
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:41,131
Oww!

85
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,958
Ohh! These things are impossible.

86
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,771
Yeah, and who is gonna steal

87
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:47,622
a "Matrix 2" and "3" box set?

88
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,690
Okay, I can't, I can't...

89
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,859
- This is blood. I'm bleeding.
- Where?

90
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:53,761
Hey, you two. How's it going?

91
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,663
Ugh. Pretty sucky.

92
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:57,465
Because of Brett?

93
00:03:57,922 --> 00:03:59,133
Huh?

94
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:02,503
I think it's very, very likely
that he is still alive.

95
00:04:02,572 --> 00:04:06,541
But if you two are upset about
his disappearance,

96
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:08,743
then you can take a break for a while.

97
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:10,511
Oh, no, that's okay, we don't...

98
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,146
Thank you, Glenn.

99
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:15,917
We, um, we could really use
a chance to sit and reflect.

100
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:18,886
You know, Brett was like
a father to me, so...

101
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:23,157
Yeah, and he was... he was like
a grandfather to me.

102
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:29,163
Uh, I'm young enough that he was
also like a grandfather to me.

103
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:30,765
I had no idea.

104
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:34,368
Well, you two take as
long as you need, okay?

105
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,636
You know, a book of Matthew says,

106
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:38,438
"Blessed are those who mourn..."

107
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:41,408
Glenn, we're gonna mourn in our own way.

108
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:43,577
Yeah.

109
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:45,345
Nice.

110
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:50,283
Hey, Dina, Justine's
complaining about an odor

111
00:04:50,352 --> 00:04:51,885
in the women's room again.

112
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:54,839
She's describing it as
a liquid raccoon smell.

113
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,724
Hey, Dina. You okay?

114
00:04:57,793 --> 00:05:00,504
What? Yeah, sorry, I just

115
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,828
haven't really been sleeping lately.

116
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:04,242
You know,
weather's getting worse.

117
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:05,917
I'm starting to think
we should get everyone

118
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:07,519
into the new storm shelter.

119
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:09,817
Uh, I don't think
that's necessary.

120
00:05:09,818 --> 00:05:11,057
It's just a rainstorm.

121
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,800
Tell that to Brett. Oh, wait, you can't.

122
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:16,294
'Cause he's smeared
all over the Midwest.

123
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:32,044
I get that it's weird
for a dude to say this,

124
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:33,712
but I'm gonna miss Brett's laugh.

125
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:36,782
Me too, me too. Hey, man, uh,
let me ask you something.

126
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,703
How...

127
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,687
How, uh... How did, how were you...

128
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:44,701
I'm sorry. What?

129
00:05:44,702 --> 00:05:46,391
No, it's just... wh... did... did...

130
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,294
Were you always...
Did... because I don't...

131
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:51,263
Oh, look! Look at that!
That's Amy. Hey, Amy.

132
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:55,275
Hey. Have you guys noticed
anything weird about Dina?

133
00:05:57,604 --> 00:05:58,904
Well, Dina's her own thing.

134
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:00,872
We've had sex in three different houses,

135
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:02,941
and I'm not totally sure
any of them were hers.

136
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,578
Okay. I mean, not normal
Dina-weirdness, like,

137
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:07,979
something's off.

138
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:10,515
I don't know. I mean,
maybe she's just...

139
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:12,818
Oh! See?

140
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:19,491
Attention... all customers and
employees to the storm shelter.

141
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,860
Now, people! Let's go!

142
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:24,563
Ugh! Move, grandpa!

143
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:28,121
Oh, she's picking that lady up.

144
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,778
Again, I'm so sorry for the false alarm.

145
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,913
There's no tornado.
You're free to leave.

146
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,915
Now, better safe than sorry,
so no apologies.

147
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,585
Yes, but, well, we are apologizing.

148
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:46,420
I am absolutely not apologizing.

149
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,422
- Well, some people should be.
- Well, some people

150
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,890
should shut their damn yaps.

151
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,360
Anyway, as a thank you,
please enjoy a coupon

152
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:55,896
for 50 cents off frozen
yogurt in the café.

153
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:58,319
We could only find ten.

154
00:06:58,406 --> 00:07:01,307
So... get them while they're hot.

155
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:03,237
Thank you.

156
00:07:05,377 --> 00:07:07,408
Give one to her.
Dina was really rough with her.

157
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:25,759
Hey, Myrtle, you've been
here a long time, right?

158
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,893
Since 1987.

159
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,329
Oh, yeah, so you were here, then,

160
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:31,365
when Garrett first started...

161
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:34,284
The Cards were in the World Series.

162
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:38,005
I was having an affair with Ozzie Smith.

163
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:40,861
The Wizard, we used to call him.

164
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,963
Wow, no kidding. So...

165
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:45,895
Turns out it wasn't really Ozzie.

166
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:48,335
He was a waiter at Beffa's,

167
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:51,939
which was a popular
establishment back then.

168
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:54,007
Beffa's? Never heard of it.

169
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:58,946
I once saw Al Wiman having
a roast beef sandwich there.

170
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:03,483
Well, he ordered it.
I don't recall if he ate it.

171
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:04,851
That's a really good story.

172
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,554
- Um, Myrtle, when...
- Back then,

173
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:10,190
people were tougher than they are now.

174
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,527
You can't even call someone a [bleep]

175
00:08:13,596 --> 00:08:15,662
Even if they're being one.

176
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:18,772
Which reminds me of a story...

177
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,569
I once had a sister-in-law
who really was [bleep],

178
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:24,538
and she was adorable.

179
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:27,736
I finally get to catch up
on Kylie Jenner's Insta.

180
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:29,737
Man, she does sponsored
posts in a way that

181
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:32,072
make you really believe
that she loves the product.

182
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:34,074
I know. It's beautiful.

183
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:36,744
How's it going, you two?

184
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:39,113
Oh, uh... comes in waves.

185
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:42,883
One second I'm, like, "Huh?"
And the next I'm, like, "Huh."

186
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:44,852
Well, you know,
I'm still holding out hope

187
00:08:44,921 --> 00:08:46,754
that Brett's alive.

188
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:48,689
Even with the foot?

189
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:51,725
I don't wanna
re-litigate the foot, but...

190
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:54,765
I did wanna write a Brett tribute

191
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,664
for the newsletter...
you know, just in case.

192
00:08:56,727 --> 00:09:01,100
And you guys knew him so well
I thought maybe you could help.

193
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:04,672
Of course. I mean,
we would love to honor him.

194
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:07,174
So what was his wife's name?

195
00:09:07,818 --> 00:09:08,642
Um...

196
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:10,244
- Cinnamon.
- Margaret.

197
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:11,445
Cinnamon Margaret?

198
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:12,746
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

199
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:15,557
Uh-huh. That is... what we said.

200
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:19,106
Okay, uh, I also wanna
include a funny story.

201
00:09:19,723 --> 00:09:20,354
Well...

202
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:24,091
We obviously have... so many of those.

203
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,326
Obviously.

204
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:27,294
- From real life.
- Mm-hmm.

205
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:30,364
Great. Okay.

206
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:33,407
Cheyenne, what's your favorite?

207
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:38,251
Just a heads-up, we're gonna need to do

208
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:39,819
a full restock of the jerky.

209
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:41,087
I'm taking this down
to the storm shelter.

210
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:42,622
Oh, do we need that much?

211
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,257
Tornadoes last, like, 15 minutes.

212
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:46,125
Uh, what if the roof caves in?

213
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:48,661
Sorry, everybody. Looks like
we're gonna starve down here

214
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,064
because Amy thought we'd only
be trapped for 15 minutes.

215
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,566
Uh, Dina? That seems a little dramatic.

216
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,902
"Okay, uh, Dina?
That seems a little dramatic."

217
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,470
Look, I don't have time
to roast you, okay?

218
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,839
I still need sun lamps,
mylar blankets...

219
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:01,974
Are you maybe going through anything

220
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:03,810
you wanna talk about, or...

221
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:05,678
Okay, I need to have games for morale.

222
00:10:05,747 --> 00:10:07,513
Chess, Scrabble, Uno for the dummies.

223
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:10,349
Okay, Dina? I'm worried about you.

224
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:12,752
- As a friend.
- You wanna be a friend?

225
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,554
Go freeze a couple
hundred pounds of chard.

226
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:16,322
I'm not doing that.

227
00:10:17,002 --> 00:10:17,757
Fine.

228
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,460
Guess we won't have chard.

229
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:33,539
Okay. Thank you.

230
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:35,872
Hey, Sandra, how's it going?

231
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:38,244
I just found out Jerry's
feeding tube got infected and...

232
00:10:38,313 --> 00:10:39,545
Ah, same here.

233
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:41,027
So let me ask you a question,

234
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:43,199
but don't tell Garrett.

235
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:44,869
- Okay.
- Okay.

236
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,278
Has he ever told you how
he ended up in a wheelchair?

237
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:51,474
Um... let me think.

238
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:52,767
Hey, what's up, guys?

239
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:53,188
Hey.

240
00:10:53,805 --> 00:10:55,071
Hey! What's going on?

241
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,572
What you guys talking about?

242
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:57,707
Nothing.

243
00:10:57,776 --> 00:10:59,108
Nothing?

244
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:01,577
So you guys are just in the hallway

245
00:11:01,646 --> 00:11:04,814
staring at each other saying nothing?

246
00:11:04,883 --> 00:11:06,682
Well, not nothing. I mean, we were...

247
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:07,984
we were talking about...

248
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:10,160
Jonah's going to a barbecue,

249
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:11,760
and he asked if it'd be interesting

250
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:14,296
to put burrata on a burger
instead of provolone.

251
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:16,965
And I said, "Who uses provolone?"

252
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:21,136
And he was laughing,
and then I started laughing.

253
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:24,540
And then he asked,
"Are burgers cliché in general?"

254
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:27,976
And I said, "No, not
if you use venison."

255
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:29,511
But then you said,

256
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,481
"Venison does not
pair with burrata," so...

257
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,571
here we are.

258
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,545
Yeah. A-and then you...

259
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:38,380
- and then you came up.
- Mm-hmm.

260
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:41,483
- So...
- Well, I'm sorry I asked.

261
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:44,286
- Okay.
- I-I'll see you around.

262
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:45,788
Mm.

263
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:48,257
Wow, you are an incredible liar.

264
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:49,242
Thank you.

265
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:56,732
Swam up the Panama Canal.

266
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:59,568
Hey, how long was he
a cowboy trick rider for?

267
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:03,739
Well, he was in the circuit
for a number of years

268
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,498
with his horse named...

269
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:09,445
Cloud Tie.

270
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,243
- Cloud Tie.
- Yeah.

271
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:13,949
And, uh, then he joined the Marines.

272
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:17,019
He was in the... Blue Shirt Division.

273
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:19,888
- Okay.
- At the battle of, uh...

274
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:22,424
- Khaki Pants.
- Yep.

275
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,293
Like it sounds?

276
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:25,661
Mm-hmm.

277
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,465
K-H... K... A-K-I.

278
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,734
I just think that the tornado
and this Brett stuff

279
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:33,402
is really affecting you.

280
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:34,970
How many iodine tablets
to sterilize urine?

281
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,739
Is it two or three?
I really couldn't say.

282
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:38,340
Maybe err on the side of caution.

283
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:41,310
Are you okay?
'Cause you seem a little manic.

284
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:43,274
Is this your thing? Do you like to

285
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:45,243
just follow people
and tell them everything

286
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:47,045
you think is wrong with them?
'Cause I could do that too.

287
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:49,480
- No, that's not...
- Hair. Chin. Shrimpy build.

288
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:51,182
Boobs. Well, left boob.

289
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,419
I'm willing to ignore that
because I know you're lashing out.

290
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:56,208
- Ankles.
- I have joint inflammation!

291
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,806
- You need to get help!
- I'm fine!

292
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:02,056
Sorry.

293
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:02,780
Dina?

294
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:06,096
I think there's something
wrong with Dina.

295
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:08,265
Heck, yeah, there is.

296
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:09,924
No, Glenn. It wasn't a diss.

297
00:13:11,117 --> 00:13:12,316
Okay.

298
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:14,989
Good burn! That was fun.

299
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:16,724
Hey, let's do Elias now...

300
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:19,760
Glenn, I think the tornado
really affected her.

301
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:21,996
I don't know if this is a
workman's comp type of thing,

302
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:23,297
but she needs to talk to someone.

303
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:25,299
Oh, Lisa's a good listener.

304
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:27,768
I was thinking like a professional.

305
00:13:27,837 --> 00:13:30,771
Ohh! Okay.

306
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,608
Now, we don't have a binder
on dealing with tornadoes,

307
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:35,943
but I did find one
on workplace shootings

308
00:13:36,012 --> 00:13:37,778
that I think I can make work.

309
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:40,915
The tornado was like two months ago.

310
00:13:40,984 --> 00:13:42,216
We're over it.

311
00:13:42,285 --> 00:13:44,051
Well, maybe you are.

312
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,688
But maybe there's someone else
who's having trouble coping.

313
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:49,590
- Who is it?
- It doesn't matter.

314
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:50,781
- Is it Sandra?
- Nope.

315
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:52,293
- Is it Dina?
- I'm not gonna say.

316
00:13:52,362 --> 00:13:53,895
- Carol.
- No!

317
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:55,296
- Thanks, Ames.
- I'm sorry.

318
00:13:55,365 --> 00:13:57,031
This is not what I had in mind.

319
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,733
"If you're reading this,
then your branch

320
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:01,736
has been the victim
of a workplace... tornado.

321
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:04,516
Workplace tornados
are a growing epidemic

322
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:07,362
that we need to face while
still respecting the right

323
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:10,845
of every American to own tornados."

324
00:14:10,914 --> 00:14:11,879
It's good.

325
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:25,793
"Many tornado victims describe worrying

326
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:27,695
that behind every hallway,

327
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:30,998
there's a lone tornado
waiting to tornado them."

328
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:32,266
This is waste of time.

329
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:34,302
Look, Dina. I just think

330
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,104
that you're holding in
a lot of pent-up emotion

331
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:39,140
and that it's good
to talk about these things.

332
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,775
I learned that in couples therapy.

333
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:42,677
Oh, and that worked out
great for you, didn't it?

334
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:43,978
Dina, that didn't

335
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:45,646
work out for them, though, actually.

336
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:47,781
- They're getting a divorce.
- I know.

337
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:48,982
You know, there's no shame

338
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,516
in admitting you're having a tough time

339
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:51,751
dealing with something, okay?

340
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,466
In college, I discovered that my dad

341
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:56,867
was having an affair on Parents Weekend.

342
00:14:56,936 --> 00:14:58,369
Try enjoying "Stomp" after that.

343
00:14:58,437 --> 00:15:00,171
Ugh, that's your trauma?

344
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:02,473
I watched my brother drown
in the South China Sea.

345
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:04,942
Well, it's not a contest.

346
00:15:05,011 --> 00:15:06,343
Well, if it was, you'd lose.

347
00:15:06,412 --> 00:15:08,212
I went to the movie "Saw"

348
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:10,080
thinking it was about carpentry.

349
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:11,482
It is not!

350
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:13,484
I threw up in my lap.

351
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:16,320
And then Jerusha made us stay
because it was our date night

352
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:18,122
and the tickets were non-refundable.

353
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:19,723
Okay, there's a lot to unpack there,

354
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:22,126
but let's circle back to Dina.

355
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:24,895
I once got caught trying to run

356
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:27,464
a badger game in Kansas City.

357
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:30,834
Ha. I had to cut my way out.

358
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,279
Thank you, Cheyenne, for taking us

359
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:44,281
through your visit to Cancun, but...

360
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,151
I'm not clear...
what was traumatic about it?

361
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,520
Nothing. It was awesome.

362
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:52,823
Great. Okay, uh, well,
who hasn't shared yet?

363
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:55,226
- Uh, Garrett hasn't.
- Oh. Garrett?

364
00:15:55,294 --> 00:15:57,828
Oh, no, I've lived a blessed life.

365
00:15:57,897 --> 00:15:59,330
I have something.

366
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:01,365
My first apartment
was in a pet cemetery...

367
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:03,801
You're saying nothing traumatic

368
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:05,469
has ever happened to you?

369
00:16:05,538 --> 00:16:09,206
'Cause, you know,
this... this is a safe space.

370
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:11,800
Well, when I was a kid,

371
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:13,244
I was really into horseback riding.

372
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:14,945
I was good at it too.

373
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:17,381
Until Chestnut bucked me
going over a hurdle

374
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,949
and I landed on my neck.

375
00:16:20,024 --> 00:16:22,219
Doc said I was lucky to walk away.

376
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:24,888
But I came in last place, so...

377
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:27,825
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, that sounds bad.

378
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:30,194
Are you kidding?
That's, like, nothing.

379
00:16:30,263 --> 00:16:31,829
My worse trauma was when Sandra

380
00:16:31,897 --> 00:16:34,098
tried to murder me during a tornado.

381
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,620
I didn't try to murder you.

382
00:16:36,469 --> 00:16:38,369
I just didn't try to save you.

383
00:16:38,437 --> 00:16:41,090
I love your friendship. Frick and Frack.

384
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:42,873
You know, this...
right here, right now...

385
00:16:42,942 --> 00:16:45,809
- this is my greatest trauma.
- Glenn, let's wrap this up.

386
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:47,511
- Yeah. I'm out of here.
- No, Dina...

387
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,977
Look. Listen. I get it.

388
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:50,344
You want me to suddenly get in touch

389
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:52,483
with some deep, dark
emotions, but guess what.

390
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:54,451
I don't have time
to whine about my issues,

391
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,220
and frankly, I am sick of listening

392
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,788
to all you people whine about yours.

393
00:16:57,857 --> 00:16:59,056
Get off me!

394
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,257
Move, Brett!

395
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:09,262
So, apparently when the
tornado was coming,

396
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:11,808
Brett was able to run
and make it to his car.

397
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:14,685
And then his car got
swallowed up by the tornado?

398
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:17,085
- No, he just drove home.
- Oh.

399
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:18,887
And then we emailed the wrong Brett,

400
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,923
so we never knew
he was scheduled to work.

401
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:23,425
Well, I knew he wasn't dead.

402
00:17:23,494 --> 00:17:25,494
Yeah. I guess you were right.

403
00:17:25,563 --> 00:17:27,396
Though, just between you and me,

404
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:29,314
I thought he was dead for sure.

405
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:32,447
But now look at him. God bless.

406
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:34,204
Hanging out with his best friends.

407
00:17:34,905 --> 00:17:37,072
Oh. Never knew they were friends.

408
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:39,208
You sure are bagging those groceries.

409
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:42,411
Oh. I thought you had
a spider on your shoulder.

410
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,446
Oops. Oh. Got it. There it is.

411
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:45,714
There it is.

412
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:47,182
Is Glenn still watching?

413
00:17:47,251 --> 00:17:48,517
Yep.

414
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:49,518
Okay.

415
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:54,131
Wait. Oh, my God. Whose foot was that?

416
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:59,695
Hey, man. I'ma take off early.

417
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:02,431
I, uh... saw a motorcycle
in the parking lot

418
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,969
and it's the same motorcycle
that I was riding the night...

419
00:18:07,037 --> 00:18:08,704
- it all went down.
- Okay, all right.

420
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:10,606
Okay, okay, I get it.
You're messing with me.

421
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,040
You can stop now.

422
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:13,609
Cool.

423
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:14,943
Hey, just an FYI.

424
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,112
I wasn't trying to be nosy. I just...

425
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:20,048
I thought it would be cool
to know you better. That's all.

426
00:18:20,117 --> 00:18:22,384
You know, you're my roommate,
and you're my best friend, and...

427
00:18:22,453 --> 00:18:24,653
Okay. First of all,
I don't need a best friend.

428
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:25,930
I'm an adult.

429
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:27,360
And if I did have a best friend,

430
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:29,157
it would be my boy Randy Mendoza.

431
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:31,068
We've known each other
since the second grade.

432
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,098
Always about Randy...

433
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:34,963
Look. What if I told you
I got shot in Iraq?

434
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,332
Or got drunk and hit a bus full of nuns?

435
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:38,528
Is this also in Iraq?

436
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:41,196
Whatever it is, it's
gonna put me in a box.

437
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:42,848
And I don't want that.

438
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:46,318
Understood.

439
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:50,723
Hey. D... um... does Randy know?

440
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,591
Of course. He's my best friend.

441
00:18:54,495 --> 00:18:56,095
That's messed up.

442
00:18:58,432 --> 00:18:59,836
Wow.

443
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:03,402
Really got everything in here, huh?

444
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:06,105
Beef jerky...

445
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:07,546
beans...

446
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:10,008
pornography?

447
00:19:10,668 --> 00:19:12,177
People are gonna need a release, Amy.

448
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:14,480
It could be hours down here.

449
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:17,783
Look, you know Brett is alive, right?

450
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:20,352
No one died. It's all okay.

451
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:23,188
So, we can just head out.

452
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:24,623
I'm not leaving.

453
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:31,663
You cannot... stay... down here!

454
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:33,284
Are you being serious right now?

455
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:34,744
Oh, God.

456
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:37,336
Okay, you know what?

457
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:39,805
Fine. I get it. You don't want my help.

458
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:42,708
I give up. I'm giving up.

459
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:43,636
Great.

460
00:19:44,862 --> 00:19:49,381
Oh, it's just getting sad at this point.

461
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,890
You're so tiny!

462
00:19:51,552 --> 00:19:53,652
Look, you know what?

463
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:55,687
Just for that, you don't
get a space in the shelter.

464
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:57,723
Oh, I'm so sad that I don't get a spot

465
00:19:57,792 --> 00:19:59,391
in your little masturbation jail.

466
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,493
All jails are masturbation jails.

467
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:02,828
Look, things happen, okay?

468
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:04,530
You can't be prepared for everything.

469
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:05,664
No, you can't prepare for everything,

470
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:08,037
but I can and I always do.

471
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:15,674
- Dina...
- Forget it.

472
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,242
You don't wanna hear about my problems.

473
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:18,716
No, I-I do.

474
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:21,213
Of course I do.

475
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:22,848
Really?

476
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,250
I couldn't sleep or eat,

477
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,688
so I just watched old VHS tapes
of the 1994 Winter Olympics.

478
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:33,559
I'm Team Tanya all the way,
you know?

479
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:35,160
- Mm.
- I'm pretty sure

480
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:38,230
Nancy Kerrigan
hit herself in the leg.

481
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:42,067
Nobody tells you at six
that a dog can't eat chocolate.

482
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:43,936
Oh, wow. We're going
back to the beginning.

483
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:45,671
Okay.

484
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:47,448
And for the rest of camp,

485
00:20:48,175 --> 00:20:51,009
all the kids called me "Bagel Boobs."

486
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:56,281
I just feel like this feeling
is gonna last forever.

487
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,532
I know. With Adam gone,

488
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:00,099
I'm on my own for the first time,

489
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:01,600
and I'm just... I'm terrified.

490
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:03,434
Maybe don't make this
about you right now.

491
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:05,516
Yeah. No. Sorry. You go, you go.

492
00:21:05,623 --> 00:21:07,056
- You go.
- Okay.

493
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:09,182
So I think we got up
to my tenth birthday?

494
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:10,702
Mm-hmm. We're at ten.

495
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:15,214
It's about to get really bad.

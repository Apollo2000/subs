00:00:00,531 --> 00:00:01,999
We found him this morning.

2
00:00:02,081 --> 00:00:03,869
Looks like he used to work here.

3
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:06,819
We were opening up the drywall,
and Gary saw the arm.

4
00:00:07,017 --> 00:00:08,115
I was like, "What?"

5
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:10,548
No way, Gary. That's not a dead body."

6
00:00:11,074 --> 00:00:12,611
Then Gary showed it to me.

7
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:15,080
Turns out, it was a dead body.

8
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:17,509
Who are you? Beyoncé?

9
00:00:17,886 --> 00:00:19,064
Selena.

10
00:00:19,298 --> 00:00:20,845
- Who?
- Selena.

11
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:23,681
She was Beyoncé before Beyoncé.

12
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,908
I thought you were J.Lo.

13
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:28,908
Mm, no.

So, unfortunately,
the body we found

16
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:38,619
was one of our employees.

17
00:00:39,468 --> 00:00:41,071
Salvatore Kazlauskas.

18
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:43,259
Wait, you mean Creepy Sal?

19
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:45,290
The man is dead.

20
00:00:45,692 --> 00:00:46,857
But yeah.

21
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:48,681
- Oh.
- Phew.

22
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,900
Police said he's been dead
for at least a year.

23
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:53,108
Are you crying?

24
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,369
Yeah, I just...

25
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:55,947
Poor guy.

26
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:57,619
But you didn't know him.

27
00:00:57,705 --> 00:00:59,309
But he was a human being.

28
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:00,955
Ehh.

29
00:01:01,135 --> 00:01:02,968
Sal was a bit of a...

30
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,357
How do I put it?

31
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:07,283
When he looked at you,
it felt like he was grabbing you.

32
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:10,689
Apparently he was doing
some work behind the drywall

33
00:01:10,747 --> 00:01:13,295
outside the women's washroom
and then his foot got caught

34
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:15,330
in a beam, and he starved to death.

35
00:01:15,462 --> 00:01:18,968
I'm sorry,
what "work" was he doing exactly?

36
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:20,415
We're not sure.

37
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:23,322
He drilled a hole into
the women's washroom so...

38
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,244
maybe he was hanging a picture?

39
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,872
Dude.

40
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:28,594
He was peeping on women
going to the potty.

41
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:29,697
- What?
- Ew.

42
00:01:29,837 --> 00:01:30,876
Why?

43
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:32,187
Well, that explains
the rotting smell

44
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:33,512
in the women's bathroom.

45
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:35,014
I know we all assumed
that was Amy.

46

I'm sure there's a lot
of churn going on in there.

50
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:43,217
- I have no churn.
- And anyway, um,

51
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:45,514
everyone make sure that
you don't disturb the body

Technically we've all been working next
Sal's dead body for the past year.

58

Nobody complained until now.

Oh, it just occurred to me.

60
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:02,275
That must've been Sal's foot
we found.

61
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:03,572
- Oh.
- No, no.

62
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,421
Actually he still had
both of his feet.

63

00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:30,941
Well, you swiped right.

167
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,172
No, I didn't.

168
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,323
I swiped left, like this.

169
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,456
Oh, yeah, you got
a little right to your swipe.

170
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,464
- Well, how do I cancel it?
- You can't.

171
00:05:38,597 --> 00:05:39,682
What do you mean I can't?

172
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:41,480
She's gonna think
Jonah matched her.

173
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:42,680
You know what it is?

174
00:05:42,738 --> 00:05:45,503
It's like eating a birthday candle,
only in a good way.

175
00:05:45,573 --> 00:05:46,844
Garrett, what do I do?

176
00:05:46,902 --> 00:05:48,198
I don't know, be honest.

177
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,832
Tell her you stole Jonah's phone,
and you were stalking her on it.

178
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:51,899
Okay, that's not gonna happen.

179
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:53,087
I was thinking more like,

180
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:54,503
I could sneak up like a ninja,

181
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:56,406
take her phone,
cancel the notification,

182
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:58,081
and then slip it in
without her noticing.

183
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,089
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm.

184
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,187
Or...

185
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:02,796
I know this guy
who works at the NSA.

186
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:04,277
He kind of owes me a favor.

187
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:05,700
I could call him up,

188
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,433
have him hack into Kelly's phone,

189
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:08,628
and melt her motherboard.

190
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,636
Yes, call the guy.

191
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,284
I'm messing with you.

192
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:13,564
How is that helpful?

193
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:15,323
I wasn't trying to be helpful.

They're all the same.

Oh, come on.

My husband works
at a Shoeland.

lunch break already?

the lunch police?

Take me Downtown,
Officer Bumblebee.

260

Oh, actually
I'm the "Disappearing Bees,"

261
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,383
- so the...
- Oh, hey.

Kelly, could you jump on
register four?

263
00:08:54,386 --> 00:08:56,200
Oh, I just started
my lunch break.

310
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:51,073

311
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:53,012
Bag of old batteries,

I am a master
at make-up.

323
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:21,364
If I can make Elias
look like Dame Edna,

324
00:11:21,465 --> 00:11:22,922
I can make you look like Sal.

325
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:24,744
Wait, why did Elias
want to be Dame Edna?

326
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:26,480
He didn't,
I just did it.

327
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,176
I mean...

328
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:29,739

I was just doing
what you told me to do!

494
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:14,171
What is wrong with you?

495
00:17:14,229 --> 00:17:16,043
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Back up!

496
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,788
- You back up!
- You both back up.

497
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:18,616
It's all right.

498
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:21,538
Okay, if I rotate Jonah
on four-hour shifts,

499
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:23,146
and I keep Kelly
on the loading dock,

500
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:26,140
then I think I can make it so
that they never see each other.

501
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:27,677
I don't feel so good.

502
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,379
The candy corn is fusing itself

503
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:30,613
back together in my stomach.

504
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,982
Is that your second bag?

505
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,554
- Mm-hmm.

about something else.

509
00:17:40,338 --> 00:17:42,072
Is this some kind of prank?

510
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,507
Like, like, what?

511
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:45,142
"Humiliate the new girl?"

512
00:17:45,205 --> 00:17:46,350
How could I humiliate you?

513
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,620
I barely talk to you.

514
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:48,757
Hey, guys.

515
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:50,093
Why don't we take a breath?

516
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:51,209
You know what, Kelly,

517
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,763
I feel like
I cut your break short.

518
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:54,563
Maybe you should go have
another bowl of ramen,

519
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,154
- my treat.
- No, no, no, no.

games with me all day.

523
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:03,845
Then explain all those texts!

524
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:06,713
I never texted you.

525
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,337
Stop lying!

526
00:18:09,703 --> 00:18:11,937
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

527
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:13,839
- Okay, Kelly, just...
- Okay, Kelly.

528
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:15,069
It was me. I did it.

529
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,229
I took Jonah's phone,

530
00:18:16,323 --> 00:18:17,370
and I was messing around.

531
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:18,710
And I accidently swiped right,

532
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:20,053
and I just couldn't stop myself.

533
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,469
And Garrett had something
to do with it too.

534
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:23,181
- What?
- I-I mean mostly it was me.

535
00:18:23,257 --> 00:18:25,483
Just put the knife down, okay?
You're not going to hurt anyone.

536
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:27,886
- Stop telling me what to do!
- Jonah!

So turns out
that very aggressive redhead

00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,796
who came in yesterday
was not Carrot Top.

- [all groan]
- I know.

5
00:00:08,014 --> 00:00:09,602
We've reviewed
the tape several times

6
00:00:09,687 --> 00:00:11,960
and can't in good conscious
call it a match.

7
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,468
I'm sorry, guys.
I guess I just

8
00:00:13,553 --> 00:00:15,015
saw what I wanted
to see.

9
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,410
But he posed
for so many photos with me.

Next up, we're running short
on reusable bags.

Oh, we can just use
the ones under Mateo's eyes.

I'm honestly impressed
with the commitment.

We're only accepting

- What?
- Zephra's just updating things a little.

47
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:31,258
It seems crazy to change
something that's working.

48
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:32,479
The horse and buggy
was working.

49
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:34,263
It seemed crazy
to stop using that,

50
00:01:34,348 --> 00:01:36,110
but then they
developed the car, and...

51
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:37,286
Well, that destroyed
the planet.

52
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,869
- That's a bad example.
- Excuse me,

53
00:01:38,954 --> 00:01:40,657
do you have
gay iPad cases?

54
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:44,017

about that either?

- What?
- Oh, today is fun for me.

57

Zephra's asking
that we no longer

58
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:52,728
- use the term "heavenly day."
- What?

59
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:55,312
Yeah, there was a memo.
They feel it's a little loaded.

60
00:01:55,397 --> 00:01:57,829
Yeah, yeah,
it's loaded with kindness!

61
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:00,051
It's the same thing
as saying "have a nice day"

62
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:01,749
- or "have a good day."
- Great.

63
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:04,634
- Then say one of those instead.
- To the customers?

64

I might as well
give 'em the middle finger.

You were killing it
this morning.

When you said
that protection thing

67
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:12,814
to Cheyenne,
I legit peed a little,

- and not even that little.
- Well, thanks.

really go to Cheyenne

hanging around
the cell phone kiosk,

82

that's where she goes to fart.

is messed up.

- Whoa, this is intense.

about Cheyenne.

Nina dumped me.

This is bigger
than our "Dune" fight.

- [chuckles]
- What's a "Dune" fight?

110
00:03:40,426 --> 00:03:42,259
When we were roommates,
remember?

111
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:45,227
I came home, and you and Randy
were watching

112
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:46,926
the director's cut
of "Dune" without me,

113
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:48,611
even though I specifically said
that I wanted to.

114
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,433
I mean, I remember watching
"Dune" with Randy,

115
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:52,522
- but you were there?
- No, no.

116
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,735
That's why I was
so pissed, remember?

117
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,435
And then, and then to get you back,
I made six branzinos

118
00:03:58,575 --> 00:03:59,642
and stunk up the place.

119
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:00,905
That's why you did that?

120
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,473
I thought you were
just premaking

121
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:03,780
your meals for the workweek.

122
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:04,975
You thought I was gonna eat

123
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,642
a branzino every day
for a week?

124
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:08,290
I don't monitor
your fish intake.

125
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,971
Do you seriously
not remember?

126
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:11,798
That was, like,
our first big fight.

127
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:13,501
But whatever.
No bigs.

128
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,751
Hey, guys,
I need some computer help.

129
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:18,017
I'm trying to email
my friend Gary

130
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:20,513
at Cloud 9 corporate,
you know, about them making us

131
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:22,259
say, "have a non-heavenly day."

132
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:23,981
Oh, I'm not sure that's
what they were going for.

133
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:25,636
I think they're just trying
to play it safe, you know,

134
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,540
'cause some people don't
believe in Heaven.

135
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:35,267
Anyway, every time
I email him,

136
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:37,149
I keep getting
this weird message back

137
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:38,517
from a mailer demon.

138
00:04:38,602 --> 00:04:40,829
Oh, that just means a demon
ate your friend Gary's soul.

139
00:04:40,955 --> 00:04:42,882
- What?
- No, it's mailer-daemon.

140
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:44,752
It means that the email
doesn't exist anymore.

141
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,670
I'm sure there was
a whole bunch of reshuffling

142
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,019
at corporate
when Zephra took over.

143
00:04:48,103 --> 00:04:50,543
So no more Gary,
no more Heaven,

144
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:52,587
just more computers
and demons.

145
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,112
Well, if it bothers you,
I'm sure you could find

146
00:04:55,197 --> 00:04:56,767
somebody else
to contact at Zephra.

147
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:58,333
Yeah, you know,
do a little research.

148
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,946
- Find out who the new Gary is.
- I guess.

149
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:02,729
But if they think
they're gonna improve on Gary,

150
00:05:02,813 --> 00:05:03,665
they're nuts.

151
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,451
The man was perfect.

152
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:08,193
5'9", brown hair, you name it.

153
00:05:08,821 --> 00:05:10,041
That does sound perfect.

154
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,126
- You're 5'8".
- Same difference.

155
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:14,392
So you didn't see it
coming at all?

156
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:16,568
No, I always expected her
to kill me,

157
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:17,892
not to break up with me.

158
00:05:17,977 --> 00:05:20,563
Well, if you ever need
a quick pick-me-up or whatever,

159
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:21,642
you have my number.

160
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:23,743
Yes, you've been very clear.
Thank you.

161
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:26,447
[scoffs] Oh, my God,
did the janitor quit?

162
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:29,493
Because there's a huge pile
of garbage at that table.

163
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:33,064
Get it?
Talking about Mateo.

164
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:35,798
Can you... Shh!
We're trying to help Sayid.

165
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,157
Well, Cheyenne's the one
who needs help.

166
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:40,095
- She's got less brains...
- Guys.

167
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,368
Can you take it outside?

168
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:43,639
Life is railing Sayid
right now.

169
00:05:43,724 --> 00:05:45,173
Okay, I guess.

170
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,686
What were you gonna say?
Less brains than a what?

171
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:49,290
Honestly, I'm glad
they cut me off.

172
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:50,790
I think it was gonna be racist.

173
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,315
Okay, it's your turn
to field coupon complaints.

174
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,536
They're getting feisty
out there.

175
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,886
An old man
shook his cane at me...

176
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,236
Flirtatiously at first,
but then it got mean.

177
00:05:58,321 --> 00:05:59,865
I'm sorry.
Just... I started

178
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,443
doing some research,
and I came across

179
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,294
this article,
"The Truth About Zephra."

180
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:06,942
I think there's
some fishy business going on.

181
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:09,592
Oh, like tax evasion,
offshore banking?

182
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:10,630
What are we talking here?

183
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:12,981
You know how
everyone's pushing this 5G?

184
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:15,767
Well, turns out 5
is the worst of the Gs.

185
00:06:15,852 --> 00:06:17,291
They say
that it hits your brain

186
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:18,427
at a certain frequency

187
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,734
that lets them
control human behavior.

188
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,781
You think Zephra's
involved in mind control?

189
00:06:23,024 --> 00:06:25,044
Okay, that's enough screen time
for you.

190
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:27,569
No, it's not that I believe
in mind control,

191
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,442
but they are trying to control
how we greet customers.

192
00:06:30,527 --> 00:06:31,630
Glenn, enough.

193
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:32,972
This is why old people
shouldn't be allowed

194
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:34,056
on the Internet.

195
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:38,229
I don't trust Zephra either.

196
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,070
I've learned some stuff.

197
00:06:40,185 --> 00:06:43,496
- You ready to wake up?
- Well, I am awake.

198
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,866
[whispering]
Not yet.

199
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:49,399
Oh, hey, skank.

200
00:06:49,484 --> 00:06:51,602
Why are you stocking?
Did you finally get demoted?

201
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:54,158
No, I'm covering for Sarah.

202
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:56,341
Nina texted Sayid
that she had HPV

203
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:57,627
the whole time
they were dating,

204
00:06:57,711 --> 00:06:59,471
so a bunch of people
took him out for ice cream.

205
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:02,039
- Mm, he's so lucky.
- I know.

206
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:03,204
I don't get it.

207
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,860
I mean, we're,
like, way more interesting

208
00:07:04,944 --> 00:07:07,345
- than some dumped guy.
- Well, I am.

209
00:07:07,446 --> 00:07:09,868
But you're like an Iggy Azalea
wannabe five years too late.

210
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:11,134
[scoffs]

211
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:13,619
Okay, that just felt
like nothing.

212
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:16,143
Yeah, it's not as fun
without anyone watching.

213
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,024
Right?

214
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:18,841
I feel like we could get
their attention back

215
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:20,196
if we just up
our game a little.

216
00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:23,330
Yeah, we need something
splashy, something grabby.

217
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:24,985
Oh, exactly.

218
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,916
God, I am craving ice cream
so bad right now.

219
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:32,158
Me too.
Should we go get some?

220
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,727
Yeah, but you can't use
my punch card, 'cause you suck.

221
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:37,275
Good.
I wouldn't want to, dick.

222
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,088
Ooh, we should get
clown sundaes.

223
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:40,994
[mockingly] Ooh, we should get
clown sundaes.

224
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,996
- Yeah, we totally should.
- Okay. [giggles]

225
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,978
Hey, Marcus,
can you tell Glenn

226
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:46,173
what you told me
about Zephra?

227
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,696
[laughs]
What?

228
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:49,752
I didn't say anything
about Zephra,

229
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:52,485
and if you heard something,
it definitely wasn't from me

230
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:53,659
Marcus White.

231
00:07:53,743 --> 00:07:54,774
[rock music playing]

232
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:57,386
Now, about Zephra.
What were you thinking?

233
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:58,447
Um.

234
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,041
Who do you think is the one...
Hold on, sorry.

235
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:01,971
[music stops]

236
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:03,330
It's actually
super distracting.

237
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:04,409
We'll just talk quietly.

238
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:06,193
Okay, so I read
something online

239
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,501
about how Zephra is trying
to control our minds.

240
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:10,439
It's all true,
and there's videos to prove it.

241
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,504
Just Google
"Zephra mind control

242
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:14,259
guy goes nuts at Red Lobster."

243
00:08:14,351 --> 00:08:15,516
Marcus told me all about it

244
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:17,041
'cause of this weird thing
that's been happening.

245
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,556
Like, I've been shopping online
for a new mouthwash.

246
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:22,282
Then I came to work, and I got
a notification on my phone

247
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:24,712
with a digital coupon
for SuperCloud mouthwash.

248
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:28,111
Oi. So that's what
the digital coupons are about?

249
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:30,017
Yep, then
after I used that one,

250
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:31,653
they sent me more coupons,

251
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:34,556
so I kept buying the mouthwash
just like they wanted me to.

252
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:37,095
Okay, but, actually,
I'm just trying to find out

253
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,440
why they won't let us say
"have a heavenly day."

254
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,181
Well, of course
they don't want that,

255
00:08:41,265 --> 00:08:43,096
'cause guess who their god is.

256
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:45,098
- A fat baby?
- What?

257
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:47,100
No, that's my nephew.
He's my lock screen.

258
00:08:47,184 --> 00:08:49,766
- I meant the phone... technology.
- Oh.

259
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,634
When you think about it,
the Zephra app

260
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:53,626
tracks your location
and times your break.

261
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:56,180
So, in a way,
they've been controlling us.

262
00:08:56,265 --> 00:08:58,792
- That's true.
- Yeah, and riddle me this.

263
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:00,418
What's with that room
in the back

264
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:03,087
- marked "Zephra personnel only"?
- What?

265
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:05,157
- What's with it?
- Exactly.

266
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:06,945
No one here knows because
we're not allowed back there,

267
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,829
which means...

268
00:09:09,474 --> 00:09:11,055
that's where
it's all happening.

269
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,841
- Where what's happening?
- Exactly.

270
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:14,345
Exactly.

271
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:17,305
Hey, I was hoping
to return this.

272
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:18,940
I don't know if you remember,
but I was in here

273
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,024
a couple months ago.

274
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:22,724
Oh, yeah, no,
the car cell phone holder.

275
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:24,161
You had a Kia Optima, right?

276
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:25,643
I thought this would've worked
out for you.

277
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:26,992
It did,
but I totaled the Optima

278
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:28,516
in an illegal street race.

279
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:31,014
I know the return window
is probably over, but...

280
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:32,409
Nah, man, I'll hook you up.
No worries.

281
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:34,019
Your last name
was Dinkins, right?

282
00:09:34,104 --> 00:09:35,282
Are you kidding me?

283
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,814
You don't remember our fight,
but you remember...

284
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:38,243
All due respect,
Mr. Dinkins...

285
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,197
The most random, boring guy
I've ever seen in my life?

286
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,720
Wow, okay,
that was rude.

287
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:44,244
Sorry about that, but he's
just going through some stuff.

288
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:46,830
What I'm going through,
Mr. Dinkins,

289
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:49,022
is someone who I thought
was my close friend

290
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:50,397
not remembering
a pivotal moment

291
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:51,866
in our friendship,
which makes me wonder

292
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,558
if we were even friends
in the first place.

293
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:55,386
Okay, and that's on the card

294
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,890
with the last four digits
5-8-7-6?

295
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:59,673
You remember
his [bleep] credit card number?

296
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:03,225
- It's on the receipt.
- That makes sense.

297
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:11,271
- What the hell are you doing?
- Well... [grunts]

298
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:12,490
Don't you think it's weird

299
00:10:12,574 --> 00:10:14,725
that we don't have access
to this room?

300
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,750
- We're the managers.
- Oh, God.

301
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:19,105
You're still on this
Zephra is evil kick?

302
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:20,687
Come on, we don't need
to go in there.

303
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:23,908
- I'm sure it's just tech stuff.
- Perhaps.

304
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:25,945
But, you know,
Marcus and Sandra think...

305
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,923
Now you're listening
to Marcus and Sandra?

306
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:29,484
You guys
are like the Three Stooges

307
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:31,008
if Curly was Hawaiian.

308
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:33,099
Well, actually, I don't know
for a fact that he wasn't.

309
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:36,781
Wait, what if Zephra is
already controlling your mind

310
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:38,227
and you don't even know it?

311
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:41,095
Glenn, I promise you Zephra
is not controlling my mind.

312
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,316
Yeah, but they might be
making you say that.

313
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:45,101
Okay, would they
make me say this?

314
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,953
Zephra is
an inferior company.

315
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:49,172
- Their tablets barely hold a charge.
- Hmm.

316
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:51,393
Yes, because they want you
to convince me

317
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:53,273
that they're
not making you say things.

318
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:55,148
The fact that you think
they're controlling your mind

319
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:56,708
is proof that they're
not controlling your mind

320
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,971
because they wouldn't
want you to be aware that...

321
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:00,325
What am I doing?

322
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,589
Effective immediately,
there will be no more talk

323
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:03,939
about conspiracy theories.

324
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:05,595
Well, there goes
my afternoon.

325
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,675
What's this about?

326
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,984
Some people think

327
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:10,808
that Zephra's maybe trying
to control our minds,

328
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:13,638
but they're not, you know,
even if it seems like they are

329
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:16,055
because of what
they're making us say and do.

330
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,101
Okay, it doesn't matter
what it seems like,

331
00:11:18,186 --> 00:11:19,720
because we're no longer
gonna entertain

332
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,368
talking about
these crackpot theories.

333
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:24,474
Okay, now, hang on,
'cause often these ideas

334
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,435
become stronger when people
feel shamed or marginalized.

335
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,437
All right, let's talk this out.

336
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,743
Why do we think Zephra
controls minds?

337
00:11:31,827 --> 00:11:34,050
5G, it's bad stuff.

338
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:36,444
I did hear
it makes birds kill themselves.

339
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:38,663
- How does a bird kill itself?
- Just stops flapping.

340
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:41,187
That's dumb.
There's no Zephra conspiracy.

341
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:44,398
Oh, interesting,
an opposing viewpoint.

342
00:11:44,483 --> 00:11:47,078
But the moon landing,
now, that was a big lie.

343
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:48,689
I'll tell you
what's a big lie...

344
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:50,344
Love.

345
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:52,303
Don't you dare
give up on love.

346
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,373
Cody's right...
They could have easily doctored

347
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,464
the moon landing footage,
just like they show us photos

348
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:58,891
where the Earth looks round
when it's definitely flat.

349
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:01,017
- And we got there.
- You're right, Jonah.

350
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:03,296
This is so much better
than just shutting it down.

351
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,124
No, you know what, Dina?
It can be.

352
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,594
Marcus, let's talk this out.

353
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,597
I think that the Earth is round

354
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:10,818
- because of science.
- Ugh.

355
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:13,430
Like, if you stand on a dock
and you watch ships sail away,

356
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:15,433
they eventually disappear
over the horizon.

357
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:16,547
You've done that?

358
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:18,953
Put on your little peacoat
and stood on a dock for hours

359
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,703
until ships disappear?

360
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:23,416
Well, I mean,
scientists have.

361
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:26,144
But you haven't
because you're afraid

362
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:27,843
of what you would find out.

363
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,540
Just like we might be afraid
of what we'd find

364
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,327
in the Zephra-only room,
which is probably nothing

365
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:36,982
so we should
just blindly trust Zephra

366
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:38,723
- and get back to work.
- Okay, okay.

367
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:41,552
"Leading scientist
admits Earth is flat."

368
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,033
Right there
on truthwarriors1.biz.

369
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:46,119
Refute that.
I dare you.

370
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:49,050
I'm telling you
they would freak out.

371
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:49,965
I don't know.

372
00:12:50,055 --> 00:12:51,197
Would people actually believe

373
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:53,220
that I put bees
in your sandwich?

374
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,992
I mean, like, where do we
even get a bunch of dead bees?

375
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,575
I think we just use raisins,
and I sell it.

376
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:01,056
Well, I feel like we need

377
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:04,153
to do something
more, like, emotional.

378
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:05,061
Yeah, you're right.

379
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:06,857
It's probably why this whole
Sayid break-up thing

380
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:08,151
is popping.

381
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:11,023
What if we had
a big public blowout,

382
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:13,019
you know, and we dropped
some major bombs?

383
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,354
Okay, yeah,
what if you come at me like,

384
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:17,661
- "I know what you did!"
- Okay.

385
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:19,249
And then you'd be like,
"And I know you were

386
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,137
"only friends with me
to get close to Bo

387
00:13:21,222 --> 00:13:22,318
because you're in love
with him."

388
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,079
[gasps]

389
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:24,786
Do you see how I moved
the story forward?

390
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,068
- Mm-hmm.
- Yours was just like

391
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:27,496
attitude, which is fine.

392
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:29,302
Yeah, ooh,
and then it could come out

393
00:13:29,386 --> 00:13:32,497
that you're Harmonica's
real father.

394
00:13:32,582 --> 00:13:36,092
So her parents are me and Bo?

395
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:38,902
Yeah, imagine
how pissed I'd be.

396
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:41,097
Let's not commit
to anything just yet,

397
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:43,969
but we should definitely
jot some ideas down.

398
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:47,934
- Hey, man, did you text Randy?
- Well, I tried to.

399
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:49,864
I asked him if he remembered
me being mad

400
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:51,747
when I came home that night,
but I just got

401
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,066
a "sorry, wrong number" text.

402
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:55,374
Yeah, you texted him
12 times in 3 minutes.

403
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:56,941
He texted you that
so you would stop.

404
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:58,544
Oh, okay,
so then he's obviously

405
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,026
- still feeling bad about it.
- Feeling bad?

406
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,536
No, Randy
does not remember, okay?

407
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:05,833
Randy barely even remembers
watching "Dune."

408
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:08,864
Randy smokes a lot of weed.
Leave him alone.

409
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,184
Okay, fine,
but I'm not gonna apologize

410
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:12,708
for caring, okay?

411
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,623
You're an important person
in my life, Garrett.

412
00:14:14,707 --> 00:14:17,137
A lot of men are scared
to say things like that,

413
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:18,236
but not me.

414
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,951
I'll tell you
exactly how much you mean to me

415
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:21,326
- to your face.
- Please don't.

416
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,979
Too late.
I'm already doing it.

417
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,661
I value your taste in music.

418
00:14:24,746 --> 00:14:25,488
- Okay?
- Oh, boy.

419
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,278
Sometimes I save screenshots
of texts that you send me.

420
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:30,290
- What, why would you do that?
- I don't know.

421
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:34,730
To... to revisit them and laugh
or to send them back to you

422
00:14:34,814 --> 00:14:38,430
at the perfect moment,
like June 12, 2018...

423
00:14:38,514 --> 00:14:40,160
Eye roll,
"I'm never getting married."

424
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,129
You think I'm not
gonna throw that back at you

425
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:43,449
at your wedding?

426
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,894
So Bo went away
with you that weekend?

427
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:48,606
I thought his grandmother died.

428
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:51,044
Foolish girl,
she's alive and well.

429
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:54,048
- Nana's in on it, too.
- So they're still beefing?

430
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:55,637
Oh, yeah,
they're going at it.

431
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:57,057
- It's savage.
- I don't believe it.

432
00:14:57,141 --> 00:14:58,406
Well, believe this.

433
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,066
Bo and I have
a deeper connection

434
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:02,176
- than you'll ever have!
- [scoffs]

435
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:04,455
This whole time, I thought
that you were my friend,

436
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,082
but really you were
only using me to get to Bo!

437
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:10,173
Yes, it was
the ultimate betrayal.

438
00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:13,035
Oh, my God,
what they're saying...

439
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:15,261
It's written...
It's written here.

440
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:17,556
I got to tell Marcus
and Sandra.

441
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:19,906
What?
"Ultimate betrayal."

442
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,535
Wait a minute, did you guys
write this out ahead of time?

443
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,755
Is this fake?

444
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:26,066
What?
No, you're crazy.

445
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:27,707
I absolutely slept with Bo

446
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,350
in his grandmother's
meth bungalow.

447
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:30,960
- This is ridiculous.
- Whatever.

448
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:33,355
Wait, no, come on,
you guys, we're fighting.

449
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,616
Yeah, we just jotted down
a couple of bullet points.

450
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,160
Okay, this is
way more interesting

451
00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:38,731
than some nobody
getting dumped.

452
00:15:38,816 --> 00:15:40,012
- Ooh.
- Whoa.

453
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:41,144
Well, I'd rather be a nobody

454
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:43,146
than a couple
of Impossible Burgers,

455
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,366
'cause all I'm seeing here
is some imitation beef.

456
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,500
- Oh, imitation beef!
- Too funny.

457
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:50,023
- Oh, that's funny, Sayid.
- Oh, come on.

458
00:15:50,107 --> 00:15:51,816
You don't think
he wrote that down?

459
00:15:52,022 --> 00:15:53,566
[grunting]

460
00:15:53,651 --> 00:15:55,830
We got to get in there
before it's too late.

461
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:58,764
- What is wrong with you?
- Dina, you don't understand.

462
00:15:58,894 --> 00:16:02,811
Zephra has Mateo and Cheyenne,

1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,947
<i>- Previously on</i> The Passage...

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,439
- Amy, I'll find you.

3
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:05,463
I promise.

4
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:10,028
- Euthanize her.
- Okay.

5
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:11,488
<i>But you won't fix
the real problem.</i>

6
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,312
- Which is?
- The nightmares.

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,910
There are a lot
of sick people in the world,

8
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,453
and you could help us
save millions of them.

9
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,519
I want the agent.

10
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:22,021
Don't look at that. Look at me.

11
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:24,606
He's gonna come for her.

12
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,292
- Who?
- Fanning.

13
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,383
I guess now is
a good time to talk.

14
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:33,574
In the last three years,
12 death row inmates

15
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,554
<i>were sent to a government
facility in Colorado</i>

16
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:37,578
<i>to be used as guinea pigs</i>

17
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,724
for top secret
medical experiments.

18
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:39,997
I'll look into this.

19
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,584
<i>Stay out of my way,
Agent Wolgast.</i>

20
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:14,990
<i>It's time, Carter.</i>

21
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,117
<i>You're gonna have
to make a choice.</i>

22
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,729
What are you doing?

23
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:47,189
Carter had another nightmare.

24
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,857
He has them all the time now.

25
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,192
Is that a part of this?

26
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,860
Is that gonna happen to me?

27
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,445
Are you having nightmares?

28
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:56,657
No. But all I do all day

29
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,576
is sit around and think
what drug they put in me.

30
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,329
And if I get sick,
what will happen to me?

31
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,084
Is that gonna happen to me?

32
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,271
No, it's not gonna
happen to you, 'cause we're

33
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,175
- gonna get out of here.
- How?

34
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,965
All I know is the hallway
to the elevator to the bathroom.

35
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,028
-And there's men outside
with guns every ten feet...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,321
-...and you said you would
get us out of here.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,823
-And you didn't
get us out of here.
-Hey.

38
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,866
What did I say
we were not gonna do? Huh?

39
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,785
-Panic.
-Panic. And what are
you doing right now?

40
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,120
- Panicking.
- You're panicking.

41
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,685
I'm gonna get us out of here.

42
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,019
What are you gonna do?

43
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,188
I'm gonna broaden our horizons.

44
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,734
...What is it?

45
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,529
I have to see Dr. Lear
right away.

46
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,699
- What for?
- I have all that.

47
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,958
Why do you care so much about
the virals' brain activity?

48
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,795
I think we're witnessing
an evolution.

49
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,755
We need to understand it,

50
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,508
in case we need
to defend ourselves.

51
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,595
From bad dreams? Wow.

52
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:02,431
You're like my mom who says cell
phones give you brain cancer.

53
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,975
Cell phones do give you
brain cancer.

54
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,728
See? It's just what I suspected.

55
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,416
Their brain activity peaks
overnight.

56
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,190
These...

57
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,443
These nightmares
can't be unrelated.

58
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,528
Maybe it's just static, but...

59
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,572
But what if it is communication?

60
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,200
Who's this?

61
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,827
The intensity of the EM field

62
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:26,997
is exponentially higher
than all the others.

63
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,375
Fanning.

64
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,921
Sir, I've got Wolgast for you.

65
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,298
Says he wants to talk
to you and Dr. Sykes.

66
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,593
Amy's not sleeping.
She's anxious.

67
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,512
Yeah, that's been going around.
What can we do?

68
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,432
I think, for a start, you can
get her out of that room.

69
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,934
She's ten.

70
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,519
She needs fresh air.
Go outside. Diversion.

71
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,022
D.O.D. has some
security concerns.

72
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,857
Mostly about you.

73
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,237
They can afford
an outdoor security detail.

74
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,530
I'm not Harry Potter.

75
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,288
Okay. Tell me what you need.

76
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:19,591
I just wanted to say thank you
for what you did.

77
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:22,094
I wouldn't think
too much about it.

78
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:25,264
If you really want to thank me,
you can just get out of my head.

79
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,683
We got another problem.

80
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,645
One of your soldiers
is going a little crazy.

81
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,355
What are you talking about?

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,983
You're gonna have to take care
of him.

83
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,902
"Take care of him."
What does that mean?

84
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,530
He's gonna blow the whistle
on this whole place.

85
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,343
If what's going on here
gets out,

86
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:44,552
you're going to be
held responsible,

87
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,494
and then I'm gonna get
euthanized.

88
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,997
I don't think you know what
you're talking about, Shauna.

89
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,707
My people are fine.

90
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,645
Trust any one of them
with my life.

91
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:58,171
Okay. I guess we'll just wait
and see what happens.

92
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,924
Richards,
we need you in the cell block.

93
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,677
We have a problem
with Sergeant Paulson.

94
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,557
Copy.

95
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,368
Paulson.

96
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,913
What's the problem?

97
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:19,795
Sir, you know David Winston?

98
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,463
Yeah.

99
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,882
- Met him briefly on the way in.

100
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,467
How have you been, Winston?

101
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,846
He drove long-haul truck
for 20 years.

102
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,808
One day he found a girl,
and he raped her.

103
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,246
He strapped her underneath
his rig and finished his route

104
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,647
from Seattle to Bozeman
with her under there.

105
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,191
Then he went on
a five-year killing spree.

106
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,943
All right, listen to me.

107
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:46,363
You don't need
to learn their stories.

108
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,802
Yeah, well, he didn't give me
much of a choice, did he?

109
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,906
It's a lot like you
and Shauna Babcock.

110
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,843
<i>You know what he says to me?</i>

111
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,515
- He tells me he loves me.
- Randy,

112
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,057
this is what,
our third tour now?

113
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,684
I brought you along

114
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,664
- because I trust you.
- These things can do

115
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,541
whatever they want,
and no one can stop 'em.

116
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,793
I mean, you can, but Babcock
won't let you, you know?

117
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,503
I want you to report
to the medic right now.

118
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,860
You need a full psych eval.

119
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,405
Babcock is playing you.

120
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:29,698
Listen to me.

121
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,117
<i>You need to wake up.</i>

122
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,370
<i>We are sworn to protect
the lives in this facility</i>

123
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,823
<i>until these lab rats give us
the cure that we need.</i>

124
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,959
<i>We've just been here too long.</i>

125
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,216
How do you know we're not
the lab rats?

126
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,983
You know, I can't believe
they let you do this to me.

127
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,610
What are you talking about?

128
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,923
My dad and I built a treehouse
when I was your age.

129
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,697
Just like this.

130
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,782
You know, minus the guards.

131
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,951
It was awesome.

132
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,495
So is basketball.

133
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,996
I'd murder you at basketball.

134
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,915
Go ahead, make it yours.

135
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,083
Add any changes.

136
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,002
Okay, one big ground rule here.

137
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,773
We handle all
the construction tools,

138
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:29,508
Hammer.

139
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,136
Yay.

140
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,850
All right,
let's see what you got.

141
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,940
All right,
this is a great start.

142
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,943
Lot of imagination here.
I like it.

143
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,405
We'll start on the ladder.

144
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,991
Don't wander outside
the perimeter,

145
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,618
or we'll have to shoot you.

146
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,119
Yup. Got it.

147
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,664
See, Amy? Fun.

148
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,294
Amy.

149
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,589
What's wrong with this picture?

150
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,424
Come on up.

151
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,843
We built this for you.

152
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,303
Come on.

153
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,402
You're afraid of heights.

154
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,529
- No.
- I'm not gonna make fun of you.

155
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,717
- You already are.
- No. What about when you climbed

156
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,594
down that ladder
the first day we met?

157
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,827
I was more scared of you
than heights.

158
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,112
Focus on where you're going.

159
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,997
Come on. Take that step.

160
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,331
There you go. Don't look down.

161
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,166
Look up. Look at me.

162
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,335
Look into these
beautiful hazel eyes.

163
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,422
Gross.
- Come on, you're doing great.

164
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,090
Come on.

165
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,301
I got you.

166
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,219
All right.

167
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,887
There you go.

168
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,098
You made it up. All right.

169
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,559
...Good.

170
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:03,852
Tell me what you see.

171
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,731
Same things I see every day.

172
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,232
Not exactly.

173
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,235
Now we have a bird's-eye view
of Project Noah

174
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,030
and what's on the other side
of that security wall.

175
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,489
Wow.

176
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:17,866
That's genius.

177
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,909
Don't act so surprised.

178
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,287
I got skills.

179
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,875
All right, Anthony.
This all looks good.

180
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,793
The dreams are worse.

181
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,381
It's happening every time
I close my eyes.

182
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,718
It's the same guy. Fanning.

183
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,054
Who is he?

184
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,139
Come on, tell me, man.

185
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,894
Tim Fanning...

186
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,480
was the most brilliant man
I ever knew.

187
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,128
Also one of
the most manipulative.

188
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,152
What happened to him?

189
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,655
I can't tell you that.

190
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,492
Okay, well, he's coming for me.

191
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,578
He says I have to make a choice.

192
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,121
What kind of choice?

193
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,290
I don't know, Dr. Lear.

194
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,585
I always wake up before we get
to the Q and A part.

195
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,206
You know, Anthony,
you have a very good chance

196
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,093
of coming through this trial
without any side effects.

197
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,429
You're different.

198
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:22,931
How?

199
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,726
You're young. You're strong.

200
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,581
And you're
the first test subject

201
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,897
who hasn't tried to convince me
of your innocence.

202
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,442
You know I read
your case file, right?

203
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,070
So you know everything about me?

204
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,508
I know your
court-appointed lawyer

205
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,823
fell asleep during the trial.

206
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,075
Yeah, well,
you get what you pay for.

207
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,013
I also know Project Innocence
offered to take on your case,

208
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:44,994
and you turned them down.

209
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,246
What are we doing here?

210
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,164
See...

211
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,795
I don't know what happened
to Rachel Wilson,

212
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:58,133
but I think her death
is clearly a burden on you.

213
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,139
Hey.

214
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,142
I have some great news.

215
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,768
What?

216
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,479
They've got the tater tots back
in the cafeteria.

217
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,274
Oh, did you call in
a favor to get that?

218
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,026
Oh, yeah. Meet me upstairs
when your shift's over.

219
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,154
I'll have ketchup.

220
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,031
Sure.

221
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,576
As long as we don't have
to talk about work.

222
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,828
Well, then...

223
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,955
I'll have to ask you
something now.

224
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,460
I've been, uh, getting questions
about the Babcock thing.

225
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,713
Why did you change your mind
about the execution?

226
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,967
Last minute,
I called the D.O.D.,

227
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,595
let them know that
we were using deadly force.

228
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,096
They said absolutely not.

229
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,056
Told me to stand down.

230
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,870
Why would they overrule
your decision?

231
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,269
She killed someone.

232
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,731
Well, we've got
$36 million invested per viral.

233
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,817
I guess nobody wants
to set that much cash on fire.

234
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,696
Oh. Okay.

235
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:38,858
Hi.

236
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,026
Welcome.

237
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,653
Uh, you here for the open house?

238
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:46,199
I was just driving by
and had to pop in.

239
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,368
Okay.

240
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,702
Rachel Wilson,

241
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,621
RW & A Realty.

242
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,039
Anthony Carter.

243
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,499
And thanks for coming,

244
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,646
but I'm not looking
for any help on this.

245
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,773
No, you're not looking
to pay a commission.

246
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,380
Am I right?

247
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,843
I try to only pay
for things I can't do myself.

248
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,929
Give me the confidence
of a first-time home flipper.

249
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,640
Look around.

250
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,434
Everything in here
is top-of-the-line.

251
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,998
-Yeah, I mean,
you have a great eye.
-Yeah.

252
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,607
Expensive taste, but...
you've been on the market

253
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,610
30% longer than average,
with no bites.

254
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,031
Let me help you.

255
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,950
How?

256
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,120
How about a freebie?

257
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,998
Okay.

258
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,292
Kitchen. Solid layout.

259
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,794
Sink and the stove
are an A-plus.

260
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,566
- Appreciate it.
- So, wait, this-this can't be

261
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,298
the only fridge in here.

262
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,800
It's a totally new,
energy-efficient technology...

263
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,261
Yeah, but it doesn't have
any room for groceries, so...

264
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,679
maybe swap it out.

265
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,640
...Yeah.

266
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,267
That's such a good stove.

267
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,603
Ugh! What is this?

268
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,522
- That is an apple.
- Mm-mm, no.

269
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,025
It's a pop of color.

270
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,568
This is good.

271
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,154
Let's see where we need
more of this.

272
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,661
Wh-What?

273
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,998
Anthony,
the bed's in the corner.

274
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,751
What's wrong...?

275
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,796
Have you never lived
with a woman?

276
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,716
- Ever?
- I have an active dating life.

277
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,238
-Uh-huh.
-I-I just enjoy
having space to myself.

278
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,929
Okay, now I get it.

279
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,972
That's the problem.

280
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,225
This house is a pure expression
of what's in your heart.

281
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,331
I mean, it's the perfect home
for a young couple.

282
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,875
You know, two people in love,
ready to start a life together.

283
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,359
But you do these little things
to... to sabotage it,

284
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,297
and I don't even think
you're doing them on purpose.

285
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:50,740
I swear I've never said this
in a business context, but...

286
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,660
open up your heart, Anthony.

287
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,662
Let love in.

288
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,792
Could have just said,
"Move the bed."

289
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,880
God.

290
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,430
Do you want me to ask you out?

291
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,851
Yeah, I guess I do.

292
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,647
<i>Good job, buddy.</i>

293
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,148
She's a catch.

294
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,357
Watch your fingers.

295
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,861
How you feeling?
Anything different?

296
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,030
Hot? Cold? How you sleeping?

297
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,366
I feel great.

298
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,535
I'm worried
about Carter, though.

299
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,473
- He sounded sick.
- I'm sure he's fine,

300
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,289
but I'll ask Dr. Lear, okay?

301
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,375
Looks like we're done here.

302
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:28,963
There you go.

303
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,173
Thanks.

304
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,303
Hey.

305
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,265
May I use your binoculars?

306
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,121
Come on,
I've never been to Colorado.

307
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,396
I don't know
if I'll ever see nature again.

308
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,739
Our secret.

309
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,367
Thank you.

310
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,380
You're scaring me.

311
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,508
Just doing what you do, Agent.

312
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,885
You can call me Brad.
That's my name.

313
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,806
Your name is The Agent.

314
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,188
- So, what do I look at?
- South-southeast.

315
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,525
Tell me everything you see
over the border wall.

316
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,738
<i>Shauna Babcock,</i>

317
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,676
20 years old,
got the death penalty

318
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,326
for the murder of her own mother
and stepfather.

319
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,807
Her official date of execution
passed five months ago,

320
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,517
but the execution
never happened.

321
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,957
It was two men.

322
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,084
They said they were FBI.

323
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,086
They spoke to the warden.

324
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,588
Put Babcock
in the back of their car,

325
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,299
and that was it, she was gone.

326
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,593
Classified
records obtained by WWN

327
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,720
detail close to a dozen victims,

328
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,283
death row inmates
just like Babcock,

329
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,244
with no one to speak up
for them...

330
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,600
until now.

331
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,853
I'm going to start watching

332
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,479
cable news again, just for you.

333
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,356
Did you make

334
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,941
the connection to Telluride?

335
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,306
Everything you said checked out.

336
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,735
It's all in there.

337
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,823
News vans could be there
tomorrow.

338
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,365
Hey, so I've gone after

339
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,660
some powerful people before,
and it can get pretty scary.

340
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,495
If you need security...

341
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:25,913
She brought me along.

342
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,293
Well, we go to air tomorrow
at 5:00 p.m., so...

343
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,753
until then, just lay low.

344
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,964
<i>I'm calling to follow up</i>

345
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,801
on the conversation you had
with Clark Richards.

346
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,263
Yeah. He-he said that you spoke
about our decision

347
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,849
to have Shauna Babcock put down.

348
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,688
He didn't?

349
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,732
Are you sure?

350
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,028
Okay, thank you.

351
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,157
This E.M. surge from Fanning
is 400% higher

352
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,326
than anything we saw yesterday.

353
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,912
What the hell's going on?

354
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,969
We got to get him downstairs.

355
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,377
Okay, we got to move him now!
Move, move! Help me!

356
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,437
Stupid trees.

357
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,689
Stupid birds.

358
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,608
Mountains.

359
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,987
Hey.

360
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,906
There's a guy on the roof.

361
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,241
What's he look like?

362
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,996
He has a big gun, and he's...

363
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,667
- Get down!
- Take cover!

364
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,300
Body temperature's 102.6
and rising.

365
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,571
How long has he been like this?

366
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,428
Is it too late?
- No.

367
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,972
No, I'm not gonna lose you.

368
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,810
- Did you pull up his blood?
- Got it right here.

369
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,814
This is a snapshot
of Carter's viral genome,

370
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,485
from a few days ago,
and this is a sample from today.

371
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,737
Look. Every time
we attenuate the formula,

372
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,592
- it mutates back.
- Okay, what if we

373
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:27,410
synthesize a new injection,
excise the bad nucleotides?

374
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,870
How long will it take?
- Not long. We just need

375
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,195
to pull the sample
and run the knock-out sequence.

376
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:39,755
What is that?

377
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,883
Those are gunshots.

378
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,365
The shooter's got to be
on the northwest rooftop.

379
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,764
- Spread out, find your shot.

380
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,558
We've got an active shooter!

381
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,352
...Down, down, down,

382
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:54,645
down, down, down.

383
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,578
Richards, this is Paulson.
I'm the man on the roof.

384
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,251
Damn it, Paulson. How the hell
you expect this to end?

385
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:20,257
-With me on a helicopter
out of here.
-Listen to me.

386
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:23,257
If you end this now,
I will pull every string I have

387
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,968
to get the D.O.D.
to go easy on you,

388
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,304
but if you kill anyone,
all bets are off.

389
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:29,783
I don't want anyone to die,
Richards,

390
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,047
but you wouldn't listen to me.

391
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,601
I don't know what else to do.

392
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,063
I got a clear shot
on the electric substation.

393
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,292
The backups are in there, too.

394
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,044
I can take out power
to this entire compound.

395
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,651
I need a helicopter. Find it.

396
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,658
Okay, listen to me.
We're gonna make a run for it.

397
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,253
You see those men over there?

398
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,275
- That's our finish line.
- It's too far.

399
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,069
No, it won't be
once we start running.

400
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:08,052
Stay behind me, you got it?

401
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,808
Three... two...

402
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:14,893
one...

403
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,143
Go!

404
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,899
Stay low. Amy. Amy!

405
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:37,706
Everyone make it in one piece?

406
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,626
Yeah. We're good.

407
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,962
Thanks.

408
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,426
Fever's 103.1.
His fever's getting worse.

409
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,136
We're nearly there.

410
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,025
What happened?

411
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,027
We lost power.

412
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,113
Sykes, it's Richards.

413
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,277
Paulson took out
the electrical substation.

414
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,325
Saying he wants a helicopter.

415
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,619
There's a bad situation
going on with Carter.

416
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:18,789
We need power back now,
but I can't send a repair team

417
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,667
with Paulson on that rooftop.

418
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,794
All right, give me a minute.

419
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,671
Let me go talk to him.

420
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,715
I can get a cease-fire.

421
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,262
I'm gonna take Wolgast
to the roof with me.

422
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,931
Paulson's not talking to me, but
he might get through to him.

423
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:39,268
He was a negotiation specialist
in our unit.

424
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,353
Okay, get an escort for Amy.

425
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,231
Send her to me,
and I'll keep her safe.

426
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,066
On it.

427
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:48,319
Sykes will look after you.

428
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:52,865
More ice.

429
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,242
We need to bring his fever down.

430
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,961
- Oh, Rachel.

431
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,840
I'm sorry, do zombies live here?

432
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,843
No one lives here.
That's the point, smart-ass.

433
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:13,969
Yeah.

434
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,679
Come on.

435
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,559
Hey, what are we doing here?

436
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:26,524
Okay, so I know we said no gifts
for our three months,

437
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:29,860
but... I saw this place for us.

438
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:31,779
- And it's perfect.

439
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,074
I mean, look at it.

440
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,992
Babe, I don't get it.

441
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:39,453
I mean, what's this place
have to do with us?

442
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:43,415
This place is 3,800 square feet,
and I could get it for nothing.

443
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,167
We could flip it,

444
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:49,213
take the money
and start our life together.

445
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,425
I just finished selling
my first house,

446
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,929
and this-this is a big step up
from a three-bedroom ranch.

447
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:59,390
I-I'm just a one-man operation.

448
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,559
What about me?

449
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,330
-Babe.
-I'm sorry, did you
sell that place

450
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:05,123
- all by yourself?
- No. No.

451
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,022
You and I are a team,

452
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,044
but I don't have a crew
or the right suppliers...

453
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,568
Why are you always so negative?

454
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:13,654
- Why can't you trust me?
- Whoa.

455
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,948
I have so much faith in you,
Anthony.

456
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:18,325
I believe in you,
but you never trust that.

457
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,163
Babe, th-this is just about
the house.

458
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:27,418
Well, I already made the deal.

459
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,211
I closed escrow yesterday.

460
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:31,046
I'm sorry.

461
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:34,633
I thought this would be
a good opportunity for us.

462
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,094
But it's not your problem.

463
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,846
Nothing's in your name.

464
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,472
I will figure it out.

465
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,016
Okay.

466
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,060
Okay.

467
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,187
I'll-I'll make a few calls,

468
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:50,065
and I'll pull a crew together.

469
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:51,358
Yes!

470
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:54,486
Yes!

471
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,530
We can do this.

472
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:59,825
Hey, you can do this.

473
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,827
You are crazy, you know that?

474
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:05,581
- Crazy.
- Yeah, well...

475
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,666
maybe you need a little crazy.

476
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,397
- Maybe I do.
- Yeah.

477
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:11,795
Mm-hmm.

478
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,107
My God, Anthony.

479
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:33,734
You're burning up.

480
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:37,321
All right, he's too hot.
He's gonna seize.

481
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:38,656
I need some more ice.

482
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:44,119
I-I don't know what's happening.

483
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:46,830
You still haven't
figured it out yet?

484
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,795
<i>His temperature's 106.</i>

485
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,381
We're out of time.

486
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,235
Without power,
we're gonna lose him.

487
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,279
How did this get out of hand
so quickly?

488
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,346
It's Fanning. He's drawing
energy from the other virals.

489
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,765
I don't know, maybe there's some
snowball effect

490
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,975
that's making
the virus mutate faster.

491
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,602
That's crazy.

492
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,062
Well, that's where we are.

493
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,215
I can hear everything you say.
Don't try anything stupid.

494
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:20,092
- Why do you think he snapped?
- This place is

495
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,344
a pressure cooker, and he's
been here since day one.

496
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,346
You can't give me anything else?
Specifics? It'll help.

497
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,994
Here's all you need to know:

498
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,038
We started this place
to save lives,

499
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:30,541
and I don't need the body count
getting any higher.

500
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,543
Just get through to him.

501
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,341
...Let me see your hands!

502
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,218
- Let me see your hands!
- Wait. Don't shoot.

503
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:44,012
I'm alone. Don't shoot.

504
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:45,575
- Don't shoot.
- Step out from the door.

505
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,868
All right, I'm working on
your helicopter,

506
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,559
but there's a problem.

507
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,248
Place your hands
behind your head.

508
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:52,896
Walk backwards to me.

509
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:58,318
You're Paulson, right?
My name is Wolgast.

510
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,115
Stop.

511
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,658
I'm unarmed.

512
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,035
We have a medical emergency
downstairs.

513
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:10,405
We need the power restored now.

514
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,708
That's on you.
You could have a chopper here

515
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,479
in minutes
if you made the right call.

516
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,690
We both know the people
that you're dealing with.

517
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:19,381
They'll blow this entire rooftop
with you and me on it.

518
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,091
I planned for that.

519
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,385
What did you do?

520
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,432
Slowly.

521
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:33,353
I used my access to 4B,

522
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,981
and I smuggled a vial of
Fanning's blood out of here.

523
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:39,651
And you're never gonna
track it down without my help.

524
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,114
...Here we go.

525
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,908
We have breaking news.

526
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:49,787
A tragedy involving one of
our own investigative reporters:

527
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:53,207
Sierra Thompson died earlier
today in a single-car accident.

528
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,626
- We need to go.
- We have Kurt Wisner

529
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,272
- on the scene.
- They killed her.

530
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,588
- We need to go now, Lila.

531
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:02,424
Uh, thanks, Brian.
What I have so far...

532
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,594
Vitals are still stable,
but he seems hot.

533
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:12,893
My God. Babe, babe, babe,
babe, babe, babe.

534
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,813
What happened? Are you okay?

535
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,981
Here. S-Sit down. Sit down.

536
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,863
Did someone hit you?

537
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:26,907
I need a minute.

538
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,284
And a drink.

539
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,119
Okay, okay.

540
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,796
Here you go.

541
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,261
Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

542
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,471
...Come on.

543
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,683
You're okay.

544
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,858
I'm married.

545
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:06,321
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No, you don't...

546
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,491
- you don't understand.
- No, I didn't understand before.

547
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,579
But I understand now.

548
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:19,293
I'm such an idiot.

549
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,295
Listen, I know...

550
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,883
I know it's asking a lot and I
don't deserve anything from you,

551
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,427
but can you please
let me explain?

552
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,305
No. I-I never cared
that you act crazy,

553
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:33,765
but now y-you're a liar.

554
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,581
- I'm-I'm gonna get out of here.
- Anthony, Anthony, please.

555
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:39,040
- Please, please, Anthony.
- I don't want to look

556
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,917
- at you right now.
- Please... please don't.

557
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,983
Please, please don't. Please.

558
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:47,446
Can you please
just listen to me, okay?

559
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,532
Please. I know, I know.

560
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,534
I know. I'm sorry.

561
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,165
Don't worry.

562
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,125
You'll see him soon.

563
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,002
He's nice, right?

564
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,129
I'm not so bad, either.

565
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,009
Who are you?

566
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,511
You know me.

567
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,221
Come on, try.

568
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:15,265
Relax your brain.

569
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,389
Pretend like
we've been friends forever.

570
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,354
There it is.

571
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,315
Right? My name. Tell me.

572
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,025
Shauna Babcock.

573
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,652
I know you, too.

574
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:29,363
You're Amy from Memphis,
whose mama overdosed.

575
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,657
I'm sorry about that.

576
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,553
I know it's hard
to lose a parent.

577
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,869
Where are you right now?

578
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,663
Really?

579
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,623
Smart girl.

580
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,627
I'm down in the basement
locked up.

581
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,800
Show me the real you.

582
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:53,136
Are you sure?

583
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,263
- It's a little scary.
- Yeah.

584
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,974
- I am.
- Okay.

585
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,642
I'll show you.

586
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,847
I'm gonna change right back,
though, okay?

587
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:14,950
I'm nothing like you.

588
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,535
But you are.

589
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,616
You're changing already.

590
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:19,997
You can feel that, right?

591
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,874
I know you're scared,

592
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,334
but after you change,

593
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,628
you're not gonna need anybody
to protect you.

594
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,525
You're finally gonna have
a family.

595
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,048
We're gonna look out for you.

596
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:31,883
All you have to do is give in.

597
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,802
Fighting only makes it harder.

598
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,304
Ask that poor guy on the roof
with the gun.

599
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,640
Or ask Carter.

600
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,060
I don't want anything
to do with you.

601
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:53,030
Why? You don't have anybody.

602
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:54,698
I have the agent.

603
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,145
Trust me, he's gonna have
a hard time with all this.

604
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,579
Just promise me one thing.

605
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,165
Don't let anybody tell you
what to think.

606
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,958
Listen to you.

607
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:06,710
You know what's best.

608
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,962
I want you to go now.

609
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:11,465
I get it.

610
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:14,926
But if you want to talk,
I'm around.

611
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,892
I'm gonna get someone
to check the blood locker

612
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,747
to see if Paulson's bluffing,
but if he's not,

613
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:26,188
you need to get
the location of that vial.

614
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,440
Do whatever it takes.

615
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,485
You know if that blood gets out,
it's a disaster.

616
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,196
It's the only way I can
get people to listen to me.

617
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,664
You're on the wrong side
of this.

618
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,959
Not anymore. I want
this place shut down, too.

619
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:49,461
Great.

620
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,608
Did we finally get
to the "gain his trust" chapter

621
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:53,632
of the hostage negotiation
handbook?

622
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:58,095
I've been on 4B.

623
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,638
I've seen what

624
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,409
they've turned
those people into.

625
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,351
And I know about the dreams.

626
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,436
I know they're real.

627
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,446
Who'd you get in your head?

628
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:17,697
Fanning.

629
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,950
No one knew what
this was gonna be.

630
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,274
And they can't even admit
what it is they've done.

631
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,289
We don't have much more time.

632
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,501
Let me help you.

633
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,044
We can work together.

634
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:39,845
Two's not enough to stop them.

635
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,429
What are you talking about?

636
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:44,474
Winston told me everything.

637
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,519
The virals
aren't gonna break out.

638
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:50,272
We're gonna let 'em out.

639
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,773
They can't control us.

640
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,059
- Not to do something like that.
- Ask Richards.

641
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,112
Ask him about Babcock.

642
00:35:57,197 --> 00:36:00,240
He saved her life,
and you want to know why?

643
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:02,492
It's because Fanning
needs all of them alive,

644
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,161
and when he gets one more,

645
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,328
that's when...

646
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:06,455
No!

647
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,523
I told you
I could talk him down.

648
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,567
Target down is confirmed.
Target down is confirmed.

649
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,465
I need a repair crew ASAP.

650
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,010
I gave you
as much time as you deserve.

651
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,469
What about Fanning's blood?

652
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:24,347
All the vials
are accounted for on 4B.

653
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,369
You pulled that trigger
to shut him up.

654
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:29,352
He was a raving lunatic, and he
put my men in the line of fire.

655
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,062
Was he right about Babcock?

656
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,856
And who's the "one more"?

657
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,878
- What's going on?
- When were you down on 4B?

658
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:36,546
What are you ta...?
That was a bluff.

659
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,423
I said that
to get him to trust me.

660
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:39,905
Oh, it sure is funny timing,

661
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:42,324
considering the security
incident we just had.

662
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,345
We don't have time
to be at each other's throats.

663
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,660
There's trouble coming.

664
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,287
Okay. If trouble comes,

665
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,247
- I'll handle it.

666
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,892
Jonas.

667
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,026
It's Fanning, isn't it?

668
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:23,114
You need to push him out.

669
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,325
- I'm gonna help you through.

670
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,202
Thank God. All right.

671
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:28,556
Let's prep him
for the antiviral.

672
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,829
Come on, let's move.

673
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,706
<i>I thought I could get out</i>

674
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,478
of the marriage
without you ever knowing.

675
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,961
- It's him.

676
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,338
- Give me that.

677
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,465
- Give it to me.
- I...

678
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,312
She'll call you
when she has something to say.

679
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:58,024
So, what happens now?

680
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,070
I love you, Rachel, but...

681
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:05,156
I need time to think.

682
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:36,229
Temperature's spiking.

683
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:37,667
Negative. Current one's already
giving an accurate reading.

684
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,232
- Set it up again.
- No progress.

685
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,483
Come on, Carter.

686
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,322
Negative effect.

687
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:57,667
Rachel?

688
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,385
Rachel.

689
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:35,497
Rachel. Rachel.

690
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:38,666
Baby, breathe.

691
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:40,293
Please.

692
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,962
Rachel, please breathe.

693
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,465
Come on, babe.

694
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,550
Baby, breathe.

695
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:50,804
Hmm.

696
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,973
I can see how this was tough
to explain.

697
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,768
That's the problem
with being the sidepiece.

698
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,105
When push comes to shove,
you just don't matter.

699
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:03,650
Now you got the rich,
angry husband after you.

700
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,630
He definitely hates her
more than he hates you,

701
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:07,862
but either way,
he's telling the cops

702
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,592
that you're the one
that hit her.

703
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:10,616
What's happening?

704
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,784
You're dying, Carter.

705
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,545
My God.
What's Fanning doing to him?

706
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,964
- Guys, we need more ice.
- More. Get it in here.

707
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,884
You've been playing this scene
on a loop

708
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,262
<i>in your head
for the past two years,</i>

709
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:33,680
<i>and every single time,</i>

710
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:34,765
she ends up dead.

711
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,307
<i>And every single time,</i>

712
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,101
<i>you get framed for her murder.</i>

713
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:40,228
So why'd you go down
without a fight?

714
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,273
I...

715
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,609
I could've helped her.

716
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,363
I could've...

717
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,825
could've just said
I forgave her.

718
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,785
Oh, my God.

719
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:57,807
Can I reframe this for you,
please?

720
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:00,206
<i>She was a mentally ill,
selfish drug addict.</i>

721
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,000
<i>No, you don't know
a thing about her.</i>

722
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,354
<i>Except I do,
because I've been watching</i>

723
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,546
<i>the movie with you
ever since you got here.</i>

724
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,346
I don't want to die.

725
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:17,223
So don't.

726
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:19,058
You don't have to.

727
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:21,603
Choose me.

728
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,430
...The next step
is right in front of you.

729
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:28,860
You just have to take it
and be part of my family.

730
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,198
<i>You want to feel connection.</i>

731
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,574
<i>It's human.</i>

732
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,659
<i>But in the end,
it just hurts you.</i>

733
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,953
<i>You got blamed
for Rachel Wilson's death</i>

734
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:42,207
<i>because you were poor
and you were black.</i>

735
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:43,917
<i>That's where love got you.</i>

736
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,252
Why does that
not make you angry?

737
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:49,464
<i>I'm offering you a new life.</i>

738
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:50,882
<i>One without pain.</i>

739
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,092
<i>One without suffering.</i>

740
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,989
<i>Power is what
you've been missing.</i>

741
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:59,224
<i>Love without power is misery.</i>

742
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,436
Clark.

743
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,527
<i>Choose, Carter. Do it. Now.</i>

744
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,111
<i>You can curl up and die,</i>

745
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,841
<i>or you can be at the top
of the food chain.</i>

746
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:16,324
<i>You can cash in,
or you can run the table.</i>

747
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,826
<i>You can be the victim,
or you can be the perpetrator.</i>

748
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,495
<i>-Either way...</i>

749
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,308
<i>your heart
is going to stop beating</i>

750
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:24,457
<i>in eight seconds.</i>

751
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:27,168
<i>So, what's it gonna be?</i>

752
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:37,011
Jonas.

753
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,231
Jonas!

754
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:04,330
Lock it down!
Everybody out now!

755
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:08,084
Jonas.

756
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,129
Your mask.

757
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,131
- What?
- Whose blood is that?

758
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:18,508

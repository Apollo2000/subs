00:00:13,452 --> 00:00:15,829
<i>Stardate 57538.9.</i>

3
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:18,843
<i>The Cerritos is working
alongside the USS Merced</i>

4
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:21,180
<i>in the relocation
of an ancient generation ship,</i>

5
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:23,204
<i>which,
due to some unknown calamity,</i>

6
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,203
<i>never reached its destination.</i>

7
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:27,367
Her crew, adrift for centuries,

8
00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:29,641
mummified
in disabled cryo units.

9
00:00:29,726 --> 00:00:31,343
Their most precious cargo...

10
00:00:31,437 --> 00:00:33,622
Mysterious containers
of molecular fluid

11
00:00:33,707 --> 00:00:36,742
which generates life
from inorganic material.

12
00:00:36,898 --> 00:00:39,557
We suspect they planned
to use it on a dead planet

13
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,282
to create
a habitable environment

14
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:42,466
they could call home.

15
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,875
The Merced is here

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,907
To ensure the generation ship
is preserved

17
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:47,242
during transportation,

18
00:00:47,327 --> 00:00:49,828
and I want everyone
to give them full support.

19
00:00:49,913 --> 00:00:51,688
Captain Durango
and I both served

20
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:53,477
on the Illinois many years ago,

21
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:55,140
and it is a true delight to be

22
00:00:55,225 --> 00:00:58,046
able to work with him again.

23
00:00:58,138 --> 00:00:59,722
Trouble sleeping, Ensign?

24
00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:01,968
No, I slept great. I mean,
maybe too good, honestly.

25
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:03,971
Just distribute the PADDs.

26
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:06,099
Starfleet believes
this alien vessel

27
00:01:06,184 --> 00:01:08,794
is equipped with unique
terraforming technology:

28
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,994
An elemental fluid
which can transform inert matter

29
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:13,788
into a living ecosystem.

30
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:16,500
Towing it will be
a delicate procedure.

31
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:18,877
Even the slightest flux in tractor beam

32
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:20,504
Stabilization could damage...

33
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,341
Oh. Oh, I am so sorry.
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:25,634
It is just so much
information.

35
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,344
I don't know
how you guys aren't yawning.

36
00:01:27,428 --> 00:01:30,514
Your crew doesn't
appear to appreciate the gravity

37
00:01:30,598 --> 00:01:31,890
of our undertaking, Captain.

38
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:33,433
I assure you, Captain,

39
00:01:33,517 --> 00:01:35,352
my people are the best
in the fleet.

40
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:36,937
They're proficient, alert and...

41
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:38,563
Mariner!

42
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:40,607
I am trying to hold it in!

43
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:46,822

44
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:05,120

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,660
Ugh!

48
00:02:55,745 --> 00:02:57,191
I had to yawn, okay?
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:59,637
That guy is super boring.
Like, "Oh, I'm boring.

50
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:02,663
I love museums
and dust and old gates."

51
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:05,166
I know he's boring.
He's been boring for 15 years!

52
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,460
But right now, he's telling
everyone on the Merced

53
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:09,754
That I don't have the respect
of my crew.

54
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:11,797
If you ever
disrespect me like that again,

55
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:14,700
I'll skip the court-martial
and blow you out the airlock.

56
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:17,219
Cool.
Well, live long and prosper.

57
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:20,347
Don't you give me
that sarcastic Vulcan salute!

58
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:21,644
Beckett!

59
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:25,061
Captain, I have the sensor data
that you requested.

60
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:27,146
Huh? Oh, right. The sensors.

61
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,024
Ugh. I'm sorry, Jack.
It's just Ensign Mariner.

62
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:32,749
Ugh. I feel like
she stays up all night

63
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:34,874
Coming up with new ways
to piss me off.

64
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,211
I honestly don't know why you
haven't kicked her off the ship.

65
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:39,460
But since it's not my job

66
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:40,717
to question your motives...

67
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:42,061
If you want to avoid
conflict,

68
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:44,080
why not reassign her
to all the worst jobs?

69
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:47,041
That way, transferring
would be her idea, not yours.

70
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,461
Hmm.

71
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:50,020
Well, we could reassign her

72
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:52,421
to all the nastiest jobs
on the ship.

73
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:56,155
That way, transferring her
would be her idea, not mine.

74
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,719
Brilliant plan.
That's why you're the captain.

75
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:00,858
Assignment time!

76
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:02,256
Hatchi machi!

77
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:05,059
I got conference room
cleanup duty. In your face!

78
00:04:05,143 --> 00:04:06,835
Last time I checked, that was very lame.

79
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,895
Why would you dance?
That's not a danceable job.

80
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,731
That's where all the
senior officer action happens!

81
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:13,463
Plus, they have access to better
replicator programs than we do,

82
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:14,860
And sometimes
they let you eat with them!

83
00:04:14,944 --> 00:04:15,945
It's, like,
basically the same food.

84
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,158
No, it's not!

85
00:04:17,243 --> 00:04:19,010
They get, like, gnocchi
and fritters and...

86
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:20,533
doesn't matter.
It's good, okay?

87
00:04:20,617 --> 00:04:22,076
Oh, man. I got to monitor

88
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,947
power fluctuations
in the tractor beam?

89
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:25,704
I wanted to monitor
power fluctuations

90
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:27,181
in the impulse relays.

91
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,124
Rutherford! I'm about
to go watch an ascension.

92
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,377
What? That's amazing!
What's an ascension?

93
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:32,604
Some people who master the art

94
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:34,712
of alien meditation
can achieve inner peace.

95
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:36,417
Then they transcend
the physical realm

96
00:04:36,502 --> 00:04:38,634
and become a being
of pure energy.

97
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:41,460
- Isn't that cool?
- Oh, like a Q or a the Traveler?

98
00:04:41,545 --> 00:04:43,889
No! It's more like studying
so much for a test

99
00:04:43,973 --> 00:04:45,641
that you literally
become the test.

100
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:48,018
You become everything!

101
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:49,103
Damn, that is cool.

102
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:51,564
I can't believe I actually get
to see it in person!

103
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:52,940
I wonder
if it's gonna make a sound

104
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:55,192
like "vrr" or "hmm" or "whoo."

105
00:04:55,276 --> 00:04:57,945
I guess I'll know soon!

106
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:01,073
Anyway, let's see
what I got assigned.

107
00:05:01,157 --> 00:05:03,909
"Turbolift lubing,
holodeck waste removal

108
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:06,078
and scraping carbon
off the carbon filter"?

109
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:08,497
Ooh. Those are the worst jobs
on the ship.

110
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:10,624
Scraping carbon off
of slightly harder carbon?

111
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,251
That's Klingon prison stuff.

112
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:13,919
This is weird.

113
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,426
Wow.

114
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,927
Wow.

115
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:23,304
Oh.

116
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,142
As I grow closer
to decorporation,

117
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:30,644
words start to lose meaning.

118
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:33,814
Hey, are-are we supposed
to join in?

119
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:36,317
Hmm...

120
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:38,485
A tzutchian gong?!

121
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:43,949
- Oh.
- What's happening?

122
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:44,992
- Is he ascending?
- I think he's ascending.

123
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:47,286
- He's ascending.
- Really?! No, no, no, no!

124
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,791
- Aah!
- My sand mandala!

125
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,960
- No, no, no, no!
- I can fix it! I can fix it!

126
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:57,463
I've been laying that
for two years!

127
00:05:57,547 --> 00:06:00,299
It was a physical representation
of my inner calm!

128
00:06:00,383 --> 00:06:01,634
No, no, it's gonna...
It's gonna be totally fine.

129
00:06:01,718 --> 00:06:02,968
Just keep ascending! Computer,

130
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:05,471
colorful sand, room temperature.

131
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:07,681
Well, uh... there.

132
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:09,350
See? It's-it's... it's all good.

133
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:12,645
We're good. We're good.
It's fine. Uh...

134
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:13,979
If I had known I was going

135
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:15,439
to be emptying
the holodeck biofilters,

136
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:16,690
I wouldn't have had so much
for breakfast.

137
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:18,317
Welp, have fun
with your terrible jobs.

138
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:19,652
I got to go clean
the executive conference room

139
00:06:19,736 --> 00:06:21,695
and eat some lobster ravioli.
Peace.

140
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:23,530
Uh, no. Uh-uh. Sorry.

141
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:25,991
It does not look cool
when you do it.

142
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:28,202
Damn it, it does.

143
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,714
Ugh.

144
00:06:41,924 --> 00:06:44,551
Computer,
emergency stop turbolift nine!

145
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:48,180
Ugh!
Hey, I'm working up here!

146
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:49,556
Sorry.

147
00:06:57,482 --> 00:07:00,567
Oh, this is the worst!
Oh, wait a minute.

148
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:02,236
Hey, buddy, do you want
to make this interesting?

149
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,613
How? Like, bet on who can finish
their piece first?

150
00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:06,282
- Yeah.
- All right, sure. Why not?

151
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:07,574
Yeah, I'll get in on that.

152
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:14,790
All right! Hell yeah!

153
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:18,669
Syncing tractor beams
in three, two, one.

154
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:25,634
Whoa. I was wrong.
These fluctuations are great.

155
00:07:25,718 --> 00:07:27,845
Aw, man,
look at these amplitudes!

156
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:34,727
Hi. Um, I just... I feel
terrible about the... you know.

157
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:36,979
Don't worry about it.
Don't talk to me.

158
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:40,065
Anyway, I went
and found a Hiverian metronome,

159
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:41,525
and apparently,
if you just relax

160
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:43,235
and let it sync
to your biorhythm,

161
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,071
we can get you back on track
and ascending by this afternoon!

162
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:49,074
You think I can realign a decade
of spiritual enlightenment

163
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:50,576
by this afternoon?!

164
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,077
Tomorrow morning at the latest.

165
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:53,495
You just have
to find your calm. Ah!

166
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:55,497
I... don't... want...

167
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:57,959
your... help!

168
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:03,255
Has Mariner submitted
her transfer request?

169
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:05,591
I'm going to frame it.

170
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:07,301
She's... having a great time.

171
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:08,927
- What?!
- She's finding little ways

172
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:11,722
to inject joy
into otherwise horrible tasks.

173
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:13,265
Then give her worse jobs.

174
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:14,767
I've got her emptying

175
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:16,519
out of the holodeck's
filter!

176
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:20,178
Ugh.
People really use it for that?

177
00:08:20,263 --> 00:08:21,694
Oh, yeah, it's mostly that.

178
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:23,984
Oh, if she finds a way
to enjoy that,

179
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:26,311
then what the hell are we gonna
do to get her to resign?

180
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:27,873
I don't know,
but there has to be

181
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,877
something
on this ship she hates.

182
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,881
Hmm...

183
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:38,291
Ensign Mariner,
report to Conference Room Five.

184
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:46,465
Whoa-hoa,
another conference room meeting?

185
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:49,093
Shocker. You guys debating
the Prime Directive again?

186
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:51,178
Pretty fascinating stuff.

187
00:08:51,262 --> 00:08:53,138
What is...?

188
00:08:53,222 --> 00:08:54,348
No, no. No laughing.

189
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:55,557
I was making fun of you,
not with you.

190
00:08:55,641 --> 00:08:57,851
Well, since you're one
of us now,

191
00:08:57,935 --> 00:09:00,373
I guess you're making fun
of yourself.

192
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:01,507
What?

193
00:09:01,592 --> 00:09:04,191
- No.
- Ensign Beckett Mariner,

194
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:07,361
- No, no, no, no.
- I am pleased to grant you a promotion.

195
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:08,570
No!

196
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:10,656
Congratulations,
Lieutenant Mariner.

197
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,241
Lieutenant?

198
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:14,076
Lieu... Lieu... Lieutenant?

199
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,828
Looking forward
to serving with you

200
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:18,539
for a long, long time.

201
00:09:18,623 --> 00:09:20,999
Good job, Mariner.
Well earned, well earned.

202
00:09:22,335 --> 00:09:24,169
This is real! This is real!

203
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:26,380
Wow! Thanks.
I'm gonna take off.

204
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:29,842
Oh, right after this
very important meeting.

205
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:31,885
All right, meeting's started.

206
00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:34,221
We need to choose
new conference room chairs.

207
00:09:34,305 --> 00:09:36,723
A beige chair with a leather
strip right down the middle.

208
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:39,101
Hey! We all
agree that a strip of leather

209
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:40,602
is too ostentatious.

210
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:42,604
We did not all agree.

211
00:09:42,688 --> 00:09:44,731
Whoa, whoa,
whoa. What happened to the barstools?

212
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:45,816
Barstools hurt my back.

213
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,526
You're
not sitting on them right.

214
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,491
Not sitting on them right?

215
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:50,475
I've killed better men for less.

216
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,373
- No, you haven't.
- Well, I've threatened to kill better men

217
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,130
- for about the same.
- Strap in. This will take a while.

218
00:09:56,215 --> 00:09:57,633
Barstools are cool!

219
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:00,914
Lieutenant Mariner,

220
00:10:00,998 --> 00:10:02,598
report to command prep
for mission audit.

221
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,712
It's a monumental find, Captain.

222
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:08,714
Starfleet Command ought
to just start engraving my name

223
00:10:08,798 --> 00:10:10,367
on a plaque right now.

224
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:12,786
Oh, and yours, too, Durango,
of course.

225
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:13,963
There. I'm done.

226
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:16,484
Great work, Lieutenant.
Now you get to audit the audit.

227
00:10:18,057 --> 00:10:20,225
Lieutenant Mariner,
report to the officers' lounge

228
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:22,394
- for management training.
- No...

229
00:10:24,897 --> 00:10:27,024
♪ Oh, za-beeba-dodden,
doo-bah-dum-dow, yeah! ♪

230
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:29,610
And that's why being a captain
is a lot like vocal jazz...

231
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:31,570
It's all about the notes
you don't scat.

232
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:34,076
Oh, no. No.

233
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:36,909
Now, here to teach us about
promoting diverse perspectives,

234
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:39,411
welcome
Lieutenant Winger Bingston Jr.

235
00:10:39,495 --> 00:10:43,081
In his one-man show,
The United Federation

236
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:44,750
of Characters.

237
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:47,127
Oh, hello.
Didn't see you beam in there.

238
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:52,334
Lieutenant Mariner,
report to executive poker.

239
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,796
Oh...

240
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:56,256
Look alive, Mariner.

241
00:10:56,368 --> 00:10:59,245
This game's about to get
very interesting.

242
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:00,766
Hmm.

243
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:03,009
I...

244
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:04,867
...fold.

245
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:11,527
Fold.

246
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:15,822
Hmm...

247
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:17,115
She folds! You all fold!

248
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:18,992
Every time you all fold!
You fold!

249
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:20,359
Don't tell me what to do!

250
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:21,554
I'm gonna fold.

251
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,827
I'm all in!
Woops. I got nothin'.

252
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:24,954
Guess I lose.

253
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,179
Are you out of your mind?!

254
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:27,390
We don't go all in!

255
00:11:27,475 --> 00:11:28,892
It's a friendly game!

256
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:32,673
Oh-ho-ho... No.

257
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:35,467
Here I am,
trying to help the guy ascend,

258
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,469
and he won't even give me
a chance!

259
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:39,622
I want to help him so bad
it hurts!

260
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:41,807
Geez, I get that you want
to see an ascension happen, but,

261
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:43,517
- like, isn't this a bit much?
- No!

262
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:45,310
It's not enough!
I owe it to O'Connor.

263
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:47,813
I'm just gonna have to study
the ancient ways twice as much,

264
00:11:47,897 --> 00:11:49,856
just frickin' blow 'em away
with spirituality.

265
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,112
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I don't think
it works like that.

266
00:11:51,196 --> 00:11:52,784
Yeah? Well, it's gonna have to.
Wish me luck!

267
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:54,564
- And you can finish my lunch.
- It's okay.

268
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:57,860
I don't need another lunch.
Oh! Pudding!

269
00:11:57,945 --> 00:12:00,698
- You get your own quarters?
- Yeah. It's the worst.

270
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:02,218
I'm so far away from everyone.

271
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:04,763
What did you do? How did you...
how did you get this?

272
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:07,181
- Same thing I usually do.
- But-but I go above and beyond,

273
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:08,931
and you don't even try.
Why would they...?

274
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:10,943
I don't get it, either, man.
Bad is good. I don't know.

275
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:12,403
Lieutenant Mariner,
report to ops

276
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:13,861
for review of scheduled ops.

277
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:16,448
Oh, great! Ops!

278
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,284
Pray for me.

279
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:19,870
So...

280
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,664
they like
when you break rules, huh?

281
00:12:23,748 --> 00:12:25,791
Utique, saeculorum

282
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,416
lapsu...

283
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:30,295
- Don't you have work?
- Oh, I'm using my vacation days.

284
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,131
So, I realized,
if you mix and match prayers

285
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:33,330
from different cultures,

286
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:34,875
you can increase your chance
of ascending.

287
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,551
We can beat the system!

288
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:38,804
Please! Just get away from me!

289
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:41,140
These florkas are a vital part

290
00:12:41,224 --> 00:12:43,601
of the ascension process
for the Tamarians.

291
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:45,144
Stop it!
Don't come near me anymore.

292
00:12:45,228 --> 00:12:46,979
You don't get to be
the hero here,

293
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:49,648
because you are the villain.

294
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:52,026
- Aah!
- Just center yourself for five minutes!

295
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,779
Please. I'll align your chakra.

296
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:56,489
- I'll Reiki you.
- No!

297
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:58,337
Got to figure out a way
to be bad.

298
00:12:58,422 --> 00:13:00,424
Get a promotion. Got to be bad,
Boimler, got to be bad.

299
00:13:00,508 --> 00:13:02,112
Ensign
Boimler, report to bridge duty

300
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:05,807
- at 1530.
- Oh, I'll report to bridge duty,

301
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:08,456
and they'll get
exactly what they deserve!

302
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,127
- What?
- Uh... Oh, nothing.

303
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:12,505
That was a holodeck.
Uh, Moriarty.

304
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:14,173
Exactly what they deserve.

305
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:15,964
Mariner. Heh.

306
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:17,752
Care to share a status update?

307
00:13:17,837 --> 00:13:20,256
I don't know. We're towing a
rusted old ship full of mummies?

308
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,524
If you don't feel
like you fit in here,

309
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:24,945
I could find you a post
on another ship.

310
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,364
Mm, no, thanks.

311
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:28,279
Don't forget,
all senior officers

312
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:30,542
are meeting up later
for Ransom's birthday.

313
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:32,074
It's mandatory.

314
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:35,119
He's going to sing
and play acoustic guitar...

315
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:36,787
for hours.

316
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:40,040
And the songs, oh-ho,
well, he wrote them!

317
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:44,044
They're all about the month
he lived in Barcelona.

318
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:45,921
You know, I get
what you're trying to do here,

319
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:48,882
- and it is sick.
- I'm doing exactly what I need to.

320
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:50,426
It's called being a captain.

321
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,219
No, it's called being a dick!

322
00:14:00,277 --> 00:14:02,205
Are we reading any vibrations
in the hull?

323
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,188
No, sir.
The transport is going smoothly.

324
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:05,167
All readings are nominal.

325
00:14:05,252 --> 00:14:07,234
Move us closer
to the generation ship.

326
00:14:07,318 --> 00:14:10,237
Sir, I-I believe the Cerritos
is in a better position to...

327
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:11,947
We're in charge of this mission,
Lieutenant.

328
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:13,490
Our positioning
should reflect that.

329
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:15,368
- Take us in.
- Yes, sir.

330
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,833
You know, there's
no peninsula more sensual

331
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:25,461
- than the... Iberian.
- Commander.

332
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,796
The Merced is maneuvering
awfully close to our tow sector.

333
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,298
What? Put them on-screen.

334
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:32,095
Captain Durango,
you are way out of formation.

335
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,885
I don't have to explain myself
to you, Commander.

336
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,437
The protection of this artifact
is my duty. Mine!

337
00:14:55,953 --> 00:14:57,962
- Durango!
- Sir, I'm reading

338
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,770
a highly carbonized
particle cloud erupting

339
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:02,018
- from the generation ship.
- Terraforming emulsion

340
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:04,541
has engulfed our hull!
It's transfor...

341
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:06,836
It's being funneled towards us
on the tractor beam!

342
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:09,166
- Evasive maneuver alpha!
- It's too late!

343
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:18,097
Captain,

344
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:19,473
we have
a serious problem here.

345
00:15:19,557 --> 00:15:21,970
Terraforming fluid
is dissolving the hull.

346
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,214
- Structural integrity is in serious jeopardy of breaking...
- Here's your coffee, sir.

347
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,436
- Woops.
- Aah! Are you out of your mind?!

348
00:15:26,521 --> 00:15:28,480
Environmental
irregularities detected.

349
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:31,609
Emergency force field,
Corridor 89!

350
00:15:33,738 --> 00:15:34,988
Whoa, did you feel that?

351
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:36,657
Humidity's up.
The pressure just dropped.

352
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:38,867
- I think the air's being modified.
- Not on my watch.

353
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:41,662
This is your watch, right now.
It is literally happening now.

354
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:43,330
Oh, can you not,
even for a moment...

355
00:15:43,414 --> 00:15:45,082
Look out!

356
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,461
Unauthorized terraformation.

357
00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:02,297
Whoa!

358
00:16:06,854 --> 00:16:08,263
Ah!

359
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:10,308
- What's happening?
- I don't know!

360
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,443
No!

361
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:14,779
Damn this gorgeous coral!

362
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:16,799
Well, this is just great!

363
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:19,510
I could have been one
with the universe right now.

364
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:21,137
This is all your fault!

365
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:23,306
You know what?
I'm glad you didn't ascend,

366
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,183
- 'cause you're a jerk!
- Yeah, right.

367
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:26,809
You've been obsessed
with ascending me.

368
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:28,519
I don't care
about you ascending.

369
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:30,688
All I really wanted was
for you to like me!

370
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:32,190
Wait. Wh-What?

371
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:34,484
It kills me
when someone doesn't like me.

372
00:16:34,568 --> 00:16:36,486
I can't sleep.
It's all I think about. It feels

373
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,862
like ants in my brain.

374
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:39,530
- Yeah. No, I get that.
- Oh, please.

375
00:16:39,614 --> 00:16:41,825
You haven't had
a negative thought for years.

376
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,210
Well, since we're gonna die
here, I'll just tell you.

377
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:53,836
I was never going to ascend.

378
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,100
I was faking.

379
00:16:55,185 --> 00:16:58,201
- What? Why?
- It's hard to stand out in Starfleet.

380
00:16:58,286 --> 00:17:00,677
This gave me an edge.
It was my thing.

381
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:02,387
I was the ascension guy.

382
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:04,555
But then, I was going
for so long not ascending

383
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:07,058
that I got worried that people
would catch on, which is why

384
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:08,351
I used you as cover.

385
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:09,727
I'm a jerk.

386
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,521
We're both jerks!

387
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:13,523
We wanted to be liked,
and lied about it.

388
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:15,108
I think that means
we're best friends!

389
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:18,444
I'm about to die
with my best friend!

390
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:22,156
If we can get down
to the environmental controls,

391
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,255
- there might be a way to reverse this.
- Uh... mm.

392
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,255
Are you sure
that's the best rock for this?

393
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,436
What? Yes. No.
Yes, it's fine. It's a rock.

394
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:30,185
Look, I'm-I'm just saying,

395
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,967
I think you should use
the shale over there.

396
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,470
Mom, it is the same thing.
Just leave me alone.

397
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:37,170
It's just maybe you'd want one
with more of a point.

398
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:38,213
Oh, my God! Why do you

399
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:40,258
have to second-guess every
choice I make?

400
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:42,084
...suggestion to help you,
Beckett. What-what

401
00:17:42,168 --> 00:17:43,075
- am I supposed to do?
- Right?

402
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,411
Just stand by and let you keep
making a mistake?

403
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:48,540
What I would prefer is
if you would just let me do me.

404
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:50,975
There. See?

405
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,270
The rock was fine.

406
00:17:52,408 --> 00:17:54,535
Yeah, well, we could have
gotten here faster.

407
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,045
- You're going a little fast, don't you think?
- Yup.

408
00:17:58,129 --> 00:17:59,889
- I thought you wanted fast.
- Not that fast.

409
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:01,612
Are you trying
to get us killed here?

410
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:04,657
Make sure
you're gripping with both hands.

411
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:06,993
You know, okay, okay,
you know what?

412
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:08,286
- Maybe I should just lead.
- Oh, my God!

413
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,121
Will you just stop?!

414
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:12,415
I am good at this.
Just trust me!

415
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:14,250
- Well, I'm just looking out for you.
- Yeah.

416
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:16,919
That's the whole problem, Mom.
You treat me like a child.

417
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:19,339
Well, if you would stop acting
like a child

418
00:18:19,423 --> 00:18:21,299
and more like
a mature crew member,

419
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:22,633
then I would treat you
accordingly.

420
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:24,260
Oh, you think I'm immature?

421
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:26,179
You're the one trying
to trick me into quitting.

422
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:27,841
How is that mature?

423
00:18:27,926 --> 00:18:30,220
Yeah, that's what I thought,
Carol.

424
00:18:30,305 --> 00:18:32,097
You did not
just call me "Carol."

425
00:18:32,182 --> 00:18:33,808
Whatever, Carol.

426
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,945
Oh, no, this is it!

427
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:01,882
Ah.

428
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:05,009
No!

429
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:07,053
Aah! No!

430
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:10,515
Get out of here!

431
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:13,059
I'll be okay.
You need to save yourself.

432
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:14,685
No way.
I'm not leaving you!

433
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:16,562
Tendi, it's okay.

434
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:18,356
I did this for you.

435
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,859
No!

436
00:19:22,235 --> 00:19:24,654
Yes! The systems
are still on line.

437
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:27,532
Affected areas are saturated
with carbon polymer dust.

438
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:30,201
We need Parizene gas. Flood the
ship, then trigger a reversion

439
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:32,203
with radiation
from the main deflector.

440
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:34,539
Unless you think
we should use a pointier rock.

441
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:38,042
No, that's... exactly what
I was going to suggest.

442
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:39,502
I'm just impressed.

443
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:41,504
You read my mission brief,
didn't you?

444
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:43,673
No. I... No.
Well, I mean, maybe a little,

445
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:46,050
but just ironically,
just so I could make fun of it.

446
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:48,428
Uh-huh. Okay.
Computer, hit it.

447
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:49,846
Hitting it.

448
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:02,775
Oh, my gosh.
We're gonna be okay!

449
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:05,027
Holy.
I was so ready to die.

450
00:20:05,111 --> 00:20:06,529
You saved my life.

451
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:08,030
You saved mine first.

452
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:13,244
Oh, no. What's happening?!

453
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,079
Oh, my gosh, you're ascending!

454
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:16,562
I am? I am!

455
00:20:16,654 --> 00:20:17,953
- Oh. Ah!
- It must have been when you saved me!

456
00:20:18,037 --> 00:20:19,750
When you were willing
to sacrifice yourself for me!

457
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:21,377
I pretended to be finding myself

458
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:23,647
for so long,
I guess I actually did!

459
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:25,413
I... Ow. Ooh, okay. Wow.

460
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:26,924
Oh, that actually burns.

461
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,352
Uh, is this supposed
to be happening?

462
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,383
- Uh-oh. Okay, you're smoking.
- It burns.

463
00:20:30,468 --> 00:20:31,679
It burns! Aah! Help!

464
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,181
Oh, I don't...
I don't want to ascend!

465
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,359
Drop and roll!

466
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,258
Drop and roll! Drop back
into the physical and roll.

467
00:20:37,342 --> 00:20:39,103
- Drop back into the physical and roll!
- Aah!

468
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:40,563
Time has no meaning!

469
00:20:40,647 --> 00:20:41,939
Aah! No, it's happening!

470
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:43,774
I'm everywhere and nowhere!

471
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:45,943
I can see everything!

472
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:48,404
I'm turning into pure energy!

473
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:50,281
- Why is it taking so long?!
- Aah!

474
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,575
Aah! I see Abraham Lincoln!

475
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:56,078
The universe is balanced
on the back of a giant koala!

476
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:59,248
Why is he smiling?
What does he know?

477
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:02,502
The secret... of... life is...

478
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:10,843
Uh, all right. Well, good luck
being everything.

479
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:12,762
Sorry I helped.

480
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:14,931
- Ransom, report.
- All systems stable, Captain.

481
00:21:15,015 --> 00:21:16,933
But the Merced...
She had far greater exposure

482
00:21:17,017 --> 00:21:18,184
to the terraform cloud.

483
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:20,186
Her life support's critical.

484
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,146
Oh, man. At-at this point,
they need a whole new ship.

485
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,607
Or... a whole old one.

486
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:27,026
Initiating emergency transport
for all crew

487
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,820
of the Merced
to the generation ship.

488
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:30,363
Beam them
into the stasis chamber.

489
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:32,740
It's still sealed off
and should be safe.

490
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,325
Huh. Durango should be
right at home

491
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:36,661
with some dusty old mummies.

492
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,963
Oh, my gosh, we did it.
We did it!

493
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:49,049
All crew accounted for!

494
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:04,897
Captain Freeman,
Admiral Vassery is on his way.

495
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:06,315
Very good.

496
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:08,276
I'm really glad
we found a way to work together.

497
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,652
Yeah, you know,
it's a nice change of pace.

498
00:22:09,736 --> 00:22:11,028
Going for each other's jugulars

499
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:12,405
all the time is
kind of exhausting.

500
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:15,533
- I'm proud of you.
- Oh. Thanks, Mom.

501
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:17,994
Maybe you are fit to be one
of my senior officers.

502
00:22:18,078 --> 00:22:22,164
Your chair right next to mine,
spending all our time together,

503
00:22:22,248 --> 00:22:24,333
an unstoppable
mommy-daughter team!

504
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:28,838
Admiral Vassery,
welcome to the Cerritos.

505
00:22:28,922 --> 00:22:32,216
Starfleet commends your bravery
and ingenuity.

506
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,011
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to get back to work.

507
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:36,679
Apparently, we've picked up
a strange signal

508
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:38,014
on our sense-oars.

509
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:39,557
Quite all right, Admiral.

510
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:41,350
And what did
your sense-oars show?

511
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:43,853
Well, nothing at first,
but the long-range

512
00:22:43,937 --> 00:22:45,354
- sense-oars revealed...
- Whoa. Whoa.

513
00:22:45,438 --> 00:22:47,189
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. I am sorry.

514
00:22:47,273 --> 00:22:49,734
Are you trying to say the word
"sensors," 'cause to me,

515
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:51,694
you're saying "sense-oars."
What is that?

516
00:22:51,778 --> 00:22:53,738
That's how it's said.
"Sense-oars."

517
00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:56,866
- Everyone knows that.
- Sense-oars. Sense-oars.

518
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,200
Yes, that's right.
It sounds right to me.

519
00:22:58,284 --> 00:22:59,702
Me, too.
I say it like that.

520
00:22:59,786 --> 00:23:01,370
What? No, you don't.
This is nuts.

521
00:23:01,454 --> 00:23:02,872
Yo, she's making fun of you,
dummy.

522
00:23:02,956 --> 00:23:04,373
She doesn't say "sense-oars."

523
00:23:04,457 --> 00:23:06,208
- Well, of course I do.
- Stop it.

524
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:08,085
Is this
how your crew treats authority

525
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:10,212
when it's known
I mispronounce things?

526
00:23:10,296 --> 00:23:11,756
Are you really
making fawn of me?

527
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,215
Admiral, no.

528
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:14,926
I thought we came
to an understanding.

529
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,053
Uh, maybe you need
to adjust your "sense-oars."

530
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:18,471
Would you just stop?

531
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:20,640
I have never been shown
such disrespect and...

532
00:23:20,724 --> 00:23:23,100
Is she yawning?!

533
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:24,935
You know,
when O'Connor was screaming

534
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:26,937
and turning into energy,
it made me realize

535
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:28,939
that life's too short
to be hung up

536
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:30,941
on whether everyone
on the ship likes me.

537
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:33,110
That's great, 'cause I'm sure
there's at least a few

538
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:34,570
who don't.

539
00:23:34,654 --> 00:23:36,781
And who cares? Not me.

540
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:38,574
So, who are these few people?
What did they say?

541
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:40,284
Do they not like me?
You know what? I don't care.

542
00:23:40,368 --> 00:23:41,869
But if someone said something,
I feel like I should know.

543
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:42,953
Who was it?!

544
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:45,039
Where's your pip?

545
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,124
Uh, I'm pretty good
at getting demoted.

546
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,626
In the last hour?!

547
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,127
Uh, yeah. Apparently,
the captain doesn't like

548
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:51,796
looking stupid
in front of an admiral, so...

549
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,464
What I... But I-I can't.

550
00:23:53,548 --> 00:23:55,925
You-you had everything
that I ever wanted in life,

551
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:58,302
and you didn't even care!
How are we even friends?

552
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:01,263
Maybe because I still have
the senior officer access card

553
00:24:01,347 --> 00:24:02,721
for the good
replicator programs.

554
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:05,724
Oh! I'm gonna get that macaroni
and cheese with the breaded top!

555
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:10,456

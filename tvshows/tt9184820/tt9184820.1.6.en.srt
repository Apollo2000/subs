2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,620
What are you doing?

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,020
Sometimes I hum
warp engine sounds

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,660
just to, you know,
soothe myself.

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,516
Well, that is not what
the engine sounds like.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,460
Duh. That was Enterprise-D
at warp 4.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,960
This is Cerritos.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,630
It's like...

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,470
Fletcher, no. The Cerritos has
inverted plasma distributors,

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,190
so it's a little bit
higher pitch, like...

12
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,480
Wrong. The shhz doesn't come
from the distributors.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,706
It's the vibrations in the
dilithium dispersement manifold.

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,980
It's like this.
Fzzzzz...

15
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,650
No, guys, guys, it's like this.
Shhh...

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,650
Dude, I'm telling you,
it's Fzzz...

17
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,440
And Voyager was all...
jzzz...

18
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,320
Are we doing the engine sounds?

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Hchhhh...

20
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,490
Security to Deck 11.

21
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,990
Something is very wrong
down here.

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,790
On the ground, now!

23
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,830
- Ah! - We're just humming the...
- I said freeze!

24
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh, it is a little higher.

25
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,780
Security log, stardate 57663.9.

26
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,870
Our standoff with Drookmani
scavengers continues.

27
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,410
Their claim of salvage on
Starfleet cargo is ludicrous.

28
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,920
Thus far, my recommendation of
full assault has been ignored

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,080
in favor of a more...

30
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,130
diplomatic approach.

31
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,090
As I've already said, Captain,

32
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,090
while we appreciate your
discovery of this cargo,

33
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,430
we can only offer you
a finder's reward.

34
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,890
This trash is ours.
We claim salvage.

35
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,036
It has "Starfleet"
stamped on it.

36
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,060
That's our trash.

37
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,470
It's been abandoned

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,980
for more than 100 years!

39
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,940
That means it's clear
for salvage.

40
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,520
We're taking it!

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,610
Captain, they're
attempting to load that cargo

42
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,506
- with their tractor beam.
- Oh, no, they didn't.

43
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,650
Engage our tractor beam.

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,120
Those crates are brimming with
unique Starfleet technology.

45
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,620
We can't let them have it.

46
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,750
If we fire on them,
it's an act of war.

47
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,920
- I advise we fire on them.
- Shaxs!

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,170
Shields up.
Yellow alert.

49
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,210
Our goal is that
this doesn't turn violent.

50
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,130
But if it does, our crew is
ready and focused.

51
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,800
Fletcher! Fletcher! Fletcher...

52
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,720
That's like three cantaloupes
worth of purée.

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,810
- He could beat the record!
- He's doing it!

54
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,246
Come on, Fletcher,
sloupe that 'loupe!

55
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,140
- Whoo-hoo! Ooh...
- Aah!

56
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,480
Do you know how hard it is
to get cheese out of fur

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,940
in a sonic shower?!

58
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,150
Oh, no, I am so, so sorry.
I didn't mean to.

59
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,110
Don't try to butter
my bread, Ensign.

60
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,650
I've heard about you.

61
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,990
- But I didn't... What?
- You're a disgrace.

62
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,990
You want to goof around?
Go work on Starbase 80.

63
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,990
Damn. Starbase 80?

64
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,790
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize
cats ate nachos.

65
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,710
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

66
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,500
All right, all right, all right.
Here, Doc.

67
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,060
- Here's a warm towel.
- Give me that!

68
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,800
And some freshly replicated
nachos.

69
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,550
Try the carnitas.
It's delicioso.

70
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,050
At least someone around here
appreciates rank.

71
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,930
- Mm...
- Don't listen to her.

72
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,970
She's just a cat in a coat.

73
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,076
Thanks for defusing that,
Fletch.

74
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,640
I was about to go nuts.

75
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,560
Fletcher's like a natural
peace negotiator.

76
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,826
He was always getting us
out of trouble

77
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,560
back in the Academy.

78
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,690
Ha. Remember when
those Nausicans

79
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,190
tried to eat your heart?

80
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,530
Yeah, until you convinced them
just to spit in my face.

81
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,530
I was lucky you were there.

82
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,700
Uh, Mariner, you were lucky
he was here, too.

83
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,160
You know,
it's not very Starfleet

84
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,660
to take a swing
at the bridge crew.

85
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,660
Whatever. I'm Starfleet as hell.

86
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,096
And if somebody brings up
Starbase 80,

87
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,540
they better be ready
to throw down.

88
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,936
Hey, Mariner, don't let
the senior officers

89
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,870
get in your head.

90
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,870
You wouldn't be here
if you weren't great.

91
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,540
'Cause there's a baseline
of goodness

92
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,960
to everyone in Starfleet.

93
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,550
Even Boimler.

94
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,220
So, um, what do you think's
in that cargo

95
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,760
that has everyone so wound up?

96
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,180
A bunch of cryo-frozen
princesses

97
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,560
or maybe some fruit?

98
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,060
Ooh, I hope it's
old communicators.

99
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,616
You know, the original
clamshell design.

100
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,116
Ah! Do you think
we're going to find out?

101
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,940
Once they figure things out
with those aliens,

102
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,956
they'll probably us space walk
to get everything cataloged.

103
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,570
Uh, space walk? Really?

104
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,570
W-Why can't we just use
the cargo transporter?

105
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,876
- That stuff's too massive.
- Ah...

106
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,260
Wait, what's wrong? I thought
you loved archival cataloging.

107
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,740
You talk about it all the time.

108
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,740
I have a horrible secret.

109
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,040
I never finished my space-walk
unit at the Academy.

110
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,250
What? How did you graduate?

111
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,730
I don't know.
He just gave me a "B,"

112
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,910
and I didn't say anything.

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,920
It must have been
a clerical error.

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,290
I'm a monster.
Why didn't I just confess?!

115
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,090
Spacewalking is easy.

116
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,920
You just float and magnet.
Float and magnet.

117
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,590
But what if I forget to magnet?!

118
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,026
I'll spin out into
the void of space

119
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,050
and burn up in the atmosphere
of a gas giant.

120
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,156
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down.

121
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,100
That's not gonna happen.

122
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,100
Listen, I've been working on
this new holodeck

123
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,100
training program.

124
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,020
I think it can help you.

125
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,940
- You want to try it out?
- Oh, my gosh, yes.

126
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,230
Thank you. Thank you
so much, Rutherford. Ah!

127
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,770
The holodeck. Gah, why didn't I
think of that sooner?

128
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,836
Yeah, you know, it's not just
for hanging with Sherlock Holmes

129
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,110
and Robin Hood and Sigmund Freud
and Cyrano de Bergerac

130
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,796
and Einstein and da Vinci
and Stephen Hawking

131
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,910
and Socrates...

132
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,790
Oh, five isolinear
cores down and,

133
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,330
ugh, just a ton more to go.

134
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,120
You know, when you call
something a "core,"

135
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,890
it implies there's going to be
one big one,

136
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,330
not a million little ones.

137
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,380
Ugh, we're not gonna make it
to the Chu Chu dance.

138
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,340
I traded Kowalski 12 shifts
so I could go.

139
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,960
Chu Chu dance?

140
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,970
That sounds awesome.
Is it really that good?

141
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,760
Oh, yeah.
I saw the Zebulon Sisters do it

142
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,360
back on Deep Space 3,
and I am just now

143
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,970
coming down from the high.

144
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,060
- Chu Chu!
- Chu Chu.

145
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,310
- Oh, great. Everybody's going except us.
- Guys.

146
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,810
I can handle this on my own.

147
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,810
Go get your Chu Chu on.

148
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,150
Oh, no, no, no, we would not
make you do that.

149
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,320
You would do the same for me.
I've got this.

150
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,030
Lower Deckers stick together.

151
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,110
Fletcher,
that is super cool, man.

152
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,950
Hell yeah. Thanks, Fletcher.

153
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,046
Mariner, let's go get
our Chu Chu shirts.

154
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,160
We have Chu Chu shirts?

155
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,716
Yeah, I made us Chu Chu shirts,
come on.

156
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,830
Chu Chu!

157
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,830
Ah, back to work.

158
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,670
All right, don't you worry.

159
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,380
My program will
have you spacewalking

160
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,670
with the best of 'em.

161
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,300
Computer, load Rutherford
Training Beta 2.5.

162
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,880
Aah!

163
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,680
Hi. Can I teach you a lesson?

164
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,300
Aw. Well, who's this little guy?

165
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,680
This is Badgey.

166
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,446
He's a virtual tutor
who can walk you through

167
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,020
any Starfleet exercise
you can imagine.

168
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,350
Aw, look at his little arms.

169
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,850
Yeah, I made him cute.

170
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,150
Hi, Badgey, I'm Tendi.

171
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,190
Hi. Can I teach you a lesson?

172
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,796
Yes, um, can you show me
how to perform

173
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,700
an untethered cargo retrieval
in open space?

174
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,370
Sometimes it takes a second.

175
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,490
You got it.

176
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,710
Wow, you coded this yourself?

177
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,790
Yeah, it's just a hobby.

178
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,040
- But the gravitational waves were tricky.
- Ah!

179
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,090
Oh, uh, uh...

180
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,380
So this is spacewalking?

181
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,710
I like it.

182
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,946
Just don't get your magnet boots
too close to...

183
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,050
Oh!

184
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,720
Oh, we're stuck together.

185
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,100
I think we're stuck together.

186
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,220
Oh, sorry. Yeah.
Let me just...

187
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,890
Looks like you want
to recover lost cargo.

188
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,060
- Did I get that right?
- Oh, yeah. Almost forgot.

189
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,230
Coming right up.

190
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,240
Wow, look at him...
Look at him try.

191
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,900
Ugh, that shouldn't happen.

192
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,780
Badgey, restart cargo recovery.

193
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,030
Badgey, restart sequence!

194
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
Sorry, it usually works.

195
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,200
Badgey, stop it!

196
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,476
Uh, no, it's-it's nothing,
really.

197
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,120
Come on, you stupid glitch.

198
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,380
We're back in business.

199
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,420
I can't believe
I actually made eye contact

200
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,430
with one of the Zebulon Sisters.

201
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,260
Oh, God, I forgot
how to breathe.

202
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,760
Oh, my God, and then,
when they added the third Chu,

203
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,100
and they were doing
the Chu Chu Chu dance?

204
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,180
They're geniuses.

205
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,100
I'm glad we
did this together, Boims.

206
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,310
Sometimes you can be, like,
really not annoying.

207
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,480
Yeah. Sometimes you can be
not annoying, too.

208
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,780
Fletcher!

209
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,780
- Oh, no, I'm so woozy.
- Are you okay?

210
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,280
- What happened?
- Oh...

211
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,490
The core.
I was working on the core.

212
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,290
Everything was going fine,
until...

213
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,460
I couldn't move.
I-I couldn't breathe.

214
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,180
Fletcher, you tell me
who did this to you.

215
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,460
Uh, I don't know.

216
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,300
Next thing I knew,
you were here,

217
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,010
and now I'm saying this.

218
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,986
Guys, somebody made off with
one of the isolinear cores

219
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,010
for the shield array

220
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,510
Is that important?

221
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,140
Kinda. They regulate auto-repair
when the shield's damaged.

222
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,270
I messed up the shields?

223
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,810
Hey, hey, it's okay.
It's like a backup of a backup.

224
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,036
Seems like somebody wanted
to get you in trouble

225
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,086
without damaging the ship.

226
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,046
The next time the bridge
runs a shield diagnostic,

227
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,376
they'll definitely notice
it's missing.

228
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,820
I'm gonna get court-martialed.

229
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,216
No, you're not.
We can figure this out

230
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,320
before anyone notices.

231
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,320
We're the ones who
left you alone.

232
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,370
We have to work together
to get that core back.

233
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,290
Okay, who's shady as hell

234
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,040
and knows this system
as well as we do?

235
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,830
Delta Shift.

236
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,000
These creepy Delta Shift guys
have always

237
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,170
rubbed me the wrong way.

238
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,000
I mean, what, they do our jobs
while we sleep? So weird.

239
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,010
Check it out, guys.

240
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,010
Beta Shifters.

241
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,470
Shouldn't you guys be
getting ready for bed?

242
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,010
Hey, which one of you jerks

243
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,180
never bothers to wipe down
the diagnostic panel?

244
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,470
Other people use that thing.

245
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,180
- Um...
- Look, we don't want to be here.

246
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,140
I don't like us being awake
at the same time.

247
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,230
It feels wrong, okay?
But we need some answers.

248
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,360
Oh, damn, this must be
the Beta Shift's version

249
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
of a badass.

250
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,070
Mariner's a total badass!

251
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,626
And if you don't come clean,
she's gonna

252
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,030
(bleep) your (bleep) off!

253
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,240
Whoa, Fletcher, ease up, man.

254
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,596
Guys, I'm not gonna do that.
I'm so sorry.

255
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,200
Just give us the core, we'll go,

256
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,290
- and this can all be over.
- What core?

257
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,040
Oh, please. Puh-lease!

258
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,080
Look, someone knocked
Fletcher out

259
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,630
and stole an isolinear core.

260
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,380
Are you accusing us of assault?

261
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,250
Get out of here!

262
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,050
We don't know anything
about a core.

263
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,880
That's it.
You want some of this?

264
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,156
Where's the core?
Where's the core?

265
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,090
- Where's the core, dude? Where's the core?
- Guys, no, no.

266
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,616
- Don't undo your flaps.
- Do you want to dance?

267
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,180
I'll take you to the dance.

268
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,100
I'll pick you up
at your mom and dad's house.

269
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,390
You don't talk about my dad!

270
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,230
Wait, hold on.
When did this all go down?

271
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,060
Uh, I don't know.
A few hours ago.

272
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,560
What? We were at
the Chu Chu dance with you.

273
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,900
Oh, yeah.

274
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,570
- Oh!
- Chu Chu... Chu Chu dance.

275
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,966
Wow. A double dance.
Chu Chu dance.

276
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,450
Oh, my God, Chu Chu dance.

277
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,570
And at the end,
when they added the third Chu

278
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,240
and it became
the Chu Chu Chu dance,

279
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,410
I cried. I saw you crying, too.
Don't even lie.

280
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,120
Oh, damn, you were there.

281
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,580
Yeah, that checks out.
It had to be someone else, man.

282
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,920
Don't you remember anything?

283
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,420
I don't know. It was dark.

284
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,290
It was totally dark.
Couldn't see anything.

285
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,290
Whoa!

286
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,420
Did they just fire on us?

287
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,420
Impossible. These guys
don't even have weapons.

288
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,310
The Drookmani have reversed
their tractor beam

289
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,010
to launch the cargo
against our hull.

290
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,390
These guys are lucky
I'm so ethical and considerate.

291
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,666
Captain, something is wrong
with our shields.

292
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,110
They shouldn't be fading
this fast.

293
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,506
Permission to destroy
the enemy ship.

294
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,160
They're trying to bait us
into a fight.

295
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,450
We have to find a way
to end this peacefully.

296
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,370
We're Starfleet, damn it.

297
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,000
- Whoa!
- What? Aah!

298
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,130
Non-essential power diverted.

299
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,630
Safety protocols disabled.

300
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,090
What the heck?

301
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,696
Uh, we should get out of here.
Computer, end program.

302
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,430
I said computer, end program.

303
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,640
That's not good.

304
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,970
Badgey, run diagnostic.

305
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,470
You got it.

306
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,470
Ow!

307
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,310
Sorry about that.

308
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,150
I didn't mean to hurt you.

309
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,270
Badgey, what the hell?

310
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,690
Oh, guess I'm just
a stupid, worthless glitch!

311
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,990
Oh. Badgey?

312
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,510
Computer, re-engage
safety protocols.

313
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,110
Safety protocols are
unavailable.

314
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,240
Get off me.
He's corrupted!

315
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,540
Can I teach you a lesson?

316
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,630
Computer,
load Bajoran marketplace!

317
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,430
Put this on, put this on.
We got to blend in.

318
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,680
We got to keep going.

319
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,020
Fun fact,

320
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,020
I'm gonna rip your eyes out!

321
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,650
That fact wasn't fun!

322
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,870
Our shields can't take
much more of this.

323
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,186
These guys are begging
for a fight.

324
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,710
I say we give it to 'em.

325
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,436
Phasers locked
onto their warp core, Captain.

326
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,670
Please, please let me
shoot their warp core.

327
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,050
I have been very good
this month.

328
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,170
- Evasive pattern Sulu-Alpha.
- Oh, come on!

329
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,930
I thought you said this trash
wasn't worth fighting for.

330
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,140
We're not fighting.

331
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,930
Avoiding damage is fighting.

332
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,180
We can talk this out.

333
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,430
(bleep) you.

334
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,730
Oh, man, the shields
must be slammed.

335
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,190
If they fall below 50%,
they'll realize the core's gone.

336
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,796
- And then I'll be gone.
- Wait, wait, wait.

337
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,086
I thought Drookmani
were just scavengers.

338
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,320
The Drookmani!
I bet they took the core,

339
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,990
to mess with our defenses.

340
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,466
The guy who zapped me
was definitely an alien.

341
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,910
We got to report this
to the bridge.

342
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,976
Whoa, hold up. We got to scan
the ship for intruders,

343
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,436
I'm not going to the captain
without proof.

344
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,210
Okay, let's go.
Let's go get our scanners.

345
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,710
Okay, listen.

346
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,106
I'll search decks
two through ten.

347
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,090
Fletcher, you... the... Huh?

348
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,260
The core?
Fletcher, it was in your bunk?

349
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,970
Uh, uh, aliens.
It's, uh, aliens.

350
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,270
Those frickin' aliens,
I knew they'd do this.

351
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,720
They're gonna frame me.

352
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,230
- I knew it.
- Fletcher.

353
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,270
I messed up, you guys.

354
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,110
Oh, man, I really messed up.

355
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,820
- I'm the worst! I'm slime!
- Stop it!

356
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,166
- Get ahold of yourself and shut up.
- Stupid, stupid Fletcher!

357
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,200
Just tell us what you did.

358
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
When you guys went
to the Chu Chu dance,

359
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,120
I was doing all that
rewiring on my own,

360
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,410
and it was getting so hard,
so, I was like,

361
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,250
"This would be so much easier
if I were smarter."

362
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,790
And then I was like,
"Wait. The computer's smart.

363
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,300
- "Maybe it can make me smart."
- What?

364
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,300
So I hooked it up
directly to my brain,

365
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,170
and let it run
so it would make me smarter.

366
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,340
Ooh, boy,
that is not a good idea.

367
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,470
Neural pathway established.

368
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,270
But I didn't get smarter.

369
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,270
It broke and I peed my pants.

370
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,980
So I hid down here
and told you guys

371
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,996
I had been attacked
so you wouldn't feel let down.

372
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,166
Yeah, I don't kn... uh, I don't
know what to do with this.

373
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,320
We're supposed to have each
other's backs, Fletcher!

374
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,820
You were gonna lie to the
captain about an alien attack?

375
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,110
You could have started a war.

376
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,780
Come on, just back me up.

377
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,990
All we do is back you up,
and all you do is lie!

378
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,370
I just wanted you
to be proud of me.

379
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,790
I messed up.

380
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,790
It's... ugh... it's okay.

381
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,000
We can reformat the core
and put this all behind us.

382
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,000
- I guess.
- Really?

383
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,170
Oh, thanks, you guys.

384
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,180
You know, I've actually
learned a lot today.

385
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,340
This has been, like,
a learning experience for me.

386
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,180
That's all that matters.
And you know what?

387
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,220
We're Starfleet.
We are Starfleet.

388
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,270
And when we make
mistakes, we learn...

389
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,890
Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!

390
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,200
- What did you do to it?
- I don't know!

391
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,570
- Make me smarter.
- Make me smarter.

392
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,306
Ugh, Fletcher, your brain waves
corrupted that thing.

393
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,160
It's incorporating anything
it can get its grabber on.

394
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,920
- Fletcher, you've got to call this in!
- But I'll get in trouble!

395
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,646
If this thing gets loose it could
mess up the ship. Show me something!

396
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,090
Alert the captain right now!

397
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,840
You're right. Just let me
get my tricorder here...

398
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,050
Hello! Die! Die! Die!

399
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,590
- Fletcher!
- Dummy!

400
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,720
Dummy! Party of dumbass!

401
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,350
- Me smart.
- Get off of me! Let go!

402
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,730
You help me or I'll say
this was all your idea.

403
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,110
I'm not going down for this.

404
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,980
Dude, what you're doing
is so not Starfleet.

405
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,230
You break rules all the time.

406
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,860
Only dumb rules
that shouldn't be there

407
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,240
so I can do a better job.

408
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,780
I would never
put anyone in danger.

409
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,120
Except sometimes maybe Boimler.

410
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,870
Stupid, stupid Fletcher!

411
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,420
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

412
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,000
Here's a tip.

413
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:33,260
I'm going to burn
your hearts in a fire!

414
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,640
- Leave us alone, Badgey!
- No!

415
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,970
- You were only trying to help.
- No, I was trying to show off.

416
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,286
I knew Badgey wasn't ready yet,
but I wanted to impress you.

417
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,060
I just think you're really cool.
I'm an idiot.

418
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,770
Aw, Rutherford,
you impress me every day.

419
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,270
You're very scientific.

420
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,280
I mean, Badgey's
an amazing piece of programming,

421
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,070
- even if he does want to kill us.
- Yeah.

422
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,950
He is a killing machine,
isn't he?

423
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,410
It's actually weird
that he hasn't murdered us yet.

424
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,280
Hope you're ready to die.

425
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,910
Just as soon as I...
get up there...

426
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,170
gonna kill you.

427
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,806
Aw. Poor little guy's
really having trouble

428
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,130
with those stairs.

429
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,710
You've got this, Badgey!
Wait, what am I doing?

430
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,026
He shouldn't be affected
by the physical parameters

431
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,260
of the simulation.

432
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,930
I'm gonna wear your skin!

433
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,430
Wait, if we're tiring him out,

434
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,310
then maybe we can
freeze him out.

435
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,810
Computer, load environment 83.

436
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,810
Quick. Come on.

437
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,360
Shield integrity 40%
and dropping.

438
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,190
Automatic repair is down,
switching to manual.

439
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,320
Dummy! Dummy!

440
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,466
Quick. Grab that edge,
we got to drag it...

441
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,280
Guys, wait. I know what to do.

442
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,700
You figured out how to fix it?

443
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,870
I wish. No.

444
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,750
We let this thing
beat us up a little,

445
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,226
then later we say
that a Q showed up

446
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,830
and caused all of this.

447
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,000
Nobody will doubt us
'cause we'll be all busted up

448
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,840
and, you know,
Qs are super unpredictable.

449
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,170
Here, help me feed some stuff

450
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,396
into this thing
so it gets bigger.

451
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,220
Delicioso.

452
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,340
Oh, real nice, guys.
Let me out of here! Come on!

453
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,390
- The Q thing's a good idea!
- Let go!

454
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,060
Uh, it just incorporated
a light panel.

455
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,286
We've got to get it
to the transporter

456
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,730
before it's too big to move.

457
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,286
I know you guys were friends
at the Academy,

458
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,480
I do not like Fletcher.

459
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,480
Ow! We got to rethink
this whole

460
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,190
"Lower Decks stands together"
thing.

461
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,150
- What you got?
- You know, it's kind of nice

462
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,740
that we aren't
fighting for once.

463
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,160
Yeah. I guess we make
a good team.

464
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,410
- What you got?
- From now on,

465
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,030
some Lower Deckers
stand together.

466
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,040
Come on, bro, square up.

467
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,080
Whoa! Oh, no.

468
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,500
Oh, (bleep), there's no way

469
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,290
we're gonna make it
to the transporter.

470
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,380
Airlock.

471
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,050
Aliens. It's, uh, aliens.

472
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,300
Those frickin aliens!

473
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,920
Here. Fetch!

474
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,180
Whoa! I got this.

475
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,050
You don't talk about my dad!

476
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,760
Whew.

477
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,230
- Oh, that was close.
- Ooh, yeah. Disaster averted.

478
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,560
Wait, wait. Is it drifting
towards the Drookmani?

479
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,070
No, no, no, no...

480
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,570
Oh, no.

481
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,950
We are so getting fired
for this.

482
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,410
Shields are down, Captain.

483
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,200
I have done everything I can to
respect their sanctity of life,

484
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,290
to avoid conflict, and give them
the benefit of the doubt.

485
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,840
The Drookmani
have given me no choice.

486
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,460
Shaxs, target their warp core.

487
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,920
Yes!

488
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,130
No! We waited too long.

489
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,090
Weapons systems are down.

490
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,260
We need to get the crew
into escape pods now.

491
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,600
Prepare to abandon ship.

492
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,350
Wait, Captain. Look.
What is that?

493
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,480
- Uh...
- We did it!

494
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,320
I don't know what we did,
but we did it!

495
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,990
Stay awake, Tendi.
We can do this.

496
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,540
Did... did we lose him?

497
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,620
Uh, yeah. We're doing fine.

498
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,170
We're so good. Keep going.

499
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,090
Ah. Not running anymore, Father?

500
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,590
This ends now, Badgey.

501
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,590
After I gut you, I'm gonna slit

502
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,470
your little green friend's
throat

503
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,970
and take a bath in her blood.

504
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,970
No, you're not!

505
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,490
I'm gonna wear your skin!

506
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,630
You can't hurt me, Father.

507
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:47,050
Maybe with your disappointment,
but not with your fists.

508
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,260
I'm sorry I yelled at you, son.

509
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,180
I was just trying
to impress Tendi.

510
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,350
I mean, look at her.
She's so cute.

511
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,060
It's too late for apologies.

512
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,520
It's too...

513
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,980
Kill you...

514
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,190
So cold. Father?

515
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,410
I'm so sorry
it came to this, Badgey.

516
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,910
I'm gonna cut off your foot.

517
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,450
No. Don't talk.

518
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,420
- It's over now.
- Diplomatic immunity.

519
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,340
Badgey!

520
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,130
Got it. Restoring main power.

521
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,100
Safety protocols restored.

522
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,310
Hi. Can I teach you a lesson?

523
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,100
- Oh, hey. Hi, Badgey.
- Um...

524
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,940
Um, does he remember
he was trying to, uh...

525
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,190
Remember what?
Can I teach you a lesson?

526
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,996
Nope, nope, nope, nope.
Actually, you know what?

527
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,586
- We were just heading out.
- Yeah, yeah, we're-we're good.

528
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,070
Thanks, Badgey.

529
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,570
You got it. If you need me,
Badgey's here.

530
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,950
I'm always here.

531
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,200
Ow, my frickin' wrists
are all chafed.

532
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,580
Good. Shut up.

533
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,580
That core had my brain pattern
all over it.

534
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,580
If they find it
and kick me off the ship,

535
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,080
you're going down with me.

536
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,516
What the hell is going on
down here?

537
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,420
We've got an unauthorized
airlock ejection,

538
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,380
a missing computer core,
and somebody attacked

539
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,050
that Drookmani ship.

540
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,130
You three better have one hell
of an explanation.

541
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,760
Oh, I'll tell you
exactly what happened.

542
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,060
Ensign Fletcher's

543
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,060
brilliant improvisation,

544
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,310
updating the isolinear core
to weaponize it

545
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,440
against the Drookmani
saved the Cerritos.

546
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,980
Fletcher demonstrated
the sort of selfless heroism

547
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,650
that Starfleet's all about.

548
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,990
It's that heroism that
earned him a promotion

549
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,990
and a transfer to the Titan!

550
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,280
Oh, man.

551
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,660
Wow.

552
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,580
Did we have to get him promoted?

553
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,346
Eh, you know what they say,
keep your friends close

554
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,500
and your enemies
way the hell somewhere else.

555
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,080
Whoa. The Titan.

556
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,460
Isn't that, like,
your dream gig?

557
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,340
Yeah. It is.

558
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,356
But you know what, maybe this
is just what Fletcher needs

559
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,420
to turn things around.

560
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,300
New ship, new duties.

561
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,470
It might just make him
a better man.

562
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,010
I got frickin' fired!

563
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,470
What? You, fired?

564
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,640
Who would fire you, ever?

565
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,666
It's like, who says you're not
supposed to empty trash

566
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,770
into the warp core?
It all burns up anyway.

567
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,020
Oh, yeah, who wouldn't make
that mistake?

568
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,166
I thought maybe you guys
could, like, put in

569
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,756
- a good word for me or...
- Uh, hey, Fletcher?

570
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,610
Fletcher. Sorry,
you're breaking up.

571
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,586
I think you're going through
a temporal rift or something.

572
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,410
- A rift? What a... Hello?
- Whoa, Fletcher, there's a Q.

573
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,556
- I'm holding my badge up...
- There's a Q doing crazy Q stuff.

574
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,290
- Got to go.
- Can you hear me? Guys...

575
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,160
Well, he's Earth's problem now.

576
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,106
Got to say, I'd rather serve
with a dozen of you

577
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,380
than one Fletcher.

578
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,816
I mean, yeah, you break
the rules all the time,

579
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,460
but at your heart,
you're Starfleet.

580
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,236
Aw, Boimler. That's really nice.
Thanks, man.

581
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,736
Now come on. I got the keys
to the captain's yacht.

582
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,196
Wait, what?
You shouldn't have those.

583
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,696
No, it's cool.
I signed them out in your name.

584
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,736
- Last one there's a Fletcher.
- Wait. No, no, no.

585
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,970
That's not the lesson here!

586
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,260
Lower Decks, let's go!

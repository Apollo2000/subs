2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,611
The lizard men will no longer
be subject to rat oppression!

3
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,614
Aw, they're not oppressed.

4
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,741
We raise them as food.

5
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:33,742
They-they like it.

6
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,118
Well, we are delicious.

7
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,513
- No. You should be free
to do whatever you want.

8
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,623
- What do lizards like to do?
- Mm, bask?

9
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,519
- Okay. Then you should
bask without fear of being eaten.

10
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,753
Well, that does sounds nice.

11
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,296
This will not stand!

12
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,482
- Buddy, my captain's on the way right now.
- Buddy, my captain's on the way right now.

13
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,860
It's funny. Normally, I'm, like,
a huge disappointment to her,

14
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,260
but this time
she's gonna be pumped

15
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,970
that I rooted out injustice.

16
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,346
And here comes the praise,

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,307
- in five...
- Attention, everyone.

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,286
- I'm afraid my ensign
has made a huge mistake.

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,895
- What?
- Starfleet is forbidden

20
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,105
from interfering
in your planetary politics.

21
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,167
- You will be free to determine your future
- You will be free to determine your future

22
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,817
Without our influence.

23
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,945
What? How could you...
Oh, screw the Prime Directive!

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,947
Hey.

25
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,783
You are way out of bounds here.

26
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:15,992
They're eating those guys.

27
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:17,160
What am I supposed to do?

28
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,345
- Report it to me.
- Report it to me.

29
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,206
Now I have to explain why
there's an interspecies war

30
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,541
on a planet
that was peaceful yesterday!

31
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,728
- Oh, so you're yelling at
me for spreading freedom

32
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,837
Because you don't feel
like filing a report?

33
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,692
- Mariner, I swear,
if you weren't my daughter,

34
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,009
You'd be off the Cerritos.

35
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,010
If I wasn't your daughter,

36
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,804
you wouldn't be such a bitch
all the time!

37
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,740
- That's it. That's it! When
we get back to the ship,

38
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,742
- You are going straight to...
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

39
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,309
Straight to the brig. Shocker.

40
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,412
- Oh, you're not going to the brig.
- Oh, you're not going to the brig.

41
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,188
You're going to therapy.

42
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,649
What?! You think I need therapy?

43
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,043
- What? That's... No!
- What? That's... No!

44
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:49,859
It's the '80s, dude.

45
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,694
We don't have
psychiatric problems.

46
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,071
You're a loose cannon.

47
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,132
- I don't care how many lizards you save.
- I don't care how many lizards you save.

48
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,367
You need professional help.

49
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,262
- Dr. Migleemo? Oh,
he's the worst counselor in the fleet!

50
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,747
He just tosses out
nonstop food metaphors!

51
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,207
That's an order, Ensign.

52
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,375
Freeman to Cerritos.

53
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,353
- -One to beam up. -
- -One to beam up. -

54
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,419
I don't need therapy!

55
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,714
Okay, look,
will you stop eating these guys

56
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,567
- if we give you food replicators?
- If we give you food replicators?

57
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,635
Ha. I don't know.
Can they make nutrient pellets?

58
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,886
Yes!

59
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,352
- Mariner, this report is
- Mariner, this report is

60
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,296
A veritable fruit salad
of insubordination.

61
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,690
I don't want to be here.
I broke the rules.

62
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,191
- I'm supposed to be in the brig.
- I'm supposed to be in the brig.

63
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:37,342
Sorry. Captain's orders.

64
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,469
She wants us to meet every week,

65
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,095
cooking up
some healthy strategies

66
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,408
- to marinate you into the
officer she knows you can be.

67
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,308
I don't want your help!

68
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,827
I want to show the captain
that she's wrong

69
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,829
- and then get put... in... the... brig!
- And then get put... in... the... brig!

70
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,605
Full stop, Beckett.

71
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,149
We need to find an outlet
for all that rage.

72
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,472
- Have you ever made paella?
- Have you ever made paella?

73
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,280
Nice shot, da Vinci!

74
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,050
- -Grazie. -Hey, guys.
- -Grazie. -Hey, guys.

75
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:01,991
Do you mind
if I take over the deck?

76
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,159
I've got a big evaluation

77
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:04,553
with Captain Freeman
this afternoon.

78
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,013
She's selecting
eager to please candidates

79
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,580
for her advanced diplomacy
workshop.

80
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,666
Problem is, I don't know
how eager to please.

81
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,209
Ugh, I got to practice.

82
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,729
- Computer, load program Boimler seven.
- Computer, load program Boimler seven.

83
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,130
- Ciao, da Vinci.
- Ciao, Tendi.

84
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,260
Ugh, you simulated the crew?

85
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,804
Yeah, that way,
I can pre-interview

86
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,865
- so I don't make any
mistakes when it's for real.

87
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,349
I uploaded
seven years of entries

88
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,910
from the entire crew's
private logs...

89
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,977
Aren't those private?

90
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,204
- ...and it algorithmically created
- ...and it algorithmically created

91
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,522
A perfect simulation
of everyone on the Cerritos.

92
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,316
They'll respond exactly the way
they would in real life.

93
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,294
- Ah.
- Ah.

94
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,419
Hey, buddy. How's it going?

95
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,712
Don't talk to me!
I'm pissed off!

96
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,906
Whoa! Amazing! We had that exact
same conversation an hour ago.

97
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,927
- Yeah. Ah. All I got to
do is feed it a scenario.

98
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,495
Then the simulated crew
fills in the blanks.

99
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,265
- It'll give me an edge in my interview.
- It'll give me an edge in my interview.

100
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:51,708
- Ahoy, Cap'n.
- "Ahoy"?

101
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,103
- See? I just learned not to say that.
- See? I just learned not to say that.

102
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,295
Congrats on the brownnosing
program, butt-kisser.

103
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,922
Only you would... Wait.

104
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,486
- This is a perfect simulation?
- This is a perfect simulation?

105
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,385
What was that?

106
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,612
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

107
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,555
"Interior.
Rickety metal catwalk. Night"?

108
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,449
- Mariner! You can't write
that about the captain.

109
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,392
Why waste this
on some dumb interview prep?

110
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,453
- I'm putting in my own parameters.
- If Freeman sees this,

111
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,496
- you'll get court-martialed.
- You'll get court-martialed.

112
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,438
What did she ever do to you?

113
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,439
You say I need therapy?

114
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,522
Okay, I'll go to therapy.

115
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,608
Mariner, don't touch my code!
Don't touch my...

116
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,379
- Therapy...!
- Therapy...!

117
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,072
What the hell?
What did you do to my program?

118
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,633
- I made it into an awesome movie.
- I made it into an awesome movie.

119
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,576
Oh, I'm gonna work some out.

120
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,412
All right!

121
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,140
- ...Ooh, nice font.
- ...Ooh, nice font.

122
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,416
No, no, what are
you talking about? A movie?

123
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,626
What, you wrote out
a whole script in two seconds?

124
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,938
- -I just, like,
hit the act breaks,

125
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,547
- Couple set pieces.
- Set pieces?

126
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,423
The computer's
filling in the rest.

127
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,317
- I made parts for the crew and all of us!
- I made parts for the crew and all of us!

128
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,259
It's gonna be great!

129
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,511
I don't want to do a movie!

130
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,197
That's okay. You were
kind of a Xon, to be honest.

131
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,532
- You probably weren't
gonna make final cut.

132
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,266
- Who's Xon?
- Exactly.

133
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,869
Ooh, I've always wanted
to be in a movie!

134
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,120
Can I be the voice of the ship?

135
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,621
- "Red alert! Red alert!"
- "Red alert! Red alert!"

136
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,165
No, no, I got
the perfect part for you.

137
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,482
- You're gonna love it.
- Guys!

138
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,108
This is an important work tool,

139
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,711
- not a fun thing to have a good time with.
- Not a fun thing to have a good time with.

140
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,535
Boimler, pipe down. Shh.
Come on, the credits.

141
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,946
I don't want this.

142
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,382
- I just want to prep.
- Well, tough.

143
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,884
- You're just gonna
have to wait till it's over.

144
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,719
Come on, come on, come on,
let's go get into costume.

145
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,786
Okeydokey!

146
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,661
I'm not getting in anything.

147
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,640
- Mariner! I want these credits gone now!
- Mariner! I want these credits gone now!

148
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,957
Hmm.

149
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,085
Wha?

150
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,297
Yeah!

151
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,965
Happy birthday, Captain!

152
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,818
- I might be getting up in years,
- I might be getting up in years,

153
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,136
But I still hold
the hydroscoot speed record

154
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,429
back at the Academy!

155
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,866
Captain out! - -RANSOM: Whoa!

156
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,308
Get him, Captain!

157
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,309
Shut up!

158
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,685
I'll kill you! I...

159
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,789
Oh, I can't stay mad.

160
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:36,854
Oh, I can't stay mad.

161
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,358
Good one, Cap'n!

162
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,359
I don't remember
giving you permission

163
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,295
- to scoot with us, Ensign.
- To scoot with us, Ensign.

164
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,041
Yeah, actually, I need to
borrow the cap'n

165
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,114
- for a quick interview.
- It's her birthday!

166
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,549
Um, can I at least ask
what she likes more,

167
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,385
- when bridge officers
arrive early or stay late?

168
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,869
A question like that
makes me think

169
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,139
- you're asking the wrong questions.
- You're asking the wrong questions.

170
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,498
Good... to... know.

171
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,725
Sorry to interrupt
your vacation.

172
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,167
This isn't a vacation.

173
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,395
It's important scientific research.

174
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,713
Vacation's over.

175
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,842
Sorry for the short
notice, Captain Freeman.

176
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,444
- Not a problem at all, Admiral.
- Not a problem at all, Admiral.

177
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,279
- How can we help?
- We've received a bizarre message

178
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,805
from the leaders of Idlocana 6.

179
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,449
- Their president wanted to thank us
- Their president wanted to thank us

180
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,891
For a wonderful second contact

181
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,393
with the crew
of the San Clemente.

182
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,811
So? What's wrong with that?

183
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,706
- Starfleet doesn't have a San Clemente.
- Starfleet doesn't have a San Clemente.

184
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,401
Whoever second-contacted them
wasn't our ship.

185
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,920
- What a mystery.
- What a mystery.

186
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,404
Uh, whose boy is this?

187
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,697
Ensign Brad Boimler, sir.

188
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,532
Here to learn.

189
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,009
- This impostor...
- This impostor...

190
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,910
You want
the Cerritos to investigate?

191
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,204
Get in, get me intel,
then get out.

192
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,599
- And, Freeman,
stick to the plan this time.

193
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,042
If this was actually happening,
they'd send the Enterprise.

194
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,836
But, you know, artistic license.

195
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,314
- Luckily, the Cerritos just
went through some upgrades.

196
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,633
We should be more than suitable
for the task.

197
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,513
The Cerritos is ready
to launch whenever you are.

198
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,033
- Oh.
- Oh.

199
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,600
There she is.

200
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,824
She never fails
to take my breath away.

201
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,470
- I wish I could kiss her and squeeze her.
- Excuse me?

202
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,455
Uh, uh, the Cerritos
is a handsome lady.

203
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,683
- You're damn right about that, Boimler.
- You're damn right about that, Boimler.

204
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,503
Call the ship a handsome lady.

205
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,722
Hmm.

206
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,310
Captain,
we're ready for your command.

207
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,914
- Mm,
time to take this puppy off its leash.

208
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,851
The selenium rings are
disrupting the sensors, Captain.

209
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,794
I'm not detecting
any Federation...

210
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,356
- Hold on.
- Hold on.

211
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,423
- Enemy vessel decloaking!
- Raise shields!

212
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,472
Like a rat to the bait, Freeman.

213
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,993
Predictable as always.

214
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,475
Predictable as always.

215
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,644
- Who is this marauder, Captain?
- I don't know.

216
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,023
I am Vindicta, vengeance personified!

217
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,816
At last, Freeman.

218
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,235
I will bathe in your blood.

219
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,588
- Oh, boy,
somebody's really laying it on thick.

220
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:16,532
Behold my three henchmen
of the apo...

221
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,455
- of the Vin-pocalypse.
- Of the Vin-pocalypse.

222
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,370
Tendi, my savage warrior queen

223
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:26,167
who comes from a long
line of thieving Orion pirates.

224
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,627
Yeah, nobody messes with Orions.

225
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,773
- I'll steal from anyone
and never give it back. Theft!

226
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,215
And, uh,

227
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,592
B-Bionic 5,

228
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,738
- half man-meat, half robot-meat, all pain.
- Half man-meat, half robot-meat, all pain.

229
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,889
100% pain.

230
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:44,018
Tremble at the sight of the great Vindicta!

231
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,728
And Shempo.

232
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,957
- I'm Shempo. I was supposed
to be played by Boimler.

233
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,733
Okay, come on.
I don't sound like that.

234
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,361
I love my captain, and I don't
want to be doing this.

235
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,172
- All right, that's not too far off.
- All right, that's not too far off.

236
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,365
You're posing as Starfleet. Why?

237
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,950
Because I do what I want!
Ugh, you're a jerk, Freeman.

238
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,203
You're nothing
but a propped up errand girl,

239
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,706
blindly licking Starfleet's boot
and begging for heel.

240
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,851
- Oh! Vindicta got your ass.
- Oh! Vindicta got your ass.

241
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,252
Look, there's no need
for theatrics, all right?

242
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,315
- I'm sure you're a reasonable...
- Shempo got you tea, master.

243
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,591
This is coffee!

244
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,426
I was Shempo.

245
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,154
- ...That poor Shempo!
- ...That poor Shempo!

246
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,430
You didn't have to do that.
Are you out of your mind?

247
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,641
Freeman, you disgust me.

248
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,952
- You're a coward who hides behind rank.
- You're a coward who hides behind rank.

249
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,269
You can't even appreciate

250
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,021
your most valuable,
creative thinkers.

251
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,333
- I am Vindicta! Today you die.
- I am Vindicta! Today you die.

252
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,442
This Vindicta
is all over the place.

253
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,444
"Hell is empty,
and all the devils are here.

254
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,673
Our revels now are ended."

255
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:37,863
Our revels now are ended."

256
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,907
Wait,
is she quoting The Tempest?

257
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,454
"Hell is empty,
and all the devils are...

258
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,517
- are here."
- Wait, this is a recording.

259
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,126
It's a distraction.

260
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,585
Winger?

261
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,254
Hi. I'm Lieutenant Lemonts.

262
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,732
- Your one-man show took my breath away.
- Your one-man show took my breath away.

263
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,091
Thank you. Thank...

264
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,307
Freeman! Bring me Free...

265
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,853
- -God,
these stupid capes. So much fabric.

266
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,276
Bring me Freeman,
and I'll let you live.

267
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,610
Never, witch!

268
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,655
Wow.

269
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,948
Boimler did a good job.

270
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,324
Chief Lundy's accent
was spot-on.

271
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,219
- Yeah,
and the way his face was all blotchy?

272
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,662
- Wait, do you think Billups is in here?
- Eh, probably.

273
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,998
So I can say
whatever I want to my boss

274
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,921
- with no consequences?
- With no consequences?

275
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,629
- Hey, wait! We have to hench!
- Tendi, come on.

276
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,190
- Pirate it up. Take some slaves.
- Pirate it up. Take some slaves.

277
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:40,301
Oh, uh, you know the whole
"Orions taking slaves" thing?

278
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,404
- It's not something I really like to...
- It's not something I really like to...

279
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,013
Dirty Orion.

280
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,096
Lundy!

281
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,020
Give me Freeman!

282
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,522
Attack formation Raptor.

283
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,417
- This isn't my first
overpowered space warlord,

284
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,359
And it won't be my last.

285
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,715
- Ransom,
you think you're better than me?

286
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,699
Better at being
the captain's little dick wig.

287
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,868
You can talk the talk,
but can you... Ow!

288
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,596
- -Walk
the walk! She can do both!

289
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,538
- Oh, she's walkin' and talkin'.
- Sir, quick,

290
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,766
- what's the captain's favorite type of cookie?
- What?!

291
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,477
- Tell me before you succumb to the pain.
- Tell me before you succumb to the pain.

292
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,710
If I were to bake her cookies,

293
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,879
what would be my best bet?

294
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,316
- Cap's got a sweet tooth.
Cookies are a good move.

295
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,383
I've done it myself.
But watch out.

296
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,385
She's allergic to...

297
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,180
Allergic to what? Ransom!

298
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,766
Allergic to what?!

299
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,243
- At your stations, people.
- At your stations, people.

300
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,560
This is not a drill.

301
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,438
Billups! Show yourself!

302
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,689
Sir, get down!

303
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,028
Engineering, evacuate!

304
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,866
Andy Billups!

305
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,970
- You think you're the
best engineer in the fleet.

306
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,594
Well, I've wanted
to say something to you

307
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,957
for a long time.

308
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,893
- You are the best engineer in the fleet!
- You are the best engineer in the fleet!

309
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,253
- Huh?
- I love how you program subroutines.

310
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,420
It's breathtaking.

311
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,714
It feels so good to say it.

312
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,716
Warning. Hydron levels critical.

313
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,260
Damn it!
We don't have much time.

314
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,655
- Rerouting the vent system
would take a whole team.

315
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,097
If we bypass the indacontrols

316
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,260
and suppress the sativents,

317
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,599
it should function as a...

318
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,494
- Rudimentary plasma filter.
- Rudimentary plasma filter.

319
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,563
Wow,
for a random space marauder,

320
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,648
you really know your way
around a starship.

321
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,043
- Aw, thanks.
- Aw, thanks.

322
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,819
Intruder!

323
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,172
- When you get to hell,
- When you get to hell,

324
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,115
Tell the Pah-wraiths
that Shaxs sent you!

325
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,951
Special delivery
straight from Bajor!

326
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,114
- Ah, shut up.
- Ah, shut up.

327
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,963
Borg head?

328
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,006
- Explosive. -
- -Designation: explosive. -

329
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,196
- ...Oh, look!
- ...Oh, look!

330
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,347
Oh, Shaxs's earring.
You have to wear it.

331
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,075
- Come here. Come here.
- Uh, I-I don't know.

332
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,368
Isn't there, like,
religious significance?

333
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,161
- I mean, some of his ear's still on it.
- I mean, some of his ear's still on it.

334
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,937
Come on, dude.
Orions are pirates!

335
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:57,938
Pillaging's your whole thing.

336
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,875
- Okay, stop! It is not my whole thing.
- Okay, stop! It is not my whole thing.

337
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,180
And for your information,
many Orions haven't been pirates

338
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,945
for over five years!

339
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,216
- Okay, sorry. Look, you can just
be my generic warrior henchman.

340
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,326
Come on! Come on,
let's go torture the cat doctor.

341
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,970
Like, really torture
the hell out of her.

342
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,513
- Her name is Dr. T'Ana.
- Her name is Dr. T'Ana.

343
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,123
You're way too into this.
This is messed up.

344
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,000
It's the
holodeck. It's not real.

345
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,002
Die! Die!

346
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,608
- What is with you
today? This is not healthy.

347
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,175
- Can we stop the movie?
- No!

348
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,676
No, I'm fine.
This is feeling good.

349
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,070
Come on, let me
just take down the captain,

350
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:29,989
- and then we can grab tacos.
- And then we can grab tacos.

351
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,181
I don't want to watch you
phaser the captain.

352
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,016
Phaser?

353
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,287
- Oh, it's going to be way worse than that.
- Oh, it's going to be way worse than that.

354
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,647
I am out of here. Arch.

355
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,523
Hey, come on.

356
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,127
- This isn't you.
- This isn't you.

357
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,610
It is, too!

358
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,741
Ransom. Shaxs. Anyone, come in.

359
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,034
No one left to hide behind,
Captain.

360
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,374
It's just me and you.

361
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,833
And-and these guys.

362
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,589
You'll never take my ship.

363
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,275
- I don't want your ship.
- I don't want your ship.

364
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,218
I want you to stop treating me

365
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,761
like I'm the bad guy
all the time.

366
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,113
- You are the bad guy.
- You are the bad guy.

367
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,723
No, I'm not.
Why don't you ever side with me?

368
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,183
I don't even know you.

369
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,726
Exactly!

370
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,080
Oh, my God. You're-you're crazy.

371
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,396
Oh, my God. You're-you're crazy.

372
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,273
No, this is crazy.

373
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,044
- Sir, her ship.
- Sir, her ship.

374
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,277
- The warp core's gone critical.
- Brace for impact!

375
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,664
Warning. Warning.

376
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,275
- - The ship has crashed. Warning.

377
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,949
Oh, damn it.

378
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,847
- All surviving crew,
emergency evacuation protocol:

379
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,789
Delta Echo.

380
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,167
I'll keep systems functional
for as long as possible.

381
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,919
You can do this. We can do this.

382
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,689
Cerritos strong!

383
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,423
Oh, when are you going
to give up

384
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,693
- -the "loving captain" act?
- It's not an act!

385
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,510
I'm overflowing
with love and affection!

386
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,512
- Oh, shut up!
- You shut up!

387
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,433
Sir, are you okay?

388
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,809
I'll live,

389
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,204
- -but the rest of the crew...
- Will be fine.

390
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,939
I initiated a rapid repeating
emergency transport sequence

391
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,983
and beamed the entire crew
before we crashed.

392
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,443
What? But that's not possible.

393
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,004
No, it's a movie.
You can beam whatever you want.

394
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,839
You can do all sorts
of beaming stuff in a movie!

395
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,382
- What?! That is amazing!
- What?! That is amazing!

396
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,617
- I learned it from you, sir.
- Uh... okay.

397
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,713
- What is your problem?!
- What is your problem?!

398
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,338
You've been a jerk
since I was eight!

399
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,465
Why do you have
to be so hard on me?!

400
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,548
- What? I don't know you!
- What? I don't know you!

401
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,663
Get off my mom, you bitch.

402
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,541
Oh! Wait. What?

403
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,311
- You simulated me in here,
too? Not cool, man!

404
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,546
I got private stuff
in those logs!

405
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,215
Emergency transport
on signal now!

406
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,568
- Beckett, no!
- Beckett, no!

407
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,886
Oh, great.
Well, now it's just us.

408
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,697
Yeah, thanks for ruining
the awesome captain-murder

409
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,449
- this was all building to.
- This was all building to.

410
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,851
We were supposed to fight
on a rickety metal catwalk.

411
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,578
Oh. Let me make it up to you.
Double punch!

412
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,330
...Double block.

413
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,439
- Whoa. How did you...?
- I know all your moves

414
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,358
and everything about you.

415
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,795
- I know you dressed up like
Toby Targ every Halloween,

416
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,906
Even when you were too old.

417
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,426
- And I know you actually
love the warp core!

418
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,160
Take that back.
The warp core's lame!

419
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,582
You only break rules
because you know

420
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,418
that's what everyone expects
you to do!

421
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,854
- If you really were a badass,
- If you really were a badass,

422
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,588
You'd do the hard thing
and just be

423
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,089
a good officer.

424
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:39,887
They're not casting you
as the villain. You are!

425
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:49,038
- Hey, I know you might
be a psychotic space raider

426
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,939
Whose boss
just destroyed my ship,

427
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,901
but you...
are all right in my book.

428
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,754
- That's a book I'd read cover to cover.
- That's a book I'd read cover to cover.

429
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,781
Sir, you're the only person
who can see past my mask,

430
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,843
- and knows deep down, I just want
- and knows deep down, I just want

431
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,745
To replace a toranium ops module
with ionizing subcircuits.

432
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,015
- I know this is crazy,
but do you want to just... I don't know...

433
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,959
Run away together,
and we could get our own ship,

434
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,852
and we can buffer the phase coil
whenever we want

435
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,170
or... or realign the matrix.

436
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,506
We can fix the warp engines
on our time.

437
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,830
- It would be an honor, sir.
- It would be an honor, sir.

438
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:23,305
Godspeed, you crazy.

439
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,158
- Ugh. Cap'n,
I know you've been through a lot today,

440
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,035
But I made you a platter
of chocolate chip cookies,

441
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,870
and I just want to know
what you think before I give it

442
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,747
- to the real you in real life,
so if you could...

443
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,023
The captain's allergic
to chocolate. Assassin!

444
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,085
- Great work, Jet! -

445
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,509
That's the kind
of assassin-tackling

446
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,029
that'll land you a promotion.

447
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,489
Oh, hell yeah, Jet!

448
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,216
- Wait, wait. Cap'n, Cap'n,
where do you want me

449
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,867
To see myself in five years?

450
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,678
Don't answer that, Captain.
He's playing mind games!

451
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,787
You're the man, Jet.

452
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,514
-Get him out of here. -Let's go.

453
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,998
How can I be the man, Cap'n?

454
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,500
I want to be the man!

455
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,552
That's it. Keep up the act.

456
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,180
Oh, you know so much about me,

457
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:06,533
but you missed one big thing.

458
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:07,849
But you missed one big thing.

459
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,811
Oh, yeah, here we go... time
for one of your snarky jokes.

460
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,914
- Yeah, I may hate protocol,
- Yeah, I may hate protocol,

461
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,065
But I don't hate this ship.

462
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,751
I don't hate the crew.
I work with my best friends.

463
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,921
- The captain's my mom. I
would do anything for her.

464
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,530
Oh, come on.
No, you hate the captain.

465
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,031
You complain about her nonstop.

466
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,550
- It's like your whole thing!
- It's like your whole thing!

467
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,326
Yeah, I mean,
she's hard on me, right?

468
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,170
She's the captain,
and I'm a pain in the ass.

469
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,725
But if she kicked me off
the Cerritos,

470
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,557
- I would be done in Starfleet.
- I would be done in Starfleet.

471
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,834
She's watching out for me
the only way she knows how:

472
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,104
- in a up, overbearing, mom way.
- In a up, overbearing, mom way.

473
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,547
Oh, please. The only person
you care about is yourself.

474
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,944
- Okay, well,
then why did I let you kick my ass

475
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,612
To buy time for everyone
to get off the ship

476
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,389
before the self-destruct
timer went off?

477
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,766
- Wait. What?-

478
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,065
No, no, no, no. No, no, no! Aah!

479
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,192
No!

480
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,574
Wow. I can't believe I just
got my ass kicked by myself

481
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,219
- and just... Wait.
- And just... Wait.

482
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:08,925
I guess I like working
on the ship and...

483
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:12,872
- Oh, my God. Therapy works. Guys,
therapy works!

484
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,586
Honestly,
that was way more therapeutic

485
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,313
- than I thought it would
be. I worked through a lot.

486
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:21,465
I feel great, too. I just wish

487
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,401
I could tell the real Billups
how I feel about him.

488
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,028
- Why don't you, man? He's right there.
- Why don't you, man? He's right there.

489
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,137
Nah, I wouldn't want
to bother him. I mean,

490
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,637
look at him.
Dude's a stone-cold badass.

491
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,895
Hey, T. I owe you an apology.

492
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,040
- The whole Orions-pirate thing.
- The whole Orions-pirate thing.

493
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,441
I-I feel really bad. I'm sorry
if I put you in a weird spot.

494
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,943
Thanks. I appreciate it,
and the truth is,

495
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,654
a lot of Orions are capitalist,
hyper-libertarian,

496
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,948
gangster pirates,
just not this one.

497
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,634
-That's why I'm here. -Oh, well, thanks

498
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,660
For having my back in there.
I owe you one.

499
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,788
Um, so, do you want
to maybe go sit

500
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,223
- and look at the warp core with me?
- And look at the warp core with me?

501
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,249
Wow, so lame. Yes. Let's do it.

502
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,752
We talking warp core?
Ooh, baby, I'm in.

503
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,342
- Mariner.
- Hey, Cap. Sorry about earlier today.

504
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:08,654
- I was way out of line.
Thanks for looking out.

505
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,888
Later, skater.

506
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,202
- "Later skater"? I know
she's up to something!

507
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,477
What did she tell you?

508
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,104
Captain, you know I can't share

509
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,539
- what your crew tells me.
- What your crew tells me.

510
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,482
That'd be a real ethical pickle.

511
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,918
What?!
If she's planning something,

512
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,860
- I have a right to know.
- Carol,

513
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,546
- you're being a pineapple right now.
- You're being a pineapple right now.

514
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,323
Ugh! Stop referencing foods!

515
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,886
Okay. No more distractions.
I just need to know

516
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,346
what to wear to the interview.

517
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,722
Computer, continue program.

518
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,432
- Hey, Cap'n, do you like turtlenecks
- Hey, Cap'n, do you like turtlenecks

519
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,726
- Or just standard uniform?
- Against insurmountable odds.

520
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,478
Oh, sorry. You got something
going on here. I'll wait.

521
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,231
- As captain,
it was an honor serving beside her.

522
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,675
As a mother, it was a privilege
to call Mariner my daughter.

523
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,861
- -Wait. What? -That's right.
- -Wait. What? -That's right.

524
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,554
Mariner was my daughter
the whole time.

525
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,681
It's a secret
we didn't want anyone to know.

526
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,408
- Uh,
uh... -And if someone had ever

527
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,672
Found out she was my baby girl,

528
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,936
I don't know
what I would have done.

529
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,813
Probably
kicked them off the ship,

530
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,749
- maybe even court-martialed
them right out of Starfleet.

531
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,191
I was being crazy.

532
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,693
Thank goodness

533
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,088
- nobody ever found out.
- Computer, end program!

534
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,700
Ooh!

535
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,427
- Hey, nerd,
we're going to go stare at the warp core.

536
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,370
You want to...? Whoa. You okay?

537
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,873
- Yeah.
- All right, whatevs. Hey.

538
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,076
- Good luck with the interview.
You're gonna do great.

539
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,313
...So, you're interested

540
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,006
In the advanced
diplomacy workshop.

541
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,717
Where do you see yourself
negotiating peace in five years?

542
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,696
- I... uh...
- I... uh...

543
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,680
Just take a breath and say the
first thing that comes to mind.

544
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,390
- Mariner.
- Mariner what?!

545
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:38,393
- Uh... is hot? - Excuse me?!

546
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:41,563
- Uh, I don't know! She's not hot!
- She's nasty!

547
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:50,638
- Ensign Boimler didn't bother
to prepare for interview. Terrible.

548
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,544
Revenge!

549
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,480
...Not-a today.

550
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,716
Not-a on-a da Vinci's watch.

551
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,884
Chirp.

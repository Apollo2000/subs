00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,958
After we dump this in storage,
let's hit the bar

3
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:23,958
and see if we can get a cute
lieutenant to argue with me.

4
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,668
And see if we can get a cute
lieutenant to argue with me.

5
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,836
Interesting.
Why would you want that?

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,195
I don't know. Getting
some uptight hunk all wound up

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:29,255
- just gets me all...
- Supplicate yourselves!

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,173
- Just gets me all...
- Supplicate yourselves!

9
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,591
- Ah! What the heck?
- Whoa. It's one of

10
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,051
those transdimensional
energy creatures.

11
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:34,051
Behold and tremble at...

12
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:37,162
Behold and tremble at...

13
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,556
Quick, Tendi,
grab me one of those canisters.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,765
Wait, shouldn't
we call security?

15
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:39,765
- I will destroy you.
- No, no.

16
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,125
- I will destroy you.
- No, no.

17
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,853
We can use this thing
for all sorts of cool stuff.

18
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,354
Hey, grab the pod.
We can figure it out later.

19
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,378
He's a sentient creature.

20
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:46,397
Are-are we even allowed
to stuff him in something?

21
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,315
Are-are we even allowed
to stuff him in something?

22
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,841
He's a bad guy. He zaps people.

23
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:53,011
I shall make a feast
of your misery!

24
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:53,070
- No, wait! Don't put me
in the pod!

25
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,929
- No, wait! Don't put me
in the pod!

26
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,473
I-I can grant you wishes.

27
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,099
And I'm listening.

28
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:58,159
I can rearrange air molecules
into whatever you want.

29
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,311
I can rearrange air molecules
into whatever you want.

30
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,705
Even one of those
fancy new tricorders

31
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,689
- with the purple stripe?
- Ooh, those are nice.

32
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:04,749
Oh, that would use up
a lot of my...

33
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,608
Oh, that would use up
a lot of my...

34
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,109
Okay, okay.

35
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,778
Just... I'll try.

36
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:11,881
There.

37
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,698
There.

38
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,492
That's... There you go.

39
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,052
- Where's the power cell, dude?
- What, really?

40
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:17,052
Like I was going
to ask for something

41
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:18,516
Like I was going
to ask for something

42
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,954
that didn't come with batteries.

43
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,206
Okay, okay.

44
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:23,851
Thank you.

45
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,169
Thank you.

46
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,398
I really got to think
of something cool

47
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:29,398
- to say when we're
going to warp.
- Die, mortal!

48
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,966
- to say when we're
going to warp.
- Die, mortal!

49
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,843
Something like "It's warp time!"

50
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:33,903
What do you think of that?
Is that good for you?

51
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,137
What do you think of that?
Is that good for you?

52
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:46,999
Hmm.

53
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,252
What you watching?

54
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,045
Oh, it's this video
of Vice Admiral Gibson

55
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,815
falling off a stage
during peace negotiations.

56
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,839
You got to check it out.

57
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,194
- Ah, it's classic.
- Guess which command ensign

58
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,012
just scored the best assignment
on the ship.

59
00:02:59,095 --> 00:02:59,071
- Uh, Castro?
- No, not Castro.

60
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,680
- Uh, Castro?
- No, not Castro.

61
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:01,931
Too bad.

62
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:02,932
- She's the best.
- Castro's overrated.

63
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,616
Just because she served
on the Enterprise

64
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:04,660
- for, like, one minute...
- Ooh, was it P'jok?

65
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,453
- For, like, one minute...
- Ooh, was it P'jok?

66
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,105
That guy can do anything,
and what a snack.

67
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,273
No! It's me. I got it.

68
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,542
I'm the guy that got it, okay?

69
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:11,542
I'm gonna be piloting General
K'orin down to Tulgana 4.

70
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:15,111
I'm gonna be piloting General
K'orin down to Tulgana 4.

71
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,113
K'orin. How do I know that name?

72
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:17,172
Maybe because he's like
one of the most decorated,

73
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,657
Maybe because he's like
one of the most decorated,

74
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,285
battle-hardened Klingon warriors
in history?

75
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:22,344
Or maybe it's just 'cause all
Klingon names sound the same?

76
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,471
Or maybe it's just 'cause all
Klingon names sound the same?

77
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,390
Like, they all have
an apostrophe for some reason.

78
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,624
Yes. That's it.

79
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,625
Well, clearly I'm being rewarded

80
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:28,684
for all the hours I log
into the simulator.

81
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,793
For all the hours I log
into the simulator.

82
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,670
Your idea of a reward is
an escort run?

83
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,672
Oh, you have the bar set
way too low.

84
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:34,732
What's punishment?

85
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,132
What's punishment?

86
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:37,693
Something actually fun?
What is wrong with you?

87
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,136
Look, all I know is, I'll be
flying down to a bustling,

88
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:40,195
exotic planet while you're stuck
right here.

89
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,764
Exotic planet while you're stuck
right here.

90
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:43,640
Uh, check yourself.

91
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,309
It doesn't get more exotic
than this.

92
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,955
All right, nobody talk to me.

93
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,832
I got to brush up on my formal
Klingon greetings, okay?

94
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:51,832
Nuqneh, nuqneh!

95
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,609
Nuqneh, nuqneh!

96
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,027
Yeah, keep it subtle. Nuqneh.

97
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,989
Well, if you see an unaligned
EPS conduit, don't call me.

98
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,950
Mine are aligned as hell.

99
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,260
Wait, aren't there, like,
a hundred of those?

100
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,386
How long have you been in there?

101
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,787
A solid week.

102
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:05,846
Crawling through cramped ducts,

103
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,972
Crawling through cramped ducts,

104
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,499
prying open panels, and
adjusting red-hot power cables.

105
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,960
Look, look look. I've got
blisters on my blisters.

106
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,562
Oh, wow, you must be so relieved
to be done.

107
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,837
Oh, I'm not done.

108
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,464
Now I get
to recalibrate everything.

109
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:16,523
That's another three,
four days in the tubes!

110
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,466
That's another three,
four days in the tubes!

111
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,902
Oh, but I thought
we were gonna watch

112
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,177
the Trivoli pulsar together?

113
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,513
Oh, I did promise you
I'd do that.

114
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:23,572
Well, don't worry.
Some people agree to do stuff

115
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,366
Well, don't worry.
Some people agree to do stuff

116
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,557
when they don't actually mean

117
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,243
- they're going to do it.
- No, no, no, no.

118
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:28,243
I'm Starfleet.
I never go back on my word.

119
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,853
I'm Starfleet.
I never go back on my word.

120
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,522
Eh... you know,

121
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,816
if I quit my job in Engineering
and switch divisions,

122
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:34,875
I wouldn't have to be
in the tubes at all.

123
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,126
I wouldn't have to be
in the tubes at all.

124
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,735
Really?! Oh, you can do that?

125
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,529
- Sure. When's the pulsar?
- 0800.

126
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,738
Ah! This really means a lot.

127
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,882
I don't have a lot
of friends yet,

128
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:41,882
and doing science on my own
really bums me out,

129
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,550
and doing science on my own
really bums me out,

130
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,868
so thanks, Rutherford.

131
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:45,928
All right,
looks like I just have to...

132
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,371
All right,
looks like I just have to...

133
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,206
find a new career.

134
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,750
Uh...

135
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,380
Ooh! Pew, pew, pew.

136
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,383
Good work, gents.
Let's keep her right and tight.

137
00:04:59,424 --> 00:04:59,400
Pew, pew, pew.

138
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,591
Pew, pew, pew.

139
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,054
Uh... At ease, carry on. Sorry.

140
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:05,114
What? Mariner?

141
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,390
What? Mariner?

142
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,742
Oh, hey, Boimler. You want some?

143
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:09,952
What are you doing?
Get out of here.

144
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,203
You're getting broth
on the controls.

145
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:11,203
- I got to prep for takeoff.
- Oh, I know. I'm coming with.

146
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,730
- I got to prep for takeoff.
- Oh, I know. I'm coming with.

147
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,399
You got the same mission
assignment as me? How?

148
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,400
Pulled some strings.

149
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:17,459
I mean, you made this sound
so rewarding,

150
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,861
I mean, you made this sound
so rewarding,

151
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,744
I just had to see you in action.
Keep reading.

152
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,239
I'm your copilot?

153
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:23,298
You're taking on more work?
Just to bug me?

154
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,408
You're taking on more work?
Just to bug me?

155
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,577
Calm down, man. We can't
have you co-flying angry.

156
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,745
I need you co-calm.

157
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:28,804
Ooh, nice dress uniform.

158
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,371
Ooh, nice dress uniform.

159
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,974
- You getting married after this?
- No.

160
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,958
- I wish you would take
this seriously.
- I am.

161
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:34,018
Ooh! This is the new shuttle
with the blast shield. Yeah!

162
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,586
Ooh! This is the new shuttle
with the blast shield. Yeah!

163
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,100
Rutherford,
great work on the EPS grid.

164
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,311
I wish I had
more engineers like you.

165
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:53,370
My life would be a lot simpler.

166
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,937
My life would be a lot simpler.

167
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,356
Uh, th-thanks.
Uh, can we talk for a second?

168
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,984
Just for a second?
Don't tease me. Come on, man.

169
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,795
You're my number-one-
with-a-bullet systems guy.

170
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,613
I got time for you in spades.

171
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,573
Um...

172
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:05,632
I just wanted to let you know

173
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,824
I just wanted to let you know

174
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,744
that I'm going to be exploring
other opportunities on the ship.

175
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:11,388
Are you saying what I think
you're saying, Ensign?

176
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,790
Are you saying what I think
you're saying, Ensign?

177
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,417
Uh, I'd like to request
a transfer out of Engineering.

178
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:16,477
Consider your request...

179
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,253
Consider your request...

180
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,546
granted!

181
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,507
Oh, man, this is exciting.

182
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:22,566
I'm sure wherever you end up,
they'll be lucky to have you.

183
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,176
I'm sure wherever you end up,
they'll be lucky to have you.

184
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,345
- Rutherford! Rutherford!
- Aw, thanks, guys.

185
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,180
- Rutherford!
- I'm gonna miss you.

186
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:29,239
Buried alive...

187
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,849
Buried alive...

188
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,310
-Marooned for eternity...
Moons of Nibia.
-Ugh. Unbelievable.

189
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:35,871
Oh, sorry. I keep having
this awesome dream.

190
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,314
Oh, sorry. I keep having
this awesome dream.

191
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,274
General K'orin is gonna be here
any second.

192
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:40,334
Let me do the talking.
I've been studying him all day.

193
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,485
Let me do the talking.
I've been studying him all day.

194
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,712
- Is he single?
- Will you just...!

195
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,488
Rein it in.

196
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,824
We need to show him deference
and respect.

197
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,287
General K'orin.

198
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:53,347
It is an honor
to escort you, sir.

199
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,790
It is an honor
to escort you, sir.

200
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,041
Allow me to say...

201
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,501
Nuqneh.

202
00:06:58,737 --> 00:06:59,853
Oh, no. No, no, no.

203
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,672
Oh, no. No, no, no.

204
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,399
- Mariner, what are you doing?!
- What? No!

205
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:05,675
What are you doing? What...?

206
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:05,734
No!

207
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,219
No!

208
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,514
Starfleet has made you soft,
Mariner.

209
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:11,573
Not as soft
as your ngech, K'orin!

210
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,684
Not as soft
as your ngech, K'orin!

211
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,528
Wait, wait, wait. W-W-Wait.
Hold on, hold on.

212
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:17,579
Do you two know each other?

213
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,856
Do you two know each other?

214
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,251
Yeah. We did some off-the-books
gray ops stuff back in the day.

215
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,995
We're, like, the same age.
Back in what day?

216
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,295
Now they've got you
pushing PADDs

217
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,321
on a ship full of children.

218
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,258
- Well, can't beat four weeks'
shore leave.

219
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:29,258
Well, general,
as I was saying, Nuq...

220
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,534
Well, general,
as I was saying, Nuq...

221
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,203
Okay. Yeah,
just holding your sword, then.

222
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:34,263
I must update you on my many
sexual conquests, Mariner.

223
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,582
I must update you on my many
sexual conquests, Mariner.

224
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,208
What, both of them?

225
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,424
Okay, you go down.

226
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,427
There we go.

227
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,054
Where did you even get flagons?

228
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:52,114
Boy! Land in Little Qo'noS.
I want gagh!

229
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,058
Boy! Land in Little Qo'noS.
I want gagh!

230
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,227
Uh, well, my orders were
actually to deliver you

231
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:58,287
-to the Federation outpost
so you could...
-Copilot, just set us down

232
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,956
-to the Federation outpost
so you could...
-Copilot, just set us down

233
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,065
in the Klingon district.
The man wants hot worms.

234
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,317
Yes, sir.

235
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,401
Coming right up.

236
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:05,460
Do you remember Jaxxa Prime,

237
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,403
Do you remember Jaxxa Prime,

238
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:10,364
the commander who didn't believe
you about rectal insectoids?

239
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:10,424
Ha! Yeah, I got chewed out,
but his ass got chewed up.

240
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:14,410
Ha! Yeah, I got chewed out,
but his ass got chewed up.

241
00:08:16,223 --> 00:08:17,639
Federation shuttlecraft,

242
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,141
Federation shuttlecraft,

243
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,083
this is Tulgana 4
space traffic control.

244
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,793
Landing code challenge epsilo.

245
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:22,853
Transmitting confirmation
on secure channel gamma sev...

246
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,077
Transmitting confirmation
on secure channel gamma sev...

247
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,924
Will you two please be quiet

248
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,926
so we don't get shot out
of the sky? Whoa!

249
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,429
Sending confirmation code now.
Thank you.

250
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,264
Mm, mm.

251
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,282
Mmm, the smell
of a Klingon district.

252
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:53,342
We'll have to get
the shuttle washed for sure.

253
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,968
We'll have to get
the shuttle washed for sure.

254
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,345
If anyone asks,
this was your call.

255
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,495
Okay, snippy.

256
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,288
Ooh, yeah, I'm snippy.

257
00:08:59,372 --> 00:08:59,348
Drinking, landing
in an unsecured district?

258
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,499
Drinking, landing
in an unsecured district?

259
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,417
That's how you choose
to represent Starfleet?

260
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,895
Me and the general
are blood-bonded.

261
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:04,895
It would have been weird
if I acted all stuffy.

262
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,688
It would have been weird
if I acted all stuffy.

263
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,756
He's passed out
and he pooped on his sword.

264
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,519
He's a lightweight.
I mean, don't sweat it.

265
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:10,525
We'll get him a hot cup
of raktajino,

266
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,134
We'll get him a hot cup
of raktajino,

267
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,970
- he will be ready to go.
- Oh, no.

268
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,263
- Oh...
- Oh, no!

269
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,431
Oh, no, no, no, no.

270
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:17,491
The shuttle! The shuttle!
What the hell?!

271
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,867
The shuttle! The shuttle!
What the hell?!

272
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,435
- No.
- Ha. Classic K'orin.

273
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,813
Ah, he did this on Vulcan.
And on Earth.

274
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:23,872
He steals a lot of things.

275
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,481
He steals a lot of things.

276
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:27,984
We are stranded here
because of your recklessness.

277
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:28,043
Oh, relax. We can just beam
back to the Cerritos

278
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,319
Oh, relax. We can just beam
back to the Cerritos

279
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,154
and remotely trigger
the return autopilot.

280
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,491
Sure, yeah, if Tulgana 4
wasn't protected

281
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:35,550
by an ion field that restricts
comms and transporters!

282
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:39,328
By an ion field that restricts
comms and transporters!

283
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,955
Do you even read
the mission brief?

284
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:41,014
I'm sorry,
I skimmed almost most of it

285
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,790
I'm sorry,
I skimmed almost most of it

286
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,542
and read some
of the captions, so...

287
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:46,395
- Dude, where are you going?
- I'm tracking down our shuttle.

288
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,772
- Dude, where are you going?
- I'm tracking down our shuttle.

289
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,756
If we're not back to it
by the next rotation,

290
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,776
- we'll be court-martialed!
- Don't knock it
till you've tried it.

291
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:52,776
This is serious! I think we're
violating the Khitomer Accords!

292
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,386
This is serious! I think we're
violating the Khitomer Accords!

293
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,429
Yeah, I don't want to go
to a penal colony either,

294
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,973
but I am not going
to speed-walk.

295
00:09:59,056 --> 00:09:59,032
What is this speed-walking?

296
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,683
What is this speed-walking?

297
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,369
- You know we're going
the same speed.
- Stop it.

298
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,353
It's to conserve energy.
Section 31 does this.

299
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,860
Yes, General K'orin
was here a short while ago.

300
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:10,919
It was my honor to serve him
a warrior's meal.

301
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,864
It was my honor to serve him
a warrior's meal.

302
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,199
Do you know where he went?

303
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:17,259
- Are you tracking him?
- Oh, well, I, uh...

304
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,201
- Are you tracking him?
- Oh, well, I, uh...

305
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,661
Whew, I think, uh...

306
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,080
Uh, no, we-we want
to kneel before him

307
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:23,140
and lick his boots like
the Federation dogs we are.

308
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,250
And lick his boots like
the Federation dogs we are.

309
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,003
He went north,
in search of stronger ale.

310
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:29,062
- He was already wasted.
- Is that a problem?

311
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:32,006
- He was already wasted.
- Is that a problem?

312
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,384
Uh, no. I mean, uh,
drinking to excess is cool.

313
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,611
All right, come on.
There's an Andorian district

314
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:37,678
just north of here.

315
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,930
So we're Federation dogs, huh?

316
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,616
Hey, if it got us
what we needed, woof woof.

317
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:41,616
I know this is fun,
but we really need to get back.

318
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,577
I know this is fun,
but we really need to get back.

319
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,727
I'm not having fun.

320
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,121
Geez, these guys are acting

321
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,064
like they've never seen
a Starfleet uniform.

322
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:48,123
Well, they're Kaelons,

323
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,565
Well, they're Kaelons,

324
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,400
and Kaelons are
notoriously isolationist.

325
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,402
And that...

326
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:53,462
- Oh, shoot, sorry.
That's my fault.

327
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,946
- Oh, shoot, sorry.
That's my fault.

328
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,032
Boimler, let's keep moving.

329
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,201
No, no, no, I need to apologize
in his native tongue.

330
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:00,260
Let me think.
He's a, uh, a Taxor.

331
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,119
Let me think.
He's a, uh, a Taxor.

332
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,206
Right, and they communicate
through guttural tones.

333
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,213
Hey back off, blue!

334
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:12,272
No! Don't hit him!
We have a treaty!

335
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,696
No! Don't hit him!
We have a treaty!

336
00:11:21,976 --> 00:11:23,992
You made the right choice

337
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,559
You made the right choice

338
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,144
transferring into Command, son.

339
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,562
Nothing compares to the firm,

340
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,481
hot pulse of a joystick
in your hand.

341
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:30,540
The bridge is
where the action is.

342
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,608
The bridge is
where the action is.

343
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,984
Should be interesting, sir.

344
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,945
Let's start with
a classic bridge simulation.

345
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:36,004
Computer, Command Trainer 43.

346
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,780
Computer, Command Trainer 43.

347
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,991
Initiating advanced simulation.

348
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:41,051
Ensign, the bridge is yours.

349
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,910
Ensign, the bridge is yours.

350
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,788
Be gentle but attentive.
Get her where she needs to be.

351
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:45,847
- Guide her home.
- Okeydokey.

352
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,791
- Guide her home.
- Okeydokey.

353
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,460
Uh, maintain course.

354
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:53,188
Captain, we're being drawn
into a temporal rift.

355
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,297
Captain, we're being drawn
into a temporal rift.

356
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,133
- Uh... Uh...
- Shields at ten percent!

357
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,468
- Warp core breach
in 30 seconds, Captain!
- Oh, man.

358
00:11:59,552 --> 00:11:59,528
Captain, we need orders!

359
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,803
Captain, we need orders!

360
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,598
Uh, uh... maintain course?

361
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,225
Ship destroyed.

362
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:06,284
105%

363
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,144
105%

364
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,312
Wait. How did I kill
more than the whole crew?

365
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,148
Okay, that was a rough start.

366
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:12,207
FYI, in situations like that,

367
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,816
FYI, in situations like that,

368
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,152
try employing
the Janeway Protocol.

369
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,154
Got it. And what's that?

370
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:18,213
Good one.

371
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,989
Good one.

372
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,383
All right, let's try something
more straightforward.

373
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,325
Computer, Command Trainer 4.

374
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:23,385
Initiating basic training
simulation.

375
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,163
Initiating basic training
simulation.

376
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,166
Captain, we're directly
in the path of a small asteroid.

377
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:30,225
Should we move to avoid?

378
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,500
Should we move to avoid?

379
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,502
Uh, do the Janeway Protocol.

380
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,671
Uh, are you sure, sir?

381
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:35,730
Yes?

382
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,548
Yes?

383
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,900
Collision alert, sir.

384
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,010
The kindergarten on Deck Eight,
it's gone!

385
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:41,069
Uh, uh...

386
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,970
Uh, uh...

387
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,054
No.

388
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,056
No, no, no.
Now the pre-K is gone.

389
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,116
All the ship's children
have been ejected into space.

390
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,018
All the ship's children
have been ejected into space.

391
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,020
- All those kids...
- Freeze program.

392
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,730
In thousands of simulations,

393
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:52,789
that's literally
never happened before.

394
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,149
That's literally
never happened before.

395
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,444
Let's try another one, on a ship
with even more children.

396
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,991
I can't believe I messed up
so bad with that Taxor.

397
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,993
I've read, like,
five books about them.

398
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:06,052
Hey, don't sweat it, B.
I got you.

399
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,703
Hey, don't sweat it, B.
I got you.

400
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,556
That's even worse.
You didn't study them at all.

401
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,873
I study by doing, you know?

402
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:10,932
Maybe you need to spend
less time in the library

403
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,875
Maybe you need to spend
less time in the library

404
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,478
and more time
letting Boimler get nasty.

405
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,878
No. I need to up my studying,

406
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,379
spend even more time
in the library.

407
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:17,439
Whatever, man.
Just hang here for a second.

408
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,256
Whatever, man.
Just hang here for a second.

409
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,091
I got to go blood-pee
some blood wine,

410
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,844
maybe get some intel
on the general.

411
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:23,904
Oh. I see we both have
a thing for red.

412
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,097
Oh. I see we both have
a thing for red.

413
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,099
- Uh, me, what, red? What?
- Your shirt.

414
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:29,159
- We match.
- Oh.

415
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,893
- We match.
- Oh.

416
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,562
Uh, yes, well,
this is my work shirt.

417
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,398
- And I'm Ensign...
- Ensign Brad Boimler. I know.

418
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:36,458
I can sense your thoughts,
your desires.

419
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,236
I can sense your thoughts,
your desires.

420
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,571
I know you like jamaharon.

421
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,283
Mm...

422
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,205
Mariner, what the hell?!

423
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,706
That thing is an Anabaj.

424
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,766
It's gonna implant eggs
in your throat, dummy.

425
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,875
It's gonna implant eggs
in your throat, dummy.

426
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,919
What are you...

427
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,797
I know you still want it.

428
00:13:59,880 --> 00:13:59,856
I can hear
your nasty boy thoughts.

429
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,632
I can hear
your nasty boy thoughts.

430
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,218
Jamaharon.
This boy wants jamaharon!

431
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,930
Love your sarong.

432
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,324
- You okay, Boims?
- Yeah, I just...

433
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,700
I-I've never even
heard of an Anabaj.

434
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,142
How did you know?

435
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:12,202
Affinity for red,
drawn to the weak-minded.

436
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,936
Affinity for red,
drawn to the weak-minded.

437
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,772
Plus, I kind of dated one once,
but only to make my mom mad.

438
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:17,855
Weak-minded?

439
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:17,874
An Andorian in the bathroom
said the general's

440
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,459
An Andorian in the bathroom
said the general's

441
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,151
at a bar just down the road.
Come on.

442
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,987
You can tell me
about jamaharon later.

443
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:24,005
Ah, you're doing a bang-up job

444
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,656
Ah, you're doing a bang-up job

445
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,050
with that endocrine system,
Ensign.

446
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,552
It's not so different
from engineering.

447
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,345
The heart's an engine.
The brain's a computer.

448
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:30,345
The eyes are a different kind
of computer. No... cameras.

449
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,621
The eyes are a different kind
of computer. No... cameras.

450
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,015
- Eyes are cameras. Camera eyes.
- Sure.

451
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,499
Whatever you need
to tell yourself.

452
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:35,559
The next part gets dicey.
Keep him distracted.

453
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,960
The next part gets dicey.
Keep him distracted.

454
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,355
- Are you sure you don't
want me to reroute...
- Go chat him up!

455
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:40,355
That's an order!
Tendi, exoscalpel.

456
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,424
That's an order!
Tendi, exoscalpel.

457
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,677
Uh, hi. I'm supposed to
distract you from all this stuff

458
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:46,736
- over here, so...
- I'm gonna be okay,
though, right?

459
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,822
- over here, so...
- I'm gonna be okay,
though, right?

460
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,006
My implant says there's
only a small chance you'll die.

461
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,975
- What? How small?
- 18%. Oh, uh...

462
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:53,034
Now it's up to 20. You might
want to control that heart rate.

463
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,370
Now it's up to 20. You might
want to control that heart rate.

464
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,145
Oh, God, I'm gonna die!

465
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,813
What the hell
are you saying to him?

466
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,648
- Just calm him down.
- Uh, uh...

467
00:14:59,732 --> 00:14:59,708
Take your mind off of this.
Uh, think about work.

468
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,501
Take your mind off of this.
Uh, think about work.

469
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,028
- Think about the warp core.
- I got burned in the warp core!

470
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,322
Those are dilithium burns?
How are you still alive, man?

471
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:06,381
You should be dead!

472
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,531
You should be dead!

473
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,992
Get out of here!
Tendi, take over.

474
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,785
- Wait, but...
- Sorry.

475
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:11,845
Don't worry, you're looking
just fine, inside and out.

476
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,288
Don't worry, you're looking
just fine, inside and out.

477
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,458
Oh, my God. Oh, thank God.
That robot said I was dying.

478
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:17,517
Listen, kid, you're great
at digging around in a body,

479
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,044
Listen, kid, you're great
at digging around in a body,

480
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,087
but if you can't muster up
some bedside manner,

481
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:22,147
you may as well be
with the grunts in security.

482
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,798
You may as well be
with the grunts in security.

483
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,467
Welcome to security.

484
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,886
Why don't we throw you into
the fire and see if you burn?

485
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:28,945
Computer, initiate
Combat Simulation Smorgasborg.

486
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:32,931
Computer, initiate
Combat Simulation Smorgasborg.

487
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,183
Initiating.

488
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,726
Borg!

489
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:35,785
Oh, crap.
I don't know how to fight.

490
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,353
Oh, crap.
I don't know how to fight.

491
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,606
I don't know how to fight.
Maybe this thing does?

492
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:42,292
O-Okay.

493
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,318
O-Okay.

494
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,904
Oh, I can do that?

495
00:15:47,255 --> 00:15:48,131
Ha, man. Ha!

496
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,532
Ha, man. Ha!

497
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,701
Take that. Chop, chop, bang!

498
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,664
Karate! Ha, ha.

499
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,170
In the name of the Prophets.

500
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,339
I-I put people
into that simulation

501
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:05,398
so they can learn
how to deal with defeat.

502
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,508
So they can learn
how to deal with defeat.

503
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,178
Ensign, you are
a natural-born warrior.

504
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:11,237
Oh. Okeydokey.

505
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,721
Oh. Okeydokey.

506
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,600
Keep your head down.
Andorians don't mess around.

507
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,620
Um, Andorians were a founding
member of the Federation.

508
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,397
Please don't explain them to me.
I can look out for myself.

509
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,120
You want to tell me
about Tellarites, too?

510
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:23,124
Maybe shut up and keep
an eye out for the shuttle?

511
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,959
Maybe shut up and keep
an eye out for the shuttle?

512
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,002
How about that?

513
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,862
No, you're hurting me. Please.

514
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:28,922
My bones.

515
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,698
My bones.

516
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,741
- They're killing him!
- Boimler!

517
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,743
Please, no. I-I can explain.

518
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,537
Explain it to my boot.

519
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,266
Starfleet! I order you
to step away from the elder.

520
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,251
You idiot!
That's no elder, it's...

521
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:42,310
Now I'm a little boy.

522
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,087
Now I'm a little boy.

523
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,922
A shapeshifter? Ah, boo.

524
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:46,981
That Vendorian is a thief,
and you let him get away!

525
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,591
That Vendorian is a thief,
and you let him get away!

526
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,469
They must be working together!

527
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,436
Oh, no! Aah!

528
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,666
Stand down. This is in violation
of the Tulganan Neutrality Pact.

529
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,068
Stand down. This is in violation
of the Tulganan Neutrality Pact.

530
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,346
Kirk hands!

531
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,414
Kirk hands!

532
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,625
Hello, alien people.

533
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:23,685
Alien creatures and beings.

534
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,085
Alien creatures and beings.

535
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,795
Look up here. Thank you. Okay.

536
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,190
I would be happy to hand you
all your asses, but right now,

537
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:29,190
we're kind of on a deadline, so
how about instead of fighting,

538
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,568
we're kind of on a deadline, so
how about instead of fighting,

539
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,343
the next five rounds are on me?

540
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,308
It's cool. I stole it
from that Taxor!

541
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,518
Excuse me, sir.
I don't know you.

542
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:41,578
That is Starfleet property
you're handling.

543
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,812
That is Starfleet property
you're handling.

544
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:47,792
Ah, apparently,
we just missed K'orin.

545
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,485
Ah, apparently,
we just missed K'orin.

546
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,361
- If we hurry,
maybe we can get him.

547
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,155
- I don't even care anymore.
- What?

548
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:53,214
- Oh, man, how much blood
did you lose?
- Ow.

549
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,491
- Oh, man, how much blood
did you lose?
- Ow.

550
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,926
This whole time, I've either
been one step behind you

551
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,828
- or totally in the dark.
- Yeah, but only because
I'm pretty amazing.

552
00:17:59,912 --> 00:17:59,888
Look, everyone has bad days.

553
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,663
Look, everyone has bad days.

554
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,427
All that studying,
and where did it get me?

555
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,792
Klingon threw a knife
at my head.

556
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,376
I nearly got eggs
laid in my throat.

557
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:06,436
Those guys at the bar
wanted to eat me.

558
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,796
Those guys at the bar
wanted to eat me.

559
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,797
What is that?
What are you doing?

560
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,882
Kitalia leaves...
They contain a numbing agent.

561
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:11,941
I've never once seen you study,
but then you just

562
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,384
I've never once seen you study,
but then you just

563
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,512
breeze in here
knowing cool plant tricks

564
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,013
and which aliens
are which... how?

565
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:18,072
Dude, I told you
I've been places.

566
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,416
Dude, I told you
I've been places.

567
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,974
I just pick stuff up
along the way.

568
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,309
I could never do that.

569
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,228
I guess I'm just not cut out
for Starfleet.

570
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:24,287
Oh, please,
you're Mr. Starfleet.

571
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,687
Oh, please,
you're Mr. Starfleet.

572
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,147
No, I'm not, not like you are!

573
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,191
I should just turn in
my uniform and go

574
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:29,250
work on a research asteroid!

575
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,235
Work on a research asteroid!

576
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,821
No, absolutely not.
Do not even joke about that.

577
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,340
That is the lamest thing
you could do.

578
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:35,340
I should just
study bugs on a far-off planet

579
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,533
I should just
study bugs on a far-off planet

580
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,869
and then eventually get eaten
and no one will even know

581
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,746
until they stumble
across my distress call,

582
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:42,806
but it'll be way too late,

583
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,206
but it'll be way too late,

584
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,809
and then they'll have to spend
a bunch of time

585
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,292
deciphering
how things went wrong

586
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:47,352
based on my final
shaky video logs.

587
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,503
Based on my final
shaky video logs.

588
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,214
I'm sure you wouldn't get eaten.

589
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:52,273
Starfleet doesn't just need
badass cool people like me.

590
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,217
Starfleet doesn't just need
badass cool people like me.

591
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,553
They need, like, book-smart
people like you, too.

592
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,222
When we get back, I'm done.

593
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,895
All right, everyone, huddle up.

594
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:06,955
I want to introduce you to the
newest bear in our bear pack.

595
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,732
I want to introduce you to the
newest bear in our bear pack.

596
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:10,792
Rutherford's blood runs
yellow and black.

597
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,110
Rutherford's blood runs
yellow and black.

598
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,028
He's one of us.

599
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,406
Security isn't like
the other departments.

600
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:17,465
No, it's a higher calling.

601
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,908
No, it's a higher calling.

602
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,578
We stand shoulder to shoulder,
holding the line

603
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:22,637
against dangers
known and unknown.

604
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,247
Against dangers
known and unknown.

605
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,790
No greater honor

606
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,709
than to die
beside you in battle.

607
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:28,768
Yes, Rutherford, you're
never going to have to see

608
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:32,129
Yes, Rutherford, you're
never going to have to see

609
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,590
the inside
of a Jefferies tube again.

610
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,799
Thank you, sir.

611
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:35,859
This all sounds fun
but not for me.

612
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,594
This all sounds fun
but not for me.

613
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,970
What?

614
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:40,929
My heart's in engineering.

615
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:40,989
I'd like permission
to leave the bear pack.

616
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,265
I'd like permission
to leave the bear pack.

617
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,392
Rutherford, that is...

618
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,602
outstanding!

619
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,895
Got to be true to yourself!

620
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:47,954
Am I right, bears?

621
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,330
Am I right, bears?

622
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,940
- Hoorah!
- Aw, bears.

623
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,401
Come on, we got to take
a shortcut.

624
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:54,460
We're almost out of time.

625
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,402
We're almost out of time.

626
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,485
Whatever. Who cares?

627
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,613
I clearly do.

628
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,406
Greetings, "hyoo-mons."

629
00:19:59,489 --> 00:19:59,465
I noticed you are injured.

630
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,658
I noticed you are injured.

631
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,578
Perhaps I could
provide you transport.

632
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,121
Uh, no, thank you, sir.

633
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:06,180
Yeah, right.
Can you believe this guy?

634
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:07,640
Yeah, right.
Can you believe this guy?

635
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,808
Actually, yeah,
that would be great.

636
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,351
- We're kind of in a hurry.
- Wait, what?

637
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:10,351
Excellent. My shuttle is
just beyond that ridge.

638
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,128
Excellent. My shuttle is
just beyond that ridge.

639
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:15,464
Come, come.

640
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,307
What are you doing?
We can't trust a Ferengi.

641
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:17,358
- What? He's not a Ferengi.
- Yes, he is!

642
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,259
- What? He's not a Ferengi.
- Yes, he is!

643
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,178
- No, I think he's a Bolian.
- Oh, my God!

644
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,139
He could not be more Ferengi...
The big ears, the beady eyes,

645
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:24,198
that greedy thing they do
with their hands.

646
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:25,366
That greedy thing they do
with their hands.

647
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,142
"Hyoo-mon."

648
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,769
- Myah.
- Ferengi are

649
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,492
the most untrustworthy race
in the galaxy.

650
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:30,538
He probably just wants to lure
us over there so he can mug us.

651
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,832
He probably just wants to lure
us over there so he can mug us.

652
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,024
Look, we need a ride now,

653
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,692
and my gut is telling me
this is fine.

654
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:35,752
Need I remind you
that you've been wrong

655
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,861
Need I remind you
that you've been wrong

656
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,488
about literally
everything today?

657
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,864
Not this.

658
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,324
Uh-huh, sure. Okay, buddy.

659
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:42,383
- Let's go.
- Good, good.

660
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,825
- Let's go.
- Good, good.

661
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,370
- Follow me right this...
- What's your landing code?

662
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,621
Uh, what?

663
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:47,680
Tulganan security requires
all shuttlecraft

664
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,384
Tulganan security requires
all shuttlecraft

665
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,124
to provide
a secure landing code.

666
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,502
If you really have a shuttle
here, you must have a code.

667
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:53,561
Oh, my code, yes.

668
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,087
Oh, my code, yes.

669
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,339
It's, uh, right... here!

670
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,007
- Give me your profit!
- Oh!

671
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:00,401
Aah! Starfleet!

672
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,511
Aah! Starfleet!

673
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,863
Hey, Ferengi,
get-get out of here!

674
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,721
Get! Get!

675
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:04,781
Okay, maybe you were right.
That, uh...

676
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,349
Okay, maybe you were right.
That, uh...

677
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,035
that seems like that
might've been a Ferengi.

678
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,853
I was so right, yes!

679
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:11,913
Holy crap, it's the shuttle.
It's the shuttle!

680
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,147
Holy crap, it's the shuttle.
It's the shuttle!

681
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,984
- Bye-bye.
- Isn't that illegal?

682
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,920
What are they gonna do,
send me a bill in space?

683
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:18,920
Fair enough. If we gun it, we
can just make it back in time.

684
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,964
Fair enough. If we gun it, we
can just make it back in time.

685
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,448
Oh, man, he drank everything!

686
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,592
- What do we do?
- Grab a leg.

687
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:24,592
Let's drag him out
and leave him by the front door,

688
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,427
Let's drag him out
and leave him by the front door,

689
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,221
unless you don't think
that's Starfleet enough.

690
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,871
It isn't, but let's do it.

691
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,376
I demand

692
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,336
you give me an honorable...

693
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,507
Someone contact the Cerritos,

694
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,217
tell them
we finally found K'orin.

695
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,276
He is just in time
for the peace accords.

696
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,553
He is just in time
for the peace accords.

697
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,888
Fetch me my drinking horn.
I need ale.

698
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:46,948
Are you kidding me?
No! Stop that.

699
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,433
Are you kidding me?
No! Stop that.

700
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,562
Whew, what a day!

701
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:53,621
Man, that escort mission
kind of went off the rails, huh?

702
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,231
Man, that escort mission
kind of went off the rails, huh?

703
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:58,066
Sure did.

704
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,028
Can't believe I didn't realize
that was a Ferengi in the park.

705
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,531
Hey, uh, so do you think maybe,

706
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,783
maybe, fun idea, we could
just keep it between us?

707
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:06,843
For sure.
We're in a circle of trust.

708
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,577
For sure.
We're in a circle of trust.

709
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,787
This is a shuttle of silence.

710
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,789
So the Ferengi's right there,

711
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:12,849
and I'm like, "Mariner,
we can't trust this guy.

712
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,753
And I'm like, "Mariner,
we can't trust this guy.

713
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,853
He's a Ferengi." And then
she says, she says, get this,

714
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:16,853
she says,
"Oh, no, that's a Bolian."

715
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,212
she says,
"Oh, no, that's a Bolian."

716
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,425
- Bolian!
- Okay, okay.

717
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:23,484
Yep, yep, all right.

718
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,052
Yep, yep, all right.

719
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,304
After this long day
of being a badass,

720
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,198
Captain Know-It-All over here
doesn't even know

721
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:29,198
- what a Ferengi was.
- It wasn't as clear as that.

722
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,308
- What a Ferengi was.
- It wasn't as clear as that.

723
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,977
"Myah, myah, hyoo-mon!"

724
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,896
He was doing the hand thing
and everything.

725
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:35,955
All right, yeah,
no, that's my cue

726
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,290
All right, yeah,
no, that's my cue

727
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,316
to go just launch myself
out an air lock.

728
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,109
You guys have a great night.

729
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:41,169
Lucky I was there!
I spotted it. I called it.

730
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,111
Lucky I was there!
I spotted it. I called it.

731
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,238
I called it.

732
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,116
Tendi, I'm sorry.

733
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,176
I tried to make it work
in another division.

734
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,844
I tried to make it work
in another division.

735
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,120
I just couldn't do it.
I belong in the tubes.

736
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,932
- I'm not gonna be able
to watch the pulsar with you.
- All right, whatever.

737
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:54,932
I'll just watch it
in there with you on my PADD.

738
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,642
I'll just watch it
in there with you on my PADD.

739
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,986
Wait, you can?
We don't have to go

740
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,395
to the observation deck
or anything?

741
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,962
Nah, I just wanted company.

742
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,340
I mean, it's not like you were
trying all those new jobs

743
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,674
just to hang with me, right?

744
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:04,734
No, yeah, no.

745
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,302
No, yeah, no.

746
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,137
Could you imagine?

747
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:12,492
Ah, Mariner, was I
convincing enough for you,

748
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,519
Ah, Mariner, was I
convincing enough for you,

749
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,813
"hyoo-mon"?

750
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:17,872
You were perfect, Quimp.
Thanks for helping out.

751
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,148
You were perfect, Quimp.
Thanks for helping out.

752
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,608
Of course. I owed you one.

753
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,318
- How's the wife?
- She's good.

754
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:23,377
We're actually looking to
get away to Risa this weekend.

755
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,987
We're actually looking to
get away to Risa this weekend.

756
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,989
What? Ah, jealous.

757
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:28,049
Oh, you know what you guys
should try? Jamaharon.

758
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,159
Oh, you know what you guys
should try? Jamaharon.

759
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,203
Wow.

760
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,789
Isn't it amazing?

761
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:36,891
It's beautiful.

762
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,251
It's beautiful.

763

2
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:18,295
Parker?

3
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,531
Well, I'm on my way.

4
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,010
Okay, Dad.

5
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,664
I'll see you later.

6
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:42,928
You got plans today?

7
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:45,453
There's an exhibition
at the Rubin.

8
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:46,845
Faith and Empire.

9
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:47,977
Hmm.

10
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:51,198
Sounds
interesting.

11
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:52,938
I thought so.

12
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:58,770
Well, maybe we could get lunch
or something later.

13
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,124
I'd like that.

14
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:43,946
Suzie, change of plans.

15
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,817
Cancel my 3:00
with Senator Andrews

16
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:48,080
and tell Parker
we gotta reschedule our lunch.

17
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,605
And get the jet ready
for a trip to London.

18
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,617
- This is Alan Blunt.
- Leave a message.

19
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:04,619
Yeah, Alan,
it's Michael Roscoe here.

20
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:05,794
I need to talk to you.

21
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,491
It's, um...

22
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:09,319
It's a little difficult
to explain.

23
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,973
It's about Parker.

24
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:12,453
I'm coming to London.

25
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:14,324
I think I may be
going out of my mind.

42
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:40,541
Alex.

43
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,542
Not doing it.

44
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:42,543
Hey, come on, mate.

45
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:43,718
No. No.Two minutes.

46
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:45,328
Just two minutes'
worth of film.

47
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,982
Haven't you got a lesson
to go to?

48
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:48,723
No, we can get it on the walk.Oh...

49
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:50,942
The thing I most remember
about Tom at school

50
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:53,075
was his creative determination,
his drive.

51
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:54,816
That's what
really set him apart.

52
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:56,470
Just talking about it now,

53
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,211
almost as if I can still
see him, right in front of me.

54
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:01,866
If you don't take it seriously
it's gonna look stupid.

55
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:04,434
It's stupid. How can you do
a Making Of documentary

56
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,044
when you haven't made
any movies?

57
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:07,307
Shooting out of sequence.

58
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,917
It's
"get someone else to do it."

59
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,788
Very witty, smart.
Looks good on you.

60
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:13,356
Well, it was Jahid's idea.Get Jahid to do it then.

61
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,792
Jahid had another idea.

62
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,751
He said,
"Oh, that's a really good idea.

63
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:18,927
We should get footage tonight
at the party

64
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:20,929
that Ayisha's going to."What?

65
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:23,627
That perked you up a bit.
I knew that would work on you.

66
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:25,499
Which party?Typical, so predictable.

67
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:28,328
You won't do anything for
your friends, but the ladies...

68
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,547
When we talk
about the classics,

69
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:34,725
we think about ominous,
dusty, Victorian tomes

70
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:37,554
and forget that these books
were written to be enjoyed.

71
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:39,295
How come Jahid knows
about the party

72
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:42,037
but doesn't know where it is?Because he's not invited.

73
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:44,822
He was in a stall in the girls'
toilets when he overheard

74
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:47,042
Lianne tell Kellie
she and Ayisha were going.

75
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:49,174
What was Jahid doing
in the girls' toilets?

76
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:51,394
That's what you're choosing
to focus on here?

77
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:54,092
How can we go to the party
if we don't have an address?

78
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:55,703
Who says I don't have
an address?

79
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:58,532
Phone. Right now.

80
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,490
No, I was getting
my phone out to--

81
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,100
You know the rules.

82
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,059
Here.

83
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,675
See you tomorrow,
gents.

84
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:18,029
We all have our own
particular set of skills.

85
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:19,683
This is a more
your-skills thing.

86
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:22,077
You got it confiscated,
you get it back.

87
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:24,688
The lights are low.

88
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:25,950
You're next to Ayisha.

89
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,648
The magic
starts to happen.

90
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:30,085
Or a horror movie marathon
and a long cold shower.

91
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:31,391

Uh...

133
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:18,193
Hi.

134
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:19,368
For heaven's sake, Alex,

135
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:20,630
what were you thinking?

136
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,805
I forgot
my coursework.

137
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:22,676
Don't lie.

138
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:25,548
Tom's phone
got confiscated.

139
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,289
All I was doing
was getting it back.

140
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:30,422
By breaking into school?

141
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:33,077
Seemed like a plan at the time.Did it?

142
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:36,907
You should answer that.

143
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,825
And put it on speaker phone,
please.

144
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:43,305
Yeah? You and Alex

145
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:45,437
coming to the party?
I texted you.

146
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:46,917
Tom and Alex
won't be available

147
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,440
for any parties
this weekend.

148
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,182
They've got a lot of revision
to be getting on with.

149
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:53,358
Put that in the glove box,
please.

150
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:55,709
Come on.Actions have consequences.

151
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,754
Put it in the glove box.
Now.

152
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:05,283
There's no food in the fridge.

153
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:07,242
Your uncle looked
a little uptight.

154
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:08,460
He's always uptight.

155
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,158
What did you do this time?Nothing.

156
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:13,204
That's a lie.Okay, something.

157
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:15,598
It's just he wants me
to be just like him.

158
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,208
What's wrong with that?

159
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,820
Jack, come on. He's the world's
most boring man.

160
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,300
He works at a bank.
His casual wear is gray.

161
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,520
You guys go scuba diving
in the Med.

162
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,348
Canopy climbing
in the jungle.

163
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:29,307
And that thing with the yurts
and the camel dung,

164
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:30,961
that was not boring.

165
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:33,268
It was disgusting,
but it wasn't boring.

166
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:34,922
What is that?It's just cutlery?

167
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:37,794
Is that how you set the table?It's takeout.

168
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,623
No. It's dinner
that I cooked from scratch.

169
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,364
You forgot to buy food
again?

170
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:45,149
I had stuff.
Important stuff.

171
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:47,804
So, what we're gonna do
is we're gonna take this wok

172
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:50,590
and take a little sauce
out of here and put it here.

173
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,809
We're gonna throw
all these empty containers

174
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:55,595
into the trash and we're
never gonna speak of this again.

175
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:58,902
You really have this down
to a fine art.

176
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:00,164
Shut up.

177
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:01,949
Oh, by the way,
you owe me half.

178
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:04,255
You were supposed
to buy food.

179
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:06,562
If I chip in for this,
can you talk to him?

180
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:08,346
Come on, Alex.

181
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:10,740
You have to fight
your own battles.

182
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:18,008
Is it difficult time,
Mr. Roscoe?

183
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:20,228
I thought we had
a no-devices-at-dinner rule?

184
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:24,493
This is work. Michael Roscoe was
a client of ours at the bank.

185
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:26,538
Parker looks so weird in a suit.

186
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,192
How do you know
Parker Roscoe?

187
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:31,239
I'll see if I can find it.

188
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:38,550
This is called  Having Your Cake and Eating It.

189
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,161
Everybody needs cake.

190
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:42,380
An operation of this magnitude

191
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,687
takes a lot of people,
but I'd especially like--

192
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,518
Parker,
what is the matter with you?

193
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:51,694
I'm so sorry.

194
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:54,044
Hey, Dad, say "cheese".

195
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:55,698
Ooh. Wow.

196
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:57,657
It kind of puts things
into perspective,

197
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,963
like getting your mate's
phone back from school

198
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:01,573
isn't such a big deal.

199
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:03,053
When was this?

200
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,751
Like last year.Mm-hm.

201
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:07,579
Oh, his dad had some hissy fit
and sent him off somewhere

202
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,104
to get straightened out.
And now he's in a suit.

203
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:12,367
Sent him off somewhere?
What do you mean?

204
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,369
You know,
like a boot camp.

205
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:16,893
That sounds like a good idea,
doesn't it, Jack?

206
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:18,373
You remember the name?

207
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:19,504
Mm...

208
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:20,897
No.

209
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:23,204
It was only mentioned
in the comments.

210
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:24,727
Somewhere in France.

211
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:51,798
Martin, hi, yes.

212
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:54,191
Sorry to bother you so late,
something's come up.

213
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:56,063
Do you remember Serenkov?

214
00:11:57,412 --> 00:11:59,544
Yeah, he had a son,
didn't he?

215
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,677
And there were issues there,
I think,

216
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:04,288
and he got sent to
a school.

217
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:09,337
For troubled kids. I think that
school was called Point Blanc.

218
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:12,775
Just one sec.

219
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,996
Yeah, could you call our friend
in Moscow and double-check?

220
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:19,086
Thanks.

221
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,002
Jack.

222
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,396
You wanted a word?

223
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:26,789
I did, I did.

224
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,486
The school tried
calling you today,

225
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:31,054
but you didn't pick up.Yeah, sorry about that.

226
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:33,143
It's okay, though, right?
You got there.

227
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:35,580
Yeah, I did, I did.
I was just a little concerned.

228
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,365
Because, um...

229
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:41,717
Well, you know Alex,
he's bright and he's determined,

230
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,327
and he questions everything.

231
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:46,461
But he can be impulsive,
and he can be irresponsible.

232
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:48,637
I need you to help
set him clear boundaries.

233
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:50,857
He's not a kid anymore.

234
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:53,337
He doesn't need me
to tie his shoelaces

235
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:55,513
and pack his lunch
and run his life.

236
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,167
He can do that all himself.

237
00:12:57,167 --> 00:13:00,040
You hold this place together,
Jack, remember that.

238
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,834
I got my graduation papers.

239
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,359
No.

240
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:18,841
Congratulations.

241
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,234
Well done.

242
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,844
What's--?
It's been six years?

243
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,064
Six years.Six years.

244
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:27,850
Well done. We should celebrate.
You shouldn't have cooked.

245
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,679
We should've got a takeaway,
opened some champagne.

246
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:33,900
This...

247
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,945
was supposed to be
a part-time thing.

248
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:38,992
While I got my degree.

249
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:41,211
And now you've passed.

250
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,259
Are you saying
you want to leave?

251
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,608
I don't want to...

252
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,528
Sorry, it's work.Go on, it's okay.

253
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:54,616
Sorry, Jack.

254
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,926
Martin.

255
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:01,405
What, he took it off you?

256
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:03,103
But that's my phone. I know.

257
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:05,932
I told him,
but you know what he's like.

258
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:08,935
It's just in the car. I can
get it later, it'll be fine.

259
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:11,981
All right. Well, anyway, Jahid
sorted us out the address.

260
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,896
I know where it's on.
You coming?

261
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,333
I'm not allowed out.
I'm grounded.

262
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,206
Dude, are you serious?
It's a party.

263
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:20,990
Look. Hold on one sec.

264
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,389
Sorry, big man,
it's just constant with...

265
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:30,173
Look, I'm not
going by myself, man.

266
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:32,219
If you're--I've to go back to the office.

267
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:33,263
I'll see you later?

268
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:34,699
Yeah.Okay.

269
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:37,311
Oh, Alex. That, um...

270
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,008
That school
you were talking about,

271
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:40,575
wasn't Point Blanc,
was it?

272
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:44,231
Yeah. Why?

273
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:48,104
No reason,
just well-remembered.

274
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:53,805
And the window of opportunity
swings open.

275
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:57,418
Come on through.

276
00:14:57,418 --> 00:15:00,551
He's quite a tosser. Someone might like it.

277
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,814
Why don't we try it?

278
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:04,294
Um, sports.

279
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:05,643
Yup. Of course.

280
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:07,645
Of course it is.
Hey, don't try and work.

281
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:08,864
Heh. Hey.

282
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:10,344
Hey, man,
you've got your own.

283
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:21,311
So, what have you got?

284
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:24,532
Well, it's kind
of interesting, actually.

285
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:28,318
I called our friend in Moscow,
but he's not there.

286
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:32,627
Turns out he's here,
in London.

287
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:34,194
Really?Yeah.

288
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:36,196
Yeah, and he says
he wants to see us.

289
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:38,894
Look,
everything was normal.

290
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:41,288
We're talking, he's fine.

291
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:43,159
Then I mentioned
this school of yours,

292
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,726
there is one hell
of a reaction.

293
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:46,728
What kind of a reaction?

294
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,425
The second I mentioned
Point Blanc,

295
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:50,253
he clams up.

296
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,299
He's completely paranoid
all of a sudden.

297
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:55,780
He won't say another word
over the phone.

298
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,566
So why are we meeting
at this place?

299
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,133
Zero surveillance?

300
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,961
Like I say,
he's paranoid.

301
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,528
Did you shave?

302
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,443
Why would I shave?

303
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:09,011
There's nothing to shave.
Stole some cologne, though.

304
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,926
That's why I'm asking.

00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:11,247
No. But unexpected trouble's
always the worst kind.

00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,780
Nowadays, scripts
are just copy and paste.

321
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,697
There's no real feeling
behind it.

322
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:29,309
There's no energy, you know
what I mean? It's just--

323
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:33,530
And that's what's so great
about the X-Men movies.

324
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,881
Well, I always thought it was
just mutants with superpowers.

325
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:39,667
Well, I mean, yeah,

326
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,277
but the thing with X-Men

327
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:42,974
is they're hidden
in plain sight.

328
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:45,977
They walk among us, but they
keep themselves to themselves.

329
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:47,153
Until they don't,

330
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:48,241
and people realize

331
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:50,286
and people react with fear

332
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:52,071
and confrontation
and paranoia.

333
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,246
Oh, Ayisha.

334
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:54,943
Oh, hey, uh...

335
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,031
Alex.Yeah.

336
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:57,032
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

337
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:58,425
Hey, uh...Hey.

338
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:00,470
We have...Uh, history.

339
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,472
Yeah.History together, yeah.

340
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:04,561
What is that?

341
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:08,348
I think it's like beer
and vodka and like whiskey.

342
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:11,090
There's a guy back there,
he's making them.

343
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,659
Yeah, that is beer
and vodka and whiskey.

344
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:16,573
Um...

345
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:19,446
I'll see you around then.Yeah.

346
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:21,056
See you.

347
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,109
The X-Men,
that's got real grit.

348
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,501
That's real. You know?

349
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,242
The whole thing
is like a metaphor

350
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:35,070
for the LGBTQ community.

351
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,509
I mean, just swapped superpowers
for socially permissible sex.

352
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:41,903
I mean, the X-gene even
kicks in during puberty.

353
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:44,819
And it's like their version
of coming out, you know.

354
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:46,212
You're kind of hot.

355
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:47,996
You know that?

356
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,302
I-- Well, I--

357
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:52,914
Shit! Shit.

358
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:56,961
Oh, are you--? I...
I'm so-- You...

359
00:18:56,961 --> 00:19:00,051
I am gonna-- You stay there.

360
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,405
I think I pulled?

361
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,365
Yeah?Yeah.

362
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:13,021
Drink? Drink.Drink.

363
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:15,458
Drink.Drink. Drink.

364
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,634
♪ Step inside myself ♪

365
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:19,984
♪ And dance until
I drift away ♪

366
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:22,987
♪ We just don't care ♪

367
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:39,830
Something doesn't feel right,
Martin.

368
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:43,486
I agree.

369
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:00,547
Ian.

370
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,856
Yassen.

371
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:11,558
Small world, no?

372
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:13,255
How was New York?

373
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,083
I didn't see much of it.

374
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:19,087
Mainly the inside
of an elevator shaft.

375
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,917
And Serenkov?

376
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:25,006
Serenkov?

377
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,529
Wasn't me.

378
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,227
Someone else.

379
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:32,753
Where do we go from here,
Yas?

380
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:38,411
Well, I'm afraid
you're not going anywhere.

381
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,418
Drop the gun.

382
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,423
Martin.

383
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:54,209
You have no idea
who you're working for.

384
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:56,472
I know what I'm being paid.

385
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:58,474
You really think
you're gonna be around

386
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,171
long enough to enjoy it,
do you?

387
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:02,870
Drop the gun.

388
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:19,669
Who else have you told
about this?

389
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:23,325
No one. He was just running down
a hunch, that's all.

390
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,935
No one knows.

391
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:26,372
And this meeting?

392
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:28,983
I hid it in the Varna files,
like you asked.

393
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:40,342
I'm sorry, Ian.

394
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:44,128
I really am.

395
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:48,742
So am I.

396
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:12,505
You did very well.

397
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:16,813
Blunt's never gonna believe
Varna as a cover.

398
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:19,512
Well, maybe you're right,
but don't worry.

399
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:21,992
We've done
this sort of thing before.

400
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,561
If you don't mind?

401
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:38,661
So keep pressure on the wound
and, um, breathe easy

402
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:40,576
and go call it in.

403
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,237
I want to see him.

404
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:34,630
I'm sorry.

405
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,067
The crash was very bad.

406
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,504
I want to.

407
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:40,331
It's best you don't.

408
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:43,639
I don't understand.

409
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,119
It was a head-on collision,

410
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,208
and your uncle
was over the speed limit,

411
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,645
so there's a lot of damage
to the body.

412
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:51,865
I don't understand. He--

413
00:23:54,258 --> 00:23:55,869
He wouldn't...

414
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:49,548
We started a full forensic sweep
at 1 a.m.

415
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,941
It's taking longer
than we would like.

416
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:55,205
It's very clean. We'll have
ballistics later today,

417
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:57,643
but it was a 9 mm pistol.

418
00:25:57,643 --> 00:25:59,732
Wilby is back
at the department.

419
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:01,385
He was lucky.

420
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,042
Let me speak to him.

421
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:08,044
And what about the boy?

422
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:10,046
You do it.

423
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:19,273
First his parents,
now his uncle.

424
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:50,521
- Ian was more than a colleague.
- He was our friend.

425
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:53,568
All of us at the bank
are here for you, Alex.

426
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:57,224
They say he was
over the speed limit.

427
00:26:57,224 --> 00:27:00,270
Yes. I understand
that was the case.

428
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,839
He never did that. Never.

429
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,841
Sometimes
people make mistakes.

430
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,626
Not my uncle.

431
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:11,673
Alex, if there's
anything you need,

432
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,719
anything at all,
my number's on there.

433
00:27:16,112 --> 00:27:17,244
Point Blanc.

434
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,551
I'm sorry?

435
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:22,292
It's the last thing
he said to me

436
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:24,468
before he went out.

437
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:26,079
He wrote it on his desk.

438
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,863
Where was he going?

439
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:30,779
I don't know.
But we'll find out.

440
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:40,528
So he called you?

441
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:42,356
Yeah.

442
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:44,967
Ian said he had new information
about the Varna file,

443
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,621
and he wanted me
to come with him.

444
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:47,622
As backup?Yeah.

445
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:49,755
So he was
expecting trouble.

446
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:51,844
He didn't say.

447
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:54,673
Varna was a data-focused
cyber-attack.

448
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,413
When we trace that
all the way back,

449
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:58,372
we're gonna find
a sweaty Maths graduate

450
00:27:58,372 --> 00:27:59,808
with a broadband connection.

451
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,462
People like that
don't carry guns

452
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:03,551
and don't get the drop
on people like us.

453
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:05,118
So it's obviously not that.

454
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:08,208
Well, then if it wasn't Varna,
then what was it?

455
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:12,691
I don't know.

456
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:19,132
He didn't mention
anything else?

457
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:22,744
No other connections,
investigations?

458
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,137
No.

459
00:28:25,573 --> 00:28:27,706
None. Nothing at all.

460
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:07,789
Hi, Tom.

461
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,402
How is he?

462
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:15,710
He's upstairs.

463
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:22,761
No, Rider.

464
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,807
Romeo-India-Delta-Echo-Romeo.

465
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,417
Yeah, well,
can you check again?

466
00:29:31,987 --> 00:29:33,380
Hey.

467
00:29:36,513 --> 00:29:37,863
How are you doing?

468
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:41,040
Well, I mean,
I know you're not good.

469
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,693
Shit.

470
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:45,479
Um...It's all right. I'm okay.

471
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:47,133
Look, man,
I'm no good at this,

472
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:50,092
so we can talk
or we could watch a film...

473
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:51,877
I can't find
where they took him.

474
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:54,270
There's no hospital record,
no mortuary transfer.

475
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,532
There's nothing.

476
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:57,447
Mate, this really
doesn't matter.

477
00:29:57,447 --> 00:30:00,668
No hospital in London has any
record of him being brought in.

478
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:02,235
Maybe they spelt
his name wrong.

479
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:04,063
They're always doing stuff
like that.

480
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:06,500
Yeah, or maybe it didn't happen.What?

481
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,937
He never went over
the speed limit. Never.

482
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:12,462
Mate, I can't imagine
how hard this is for you, but--

483
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:14,943
But what if it's bollocks?
All of it?

484
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:17,685
What if it's bullshit?
What if they're lying?

485
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:19,034
Who?

486
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:25,301
Have you got--? Have you got
Find My Phone switched on?

487
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:27,042
What?On your phone.

488
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,001
Have you got Find My Phone
switched on?

489
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:30,611
The battery's
probably dead now.

490
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:33,353
Doesn't matter. It will have
saved the last location.

491
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:34,702
How's this gonna help?

492
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:36,486
We find your phone,
we find the car,

493
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:38,619
maybe we can find out
what really happened.

494
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:40,229
Password.

495
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:41,404
Okay.Come on.

496
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:42,318
Okay.

497
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:53,590
Where's that?

498
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:58,204
Somewhere by the river.
Some kind of industrial estate.

499
00:30:58,204 --> 00:31:00,075
Why would your uncle
go there?

500
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,908
Yeah, Alan,
it's Michael Roscoe.

501
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:09,955
I need to talk to you.
It's not...

502
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:13,610
It's not easy to explain.
It's about Parker.

503
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,657
I'm coming to London.
I may be losing my mind.

504
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,278
Roscoe's death
reminded Ian of something.

505
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:30,801
Another case entirely.

506
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:33,282
Gregoriy Serenkov
from Moscow.

507
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:36,024
He died in a yachting accident.
He had a son too.

508
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:39,419
And this was found
in his apartment in London.

509
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,769
We didn't think
it meant anything.

510
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,771
Then we found this.

511
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:49,255
That's Roscoe's study
just after he died.

512
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,388
Point Blanc.

513
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:54,825
It's a school
for troubled teenagers.

514
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:58,394
How did you make
that connection?

515
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:01,615
I didn't.

516
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:02,703
Alex Rider did.

517
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,320
Stay here.

518
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:25,046
All right! Let's wrap this up.

519
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:28,615
I want this area swept and clear
by 1900.

520
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:31,270
Let's get the car printed
and moved on.

521
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:34,403
If anyone asks,
it's the usual cover story.

522
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:39,626
All right! Let's wrap this up.

523
00:33:39,626 --> 00:33:43,064
I want this area swept
and clear by 1900.

524
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:45,675
Let's get the car printed
and moved on.

525
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:47,025
If anyone asks...

526
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:54,771
Oy! What are you doing here?

527
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,170
Alex, leave it.

528
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,042
Leave him, man!

529
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,044
Jesus Christ.

530
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,057
Right, who was that man?

531
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,710
What did you see?
Is it about Ian?

532
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,147
Do they know...?

533
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:23,539
What happened, man?

534
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:25,411
Can you do something for me?What?

535
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:27,239
Go home, tell Jack
I'll be back later.

536
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,240
What?

537
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,155
Just do it!

538
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:31,634
Well, call me.

539
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:34,028
I don't have--
Don't have a phone.

540
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,495
Good evening, Alex.

541
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:38,326
I know Krav Maga.Well...

542
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:42,069
I know shooting people
in the head.

543
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:44,158
Why don't we calm down

544
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:47,683
and have a cup of tea
and a chat?

545
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:52,645
Well, this is very
embarrassing, isn't it?

546
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,473
He sees straight
through our cover,

547
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:56,823
traces his uncle's car
to the scene of his death

548
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:58,346
with remarkable ingenuity.

549
00:36:58,346 --> 00:37:00,566
Gives one of our agents
a broken nose

550
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:01,958
for trying to apprehend him

551
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:04,047
then follows you
all the way across London

552
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:05,875
and finds his way here.

553
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:07,747
I find it
very impressive.

554
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:10,097
He's a walking
security breach.

555
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:13,013
An emotionally unstable teenager
who knows who we are

556
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:14,797
and who assaulted
one of our people.

557
00:37:14,797 --> 00:37:17,147
And isn't that exactly
what we need?

558
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:19,454
An emotionally unstable
teenager?

559
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:35,644
So he didn't work in a bank,
obviously.

560
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:37,864
He worked for us.

561
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:49,919
And who are you?

562
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:51,704
Who do you think we are?

563
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:54,881
Security Services.

564
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,099
MI6 or something.

565
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,753
Or something is about right.

566
00:37:57,753 --> 00:37:58,972
My name's Alan Blunt.

567
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:00,626
I'm in charge
of this department.

568
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:03,193
We are
a specialized subdivision

569
00:38:03,193 --> 00:38:05,631
of the British Secret
Intelligence Service.

570
00:38:05,631 --> 00:38:10,418
MI6 gather information,
we apply it.

571
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:12,159
We take care
of the bigger picture,

572
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,075
and we use
any means necessary.

573
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:18,296
And your uncle was one
of our very best field agents.

574
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,167
He lied to me.

575
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:23,126
My whole life.

576
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:25,215
Who he was, what he did.
Everything.

577
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:27,653
Secrecy is
an occupational necessity

578
00:38:27,653 --> 00:38:29,219
in our line of work.

579
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:31,526
Your uncle was shot
and killed doing his job.

580
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:33,615
There was no car crash,
obviously.

581
00:38:33,615 --> 00:38:35,182
But you know that already

582
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:38,011
because you are very much
your uncle's nephew.

583
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:40,666
And why does that matter
anymore?

584
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:43,495
Because there's something
we'd like you to do for us.

585
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:45,061
What?

586
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:46,541
A job.

587
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,894
You want me to help you?

588
00:38:56,377 --> 00:39:01,469
He died
in some scummy warehouse

589
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:03,471
because of you.

590
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:08,781
You can piss off.

591
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:11,436
All of you can piss off.

592
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:21,010
Just pick up the phone
in the morning, Alex,

593
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,838
if you change your mind.

594
00:39:26,015 --> 00:39:27,539
This is just wrong.

595
00:39:29,323 --> 00:39:31,238
The world is changing,
Mrs. Jones.

596
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:33,196
If we play by the old rules,

597
00:39:33,196 --> 00:39:35,460
we're going to lose
the new battles.

598
00:40:24,204 --> 00:40:25,814
Alex?

599
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:28,948
He shouldn't have died.

600
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:30,471
I know.

601
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:36,564
He shouldn't.

602
00:40:39,262 --> 00:40:40,960
They shouldn't have let him.

603
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,617
Sweetie,
it was an accident.

604
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:47,445
No one can stop that.

605
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,186
No. It wasn't.

606
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:55,061
Someone did this.

607
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:57,933
Someone did this to us.

608
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:01,110
Alex...

609
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:16,648
Jack Starbright? Yeah?

610
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:18,737
Home Office
Immigration Department.

611
00:41:18,737 --> 00:41:21,174
Mind if we come in? Uh, I suppose.

612
00:41:21,174 --> 00:41:23,263
May we see your passport
and visa, please?

613
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:25,308
Why?Your passport, Miss Starbright.

614
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:26,788
This won't take long.

615
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:33,926
What's all this about?

616
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:35,667
Yeah, this looks fake. What?

617
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,712
I'm afraid
this visa is not valid.

618
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:40,585
We have a deportation order
in your name, Miss Starbright.

619
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,935
How long have you been working
as a housekeeper?

620
00:41:42,935 --> 00:41:44,589
Alex Rider?Yeah?

621
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:47,156
Child Protective Services.
Can I come in?

622
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:48,462
I suppose.

623
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:50,290
Not wrong, I can assure you.

624
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,509
What's all this about?

625
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,162
You were told
about the care order?

626
00:41:53,162 --> 00:41:54,816
No. What?

627
00:41:54,816 --> 00:41:56,731
There's no longer a responsible
adult in the house.

628
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:58,559
We have to relocate you.Relocate me?

629
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,736
You should've been told.I'm here with him.

630
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:03,085
I don't need anybody--

631
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:04,826
Got an overnight bag
you can gather?

632
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:06,611
Some clothes
and a toothbrush?

633
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:08,308
You're not help...

634
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:09,875
Wait. Wait! Wait!

635
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:11,006
Wait.

636
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:13,139
Just wait. A moment. Please.

637
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:27,414
I don't even need to dial,
do I?

638
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:30,635
You're listening right now.

639
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,943
I was gonna come in.
I was already going to.

640
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:37,859
All you've done is show me
what kind of people you are.

641
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:42,168
But I'll do it, all right?

642
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:43,735
I'll do it.

643
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,868
Call off the dogs.

644
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:57,662
Go ahead.

645
00:42:58,706 --> 00:43:00,099

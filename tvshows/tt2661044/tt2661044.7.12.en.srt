1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,296
Of course, we'll kneel.

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,008
Was there ever even a question?

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,260
These are yours.

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,762
Ah. Why do I get the
feeling this is good-bye?

5
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,389
The palace is mine now.

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,391
So is the farmhouse.
For you, that...

7
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,059
We'll take the machine shop.

8
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,897
You need a mechanic to
run the reactor. She's your girl.

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,691
Besides, you wouldn't want
your favorite chess partner

10
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,110
to live in a tent, would you?

11
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,946
Fine. Go. Who's next?

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,163
Kneel so that you
can fight another day.

13
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,081
Good. I still
get to kill you.

14
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,172
Convicts, children of gabriel,

15
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,673
welcome to the new sanctum.

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,008
Things have changed quickly,

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,676
but the future is
full of promise,

18
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,970
and to reap the benefits
of this bright, new day,

19
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,431
I ask only that you take a knee

20
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,433
to show your loyalty,

21
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,685
a simple gesture that binds
you to a contract

22
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,228
with a single rule...

23
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,939
If at any time you do anything

24
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,817
that I deem disloyal,

25
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,527
you die.

26
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,909
And if we refuse?

27
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,660
You die.

28
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,667
In that case,

29
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,169
the killers and the thieves

30
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,671
of eligius exploration
ship number 4

31
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,548
are at your service.

32
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,767
Nelson.

33
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,479
My name is sachin.

34
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,274
My people and I swore and oath.

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,903
Better to die free

36
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,448
than worship at the feet
of false gods.

37
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,119
I will not kneel

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,788
tonight or ever.

39
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,422
Does this man speak
for all of you?

40
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,217
Surely some here
would prefer to live.

41
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,679
One small genuflection,
and life goes on,

42
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,849
one sanctum under me
for the benefit of all.

43
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,478
You stand by your principles,

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,398
and your people stand by you.

45
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,733
Those are the qualities
of a true leader.

46

47
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,925
There is only one leader
in sanctum.

48
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,678
Kneel before him or die.

49
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,935
Death... is life.

50
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,610
Aah!

51
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,997
We were so close.

52
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,124
Bill, I know you're upset.

53
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,170
Upset? Why would
I be upset,

54
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,797
just because we're back
to square one,

55
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,465
randomly entering codes?

56
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,592
You told me clarke had the key.

57
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,220
Actually, octavia's
memories did that.

58
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,597
You just never saw the
moment the flame came out.

59
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,516
You let me believe it never did.

60
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,650
My shepherd,
may I have a moment?

61
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,902
Of course.

62
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,487
Everybody out.

63
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,661
You look good in white.

64
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,454
Lock him up with the others.

65
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,540
Let's go. Move it.

66
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,428
You're wondering what
will happen to your friends.

67
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,638
Yes, my shepherd.

68
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,265
Join me, please.

69
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,316
Mmm. Broth.

70
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:20,278
I'd have killed for this during
my time on the mountain.

71
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,947
I heard about
first disciple anders.

72
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,782
I assume you two were close.

73
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,409
I'm very sorry.

74
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,827
Close?

75
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,247
I met him twice.
I usually only meet

76
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,416
the first disciple once
when they come to wake me

77
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,127
every 20 years to say
there's been no progress

78
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,921
to the last war.

79
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,382
Anders woke me twice.

80
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,801
The second time,
we had found the key,

81
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:48,306
so, yes, I suppose, I mean,
comparatively speaking,

82
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,849
we were close,

83
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,726
but that's not what you
meant, is it?

84
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,353
You were testing me
to see if I live

85
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,189
by the same code that
I expect of my disciples.

86
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,400
Yes. Forgive me.

87
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,904
I don't want to cause
you any more pain, bellamy,

88
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,281
but your friends have to
pay for what they've done.

89
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,866
Their crimes go beyond anders.

90
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,702
Dozens of disciples
are dead because of them.

91
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,663
What if there was a
way to fix the flame?

92
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,457
- Bellamy.
- With the technology

93
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,751
you have here,
it could be possible.

94
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,920
And you'll help me get it

95
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,923
as long as I don't
harm your friends?

96
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,969
Don't be ashamed.

97
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,179
The path is new to you.

98
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,389
I've walked it for centuries,

99
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,682
and it's still hard.

100
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,310
You remind me of my son reese.

101
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,812
He went in search of the flame.

102
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,063
I never saw him again.
I think

103
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,690
my daughter killed him.

104
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,110
I'll never know for sure.

105
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,986
Well, if I can get the flame

106
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,864
and your daughter
really is in there,

107
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,408
you can find out.

108
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,835
All right.
If you can get it

109
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,129
and if we can repair it

110
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,215
and if it contains
the code to the last war,

111
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,428
your friends will be absolved.

112
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,483
It's so good to see both of you.

113
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,361
Echo, your face.

114
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,447
Tell us this is a joke.

115
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,408
These clothes, the way
you betrayed us to cadogan.

116
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,493
Tell us this is part
of some plan.

117
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,120
Keep your voice down.
They are listening,

118
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,705
- and we don't have much time.
- Here's the part

119
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,331
where you tell us
how screwed we are.

120
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,793
Very. You're to
be executed.

121
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,338
There is one thing
that can stop it, the flame.

122
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,966
The flame that you told
cadogan we destroyed?

123
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,968
We believe it can be repaired.

124
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,678
We?

125
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,182
I don't know where it is.

126
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:59,937
Raven, you were there.

127
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,397
Who took it after it
came out of madi?

128
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,773
I don't know, and if I did,

129
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,484
I wouldn't tell you.

130
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,656
Yes.

131
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,414
Take this one to m-cap.

132
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,957
Bellamy, no!

133
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,292
Get off me don't touch me.

134
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,336
So much for family.

135
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,879
Move.

136
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,429
Who the hell are you?

137
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,681
I'm the man you love

138
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:39,352
the man I love would not
be ok with torturing raven.

139
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,853
It's not torture.

140
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,440
It is if you fight it.

141
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,610
I know these people, bellamy.

142
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,530
I trained for 5 years
to pass as one.

143
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,989
Then I spent another 3 months,

144
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,991
and I actually became one,

145
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,160
all so I could save you

146
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,830
and then avenge you.

147
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,749
I'm sorry you went through that.

148
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,334
Are you?

149
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,588
Because it looks to me
like while I was out there

150
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,632
doing everything I could
to get to you,

151
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,676
you were forgetting me,

152
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,427
forgetting your friends,

153
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,347
who your family is.

154
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,934
I scarred my own face
to remind myself

155
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,020
of who I was
and where I came from

156
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,773
so I wouldn't lose
myself while I let them play

157
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,567
with my mind.

158
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,903
You've lost yourself, bellamy.

159
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,863
This isn't you.

160
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:37,159
I'm trying to save all of you.

161
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:42,164
And what happens if
you can't find the flame?

162
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,916
You just gonna stand by
and watch

163
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,377
as they execute us?

164
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,421
You know I don't want that.

165
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:52,091
That's not what I asked.

166
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,760
What do you do when you believe

167
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:58,097
in something with all your heart

168
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,642
that people you love
think is crazy?

169
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,520
I don't know.

170
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,027
Watch us all die, I suppose.

171
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:16,324
Is this thing you believe in

172
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,242
really that important?

173
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,332
Is it more important than us?

174
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,922
Yes.

175
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,886
The end of war,

176
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,430
no more senseless death

177
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,265
or killing.

178
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,645
The shepherd can
deliver us there, echo.

179
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,775
All of us,

180
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,443
for all mankind.

181
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,747
Isn't that right, indra?

182
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,290
Excuse me?

183
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:52,128
Oh, you heard me.
You hear everything.

184
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,671
What about her daughter?

185
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,007
Gaia. She's
among the missing.

186
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,592
We believe she's
in the woods with a group

187
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,469
led by clarke griffin.

188
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,097
They're armed
and extremely dangerous.

189
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,099
Indra led a search party
to find her.

190
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,517
I was on it.

191
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,394
There's no sign of them,

192
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,104
but we did see this.

193
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,779
Why do you have madi's book?

194
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,239
We have a deal.

195
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,200
I kneel to you,
the child is spared.

196
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,163
Well, that was before she went
into hiding with my enemies.

197
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,707
- Are you my enemy, indra?
- No.

198
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,208
Tell me where she is.

199
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,919
I don't know.

200
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,714
Have trikru clean up this mess.

201
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,348
You, convict.

202
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,808
Come.

203
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,118
Play dead.

204
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,520
The coast is clear.
You can come out now.

205
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,694
It's ok.

206
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,364
We got clothing
and medical supplies.

207
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,075
Jackson said to only change
the grossest bandages.

208
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,829
Prioritize the antibiotics. Highest
fevers only, you understand?

209
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,497
There's no food.

210
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,915
We're working on that.

211
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,375
Jackson's getting us some bread.

212
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,377
Maybe we should just kneel.

213
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,672
What? No. Trey, everybody
down there, including you

214
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,591
lost people at sheidheda's
big debut.

215
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,009
He knows that.

216
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,636
You're scared,
but if he lets you live,

217
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,304
eventually that fear's
gonna turn to anger.

218
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,223
You're gonna want revenge
and rightfully so.

219
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,934
He will kill you
to prevent that.

220
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,519
What are we supposed to do?

221
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,104
We can't just hide
down there forever.

222
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,607
We are working on that,
too, I promise.

223
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,360
And we trust you.

224
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,487
Come on, trey.
Let's pass this stuff out.

225
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,579
I was right to believe in you.

226
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,505
I'm proud of you, too.

227
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,549
Yeah? What for?

228
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,553
Trey's right.
Hoping that we survive

229
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,722
long enough for our friends
to come and save us

230
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,432
is not a plan.

231
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,812
You're smiling?

232
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,441
Heh. Sorry.
It's just...

233
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,903
you're not worried
about yourself,

234
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,739
and I find that...

235
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,575
incredibly sexy.

236
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,620
Hmm. Behavior that
greatly increases

237
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,456
our risk of death
is sexy to you?

238
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,874
Ha.

239
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,797
- Who knew?
- Yeah.

240
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,841
- Ooh!
- Oh, ow.

241
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,470
Ha! Ow.

242
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,347
It's no castle. Ha ha!

243
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,057
No.

244
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:39,688
Even a cave...
garage...

245
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,443
with you, all
of them are castles.

246
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,286
Is it jackson again?

247
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,831
I don't think so.
Stay here.

248
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,347
Indra.

249
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,101
What the hell is that?
What have you got?

250
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,565
Sheidheda slaughtered
the children of gabriel.

251
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,444
They didn't kneel.

252
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,029
All of them?

253
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,076
Almost all.

254
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,620
Hey. Hey.
It's ok.

255
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,081
It's ok. I got you, kid.
Come on, come on.

256
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,836
Hey.

257
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,129
Can you protect him?

258
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,965
I think we might know a place.

259
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,092
You're safe now.
Come on.

260
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,970
Hey. Yeah. Ok.

261
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,350
There's more.

262
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,477
Sheidheda is looking for madi.

263
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,313
If he finds her,
he'll kill you, too.

264
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,607
Yeah. Trust me,
I'm aware.

265
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,569
Do you have any weapons?

266
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,779
Nuclear reactor count?

267
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,665
I'm proud of you, murphy.

268
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,250
Yeah. Get in line.

269
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,551
Hmm.

270
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,056
Ok.
Here we go.

271
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,520
What happened?

272
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,230
It's not his blood.

273
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,566
Take him to the decon
shower, clean him up.

274
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,448
Don't push him to talk.

275
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,950
Yesterday, he lost
his biological parents,

276
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,245
and today, his people
were killed.

277
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,289
What can I do for him?

278
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,459
Just be there, be his friend.

279
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,442
Indra?

280
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,111
Nikki, whispering. No, but
she said you could hide me.

281
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,374
Did she now?

282
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,918
Because I think indra
knows me better than that.

283
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,672
Hiding people from a one-eyed
mass-murdering dictator

284
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,257
not really a survivor's move.

285
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,763
Neither is not
inviting me in. Drop it.

286
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,142
Sheidheda asked me
to follow her.

287
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,893
I'm so glad it led me here.

288
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,603
- Open the reactor door.
- I don't know the code.

289
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,272
- First one goes in your leg.
- Fine. Easy, easy.

290
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,648
Ok, ok, ok.

291
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,400
- 1...
- don't shoot.

292
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,863
2...

293
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,041
hands where I can see them.

294
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,793
Nice and slow.

295
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,013
Jackpot.

296
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,556
Unh!

297
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,394
Hey. How'd I look
on camera?

298
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,021
Oh, good.

299
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,565
- She followed indra?
- Yeah.

300
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,861
You know, I'm starting to
miss being a live coward.

301
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,210
It might help to talk about it.

302
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,797
We're not friends.

303
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,758
Why would I talk to you?

304
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,595
Good question.

305
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,849
Maybe because I'm
the only one here...

306
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,188
or maybe because you
don't have any friends,

307
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,815
which I can totally relate to.

308
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,404
I was raised alone
on a spaceship.

309
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,492
You were raised alone
on a planet.

310
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,954
We both heard stories
about all the people

311
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,705
we're now surrounded by,

312
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,500
but they're not our friends.

313
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,170
When I was 10, the people here

314
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,673
abducted my mom and octavia.

315
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,467
I was left alone,

316
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:04,221
and a man, a prisoner came,

317
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,431
and he was my friend.

318
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,770
He raised me.

319
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,564
He trained me.
We...

320
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,400
We were gonna rescue them.

321
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:26,368
I got him killed because
I was too scared to kill,

322
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,497
and I vowed I would never
make that mistake again...

323
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,418
and I didn't...

324
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,173
up until the moment
I killed my own mother,

325
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,259
so do you still
think we're the same?

326
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,181
Your mom died a hero.

327
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,100
You weren't there.

328
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,228
She saved everyone here,

329
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,730
but I doubt that's
why she did it.

330
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,940
You were not there!

331
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,526
She did it to save you.

332
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,445
I wish she hadn't.

333
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,409
She didn't do it
to save your life, hope.

334
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,581
She did it to save your soul.

335
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,464
I c...

336
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,923
hey.

337
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,469
It's ok.

338
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,977
Ohh. Why?

339
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,312
I don't know.

340
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,901
I know.

341
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,903
Oh, it hurts.

342
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,404
Let it out.

343
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,964
Heh heh.

344
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,966
Something funny?

345
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,595
Because I don't see
anything humorous about this.

346
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,099
I'm smiling because I realized

347
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,518
I finally understand you.

348
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:19,648
Really? How so?

349
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,776
You have madi, I have hope.

350
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,028
I'd do anything
to keep her safe.

351
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,534
How long were you on penance?

352
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,912
We call it skyring.

353
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,706
10 years. Good ones.

354
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,422
What?

355
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,006
A couple of days ago,
she was just

356
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,800
our little girl.

357
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,344
Now she's messed up
like the rest of us.

358
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:05,152
You need backup
to talk to us now?

359
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,778
It's ok.

360
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,995
It's about time.

361
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,122
I have been racking my brain,

362
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,249
trying to figure out
how you telling cadogan

363
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,127
the truth about the flame
helps us.

364
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,213
You know what I've come up with?

365
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,756
It doesn't.

366
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,093
I couldn't lie to him.

367
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,219
Really?

368
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,679
Why not?

369
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,308
I had an experience,

370
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,394
something that changed me
to my core,

371
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,229
something that explains

372
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,858
why we're still here
and where we're going.

373
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,194
It came to me in a vision.

374
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,155
Mom was there.

375
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,491
The shepherd led me to her,

376
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,660
and there was a light,
and it was beautiful

377
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:59,414
and warm and peaceful,

378
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,334
and I chose it,

379
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:06,922
and when I opened my eyes,
the storm had passed

380
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,423
just like that.

381
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,469
- Bellamy...
- clarke, I...

382
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:16,348
I know how this sounds,
but it's real.

383
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:20,268
A war is coming, the last war

384
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,853
we will ever fight.

385
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,313
Win it,

386
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,774
and we become the light.

387
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,443
Is that what
the cult leader told you?

388
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,695
Did he tell you what
happens if we lose?

389
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,156
- We won't.
- We turn into crystal,

390
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,116
wiped out

391
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,327
like medusa turning
people into stone.

392
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,287
It's the end of everything.

393
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,915
Not everything, just us.

394
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,751
If I told you the ai
that destroyed the earth

395
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,378
was storing our minds
in a city of light,

396
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,130
would that be
any more believable?

397
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,174
What about a group of astronauts
turning themselves into gods

398
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,884
by transferring their minds
into the bodies

399
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,470
of their own followers
in order to live forever?

400
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:59,683
Ok. Yes. We've seen
our share of crazy,

401
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,061
but that doesn't change the
fact that fighting some war

402
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,188
to become the light
is as ridiculous

403
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,190
as the clothes you're wearing.

404
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,900
There's one way to find out.

405
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,488
Tell me where the flame is.

406
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,699
No.

407
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,119
Clarke, yesterday,
you were offering it up

408
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,413
in exchange for safe passage.

409
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,373
Yesterday, I was bluffing.

410
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,125
I made a deal
to save my friends,

411
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,876
knowing damn well
I had no intention

412
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,670
of following through with it.

413
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,505
Today, I'm standing
in front of my best friend,

414
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,549
who I thought was dead,

415
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,134
and I don't even recognize him.

416
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,760
Clarke, I am the same person

417
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,679
who brought you back
from the dead,

418
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,515
who refused to give up on you.

419
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,560
There is so much more
at stake here than you know,

420
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,979
and I know you don't
believe in transcendence,

421
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,064
but I'm telling you it's real,

422
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:52,235
and I am asking you
to believe in me.

423
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,903
Even if you're right,

424
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,907
even if everything
you're saying is true,

425
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,411
I will not help
that man start his war.

426
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,712
Tell me where the flame is.

427
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,673
Or what?

428
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,675
Dozens of disciples are dead,

429
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,761
including first disciple anders.

430
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,013
Yes, and every one of them

431
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,140
has tried to keep us
from saving our friends.

432
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:27,812
And now I am trying
to save you, all of you.

433
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:32,275
Clarke, if you don't
tell me where it is,

434
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,903
they will execute all of you.

435
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:38,281
Please let me help.

436
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,827
Go float yourself.

437
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,928
Guards.

438
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,473
Take this one to m-cap.

439
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,183
What?!

440
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,476
Come on.
Let's go.

441
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,977
Hey. Wait.

442
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,438
Bellamy, what are you doing?

443
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,981
What I have to do.

444
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,380
They all hate me.

445
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,092
They don't know what we know.

446
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,556
When we transcend,

447
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,349
they will understand.

448
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,271
For all mankind.

449
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,441
For all mankind.

450
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,703
Our guest is awake.

451
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,999
Yeah, and she snores
worse than you do.

452
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,835
Hey. It's ok.
She can't hurt anyone.

453
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,505
You know, actually, I've been
wondering about something.

454
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:21,134
You think hatch
would have kneeled?

455
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,386
I bet he would have. I think he
probably would have even made

456
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,555
sheidheda think he
was working for him.

457
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,974
He wouldn't have actually
done the work, though, would he?

458
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,269
Yeah. That's what
I thought.

459
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,066
You see that patch over there?

460
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,781
Hatch and I welded
that into place.

461
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,450
See, he already knew
he was gonna die.

462
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,243
All his men were down,
and raven,

463
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,245
in one of her more
questionable moments

464
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,789
that I nevertheless respect,

465
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,083
locked me in here with him.

466
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,835
She didn't think he
was gonna finish the job

467
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,588
once he knew, but he did.

468
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,006
You know why?

469
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,676
To save you.

470
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,512
That's what he said.

471
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,977
Now... ahem... if you
don't stop freaking out,

472
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,063
we are gonna have to
hold you in the core,

473
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,773
where the radiation
from the reactor

474
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,775
that he helped keep
from melting down

475
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,278
will eventually kill you.

476
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,322
His sacrifice will be worthless.

477
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,366
Personally, I don't want to
see that happen. Do you?

478
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,912
Good. Look. When
this is all over,

479
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,331
we'll drink to him
in the tavern, ok?

480
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,209
Ok.

481
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,592
All right. I'm awesome.

482
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,475
Aah!

483
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,687
Apologies, my shepherd,

484
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,063
but the neural link won't engage

485
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,773
with her fighting like this.

486
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,234
Keep trying.

487
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,028
Clarke, tell us
where the flame is.

488
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,072
Aah!

489
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,199
Sir, she's dangerously
close to hemorrhaging.

490
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,993
Sir,

491
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,203
I don't think she knows.

492
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,622
She does...
aah!

493
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,291
Or she wouldn't be fighting.

494
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,961
Turn it off.

495
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,927
I'm sorry, bellamy.
You did what you could.

496
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,013
Send the first of her
friends to penance.

497
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,396
Wait.

498
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,773
I'll take you to it

499
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,735
but only once all
my friends are safe.

500
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,737
Done.

501
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,238
Bellamy.

502
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,785
It didn't have to be like this.

503
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,167
Yes, it did.

504
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,816
Let the others do that, indra.

505
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:28,529
You ordered trikru
to clean up the blood.

506
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,115
I'm trikru.

507
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,992
Don't remind me.

508
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:36,037
When you're done,
clean yourself up.

509
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,789
The festivities
are about to begin.

510
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,040
Heda, for you.

511
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,755
Oh, my, knight.

512
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,178
Hmm.

513
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,187
It's perfect.

514
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,119
There's more, heda.

515
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,704
Bring it in.

516
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,151
Saved the best for last.

517
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,070
The convict you had follow
indra has gone missing.

518
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,364
Fortunately, I took
it upon myself

519
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,450
to have that convict followed.

520
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,801
Fine.

521
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,012
Then we won't eat either.

522
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,764
After the deathwave,

523
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,933
I didn't eat
for more than two weeks.

524
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,852
Deathwave?

525
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,773
A wave of radioactive fire
taller than any tree.

526
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,737
The fire jumped our valley.

527
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:36,741
The radiation didn't.

528
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,744
Everyone I knew died.

529
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,120
My parents.

530
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:48,127
I was alone for 58 days.

531
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,588
I still dream
about it sometimes...

532
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,634
but clarke helped me through it.

533
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,891
Friends can be good
at that, too.

534
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,953
I wish I knew you as a kid.

535
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,543
How about we go back upstairs,

536
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,336
finish what we started?

537
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,508
John!

538
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,849
You think they have
engine troubles?

539
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,392
- Here.
- What?

540
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,936
- Stay here.
- No. I'm coming with you.

541
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,314
He'll expect to see both of us.

542
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,733
So we got in a fight.
You went for a walk.

543
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,985
Don't worry.
I'll sell it.

544
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,404
What if you don't?

545
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,073
You'll be on the wrong
side of the door.

546
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,119
You'll be on the right side.

547
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,418
I've got this.

548
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,590
I'm coming back.

549
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,855
Oh, thank god
you're back. I...

550
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,857
Hmm. You're not emori.

551
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,067
May we come in?

552
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,652
It's a little late.

553
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,995
- He knows.
- Yeah. I figured.

554
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,670
Hmm.

555
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,465
Open it.

556
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,300
What, the reactor?

557
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,562
I like you, john,

558
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,982
but our relationship's
at a crossroads.

559
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,734
Open that door, and you and your

560
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:20,071
frikdreina girlfriend live.

561
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,864
I told you not to call her that.

562
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:25,409
Hey. Cyclops.

563
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:34,252
- Hmm.
- Yeah. That's right.

564
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,380
If anything happens to john,

565
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,173
I blow the reactor.

566
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:43,052
If you try to
come in here, guess what.

567
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,013
I blow the reactor.

568
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,598
They're bluffing, heda.

569
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,058
Are they?

570
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,060
Everyone in there knows
that they're dead

571
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,604
the second that door opens.

572
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,856
In life, that's called
having nothing to lose.

573
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,818
In chess, I believe
that's called a...

574
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,487
stalemate.

575
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,824
Game's not over yet, john.

576
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,034
King takes knight!

577
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,122
Stay here, wait them out.

578
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,541
When the door opens,
kill them all.

579
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,862
Why are they still restrained?

580
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,697
We had a deal.

581
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,450
Clarke, what is this?
What deal?

582
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,951
He releases all of us,

583
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,745
and I take him to the flame.

584
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,830
You'll forgive me
if I have trust issues

585
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,583
where you're concerned.

586
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,752
Remove the restraints
one at a time.

587
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,005
Any violence

588
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,965
will be met with lethal force.

589
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,968
No one is getting violent.
It's a good thing.

590
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,595
You're being released.

591
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:11,307
Helmet on to protect
your memory.

592
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,142
You good with this?

593
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,734
Helmet on.

594
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,402
Let's go.

595
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,863
Now you.

596
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,531
Helmet on.

597
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,367
Hands up.

598
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,494
Sending the fighters
first, is that it?

599
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,707
Can't be too careful.

600
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,209
Move it.

601
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,671
Let's go.

602
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,302
Go ahead.
Step through.

603
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,056
Next.

604
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,236
What are you doing?

605
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,863
Ensuring you keep
your part of the deal.

606
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,533
He didn't send them to sanctum.

607
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,411
Correct, and thank you
for demonstrating

608
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,913
why I didn't send you with them.

609
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,498
We know how the stone works.

610
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,126
Also correct.

611
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,669
Where are they?

612
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,255
They're safe as I
promised they would be.

613
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,924
I said nothing about
releasing them on sanctum.

614
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,970
You knew about this?

615
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,597
He doesn't know
where they are. Only I do.

616
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,435
I told you, clarke,
I don't trust you.

617
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,938
I do, however, trust the
love you have for your friends,

618
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,732
and once I have the key
and the last war begins,

619
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,734
they'll all be freed

620
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,487
at which point each
of you will be welcome

621
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,449
to fight alongside us,

622
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,369
and if you choose not to, well,

623
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,204
we'll save you anyway.

624
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,915
That is what we mean
when we say,

625
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,667
"for all mankind."

626
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,057
Your move, my liege.

627
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,568
Something's coming through.

628
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,535
Watch it, watch it.

629
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,329
Easy.

630
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,295
What the hell happened here?

631
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,339
Oh, gee.
Where to begin.

631
00:41:49,305 --> 00:42:49,301

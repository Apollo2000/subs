1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:02,752
Previously on "the 100"...

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:05,588
i saw him once,
sheidheda.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,465
I was only a girl
when he took Trikru.

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,259
He went from village to village

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,845
butchering anyone
who refused to kneel.

6
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:15,098
We cannot let this creature
command Wonkru.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,766
You and the prisoners

8
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,060
share an enemy, perhaps
even the same goal.

9
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,897
They want power.
How do we do it?

10
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,691
You make allies

11
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,651
of the murderers
and the thieves.

12
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,278
Join us.

13
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,822
A little deprogramming,
some revenge,

14
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,824
we'll split
this place 50/50.

15
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,288
Partners?

16
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,624
I'm with you...

17
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,418
and so are
my people.

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,047
Good choice.
All cogs get guns.

19
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,423
How does it work?

20
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,758
Well, you killed
my best friend,

21
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,967
so I'm not sure
i want to help you.

22
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,260
I'll do anything.

23
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,511
Our other friends,
bring them here.

24
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,889
Send in their friends.

25
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,145
I know you've only
agreed to disciple training

26
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,022
to get out of your cells.

27
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,483
That's because you're blind
to what's really going on.

28
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:10,570
I'm about to open your eyes
to the truth of our cause.

29
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,825
Where are we going?

30
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,911
I realize that taking
things on Faith

31
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,121
is not in your nature,
so I'm gonna show you

32
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,083
what happens if we
lose the last war.

33
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,669
Surface.

34
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,257
Access granted.

35
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,718
You are pretty brave,
taking us yourself.

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,929
It's not bravery, Hope.

37
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,972
You see, this elevator
will stay on the surface

38
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,767
until I signal for it
to be brought down.

39
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,729
I take it on faith that
you'd rather not die today.

40
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,734
Good.
Then masks on.

41
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,655
The particulate matter
in the air is lethal to humans.

42
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:57,283
It'll literally calcify you
from the inside.

43

44
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,379
Gabriel saved us.

45
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,839
Where is Gabriel?

46
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,550
Gabriel is no longer
your concern.

47
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,018
This is what
you're preparing to fight?

48
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,356
No. The Bardoans
lost their last war.

49
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:33,278
This is all
that is left.

50
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,576
Let me get this straight.

51
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,953
The 10-foot aliens
with superior technology

52
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,497
that built this place

53
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,458
got genocided
and turned to stone

54
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,087
by the enemy
we're gonna fight.

55
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,714
Precisely.

56
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,008
Now you know what
you're training for.

57
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:01,055
I do love me
an unwinnable war.

58
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,401
Anytime.

59
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,487
Just sit tight.
I know it's scary,

60
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,947
but we'll find
a way out of this.

61
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,240
You stay quiet, ok?

62
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,574
- No!
- Madi...

63
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,329
aren't you a spitfire?
But you need to calm yourself.

64
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,707
We're just gonna
chat... for now.

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,177
This thing on?

66
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,929
Good evening, Sanctum.

67
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,100
This is Nikki at the mic

68
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,978
with my friend Nelson
beside me.

69
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,357
Thank you for
your patience,

70
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,693
but we have
some requests.

71
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,195
We would like to
extend an invitation

72
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,240
to Russell
and Daniel Prime

73
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:47,203
and Raven Reyes
to meet us at the palace.

74
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,038
You have 20 minutes
to get here,

75
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,332
or we start
killing hostages.

76
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,501
Want to take a guess
who'll be first?

77
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,169
I'll let her
introduce herself.

78
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,095
This is Kaylee Prime.

79
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,015
Daniel, I don't
want you to do-

80
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,351
uh-uh.

81
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,812
What we talked about.

82
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,941
Fine.

83
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,039
I'm supposed to tell you

84
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,959
that I'm looking at a gun
pointed at my head,

85
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,670
but I don't want you
to do anything stupid.

86
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,922
- Damn it.
- Murphy, wait.

87
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,384
You heard what she said.
Don't be stupid.

88
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,511
She's brave. I'll give her that.

89
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,930
Be a shame
to have to kill her.

90
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,016
20 minutes.

91
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,643
Oh. Look.
Now it's 19.

92
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,937
Tick tock.

93
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,356
- We need a plan.
- All right.

94
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,149
Well, here is what
we are working with.

95
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,068
They have a lot of guns.
Wonkru won't listen to us.

96
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,861
I am 150 pounds wet,

97
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,571
and you can't fight
to save your life.

98
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,156
Guard the door.

99
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,658
I'm gone for half a day,
and now the palace

100
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,536
is surrounded with
armed cogs and convicts?

101
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,205
- Where have you been?
- We have a situation.

102
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,831
I heard the announcement.

103
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,249
I'm sure Nelson
wants us Primes

104
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,834
to tell the faithful
we're full of crap.

105
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,003
Or he wants
to kill you.

106
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:25,259
Where's everyone else?
They asked for Raven, too.

107
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:29,722
All we found were bodies
and blood at Gabriel's camp...

108
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,518
not our people.

109
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,228
There was
no trace of them.

110
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,105
We left a unit in the field
to keep searching.

111
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,065
I was afraid
to stay out too long,

112
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,566
and I'm afraid I'm right,

113
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,027
considering what
i just walked in on.

114
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,654
Gaia is with them, too,

115
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,489
but they can
take care of themselves.

116
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,491
Obviously, you can't.

117
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,159
Nate was with them.

118
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,412
We will get Nate
and Gaia back,

119
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,497
but we have 18 minutes
to save Emori.

120
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,124
How? We can't
get them Raven.

121
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,543
You're not gonna like it-

122
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,169
hell, I don't like it-

123
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,130
but we could give them
me and Russell.

124
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,756
Two out of 3 ain't bad.

125
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,509
You want to let
Sheidheda go free?

126
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,678
That's exactly what
he wants us to do.

127
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,139
- It is hardly free.
- It's still out of my control.

128
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,766
It'll at least
buy us some time, ok,

129
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,476
time for you
to gather Wonkru

130
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,978
for a frontal assault.

131
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,479
I don't care if
it's what he wants.

132
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,566
I'm going in,
one way or the other.

133
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,651
I won't let
her die, Indra.

134
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,280
Sheidheda won't just
volunteer for this.

135
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:31,200
Well, then I guess we'll
have to persuade the bastard.

136
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,678
Anders took us
outside.

137
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,056
Why the hell did you try
and send us out there?

138
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,686
It's survivable
for an hour or two.

139
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,355
I just needed time to
figure something out.

140
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,233
If he was trying
to kill us,

141
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,445
he would've found
easier ways to do it.

142
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:12,116
And now you're our trainer?
You always have so many jobs?

143
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,161
I'm only involved because
of my knowledge of-

144
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,664
from the m-cap,
and clearly,

145
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,000
this isn't
a normal situation.

146
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,627
Anders himself will
lead the training,

147
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,920
something he never does.

148
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,463
Oh, lucky us.

149
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,006
He usually lets others
dole out the punishment.

150
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,883
Oh, what, staying awake
for 72 hours,

151
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,426
sleeping in a mud pit,

152
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,845
eating grass
to stay alive?

153
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,223
Please.
Been there. Done that.

154
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,353
I probably shouldn't be
telling you this, but-

155
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,898
but they'll mess
with your minds,

156
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,067
try and amp up
your emotions.

157
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,362
It's crucial that
you keep control.

158
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,284
These are your
new training partners.

159
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,079
For the next 12 weeks,
you will eat, sleep,

160
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,414
and train with them
and with no one else.

161
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,793
Though you 4 were not
born in the cause,

162
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,670
everyone has
the ability within them

163
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,380
to serve humanity.

164
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,090
Give everything
to the group.

165
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:13,135
Trust in the process.
Trust in each other.

166
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,847
For all mankind.

167
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,641
We'll start with
some simple sparring.

168
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,060
Please choose a partner.

169
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,819
You may begin.

170
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,201
Ah!

171
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,958
I was trained
by a level 12.

172
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,086
What else you got?

173
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,338
Orlando taught you well.

174
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,800
It's not surprising.
I was his mentor.

175
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,969
Huh. It's a shame
he had to die.

176
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,263
It is, a loss
to the cause.

177
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,599
He was one
of our best,

178
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,809
but I believe
Dev had a hand

179
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,686
in your training,
as well.

180
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,859
Answer me, trainee.

181
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,819
Wasn't Dev your
surrogate father?

182
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,237
I'm not gonna talk
about him with you.

183
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,780
Well, then perhaps
you're not ready yet.

184
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,992
Are we here
to talk or fight...

185
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,286
sir?

186
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,579
Have you
made a note

187
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,414
of these responses,
mr. Levitt?

188
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,666
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm.

189
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,670
May I speak with you, sir?
They've given me an idea.

190
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,797
Of course.

191
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,134
Octavia and Zora,
slower.

192
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,556
With all due
respect, sir,

193
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,475
I've seen Octavia
kill more people

194
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,268
than I've known
in my life,

195
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,729
and Diyoza and Echo were
trained as elite warriors.

196
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,898
Which is why
we can shape them.

197
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,150
They'll be invaluable
in the last war.

198
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,235
Yes, but we may
not have much time.

199
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,029
Clarke Griffin will
arrive soon with the key,

200
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,489
and the last war
will start.

201
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,741
Maybe the fastest way in

202
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,118
is to show them what
we're really about...

203
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,995
- uh!
- Uh!

204
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,248
Our way of life.

205
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,376
I'll take it
under advisement,

206
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,253
but first, we need to
break them of their bonds,

207
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,047
or they'll keep choosing
to fight for each other

208
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,841
instead of all mankind.

209
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,510
They need to have
faith in the cause

210
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,930
above all.

211
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,349
Then we can bring them
into the community.

212
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,226
Begin the fear
simulation.

213
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,112
Hope?

214
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,822
Oh!

215
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,967
If you touch her,
i will kill you.

216
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,849
Wait. No. Don't!

217
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,239
Let me see her.

218
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,039
She's not your baby.
She's all of ours.

219
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,044
She belongs
to the cause.

220
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,713
She's mine.

221
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,300
She'll be cared for,
fed, bathed,

222
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:43,471
comforted,
and watched over...

223
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,389
no.

224
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,185
Not by two eyes,
but by thousands.

225
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,732
No. No!

226
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,950
Bring her out.

227
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,580
No!

228
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,375
What the hell was that?

229
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,545
A test,
and you failed,

230
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,423
like Octavia and
Hope before you.

231
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,092
You need to give up
on your selfish love,

232
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,303
your motherly instincts.

233
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,763
I can't just
turn it off

234
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,556
like a robot.

235
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,350
Then you'd better learn

236
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,228
because if you don't
come over to the cause,

237
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,688
you'll be sent
back to penance

238
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:40,194
one at a time to
grow old and die alone,

239
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,572
so...

240
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,243
i suggest you commit
to the training,

241
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,829
or you'll lose
your sanity

242
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,664
and your life.

243
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,217
So they took
30 people hostage?

244
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,429
You really do have an
iron grip on this place.

245
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:11,225
We don't have time for games.
Don't act so surprised.

246
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,185
You wanted chaos,
and you got it.

247
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,895
In the meantime,
my people will blow

248
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,481
the doors off the place
and come in shooting.

249
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,775
Why don't you
go play hero?

250
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,111
Oh, I'm going.
So are you.

251
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,823
Why would i, hmm?

252
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,741
As we discussed
before,

253
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,743
if these fools
finally wise up,

254
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,162
then they'll want
to tear me apart,

255
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,164
and if I survive that,

256
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,042
then you have no reason
to keep me around.

257
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,128
It's a quick death
either way.

258
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,880
How about a slow one
right now?

259
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,465
As much as
I'd relish that,

260
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,260
I'm going
to need more.

261
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,972
I'll protect you
from the faithful.

262
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,015
That's a start.

263
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,183
Oh, come on.

264
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,103
You can have back
your 10 minutes a day

265
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,439
of guarded time outside.

266
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,107
- 30 minutes...
- 20!

267
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,027
And I want someone
to play chess with,

268
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,238
someone who understands
the complexities.

269
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,783
Trust me, I'm done
playing with you.

270
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,536
Perhaps you're a more
formidable opponent.

271
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,539
I don't play games.

272
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,877
I'll find you someone.
Do we have a deal?

273
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,505
Mm... yes,
but since your plan

274
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,508
most likely
leaves us dead,

275
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,802
i have a better idea.

276
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,430
While I was pretending
to be that simpering fool,

277
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,183
i happened upon something
that might help us.

278
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,314
A tunnel
under the palace.

279
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,025
It leads right
into the Great Hall.

280
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,027
This could work.

281
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,613
Alyssa can
show you the way.

282
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,493
I feel like this
is the beginning

283
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,371
of a beautiful
friendship.

284
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,758
No morning sickness.
Sign me up.

285
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,219
No negative effects
on a woman's health

286
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,973
in any way, and we
can monitor the embryos

287
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,684
and the extracorporeal
gestational systems

288
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,727
for birth defects
and correct them

289
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,648
before they are born.

290
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,858
Please.

291
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,488
She had a heart defect?

292
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,156
Yes.

293
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,826
But it was surgically
corrected 3 weeks ago.

294
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,245
Now she's perfect

295
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,164
and about ready
to be birthed.

296
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,794
Let's give her
some privacy.

297
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,170
Agreed.

298
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,215
I know it must
seem strange,

299
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,884
but the fact that you gestated
in your mother's body

300
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:54,763
is equally as bizarre
to us.

301
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,307
You did kick the hell
out of my kidneys.

302
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,476
Exactly.

303
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,353
In our method,
none of our people

304
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,106
are laid up for extended
periods of time.

305
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,735
Do you want to know
how many embryos we have?

306
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:12,865
25, the same number of disciples
that you have murdered.

307
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,411
If you need
as many warriors as possible,

308
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,413
then why don't you just
hatch a larger army?

309
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,082
Resources.
It's a limited world.

310
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,792
And you can only
mind-control

311
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,294
so many
at a time, so-

312
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,088
and these kids,
they don't have

313
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,757
any parents
to take care of them

314
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,801
after they're...
deglopped.

315
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,554
The team
raise the children

316
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,556
until they're ready
for the creche,

317
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,516
and then
it's everyone's job.

318
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,435
So they don't form
selfish bonds.

319
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,396
Exactly.
You're learning.

320
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,402
I understand you
have learned a lot

321
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,113
about the Shepherd's
journey.

322
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:57,451
Who can tell me
about Etherea? Hmm.

323
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,328
The mountain
was very tall

324
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,455
and very scary,
but the Shepherd

325
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,290
was brave and wise.

326
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,125
Excellent.

327
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,752
Who else can
tell me something

328
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,921
about the Shepherd's
journey to enlightenment?

329
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,215
What passage do we have
in our books about it?

330
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:17,638
- Sean.
- I-i don't know.

331
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,475
Sometimes when
new things happen,

332
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,976
we get nervous.

333
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,562
We have feelings we need
to learn to control.

334
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,315
- Otherwise-
- they control us.

335
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,402
But when we feel
out of control,

336
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,279
we know what to do.

337
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,198
Perhaps we'll have
the honor of mr. Anders

338
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,991
leading us
in our exercise.

339
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:42,538
My pleasure. Ok.
Close your eyes.

340
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,882
Everyone.

341
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,053
Now...

342
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,263
take a deep breath.

343
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,392
Hold it
and let it out slowly

344
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,103
on a count of 3.

345
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:14,111
The shepherd brings us calm.
The shepherd brings us wisdom.

346
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:18,699
The Shepherd brings us
love for all mankind.

347
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,910
Now...

348
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,206
open your eyes
and breathe.

349
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,545
Excellent. Miss Haggerman,
thank you for your time.

350
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,630
Continue working hard...

351
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,175
for all mankind.

352
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:40,429
Oh, this is some
serious brainwashing.

353
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,059
These kids had it
better than I ever did.

354
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:50,189
Ok, class.
Open to page 273 of the book.

355
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,691
Who would like to read
the first passage?

356
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,656
They are watching
us all of the time.

357
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,575
You've got to try harder.

358
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,410
She's right.

359
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,329
Echo's the only one that passed
the fear simulation,

360
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,497
but you're the only one
who almost killed anders.

361
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,041
Yeah.
Wish it was real.

362
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:14,087
Stop. Get your anger
under control,

363
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,298
or do you want to go
to penance alone?

364
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,301
What do they want
with us, anyway?

365
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,970
We can already kick
the disciples' asses.

366
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,806
- Not the point.
- Single-minded devotion.

367
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,226
Screw your friends, family.

368
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,645
You've got
to bury your love

369
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,105
and your anger
and everything else

370
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,691
so deep they'll
never find it.

371
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,902
- It's not that hard.
- Yeah, for you.

372
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,238
You know, you just
like having someone

373
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,656
give you orders
again so you don't

374
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,699
have to think for yourself.

375
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,791
I think it's time
for me to go to bed.

376
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,800
Damn yourself if you want to,

377
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,969
but I believe in what
they're teaching,

378
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,554
and I will not let you
take me down with you.

379
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,533
They're like trainers
for the suits.

380
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,702
They work with
muscle contractions.

381
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:30,080
Not as cool as swords,
but still pretty effective.

382
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,625
We get to play
with those?

383
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,586
You'll be cross-trained
on all of them eventually.

384
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,630
- What is this?
- That's a flamethrower.

385
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,216
It'll make you
smoky and crispy.

386
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,844
We don't know
what we'll be fighting.

387
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,471
We have to be
prepared for everything.

388
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,268
What's in here?

389
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,520
Only level 11s
and above allowed.

390
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,896
Bioweapons?

391
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,606
Not a weapon,

392
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,400
at least not anything
that we would ever use.

393
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,069
If we're gonna
go all in,

394
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,572
you're gonna have
to trust us.

395
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:08,035
After years of study,
we've managed to isolate

396
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,578
the substance
that wiped out

397
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,496
the former inhabitants
of this planet.

398
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,707
Those crystal creatures
that we saw outside?

399
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,877
Yes. We call it Gem9,

400
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,754
and the little
that we have

401
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,006
would wipe out
everyone on Bardo.

402
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,678
Now it's time to train.

403
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,640
This exercise
is about communication

404
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,100
and teamwork.

405
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,560
It's very simple.

406
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,437
The shooter will
be firing blindly.

407
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,064
They'll have to listen
to their spotter

408
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,982
to hit the small
target behind me.

409
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,443
First person
who hits it wins.

410
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,403
Please...

411
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,156
help your partner
with the blindfolds.

412
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,076
Are these weapons lethal?

413
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,870
No.

414
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,540
Is everyone ready?

415
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,545
Begin.

416
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,422
Target's dead ahead,
shoulder height.

417
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,549
Down, to the left.

418
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,510
Shoot straight ahead.

419
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,096
A little bit down,
to the right.

420
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,889
- Uh!
- Oh!

421
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,601
- Uh!
- Huh!

422
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,859
Uh, 3-3 inches down.

423
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,569
Hit.

424
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,491
Jeez. You ok?

425
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,617
Yeah.

426
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,417
What the hell?

427
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,587
I won.

428
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,006
Technically, but you broke
the spirit of the rules.

429
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:49,553
Following rules isn't
how you win a war.

430
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:53,682
Perfect control.

431
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,810
That is how we win.

432
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,072
- Hey.
- What's up?

433
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,366
I just wanted to check in.

434
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,909
I know
it's been rough,

435
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,078
lots of new things.

436
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,290
It's not that bad.

437
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,586
I've had worse.

438
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,714
Oh, I know.

439
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:31,011
Yeah. You've seen me
at my worst.

440
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,763
And best.

441
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,725
Just keep it up.
It's almost over.

442
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,645
You wouldn't come here
just to tell me that.

443
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,231
This last part,

444
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,234
you have
to pass it, or-

445
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,987
or we're sent to penance,
left to die one by one.

446
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:55,368
Do you think we'll fail?

447
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,914
No. You've come so far.

448
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,707
You've worked hard

449
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,918
and seem to understand
our way of life,

450
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,503
but you've got
to be better

451
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,129
at keeping your
emotions under control.

452
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,966
Right now, you're
at best a level two.

453
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,885
Only a two?

454
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,139
I think I'm
better than that.

455
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,308
What level are you?

456
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,561
11.

457
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,438
Well, level 11...

458
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:30,403
do you feel anything?

459
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,489
No.

460
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,078
How about now? Heh.

461
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,456
Definitely...

462
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,711
nothing.

463
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,633
Yeah.
Me, either.

464
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,293
Nikki, incoming.

465
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,628
Saved by the bell.

466
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,091
4 minutes to spare.
Where's Raven?

467
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,051
She took a group
to the second compound site.

468
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,636
They're expected back
anytime.

469
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,014
Don't spit in my face
and tell me it's raining.

470
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,557
Hey, look. I get it.

471
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,350
If anything happened
to my girl,

472
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,810
i don't know
what I would do,

473
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,272
but I swear to you,
she is coming.

474
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,609
Since Russell and I are here,
you don't need the kids anymore.

475
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,403
- Let them go.
- Now it's 3 minutes.

476
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,322
Just enough time
to end this charade.

477
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:58,199
Now tell these people
who you really are.

478
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,702
Uh... uh.

479
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:05,957
- Where is she?
- Hmm.

480
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,294
Hope you have
lots to say.

481
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:13,048
- You're first.
- Uh!

482
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,640
I'm not Daniel Lee.

483
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,391
- Huh? What?
- What?

484
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,268
My name is John Murphy.

485
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,148
Zev was right.
We are not Primes.

486
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,650
No.

487
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,486
You saved my son
with your grace.

488
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,909
- Your turn.
- Uh!

489
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,994
Stall.
Indra's coming.

490
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,538
Ok.

491
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,749
It's true.

492
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,211
My name is Emori,

493
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,339
and this is the body
i was born with.

494
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,678
- The lees are dead.
- No. It's not true.

495
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,055
They're only saying what
our enemies want to hear.

496
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,516
Have faith. Faith!

497
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,518
- Uh!
- That's enough.

498
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,561
One minute till
I start shooting

499
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:12,065
unless raven shows up to
take the bullets for you.

500
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,817
Oh! Uh!

501
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:24,828
Russell had all you fools
convinced he was a god.

502
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,790
Where's indra?

503
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,334
If that guy really was
a god, why was it so easy for me

504
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,713
to kill him
and take his body?

505
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,339
What?
No. No. No.

506
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:40,969
I am not
Russell Lightbourne.

507
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,931
I wear his body
as my host.

508
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,058
- No.
- This cannot be true.

509
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,146
Your Primes
are gone forever.

510
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,064
No. You will die
for what you've done.

511
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,775
It's not true.
They're lying to save us all.

512
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,652
- Rrgh! Uh!
- Time's up.

513
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,904
Looks like Emori dies
instead of Raven.

514
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,866
Wait. Ok. It wasn't Raven's idea
to use your people, ok?

515
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,953
It was mine.
It was mine.

516
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:12,000
You're just saying that
to save her life.

517
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,046
Heroing's not
really my thing...

518
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,758
but hatch, he was
a better man than me.

519
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,217
He was a good man.

520
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,762
Take his name
out of your lying mouth.

521
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,848
He was a
true-blue hero.

522
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,061
He saved
all of us, Nikki,

523
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,480
so think about it.

524
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,273
If you kill
these people,

525
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,567
it's sort of like spitting
all over his good work.

526
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,695
- Aah!
- Uh!

527
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,281
Uh!

528
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,867
- Get down. Drop your gun.
- Weapons down now.

529
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,244
Drop it.

530
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:52,707
Put the gun down,
all of you.

531
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,377
Show me your hands.

532
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:01,633
Nikki, it's over.
Put the gun down.

533
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,469
Put it down.

534
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,722
Everyone,
on your knees.

535
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,558
Mmph.

536
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:17,440
You're welcome.
The plan worked perfectly.

537
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,151
So far.

538
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,369
Hey.

539
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,079
Echo, hey,
we need to go.

540
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,457
- Go where?
- I have a plan.

541
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,251
Plan for what?

542
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,419
Revenge, but
we need to go

543
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:41,798
before they discover
what I took.

544
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,926
You took
the flamethrower?

545
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,221
We need to torch
the oxygen farm.

546
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,600
What?

547
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,893
I already shut down the
fire-suppression system.

548
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,312
It'll be an inferno.

549
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,773
We'll end Bardo today.

550
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,988
Hope...

551
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,741
wait.

552
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,994
Hope!

553
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,249
What about your mother
and Octavia?

554
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,042
Level two.

555
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,044
The alarms will
create chaos.

556
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,588
We'll have time
to get to them,

557
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,214
and through the
confusion, we'll get

558
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,883
to the stone room and
get off this planet.

559
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,885
I don't think you
thought this through.

560
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,845
I thought
you wanted this.

561
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,139
They took
Bellamy from you.

562
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,474
They stole my life.

563
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,853
Yes, but this
isn't the right way.

564
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,938
Let's go get your mom
and Octavia,

565
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,315
run this plan by them.

566
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,524
Don't you understand?

567
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,776
They'll try and stop us.

568
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,570
They've bought in.

569
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,491
We have to save them
from themselves.

570
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,535
Hope!

571
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,709
Hope, let's talk about this.

572
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,210
Talk?

573
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,670
That is not the Echo
that I spent

574
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,964
5 years with
on skyring.

575
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,592
I guess they
got to you, too.

576
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,386
I'll do it myself.

577
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:14,140
You know, I thought Bellamy
meant something to you.

578
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,401
Can't let you
kill everyb-

579
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,237
Hope, stop!

580
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,782
- Uh!
- Agh!

581
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,951
Oh... oh...

582
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,077
uhh...

583
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,958
i have to save you
from yourself, all of you.

584
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,043
- Sorry.
- Agh!

585
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,587
Uh... uh...

586
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,089
huh...

587
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,309
- I killed her.
- Yes.

588
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,146
You saved everyone
else in Bbardo.

589
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:05,566
You passed the final test.

590
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,992
Hope...

591
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,119
come on. Hurry up.

592
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,871
We torch the oxygen farm,
we can end these jackals.

593
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,999
Well, are you sure?

594
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,044
- Won't this kill everyone here?
- Yeah.

595
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,047
So?

596
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,097
Oh, but wait.
What about our people?

597
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,515
- Uh!
- Uh!

598
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,149
Uh!

599
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,819
You're trying to kill
your own mother

600
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,154
to save who, exactly?

601
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:55,033
Octavia, Echo,
and Gabriel.

602
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,952
Waiting for us
in the stone room.

603
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:01,581
You done?
Can we do this?

604
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,380
Do it.

605
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,299
They deserve it for
what they did to us.

606
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,896
I'm sorry, Hope.

607
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,647
You failed.

608
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,487
I won't let you do this.

609
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,363
Huh!

610
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,574
Uh! Agh...

611
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,742
why? Uhh...

612
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,923
your fight is over.

613
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,603
You should all be proud.

614
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:10,483
Each of you has shown
commitment to the cause.

615
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,528
I'm sure you will serve well
in the last war,

616
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:16,155
but sadly, one of you

617
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:20,076
has not been able
to grow for the cause.

618
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,537
The Shepherd
is merciful.

619
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,122
We don't expect perfect

620
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,499
emotional control so soon,

621
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,836
certainly not
from level twos.

622
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,005
Echo...

623
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,512
you have been
our star student.

624
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,556
You fully integrated
into our culture,

625
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,850
so I'm giving you
the honor

626
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,935
of deciding Hope's fate.

627
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,360
We have to break
her spirit,

628
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,113
rip apart her bonds.

629
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:03,995
5 years on penance.

630
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,540
A fair sentence. Guards.

631
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:11,294
No. Oh, no. No. No.
Echo, what are you doing?

632
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,629
What are you doing?

633
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:19,010
Mom, please!
No! Please! Stop!

634
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,304
Her penance begins soon.

635
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,974
Your celebration
begins now.

636
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:29,896
For all mankind.

637
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,003
Did nelson give you
any trouble?

638
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,504
No. He's secure.

639
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,256
Good. Now position
your men outside the door

640
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,593
of this hall and
await my orders.

641
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,142
He's a liar.

642
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,852
Why are they
all telling lies

643
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,729
about you, your grace?

644
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,191
They don't have the strength
of your faith, Alyssa.

645
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,401
Thank you for
leading Indra here.

646
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,029
You served me well.

647
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,324
Anything for you,
your grace.

648
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,118
I was right. I told you.
They are not our Primes.

649
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,498
They are liars
and manipulators.

650
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,292
How dare you
say that, Zev?

651
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,921
They preyed on our faith,
and they should pay for that.

652
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:40,591
He deserves to die.

653
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,385
They're getting rowdy.

654
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,928
We should get them
out of here.

655
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:48,099
I got it handled.
You should go.

656
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,977
- Kill them.
- Murderer!

657
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:02,697
They lied to us.

658
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,991
- They'll pay for it.
- Watch it.

659
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,038
They took our faith,
took everything!

660
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,209
- Kill them.
- Take them away.

661
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,128
Leave him alone!

662
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,297
You should pay
for what you've done.

663
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,264
Do not open
these doors.

664
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,099
You might hear
disturbing things,

665
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,059
but these
are my orders.

666
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,062
Is that clear?

667
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,440
- He lied to us.
- Zev, stop.

668
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,899
- God slayer!
- Zev, no. Stop.

669
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:42,570
- What are you doing?
- Shut up, fool.

670
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,325
Ahh...

671
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,704
ahh...

672
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,206
there is an ancient saying-

673
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:59,754
what is a king
without subjects?

674
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,715
But I ask,

675
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:07,762
what are subjects
without a king?

676
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:11,515
They are but lost sheep-

677
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:15,728
confused and scared...

678
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,816
needing guidance

679
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,903
and protection

680
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:27,323
from the wolf

681
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:31,327
who delights
in their slaughter.

682
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,167
Stop.
Stop him! Attack!

683
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,544
Indra,
what are you doing?

684
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,129
Killing a demon.

685
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,506
Do you have a
problem with that?

686
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,262
Good.
Get some rest.

687
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,515
You've both had a long day.

688
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,774
We should go before
they come for us.

689
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,654
What?

690
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,656
This is what he wanted.
Open the door.

691
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,574
Only on Indra's word.

692
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:13,452
Listen. It's not
one man screaming.

693
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,037
Sheidheda's
killing them.

694
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,831
What did you just say?

695
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,250
- Help!
- Aah!

696
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,303
Uh!

697
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,264
Ahh...

698
00:40:34,305 --> 00:41:34,417

But what about Lucy?

none of who had any say

481
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,333
in whether they wanted to spend
the rest of their lives underground.

482
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,751
- Are you through?
- I don't know.

483
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,295
- Did I convince you?
- Yes.

484
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,005
That a bridge
to another world is

485
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,548
the answer to our prayers.

486
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,758
Reese: I agree with dad.

487
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,134
Shocking
coming from you.

488
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,345
Grace: Your father's
right, Cal.

489
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,348
Look at it. He saw
the end of the world

490
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,100
and that this was
our way out,

491
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,851
and now it's here.

492
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:42,021
God knows I had my doubts
along the way,

493
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,357
but if your father says
that that portal

494
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:48,528
is the way home,
then I believe him.

495
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,365
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

496
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,426
It worked.

Woman: Gifts
for the kids?

498
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,349
How is he?

499
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,853
Not bad considering
he should be dead.

500
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,772
Lungs are clear,
no fever.

501
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,608
Are you sure
he was exposed?

502
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,528
Pretty sure.

You closed the portal.

Yeah. I didn't want your
father to throw me in it.

How do we get him
to change his mind?

509
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,150
We don't. He was
always stubborn,

510
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,111
but now after being
worshipped for two years,

511
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,739
he believes he can
walk on water.

512
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,657
And you don't?

513
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,410
I believe in you.

514
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:23,331
- You just met me.
- It doesn't feel like that.

515
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,791
I've been following your work
since I was a child.

516
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,503
Ironically, it was my dad who was
the one that first told me about you.

517
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,546
I think he thought I'd be
inspired by a girl

518
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,090
who went to Harvard
when she was 10.

519
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,675
Instead, it made me feel
inadequate.

520
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,804
Something tells me
that you are not that.

521

You saved
Tristan's life.

522
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,144
I'd like to do that
for everyone.

523
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,688
- And your father?
- My father won't know

524
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,318
because he'll be too
busy with you in here.

want to.

Do I? Enlighten me.

529
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,163
Ok. The scar
on your neck.

530
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,082
My guess, it's
from a neural implant.

531
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,168
Knowing your work
with machine intelligence,

532
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,212
I'd say there's
an ai on it.

533
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,922
Somehow, it heightened
your senses,

534
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,549
allowing you to hear
the space ball,

535
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,425
doing in 10 seconds
something my dad

536
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,427
couldn't do
in 12 years.

How am I doing
so far?

More than adequate.

539
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,936
The, uh, ai is my penance.

540
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,772
Penance? For what?

00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,524
In time.

The program's name
is alie-2,

the flame.

544
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,446

- Prometheus,

545
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,491

from the gods? Cool.

546
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,827
We both know there's
no way you're satisfied

just turning it on.

548
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,372
I bet you were working
on it when you came in.

549
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:50,042
Yes. The silence
was really nice.

550
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,295
- Hmm.
- Heh.

It's not just silence.

552
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,222
I was listening
to the symbols,

cataloging them based
on the frequency of the sound,

but 7 of them have
no sound.

I thought maybe
they had been damaged,

<i>Previously on</i>
"The 100"...

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:04,522
<i>This is
how it was meant to be,</i>

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,912
you and me fighting
side by side.

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,581
<i>- Mommy, please help!</i>
- Hope.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,009
Help!

6
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:10,927
Jordan?

7
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,669
According to our
adjustment protocol,

8
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,259
nonbelievers
must be purified.

9
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:17,702
Weapons down.
We don't want to kill them, OK?

10
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:18,933
They want to
kill us.

11
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,392
Welcome back Daniel Prime
and Kaylee Prime.

12
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,165
Betraying your friends
is not the answer.

13
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,604
You've only resurrected
5 Primes.

14
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,144
We have all
the hosts we need.

15
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,812
I'm sorry it has to
be this way, Abby.

16
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,550
- Don't do this!
- No. Leave her alone!

17
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,361
- Noooo!
- No!

18
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,121
- Mom?
- Oh, sweetheart.

19
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,621
We're gonna save
our people.

20
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,286
I'm proud of you,
Murphy.

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,746
Josephine called
me John.

22
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,240
Throw her
to the wolves.

23
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,497
No. I saw her
in Clarke's mind.

24
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:49,915
We need her to get
on that ship.

25
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,339
Clarke, Abby,
what re you doing?

26
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,096
That's not
Clarke and Abby.

27
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,728
Very good.
Seems we got our Nightblood

28
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,605
despite what I'm told you did
with Kane.

29
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,942
Now you have
3 seconds to stand down.

30
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,729
Or what?
If you kill them,

31
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,942
we kill you.

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,862
You didn't think
this through.

33
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,451
1...

34
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,533
2...

35
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,286
Weapons down. Now.

36
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,047
Told you.

37
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,168
Clarke's memories
may suck,

38
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,503
but they do come
in handy.

39
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,301
Move. Move.

40
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,635
Indra, what is this?

41
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,175
Just stay calm.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,074

43
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,446
Hey!

44
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,340
How many more
of you are awake?

45
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:56,906
- None.
- Are you sure?

46
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,653
We'll sweep the ship.

47
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,651
Anyone we find dies,

48
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,366
and for each of them,
so does one of you.

49
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:04,915
Care to amend
your answer?

50
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,042
No.

51
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,873
OK. You're
their leader,

52
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,128
so here's
the situation.

53
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,419
We're setting sail
for planet beta.

54
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,708
It's a 20-year journey.

55
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,713
You can take it
with us peacefully in cryo...

56
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,326
Save Madi.
I'll take care of the rest.

57
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,091
Or you
can die today.

58
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,805
We'll give you
an hour to decide.

59
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,770
Aah!

60
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,832
No one gives
orders here but us.

61
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,125
Ugh!

62
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,765
Ugh.

63
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,136
Let them rot.

64
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,094
Come on. We have
things to discuss.

65
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,314
Lock it up.

66
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,354
Stay back.

67
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,155
Raven.

68
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,035
Finally.

69
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,976
There's a computer
upstairs in med bay.

70
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,494
Follow me.

71
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:31,961
Gaia...

72
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,499
Explain.

73
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,461
Devotion
like that is dangerous.

74
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,756
They obeyed her even though
they knew they would die.

75
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,089
Just wait. Planet beta...

76
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,449
Russell, we don't even
know if it's survivable.

77
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,305
If it isn't,
we go for gamma,

78
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,266
then delta,
then epsilon.

79
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,717
We won't even have to land
to find out if it's survivable.

80
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,555
Assuming there are no other
signal-sucking anomalies,

81
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,099
we can access
the mind drives

82
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,393
of the other teams
wirelessly from up here.

83
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,899
Come on. We were
explorers once, weren't we?

84
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,864
Russell, I love you,

85
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,120
and I will go with you
across the stars and back,

86
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,331
but you're right.

87
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,914
That child is a problem.

88
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,203
Oh, for god's sake,
she has the blood.

89
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,959
In fact, dibs on her
as my next host.

90
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,794
Simone, if we kill
their leader,

91
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,175
they will never
follow us,

92
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,006
and we need those
people to serve us

93
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,263
unless you plan
on cleaning latrines.

94
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,851
Fine. Then we kill
her sleeping army

95
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,063
because I promise you
they are already talking

96
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,232
about how to wake them.

97
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,358
We brought enough
mind-wiping fluid

98
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,610
to erase them all
in their sleep,

99
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,180
where they'll be
perfectly preserved

100
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,901
until one of us needs
a new host.

101
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,089
We'll never even have
to know them.

102
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,582
Fine, but then it's
on to beta. Agreed?

103
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,834
Josie, what say you?

104
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,796
Heh. Are you kidding?
It's brilliant.

105
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,431
A little genocide,
a long nap.

106
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,349
What the hell?
Let's be explorers.

107
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,207
How much longer
will this last?

108
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,548
It'll last longer
than these walls will.

109
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,197
OK.
We move together,

110
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,527
firing in
all directions.

111
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,804
Once we get up to the stairs,
we haul ass to the woods.

112
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,945
No way. We're not
leaving our people.

113
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,995
Here they come.
Knock them out,

114
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,329
we tie them up.

115
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,748
Take out enough,

116
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,537
eventually
they'll stop.

117
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,345
Is it over?

118
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,895
Today,
we purify Sanctum.

119
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,606
Adjusters, go forth
and find the nonbelievers.

120
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,900
Bring them here.
If they resist,

121
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,826
you may take
their lives.

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,539
Good. You're all awake.

123
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,538
Let's begin.

124
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,633
Do you or do you not
believe

125
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,293
in the divinity
of the Primes?

126
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:13,932
You don't need a potion
to find out my truth, witch.

127
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,892
Primes are not gods.
They are liars

128
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,099
and murderers.

129
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,398
Ohh!

130
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,107
You don't have
to do this.

131
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,401
We're not your enemy.

132
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,282
No. You're a disease,

133
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,193
and this is the cure.

134
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,530
Your blood or the blood
of Sanctum.

135
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,428
- Good.
- Ehh!

136
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,486
Blessed is Daniel.
Blessed is Kaylee.

137
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,493
What is the meaning
of this?

138
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,077
Blessed is Daniel.
Blessed is Kaylee.

139
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,412
Blessed are the Primes.

140
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,585
Rise...

141
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,871
And explain yourself.

142
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,335
We are purifying
Sanctum, holiness,

143
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,425
as so ordered
by Russell prime,

144
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,681
hallowed be his name.

145
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,767
Hallowed
be his name.

146
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,509
Russell is not here.

147
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,064
He abandoned you!
We did not.

148
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,568
Adjustments are
for our flock.

149
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,817
Why are the earth
people here?

150
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,486
You know what?
Never mind.

151
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,775
It's all right,

152
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,571
but we shall decide
what do with them.

153
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,542
Let's take them
to the palace.

154
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,374
Help them
to their feet.

155
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,360
- You heard her.
- Let's go.

156
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,584
Get them
on their feet.

157
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,046
We'll escort
your holinesses.

158
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,761
That won't
be necessary.

159
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,170
You've got important
work to do.

160
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,715
Not him.
The child of Gabriel stays.

161
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,769
Thank the Primes.
I missed you.

162
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,817
That was...
Interesting.

163
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,400
Another time
perhaps.

164
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,577
Unh!

165
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,507
He didn't
remember me.

166
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,466
Well, who's
the hero now?

167
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,008
- Come on.
- Where's everyone else?

168
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,268
Space. There's only
Jordan here now.

169
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,637
He's our next stop.

170
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,771
Just keep your eyes down
and move calmly.

171
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,901
These people are still whacked out
of their minds.

172
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,463
Why do they
think you're Primes?

173
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,027
- Uh, guys.
- It's the toxin.

174
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,591
We just have to
get him to the palace.

175
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,215
Gabriel's waiting.
He'll know what to do.

176
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,108
The earth people!
It's their fault

177
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,617
Russell left us!

178
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,695
Kill them!

179
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,831
Run! Run
get to the palace!

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,333
Kill them!
Kill them!

181
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,249
Gabriel,
open the door!

182
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,013
Go, go, go, go!

183
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,730
My people?

184
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,811
We got who we could.

185
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,183
Get inside.
Let's go.

186
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,083
Heh.

187
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,169
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

188
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,676
but... Are we sure?

189
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,845
I mean, it is the rest
of the human race, after all.

190
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,626
You sound
like your father.

191
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,809
Well, it's bigger
than the tank on Eligius 3,

192
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,854
but this is
where it goes.

193
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,770
- Hand me the serum.
- Just wait.

194
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,484
Are you feeling OK?
You look pale.

195
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,118
Have you had any
nosebleeds

196
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,996
or memory flashes
that aren't familiar?

197
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,084
No. What are you
talking about?

198
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,959
Oh, it's something I saw
in Clarke's mindspace.

199
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,875
Her mother had the same
neuromesh as she did.

200
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,301
I thought they destroyed
it with an emp, but...

201
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,680
They did.
I examined her before resurrection.

202
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,011
I wasn't about to
make the same mistake twice.

203
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,063
Josephine...

204
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,357
Give it to me.

205
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,743
No.

206
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,333
No.
Not Josie.

207
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,421
I can't let you
kill these people.

208
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:43,044
Believe it or not,
I am sorry for your loss.

209
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,011
Darling, listen to me.

210
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,893
I'll get the others
and track Clarke's mind drive.

211
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,272
You get the child.

212
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,105
We are gonna use
her as leverage.

213
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,862
All right.
Second hard drive's jacked in.

214
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,203
Whoa. Where'd you learn
to code like that?

215
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,617
City of light
community college.

216
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,702
Raven, focus, please.

217
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,092
I saw him once...
SheidHeda.

218
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,629
I was only a girl
when he took trikru.

219
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,922
He went from village
to village,

220
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,059
butchering anyone
who refused to kneel,

221
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,514
their families, too.

222
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,269
We cannot let this creature
command Wonkru.

223
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,443
I know, mother.

224
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,651
If we fail,
I'll take her life.

225
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,152
Then how about
we don't fail?

226
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,693
Thanks to Becca's book,

227
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,452
we're past
the a.I.'S security.

228
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,658
If I'm right and it
quarantined the minds

229
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,472
of the other Commanders,
it should be easy

230
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,042
to isolate SheidHeda and dump it
onto the second computer.

231
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,745
In there, we kill
the son of a bitch.

232
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,250
What is it?
What's wrong?

233
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,637
It looks like
there's a kill code,

234
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,798
but Becca doesn't mention that
in her notes.

235
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,511
So can you kill it
or not?

236
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,638
I can, but...

237
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,434
It'll destroy
the flame.

238
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,892
He's making us choose.

239
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,737
Guys, she's waking up.

240
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,163
Err! Ugh!

241
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,245
Release me! Ugh!

242
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,125
Gaia, what
do you want me to do?

243
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,506
Kill the son of a bitch.

244
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,505
With pleasure.

245
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,054
I will kill you, Seda!

246
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,554
I will kill you all!

247
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,438
Aah! Unh!

248
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,940
No more kneeling.

249
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,442
You will all burn!

250
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,898
- Out of the way!
- Where's the child?

251
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,360
Raven.

252
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,949
In there!
Move, move.

253
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,494
We're almost there.

254
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,657
If anyone moves,
shoot them, too.

255
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,791
The child comes
with me.

256
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,587
She stopped.
We're close.

257
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,101
Don't move!

258
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,807
That's far enough.

259
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,643
I set the inner door
to stay open

260
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,023
when I pull this,

261
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,608
so you can put
the guns down,

262
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,564
or you can float.

263
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,406
You heard her.

264
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,899
Weapons down now.

265
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,911
Mom?

266
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,250
Yes. It's me.

267
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,457
Simone,
what are you doing?

268
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,044
OK, OK.
We're doing it.

269
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,888
Clarke, I've been
pretending, too.

270
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,388
Now let's lock them up
and go save Madi.

271
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,193
Don't move. Keep your
hands where I can see them.

272
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,438
What's my
father's name?

273
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,973
Take off her gag
and bring her closer.

274
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,482
I want Clarke
to hear this.

275
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,315
I take it that means
the bitch is still alive.

276
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,741
You think she took
everything from you,

277
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,568
but you have your life,

278
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,703
you have your kingdom.

279
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,994
I can save both
of those for you.

280
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,828
What I want is
revenge!

281
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,338
She'll grieve for Madi
if you kill her.

282
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,711
It's true,
but since the child

283
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,045
is already gone,

284
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,920
what are you really
accomplishing?

285
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,552
The revenge I can offer

286
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,847
will be so much sweeter.

287
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,068
Who the hell
are you?

288
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,791
You're there now.

289
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,326
Let the blood of Sanctum
do its work.

290
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,253
Feel the red sun
on your face.

291
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,790
Know that the Primes
will protect you,

292
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,550
that Priya will
protect you

293
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,675
but only
if you believe.

294
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,843
Jordan...

295
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,176
Do you believe
in the divinity...

296
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,524
He's here!

297
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,730
That's everyone.
Mission accomplished.

298
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,355
Jordan, we're here.
You're safe.

299
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,568
Lay him down.

300
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,992
He'll be out
for hours.

301
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,535
Jordan?

302
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,494
He's in
to deep to respond.

303
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,701
- Adjustment protocol?
- Uh-huh.

304
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,871
The blood of Sanctum
is real blood?

305
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,786
Only partially.
Simone predicted

306
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,283
that the bloodletting
would deepen

307
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,421
the religious experience,

308
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,043
but the psychoactive
component

309
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,250
is pure red sun
toxin.

310
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,530
- Useful stuff.
- When used properly,

311
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,761
it can be, yeah.

312
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,555
Help!

313
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,449
Looks like
we found the adjuster.

314
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,472
I don't understand.

315
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,182
We told them
the truth.

316
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,816
Why are they
still doing this?

317
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,685
If they accept
the truth,

318
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,646
their lives mean nothing.

319
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,815
It's why I burnt
the Farm.

320
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:04,989
Help me tie him up.

321
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,908
We can use that to
save the people in the tavern.

322
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,918
Cognitive dissonance.

323
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,982
They'll believe anything
if it reinforces

324
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,497
what they want
to be true,

325
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,592
even that you're
still Daniel Lee.

326
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,472
Antitoxin again?
Why?

327
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,994
The blood of Sanctum
is far more potent

328
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,759
than what was
in Russell's bomb.

329
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,396
You take me in
as a prisoner.

330
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,797
Then once we're
inside the tavern...

331
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,209
What? No, no, no, no.
Slow down.

332
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,335
No way am I
drinking that stuff.

333
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,895
They're killing
nonbelievers.

334
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,981
My friend who you left
behind is one of them.

335
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,988
Look. I am sorry, but we stayed
to save our friends,

336
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,322
and we did that.

337
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,953
We're all here.

338
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,286
If I could help our people
in space, I would,

339
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,584
but this isn't
our fight.

340
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,596
OK.

341
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,390
Wait for me.

342
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,929
I can't let
these people die, bell.

343
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,557
Side by side.

344
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,770
Like it was
meant to be.

345
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,121
I guess it's time
to do better.

346
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,459
Kaylee prime
at your service.

347
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,217
- Emori.
- John, it's OK.

348
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,133
Someone needs to stay behind
and look after Miller and Jordan.

349
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,672
Excuse me. Sorry.

350
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,931
Kaylee was against
the adjustment protocol.

351
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,893
It's why they believed it
when you took them all away.

352
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,559
It has to be Daniel.

353
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,616
Fine, but if I die,
you're bringing me back.

354
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,443
No, I'm not.

355
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,862
At least lie to me.

356
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,295
Being a god should
be more fun than this.

357
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,188
We need
that door open, Raven.

358
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,438
Working on it.

359
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,897
I'm actually annoyed
at Eligius' competence right now.

360
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,193
It wasn't me.

361
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,486
Clarke, how...
How did you...

362
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,491
Shaw's failsafe code.

363
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,039
Where's Madi?

364
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,339
Russell...
Russell took her.

365
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,127
Oh, no. Oh, no.
No, no.

366
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,305
We'll get her back.

367
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,597
No. You don't
understand.

368
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,301
I killed his family,

369
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,184
and now he's
gonna kill mine.

370
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,349
I won't let
that happen.

371
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,992
The demon
awoke Wonkru.

372
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,934
<i>Lexa com trikru</i>
said you were strong,

373
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,597
but you're as weak
as her.

374
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,685
Your love
has made you so.

375
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,779
Gun!

376
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,198
Hold.

377
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:17,789
Madi.

378
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,373
Madi, I know
you're in there.

379
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,292
Please come back to me.

380
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,122
I lost my mother today.

381
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,881
I can't lose you, too.

382
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,801
Oh, please.

383
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,141
I'm gonna pull
the trigger...

384
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,682
In 3...

385
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,403
2...

386
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,327
Weapons down!

387
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,051
Rawww!

388
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,179
- Madi?
- She's seizing.

389
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,352
Get her
upstairs!

390
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:22,395
- Madi?
- Hurry!

391
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,242
Rawww!

392
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,204
Hold her steady.

393
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,533
Madi, Madi, I'm here.

394
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,250
Listen to my voice.
You can do this.

395
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,123
You got to fight,
Madi.

396
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,048
You have to fight!

397
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,346
Once more with feeling.

398
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,816
Got him!

399
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,199
Why isn't she
waking up?

400
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,297
Her pulse
is too weak.

401
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:31,504
No, no, no, no.

402
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,840
Wait. I know
what this is.

403
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,835
We have to take
it out.

404
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,213
Like you did with me
after the emp.

405
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,265
I need a blade.

406
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:05,998
Forceps.

407
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,734
I'll close.

408
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:39,022
I'm here.
You're OK.

409
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,693
I'm not the commander
anymore.

410
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,952
Thank you.

411
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,795
I'm sorry
about Abby.

412
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,754
Raven.

413
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,393
Where does he go?

414
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,696
Ladies
and gentlemen,

415
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,828
welcome to the main
event of the evening,

416
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:30,786
an adjustment
for the demon Gabriel himself.

417
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,501
Easy, big boy.

418
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,298
Got room for one more?

419
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,764
Right this way,
holiness.

420
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,322
As soon as someone else
knocks on that door,

421
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,716
they'll know we took
the tavern.

422
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,947
That's where we come in.

423
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,740
Gabriel and Murphy
control the inside.

424
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,068
We make sure no one else
gets inside.

425
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,159
If that happens,
it'll be 30 on 3.

426
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,499
I like our chances.

427
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,379
The forest is awake.

428
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,418
The vines Pierce
your skin.

429
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,633
The swarm is devouring you.

430
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,635
Do you feel it?

431
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,675
The Primes will save you
if you let them.

432
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,845
Zev, we have
a special guest.

433
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,988
Is something wrong,
your grace?

434
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,949
No. Let's get this
over with.

435
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,286
Dose us both.
I need adjusting, too.

436
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,578
Something went wrong
with my resurrection.

437
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,871
My memory is shot.

438
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,381
For the glory
and grace of me.

439
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,487
I'm sorry this
happened to you.

440
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,740
Your blood
or the blood of Sanctum.

441
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,479
We purify Sanctum
through fire!

442
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,729
Get the fuel!
Soak it down!

443
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,453
Together, we send
the demon

444
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:16,372
and his false prophet
to hell!

445
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,410
Leave the torch
and back away.

446
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,129
Those are your people
in there.

447
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,915
Help us save them.

448
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,174
That's what we're doing.

449
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,919
Their sacrifice will be
a blessing to us all.

450
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,471
I can't let you
do that.

451
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,897
The toxin is quick
in this host.

452
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,075
Look, I'm sorry
about this.

453
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,664
You really do seem like
a nice guy.

454
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,962
Good kisser, too.

455
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,972
I got these guys!
Go for the torches!

456
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,254
Keep them away
from the tavern!

457
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,629
Took your time.

458
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,004
My guy was tougher.

459
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,209
For the glory
and the grace

460
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,120
of the Primes!

461
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,707
Aah!

462
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,405
Echo,
check on the others.

463
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,537
You OK?

464
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,535
Everything OK in there?

465
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,328
Yeah.
Best party ever.

466
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:16,840
Show-off.

467
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,764
Counted at least
a dozen runners.

468
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,346
Watch all sides
of the tavern

469
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,642
in case they
come back.

470
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,096
Agh!

471
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,397
When did you
get that?

472
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,029
What? What is it?

473
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,198
May I?

474
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,533
Have you seen
that before?

475
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,910
The tattoo? No.

476
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,440
No, but I've been
studying it

477
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,830
for 150 years.

478
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,712
We call it
the anomaly stone.

479
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,044
You must have gotten it
on the other side.

480
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:04,016
Hey. You still think
you were gone

481
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,767
for only a few seconds?

482
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,727
It's beautiful,
but what does it mean?

483
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,936
Good question.

484
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,484
It means I have to
go back.

485
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:32,999
They're back.

486
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,265
Don't let this
delay you.

487
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,801
We're still leaving.

488
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,516
The anomaly awaits.

489
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,559
<i>♪♪ For what could have been... ♪♪</i>

490
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:55,817

You OK?

494
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,906
Look like you had
a rough night.

495
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,616
Not as rough as some.

496
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,001
Come on. They're
back from space.

497
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,253
I saw the ship.
You go.

498
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,881
I'm gonna help
clean up our mess.

499

Priya killed.

The truth?
According to who?

I'm just saying
Sanctum wasn't perfect,

but these people
had peace

00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,197
before we got here.

I heard about Abby.

00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,829
I tried to do better.

00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:36,915
I did,

523
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,456
and then I lost my mom.

We did do better.

I have to tell you

I'm very excited
about this.

533
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,537
I've been studying
those symbols

534
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,038
since we found
the stone.

535
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,829
We built the camp here
because of it.

536
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:44,570
The tattoo.

537
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,321
It's thousands
of years old.

538
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,235
We have no idea
who made it

539
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,117
or what generates the magnetic field
that holds it up,

540
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,974
but we're pretty sure it's what sucks
in all the radio signals.

541
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,910
Some of the symbols
on her back are red.

542
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,200
It's a code.

543
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,165
Very good. We're about
to find out what it's for.

544
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,371
May I see
the drawing, please?

545
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,222
Moment of truth.

546
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,814
What happens
if you're right?

547
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:33,076
I filled 100 notebooks with possible
answers to that question.

548
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,906
The last symbol
in the series

549
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,491
is called
an octonion.

550
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,335
Advanced mathematics
way above my head,

551
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,000
but I don't think it's a coincidence
you share a name.

552
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,091
Please.
It should be you.

553
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:05,981
No, no, no, no, no.

554
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,436
It can 't be right.

555
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,446
Let me see
the tattoo again.

556
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,276
Must have got
something wrong.

00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,326

00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,670
Oh, my god.

559
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,839
I knew it.

560
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,389
What the hell
is this?

561
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,764
She's here.

562

Hope?

564
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,331
I couldn't get
out of it.

565

567
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,511
Octavia,
what's happening?

568

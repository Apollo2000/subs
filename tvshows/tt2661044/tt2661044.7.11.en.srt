1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:01,553
Previously on "The 100"...

2
00:00:01,578 --> 00:00:02,505
Where's Bellamy?

3
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,299
It took him. Towards the Anomaly.

4
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:06,172
We need to get to Bellamy.

5
00:00:06,197 --> 00:00:08,116
Her brother is here.

6
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,584
I need her to talk him down.

7
00:00:09,626 --> 00:00:11,378
No one else has to die.

8
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,037
Let her go right now.

9
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:15,466
Let the conductor go,
and then we can talk.

10
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:17,994
Open the bridge and
send him back to Sanctum.

11
00:00:18,069 --> 00:00:19,821
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

12
00:00:19,863 --> 00:00:22,005
For all mankind.

13
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:25,368
Bellamy, get down!

14
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:27,011
Bellamy's dead.

15
00:00:27,036 --> 00:00:29,039
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,154
That's right.

17
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,930
It's operational.

18
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:42,558
Little glitchy, but it's working.

19
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:45,179
And I'm going to bed.

20
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:48,522
I heard about what happened.

21
00:00:48,564 --> 00:00:49,784
You're sure you're up for this?

22
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:52,860
I'm fine, Chona. Get some rest.

23
00:00:52,902 --> 00:00:55,529
Is it true no one's being punished?

24
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:56,958
Not even for killing Anders?

25
00:00:56,983 --> 00:00:58,991
I don't know think
that's been determined.

26
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,188
But it's safe to assume,
given they control the key.

27
00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:03,012
You know what I heard?

28
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:04,689
I heard the Shepherd
gave them his quarters.

29
00:01:04,713 --> 00:01:06,214
The key, Chona.

30
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:08,634
Once the last war begins,
none of this will matter.

31
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:10,930
Who cares about his damn quarters?

32
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:13,506
You're right.

33
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:15,406
The subject is ready for neural link.

34
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,243
He shows symptoms of
post traumatic stress

35
00:01:17,268 --> 00:01:19,019
from the explosion in the stone room.

36
00:01:19,044 --> 00:01:20,629
For all mankind.

37
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:22,964
For all mankind.

38

39
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:41,455
Let's begin, shall we?

40
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,865
You're in a vast desert.

41
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,725
There's an insect buzzing in your ear.

42
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,489
Bel, it's OK.

43
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:49,741
I can't let you die to save me.

44
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:51,981
Jump through.

45
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:53,178
That was fast.

46
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:54,496
I'll be OK.

47
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:55,909
The neural link is engaged.

48
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:59,297
No way. Not without you.

49
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:01,753
- For all mankind.
- Bellamy, get down!

50
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:06,675
What do you see? What's happening?

51
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,208
He's alive.

52
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:20,137
Wait.

53
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,597
Stop. Stop.

54
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,690
In the light of the
Shepherd for all mankind.

55
00:06:31,872 --> 00:06:32,999
He saved us.

56
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:35,379
No one is coming to save us.

57
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:37,946
Your friends on Bardo probably
think we're dead, which means...

58
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:40,157
Disciples died at your hand.

59
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,092
In the light of the
Shepherd for all mankind.

60
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:45,006
- He saved us.
- OK, that's enough.

61
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:46,496
Yes, he will save us.

62
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:48,206
I will fight on his behalf.

63
00:06:48,248 --> 00:06:49,749
That's enough. That's enough. Hey.

64
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,711
Hey, hey. Hey.

65
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:55,799
Stop.

66
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:59,176
I have a better idea.

67
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:01,678
We survive. Both of us.

68
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:06,140
I'm more than happy to leave
you here to die of your wounds,

69
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:08,459
but there is a way off this planet.

70
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:11,897
And to do it, it's gonna take both of us

71
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,592
working together.

72
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:38,190
Hey. Lie back.

73
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:39,733
Lie back.

74
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:41,465
Your leg's pretty messed up.

75
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:58,456
This is gonna hurt.

76
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:05,225
This next part is gonna hurt even more.

77
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,280
And I'm gonna need your help.

78
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:08,764
If you want to walk again,

79
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,073
we need to get this bone aligned.

80
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:11,130
Oh, sweet Shepherd.

81
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:13,191
He's not here. I'm all you got.

82
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:14,683
On 3, with your good foot,

83
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,492
push as hard as you
can against the wall.

84
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:18,397
There's trees in the forest, limbs.

85
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,441
You could just make a
splint, bind the leg.

86
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:22,901
Shut up. Bite down hard.

87
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,879
1, 2, 3.

88
00:08:34,986 --> 00:08:36,623
Told you that was gonna hurt.

89
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,412
I'd like to get out of
here before we find out

90
00:08:54,436 --> 00:08:56,730
what these eggs grow into.

91
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,577
Should be boiling soon.

92
00:09:14,486 --> 00:09:16,517
If you pull through,

93
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:18,415
we'll have a guy named Pike to thank.

94
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:21,025
Among other things, he taught us

95
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,588
that the oozing sap
from pine trees on Earth

96
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,550
can make antiseptics, fight infection,

97
00:09:28,758 --> 00:09:30,926
and heal wounds.

98
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,371
Let's hope the same goes
for the trees on this planet.

99
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:55,577
You're a brilliant conversationalist.

100
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:57,142
I'm stuck here with you,

101
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:58,580
and everyone I love...

102
00:09:58,622 --> 00:10:02,626
Octavia, Echo, Clarke...

103
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,086
they're all alive.

104
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:06,505
They're just out of reach.

105
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,800
Problem is,

106
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,306
to get back to the people I care about,

107
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:16,695
I have to nurse my enemy back to health.

108
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:23,063
Sometimes, Bellamy
Blake, irony can be funny.

109
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,150
This is not one of those times.

110
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:40,545
No, sir.

111
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,440
Never travels to another planet
without something to read.

112
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:45,310
_

113
00:10:45,335 --> 00:10:47,405
Even if it is pocket propaganda

114
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,548
from another false god.

115
00:11:02,168 --> 00:11:04,088
_

116
00:11:36,798 --> 00:11:39,681
They don't say "thank
you" where you're from?

117
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:42,684
By all means, thank you

118
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,119
for caring about yourself
enough to save me.

119
00:11:47,738 --> 00:11:49,540
So is this it?

120
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,877
Is this the Cave of Ascent?

121
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:55,956
How do you know about that?

122
00:11:56,976 --> 00:11:58,586
I read it.

123
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:00,427
Sure, it helped pass the hours,

124
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:04,007
but I got to say, the message...

125
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:06,708
Doesn't add up.

126
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,215
I've read these words more
times than you can imagine.

127
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,217
Enlighten me.

128
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:16,386
It's simple.

129
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:20,138
The Shepherd believes in
transcendence and peace, right?

130
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,297
But to get there, in order
to reach the next step up,

131
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:24,520
you have to fight a war.

132
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:27,396
Elucidation of that
paradox is not ours to know.

133
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:29,731
Our people have been at war

134
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:31,084
more times than you can know,

135
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:33,331
and let me tell you,
it doesn't bring peace,

136
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:35,279
just death and pain

137
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,580
and if you're lucky enough to survive,

138
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:38,782
another war.

139
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,534
I know who you are.

140
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,078
Your beliefs,

141
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:45,604
they're all about you.

142
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:47,946
Your people, your sister,

143
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:51,003
the lives you take to protect them.

144
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:54,451
Your selfish view of the
universe makes me sick.

145
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:58,015
So don't care about people.

146
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,381
That's your solution?

147
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,471
The Shepherd teaches us we're tiny

148
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:03,822
in comparison to the universe.

149
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:06,643
And when the time comes,

150
00:13:07,346 --> 00:13:08,770
he will guide me home.

151
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:11,732
OK, I got some news for
you, Conductor Doucette.

152
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:13,233
It is through no higher power

153
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:14,651
that you are alive right now.

154
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,528
It is through me. It is because of me.

155
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,496
Yeah. You. You.

156
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:20,147
It's all about you.

157
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:21,330
Ha!

158
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:24,244
You saw the words.

159
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:28,530
You didn't truly read this.

160
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:35,505
In the shadow of the
Shepherd for all mankind.

161
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:37,382
Do that later.

162
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:40,344
It's time to get that
leg of yours stronger.

163
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:55,150
It's only been a week. Any pain?

164
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:03,586
Quit showing off.

165
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:05,404
Help me pack for the climb.

166
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:14,336
You should slow down.

167
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,912
Wear yourself out
before the actual climb.

168
00:14:16,937 --> 00:14:18,965
I have people I have to get back to.

169
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,720
The Wall of Unanswered Prayers.

170
00:14:21,745 --> 00:14:23,637
The Shepherd's first hurdle.

171
00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:27,070
There's no walking around it.

172
00:14:27,095 --> 00:14:29,293
Yeah. I knew that.

173
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:31,653
Here's the plan.

174
00:14:31,678 --> 00:14:33,105
Brace your back against the shelf.

175
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:34,686
I stand on your shoulders.

176
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:36,626
I should be able to reach
that handle, and from there...

177
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,318
I should go first. I'll hoist you up.

178
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,987
My leg can bear my
weight, not the both of us.

179
00:14:41,412 --> 00:14:43,405
It's weaker than my arms.

180
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,974
My arms will get me over the
ledge, and then I'll help you up.

181
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:53,035
Fine.

182
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:09,774
Be careful.

183
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:28,789
Yeah, that's great.

184
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:30,899
Throw down the rope.

185
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:37,762
The rope!

186
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,508
Have some faith.

187
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:11,050
We should be close now.

188
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:17,518
Would have been a little easier

189
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,782
if we had some of the climbing gear

190
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:20,655
your Shepherd brought along with him.

191
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,653
It's true the Shepherd
prepared for his pilgrimage.

192
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,304
To explore the universe he had to.

193
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:30,263
But it was here on Etherea

194
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:31,844
that he found what he was seeking...

195
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:35,457
The remnants of the civilization
that had truly transcended.

196
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:37,526
And we're back to this.

197
00:16:39,887 --> 00:16:42,275
We're on a pilgrimage of our own.

198
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,444
You may be.

199
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,588
I'm headed for the exit.

200
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,941
But the Shepherd guides us both.

201
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:57,359
You sure your Shepherd
isn't laughing at us?

202
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:16,296
You know, the Shepherd persevered,

203
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:19,809
climbing skyward

204
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:23,271
from where the world below
appeared as nothingness.

205
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:25,461
Let me guess.

206
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,525
He was rolling a boulder uphill?

207
00:17:28,043 --> 00:17:30,778
No, no, wait. I know.

208
00:17:30,987 --> 00:17:33,489
He was wearing wax wings
and going for the sun.

209
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:35,825
Choose to believe whatever you want.

210
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:38,202
The Shepherd was here.

211
00:17:38,487 --> 00:17:40,305
He wrote of the hardships,

212
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:43,541
the killing cold of nights,

213
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:46,294
the snow that raged for months.

214
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:48,468
They're words on a page.

215
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:50,298
I mean, this...

216
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:53,343
We've climbed long enough
to know we can outrun this.

217
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:55,888
We can't outrun that.

218
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:02,841
So how'd your Shepherd deal with it?

219
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:03,936
Pray it all away?

220
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:06,022
He sought shelter when he needed it.

221
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:07,236
And so should we.

222
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:09,359
We're running low on rations now.

223
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:12,274
I'm sure as hell not gonna waste them

224
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,322
searching for a wind break.

225
00:18:14,364 --> 00:18:16,449
The Shepherd's patience
should be our example.

226
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:19,744
The snow will stop once
we clear the clouds.

227
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,373
The trees are getting thinner.

228
00:18:23,742 --> 00:18:25,541
It's only getting steeper.

229
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,877
You keep going up, you're going to die.

230
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:32,591
Well, at least I won't have to
hear about the Shepherd anymore.

231
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,697
I'm not afraid.

232
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:57,700
I'm not afraid.

233
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:04,403
Not afraid.

234
00:19:05,012 --> 00:19:06,703
I'm not afraid.

235
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:08,546
Not...

236
00:19:25,484 --> 00:19:27,478
I'm not afraid.

237
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:20,263
What... what is this place?

238
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:21,949
Shelter.

239
00:20:21,974 --> 00:20:24,410
A cave. This one's
bigger than the first one.

240
00:20:28,271 --> 00:20:29,791
You didn't go in?

241
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,716
No. When I found it,
I came back for you.

242
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:42,824
What's the matter,

243
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:44,548
they don't say "thank
you" where you're from?

244
00:20:44,572 --> 00:20:46,374
Let's just call it even,

245
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:48,105
leave it at that.

246
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:01,312
Uhh. I'm trying to start a fire.

247
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:04,718
How the hell did all this get here?

248
00:21:31,928 --> 00:21:33,252
Fire.

249
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:36,119
That was quick. Good Earth skills.

250
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,650
I haven't done anything yet.

251
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:12,251
The Cave of Ascent.

252
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:22,209
With his own life

253
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:25,046
he saw testament of those that ascended

254
00:22:25,325 --> 00:22:28,412
and he knew his life was not in vain.

255
00:22:33,197 --> 00:22:36,148
In the shadow of the
Shepherd for all mankind,

256
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:39,205
he saved us from the fire
that consumed the earth.

257
00:22:40,498 --> 00:22:43,101
In the light of the
Shepherd for all mankind,

258
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:47,755
he will save us from
the war to end all wars.

259
00:22:48,842 --> 00:22:51,490
His beings are with the
civilization that ascended,

260
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:54,324
just as the Shepherd foretold.

261
00:22:54,784 --> 00:22:57,411
Imprints of their energy,

262
00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:00,546
their mortal forms arisen.

263
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:08,714
In the sacred cave.

264
00:23:08,756 --> 00:23:09,950
No.

265
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:12,551
In view of proof,

266
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:15,045
yet still you doubt.

267
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:20,767
No. No.

268
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:23,589
This doesn't make sense.

269
00:23:44,964 --> 00:23:46,752
It's been days.

270
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:49,013
I know there's no food, but there's
plenty of lichen on the wall.

271
00:23:49,037 --> 00:23:50,747
You should eat.

272
00:23:53,996 --> 00:23:56,720
The Shepherd survived
3 months in this cave,

273
00:23:57,214 --> 00:23:59,133
and we can, too.

274
00:24:01,226 --> 00:24:03,478
From the ashes, we will rise.

275
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:06,951
"From the ashes, we will rise."

276
00:24:07,618 --> 00:24:09,912
Let me see that picture again.

277
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:22,580
This is your Shepherd?

278
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:25,152
Yes. I told you.

279
00:24:25,177 --> 00:24:27,877
This guy is a cult leader.

280
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:31,480
I saw a video of him preaching on Earth.

281
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:33,977
A fraud, a conman.

282
00:24:34,002 --> 00:24:36,385
He predicted the Earth's end

283
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:39,931
and brought his people
safely across the stars.

284
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:42,650
He spoke of the beings in
the cave, of their ascension.

285
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:43,809
You saw it yourself.

286
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:45,644
I don't know what happened here,

287
00:24:46,081 --> 00:24:48,022
but those things didn't ascend.

288
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:50,816
That book of yours
says that civilization

289
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:52,359
needs to have the tech know-how,

290
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:54,126
enough to work the stone,

291
00:24:54,151 --> 00:24:56,530
and those... those beings of light,

292
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:58,972
they lived in a cave.

293
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,469
They're pure.

294
00:25:02,508 --> 00:25:03,698
All we know is that

295
00:25:03,723 --> 00:25:06,700
transcendence is born
of a civilization's core,

296
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,125
its soul.

297
00:25:08,714 --> 00:25:11,960
Are they pure enough? Are they worthy?

298
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,482
If you don't trust the messenger,

299
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:15,817
then trust the truth of the message,

300
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:17,259
the beings in the cave.

301
00:25:17,403 --> 00:25:20,573
You felt it. I saw it in your eyes.

302
00:25:23,434 --> 00:25:25,017
I believe in what I can prove.

303
00:25:26,854 --> 00:25:30,417
Do you love your family, your friends?

304
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:32,330
What kind of stupid question is that?

305
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:34,399
- You know I do.
- Prove it.

306
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:38,254
At least they're worth fighting for.

307
00:25:38,435 --> 00:25:40,741
Not just words in some book.

308
00:25:41,252 --> 00:25:43,529
My people, that is what is real.

309
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:45,996
And yet there's still
something missing inside you.

310
00:25:47,308 --> 00:25:49,708
Death and despair hover around you

311
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,211
like a shroud,

312
00:25:52,591 --> 00:25:54,755
a consequence of your selfish love.

313
00:25:54,797 --> 00:25:57,003
Please tell me again how
it's better not to love.

314
00:25:57,028 --> 00:25:58,567
Love is not the problem.

315
00:25:58,782 --> 00:26:01,067
It's how you love that is.

316
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:03,597
It's not filling the hole inside you.

317
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:05,516
I love all people equally.

318
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:08,715
I even love you, a stranger.

319
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,200
That's why I came back for you.

320
00:26:10,225 --> 00:26:13,676
I'm being tested not to
preference the few over the many.

321
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,675
I have a greater purpose

322
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:19,541
for all mankind.

323
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:28,789
Ahem. Well... If those beings of light

324
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:32,293
are what's waiting for you
at the end of your rainbow,

325
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:35,194
then go in and bunk with them.

326
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:41,358
But I'm staying here on my side.

327
00:27:03,949 --> 00:27:06,549
In the shadow of the
Shepherd for all mankind,

328
00:27:06,574 --> 00:27:10,232
he saved us from the fire
that consumed the earth.

329
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:12,240
And no man...

330
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:16,581
I lost track of the days
after the first two months.

331
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:20,716
How long?

332
00:27:20,994 --> 00:27:22,732
How long have we been here?

333
00:27:23,597 --> 00:27:24,803
Doesn't matter.

334
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:27,598
We're gonna die in this cave.

335
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:29,734
Why do you seem so happy about it?

336
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,242
Your obsession with your
sister and your friends,

337
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:36,231
it's what drives the darkness
that makes you suffer.

338
00:27:36,663 --> 00:27:39,267
My love for all mankind,

339
00:27:39,663 --> 00:27:41,512
my faith in the Shepherd,

340
00:27:42,924 --> 00:27:45,067
it's made me lighter
than I've ever been.

341
00:27:45,543 --> 00:27:47,295
Why is that?

342
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,393
You believe in the Shepherd.

343
00:27:54,971 --> 00:27:57,383
What did the Shepherd believe in?

344
00:27:57,408 --> 00:27:59,546
The bond that unites us all,

345
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:01,741
that we're all connected.

346
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:05,257
I can help show you...

347
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:09,200
if you like.

348
00:28:17,504 --> 00:28:19,004
OK.

349
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,861
Sure.

350
00:28:30,232 --> 00:28:32,359
Close your eyes.

351
00:28:37,946 --> 00:28:39,169
Deep breath in.

352
00:28:41,113 --> 00:28:43,043
Feel your lungs expand.

353
00:28:46,097 --> 00:28:48,595
In the shadow of the
Shepherd for all mankind.

354
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:50,400
He saved...

355
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,935
You've read the passage.

356
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:58,230
You know the prayer.
Come on, say it with me.

357
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:03,531
In the shadow of the
Shepherd for all mankind,

358
00:29:03,556 --> 00:29:07,156
he saved us from fire
that consumed the earth.

359
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:09,454
From the light of the
Shepherd from all mankind,

360
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:12,286
he will save us from
the war to end all wars.

361
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:14,584
In the shadow of the
Shepherd for all mankind,

362
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:17,291
he saved us from the fire
that consumed the earth.

363
00:29:17,332 --> 00:29:19,458
I don't think this is gonna work.

364
00:29:35,238 --> 00:29:37,186
Bellamy.

365
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:39,682
Hello.

366
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:44,023
Come. Follow me.

367
00:29:51,111 --> 00:29:53,156
I've already seen what's in there.

368
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:57,214
Have you?

369
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:02,497
These things that you think can save you

370
00:30:03,457 --> 00:30:05,449
are just pieces of metal.

371
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:08,027
Faith is the true weapon.

372
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:10,761
You've come far, Bellamy.

373
00:30:11,127 --> 00:30:13,160
Your eyes are opening.

374
00:30:13,806 --> 00:30:16,851
But there's still so much more to see.

375
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,125
Mom.

376
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:52,454
My son.

377
00:31:08,596 --> 00:31:10,529
Go to the light, Bellamy.

378
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,038
The light is the way.

379
00:31:44,174 --> 00:31:45,857
The first time you chose to pray

380
00:31:45,882 --> 00:31:47,399
and the storm broke.

381
00:31:47,838 --> 00:31:49,506
Heh heh!

382
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:52,913
It means we're worthy, I think.

383
00:31:54,302 --> 00:31:55,707
Both of us.

384
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,014
The sun's going down.

385
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:20,540
We'll never make it
up there before dark.

386
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:23,919
We should go back.

387
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:26,004
We could go back,

388
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,311
but it took us this long
to get here from the cave.

389
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,992
Tomorrow, the next day,
nothing's gonna change that.

390
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,446
If we're on that face when
night falls, we'll freeze there.

391
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:36,097
We may.

392
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,908
But the days are getting shorter.

393
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:41,335
This is our best chance.

394
00:32:42,565 --> 00:32:44,064
Our only chance.

395
00:32:48,191 --> 00:32:49,569
Have some faith.

396
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:17,441
Getting closer.

397
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:01,956
No!

398
00:34:05,362 --> 00:34:06,697
Bellamy!

399
00:34:07,344 --> 00:34:09,066
I can't.

400
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:11,359
There's nothing...

401
00:34:18,452 --> 00:34:20,788
- Cut me loose.
- No.

402
00:34:20,915 --> 00:34:23,304
Look at me. Doucette, look at me.

403
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:24,998
I slipped the book
in your provision bag.

404
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:25,914
What?

405
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,500
The Shepherd's book.

406
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,961
I wrote the Stone codes inside.

407
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:30,795
You can activate the Stone yourself.

408
00:34:30,837 --> 00:34:32,827
Now cut me loose, or we'll both die!

409
00:34:32,852 --> 00:34:36,033
No. We're doing this together.

410
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,891
In the light of the Shepherd...

411
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:48,350
for all mankind...

412
00:34:49,647 --> 00:34:52,525
He saved us from the fire
that consumed the earth.

413
00:34:55,265 --> 00:34:58,156
And now, inspired by his strength,

414
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:02,915
I search for resilience and
for the will to find a way.

415
00:35:12,156 --> 00:35:13,866
For all mankind.

416
00:35:28,664 --> 00:35:29,938
You could have died.

417
00:35:33,045 --> 00:35:36,287
That's not the way I plan
on getting off this planet.

418
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:12,200
In the light of the Shepherd.

419
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:16,728
We're here.

420
00:37:04,824 --> 00:37:07,744
I don't... I don't understand.

421
00:37:07,785 --> 00:37:09,078
What now?

422
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,164
Now we do what we came to do.

423
00:37:12,415 --> 00:37:15,576
How can you be sure that
the bridge is down there?

424
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,723
This is the path of the Shepherd,

425
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:22,310
and in his light, we will not lose.

426
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:32,011
Doucette!

427
00:37:46,887 --> 00:37:48,889
I am afraid.

428
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,652
Talk about a leap of faith.

429
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:30,284
Welcome back, Bellamy.

430
00:38:42,146 --> 00:38:43,916
My Shepherd.

431
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:51,129
Please stand.

432
00:38:53,694 --> 00:38:55,613
And call me Bill.

433
00:38:58,606 --> 00:39:00,975
Pilgrims return from Etherea.

434
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,464
I want to know everything.

435
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:06,100
But first, your friends are here.

436
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,954
And I'm afraid they've gotten themselves

437
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,689
into some trouble.

438
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:15,589
Thank God for the Flame.

439
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:20,745
Doubt they'd serve
us saji bowls in jail.

440
00:39:21,716 --> 00:39:23,183
How could you eat right now?

441
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:24,865
He can always eat.

442
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,167
Gabriel's right.

443
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:27,944
If they didn't believe I had the flame,

444
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,762
we'd be in cells.

445
00:39:30,223 --> 00:39:31,818
Where are you going?

446
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:33,904
To wake the others.

447
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:35,426
It's time to go back to Sanctum.

448
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:37,436
Clarke, we're under house arrest.

449
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:38,930
I'm aware of that.

450
00:39:39,238 --> 00:39:41,193
I'm also aware our leverage

451
00:39:41,218 --> 00:39:43,970
disappears the moment he puts
me in front of that stone.

452
00:39:44,963 --> 00:39:46,781
So what are you gonna do?

453
00:39:47,313 --> 00:39:48,772
I'm gonna offer to do it

454
00:39:48,797 --> 00:39:51,459
as soon as the rest of you
are safely back on Sanctum.

455
00:39:51,484 --> 00:39:53,733
Clarke, they'll kill you.

456
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,219
You are not sacrificing yourself for us.

457
00:39:58,235 --> 00:40:00,070
Make way for the Shepherd.

458
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:05,772
We need to talk.

459
00:40:06,049 --> 00:40:07,601
I'm ready to help you.

460
00:40:07,626 --> 00:40:10,399
But only after my friends are...

461
00:40:26,302 --> 00:40:27,887
Bellamy?

462
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:40,664
How?

463
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:44,431
We saw you die.

464
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:49,441
It's hard to keep the Blakes down.

465
00:40:53,398 --> 00:40:55,047
Hold.

466
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:56,465
She has the key.

467
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:01,795
The key is the Flame.

468
00:41:02,287 --> 00:41:03,490
They think it's still in my head.

469
00:41:03,514 --> 00:41:05,349
Say nothing.

470
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:10,062
I hope that now you're
ready to help us, Clarke.

471
00:41:10,104 --> 00:41:12,273
Too much blood has been spilled.

472
00:41:12,315 --> 00:41:15,568
Each death is a child of
earth who won't transcend.

473
00:41:15,593 --> 00:41:17,403
I'll give you time to reunite

474
00:41:17,445 --> 00:41:19,488
while we make preparations.

475
00:41:23,778 --> 00:41:25,905
My Shepherd...

476
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:32,001
There's something you should know.

477
00:41:32,305 --> 00:41:34,082
Clarke doesn't have the key.

478
00:41:35,084 --> 00:41:37,472
The Flame was destroyed.

479
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,289
I'm sorry.

480
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:50,004

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,814
Wonkru is weak,

3
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:04,239
and their guns were stolen.

4
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:06,743
My guess... it was
the eligius prisoners.

5
00:00:06,828 --> 00:00:08,329
There was a break-in
last night.

6
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:10,123
And you think
we're responsible?

7
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,708
You and the prisoners
 share an enemy.

8
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:16,119
You make allies of the murderers
and the thieves.

9
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:17,744
Gabriel,
open the door.

10
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:19,298
I can't let you risk it.

<i>Come on.</i>

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,718
- What is it?
- Up. Come.

14
00:00:41,172 --> 00:00:42,618
Let's go.

15
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:46,562
Where are we going?

16
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,541
Look, my friends...
What happened to them?

17
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:50,470
Doubt they'd
call you a friend

18
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:52,076
- since you got them captured.
- No, no, no, no, no!

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,626
Echo! Hope!
I'm sorry!

20
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:02,290
<i>The fire
that consumed...</i>

21
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,780
Dr. Santiago.

22
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:07,315
Come. Please.

23
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:10,347
<i>...War to end all wars...</i>

24
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,253
Miraculous,
isn't it?

25
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,086
A gift from those
who have transcended,

26
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:19,717
or so we believe.

27
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:22,493
Lorenza,
we can proceed.

28
00:01:22,578 --> 00:01:24,329
Transcended?

29
00:01:24,414 --> 00:01:26,874
The Shepherd teaches us
that winning the last war

30
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,150
brings upon the final
evolution of a species.

31
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:31,369
I thought Orlando
would have taught you that.

32
00:01:34,173 --> 00:01:36,409
He hanged himself
in the cabin.

33
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:41,814
It appears we need to
rethink our penal system.

34
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,947
We lost 25 disciples
thanks to you and yours.

35
00:01:46,142 --> 00:01:48,267
I just sent the others
off to nakara,

36
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:53,935
but I thought that you
might like to say good-bye.

37
00:01:55,137 --> 00:01:56,689
I'm sure hope
and echo would, too.

38
00:01:56,774 --> 00:01:59,564
We have different
plans for them.

39
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:02,418
Please.

40
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:33,072
Is nakara your heaven?

41
00:02:33,843 --> 00:02:35,431
He left that out,
too, did he?

42
00:02:37,346 --> 00:02:39,833
No, we don't believe
in heaven, doctor.

43
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:45,025
Like I said, we believe
in transcendence.

44
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:47,986
Transcendence
through the stone?

45
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:50,587
Correct. From
the little we've

46
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:52,228
gathered about you
from octavia,

47
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:54,658
I believe that you
can help us get there.

48
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:57,251
Really? And why
would I help you?

49
00:02:57,445 --> 00:03:00,533
Because you don't
want to be executed.

50
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:04,009
I don't want my friends
to be executed either.

51
00:03:04,094 --> 00:03:05,488
Well, that's up to them.

52
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:08,075
You've been studying
the stone for 150 years.

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,537
We've been doing so
for nearly 1,000,

54
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,967
and still, its true power
remains locked away.

55
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:16,373
I would like you to
help us unlock it.

56
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:18,565
We'll share our knowledge,
you'll share yours,

57
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:20,444
and all you have
to do is say, "yes,"

58
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:23,499
and tell us everything you
know about Clarke Griffin.

59
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:27,642
Clarke? What does Clarke
have to do with any of this?

60
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:30,869
She's the key
to everything.

61
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:35,404
Join our cipher team

62
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:38,040
and you'll
understand why.

63
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:45,869
Do I get a robe?

64
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,128

Rise and shine,
errand boy.

67
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:29,548
The dark commander
needs his breakfast.

68
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:33,497
No one else is allowed
to talk to him,

69
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:35,845
and if you wait too long,
someone might.

70
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:38,570
Last thing we need is for him
to get into someone else's head.

71
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:40,370
Fine. I'm going.

72
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:42,089
Should have gone
with indra, though.

73
00:04:42,174 --> 00:04:43,883
She got to go looking
for our friends

74
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:46,636
while we're stuck here
babysitting the fanatics.

75
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,266
Indra left us in charge because
the faithful follow us both.

76
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:53,614
You're not worried
about our friends?

77
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,950
Well, our friends can
take care of themselves.

78
00:04:57,554 --> 00:04:59,258
I have to get
back to work.

79
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:04,390
Well, clearly you're not
worried about the missing guns,

80
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:07,168
or you wouldn't still be
planning this little party of yours.

81
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:10,855
It's not a party. It's a
reunification ceremony.

82
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,931
Right.

83
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:13,457
Kaylee's dream
of unifying

84
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,223
the children of Gabriel
with their families...

85
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:17,112
It's the key
to real peace,

86
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:19,296
and I'm worried that
you'll be late for it.

87
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:21,986
Me? No.

88
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,573
No way. This is
your deal, Kaylee prime.

89
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,843
And if I could,
I would be talking you out of it.

90
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,900
Look, Daniel
supported it, too.

91
00:05:29,221 --> 00:05:31,962
I need you there for
the people who favor him.

92
00:05:32,146 --> 00:05:35,134
The road out of hell is
paved with good deeds, John.

93
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:40,025
You're not
going to hell.

94
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:44,580
Fine.
I will be there

95
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:46,918
right after I bring
sheidheda his pound of flesh.

96
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:50,157
Ah! Refreshments. Thank
you for reminding me.

97
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:52,864
You like this.

98
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:57,501
Being the queen of the castle,
being worshipped.

99
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:00,344
Don't be ridiculous.

100
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:03,415
'Sides, you've
worshipped me for years.

101
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:09,617
This one's interesting.

102
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:12,560
What is it?

103
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,712
I don't know.
Something dangerous?

104
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,613
Are you sure?

105
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:23,980
It's kind of beautiful.

106
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:25,190
Who are they?

107
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:26,572
I don't know.

108
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,524
Do you always draw pictures
of people you don't know?

109
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:35,223
No. Lately, I guess.

110
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:39,142
Does that mean
I'm crazy or something?

111
00:06:39,227 --> 00:06:40,690
Well, first of all, no.

112
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:42,261
You're not crazy.

113
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:45,615
And second of all,
we don't like that term.

114
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:48,800
But you did have a panic
attack yesterday with indra.

115
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:51,352
Let's get back to what's
really bothering you.

116
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:03,923
Do you play soccer,
Madi?

117
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:08,609
No. My parents
never let me.

118
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:13,776
Too afraid I'd scrape a
knee and they'd see my blood.

119
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:18,197
And when the fleimkepas
came, they hid you?

120
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,697
So... when bellamy asked you
to take the flame,

121
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:29,724
how did that
make you feel?

122
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:32,486
I was scared...

123
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,358
But I had to do it
to save Clarke.

124
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,936
That's what bellamy
told you,

125
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,806
but that doesn't
make it right,

126
00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:45,434
even if it was true.

127
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,025
So when indra asked you
to be the commander again,

128
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:53,024
it brought all that
back up?

129
00:07:55,111 --> 00:07:56,673
Madi...

130
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,877
You have been
through a lot,

131
00:08:03,252 --> 00:08:06,294
and you are so strong,

132
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:11,258
but you gotta cut
yourself some slack. Ok?

133
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:14,135
You're not
the commander anymore.

134
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:17,043
So you don't have to take
it all on your shoulders.

135
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:20,675
Right?

136
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,061
Right.

137
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:25,142
And do you mind
if I hang onto this?

138
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:27,635
Do you mind if I go
play soccer?

139
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:30,193
You'd be crazy not to.

140
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,889
Thanks, Dr. Jackson.

141
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:36,653
Another session
tomorrow, right?

142
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,827
Right!

143
00:08:39,057 --> 00:08:41,328
Great. You're here.
Saves me a stop.

144
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,665
<i>- Hi, Madi!
- Pass it.</i>

145
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,165
- Madi looks better.
- Yeah.

146
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,128
Come here. I've got
almost all the DNA samples

147
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:50,630
from the children
of Gabriel.

148
00:08:50,914 --> 00:08:52,671
That's great, but maybe
we should talk about

149
00:08:52,756 --> 00:08:55,258
why you're doing this
instead of doing it.

150
00:08:56,342 --> 00:08:58,649
Ha! Oh, you really are in
shrink mode today, aren't you?

151
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:01,391
Your parents left you
out to die, Emori,

152
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,267
just like the children
of Gabriel.

153
00:09:03,351 --> 00:09:05,853
If I can give these
people peace,

154
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:09,562
and, yes, heal myself
at the same time,

155
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:12,527
how is that
a bad thing?

156
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:16,364
Maybe he can do a better
job talking you out of it than I did.

157
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,990
He can't!

158
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:19,484
Yeah, yeah.

159
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,103
I'll get you
the rest of the dna.

160
00:09:22,204 --> 00:09:24,247
You get me the names
of their parents.

161
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:32,033
Blessed is Daniel.

162
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:34,297
I'd be happy to take it to him,
my lord.

163
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:37,177
I would be, too,
believe me.

164
00:09:57,678 --> 00:10:00,204
Indra has a new
serving boy.

165
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:04,519
Not hungry, serving boy.
Be gone.

166
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,664
My plans exactly.

167
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,858
Must suck going from the
penthouse to the outhouse.

168
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:17,325
I'm enjoying it, though.
Comfortable bed.

169
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:20,306
Jo juice
flowing from the taps.

170
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:23,404
Indra must trust you
to send you in here with me.

171
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:27,496
Oh, trust me?
No one trusts me.

172
00:10:28,268 --> 00:10:32,128
She does, or she wouldn't
have told you who I was.

173
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:38,111
What are you
talking about, Russ?

174
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:40,651
That's why you're scared.

175
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:42,564
I can feel it.

176
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,410
You don't need to be.

177
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:46,884
Well, fear's always worked
pretty well for me, so...

178
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:49,410
Being feared
works better.

179
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:56,631
Sit, please.

180
00:10:56,715 --> 00:10:58,799
I'll teach you
how to play chess.

181
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:00,915
Be nice to have
a conversation

182
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,798
with someone in
which I don't have

183
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:06,283
to pretend to be a
hand-wringing fool.

184
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,767
Well, as much fun as that sounds,
I've got things to do.

185
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:11,547
I saved you from
being burned alive.

186
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:13,455
One game.

187
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:16,635
I'll tell you what.
If you win,

188
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:18,730
I'll give you what
you want most of all.

189
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:20,337
And what is that
exactly?

190
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:22,165
Enlighten me, please.

191
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,876
A chance to be a hero.

192
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:26,463
Yeah, you don't
know me very well.

193
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:29,092
I know you went into
that tavern to save a child

194
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:30,814
at great risk to yourself.

195
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,693
Were you scared when they
were preparing you to burn,

196
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:36,254
as scared as you are
right now?

197
00:11:36,338 --> 00:11:37,630
I'm not scared.

198
00:11:37,714 --> 00:11:40,008
Good. Then let's play.

199
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:45,657
How can you
make me a hero?

200
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:47,853
I don't care about that.

201
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:50,877
I just assume it means you know
something bad is about to happen.

202
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:52,962
Bad depends
on your perspective,

203
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,465
but from your
perspective, yes.

204
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,790
Something bad is
about to happen.

205
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:01,695
Your move.

206
00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:03,947
And if I lose?

207
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,947
Only losers think
like that, John.

208
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:11,581
But the answer is
people will die.

209
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:17,384
No rush. It's not as
if lives depend on it.

210
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,102
The queen's gambit.

211
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:34,562
Aggressive.

212
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:36,064
Shut up and move.

213
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:41,361
Please.

214
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:54,990
What's wrong?

215
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,497
Can't handle finally
being forced to tap?

216
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,995
Took you 3 years.

217
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:03,630
Come back. Murphy
wants a shot at the title.

218
00:13:03,988 --> 00:13:05,686
You can coach him
on my weaknesses.

219
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,740
I don't think
you have any.

220
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,499
No. Everybody has
their weaknesses.

221
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,724
My sister is mine.

222
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:23,560
Your sister
is your strength.

223
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:25,459
The reason why you
won't give up

224
00:13:25,544 --> 00:13:27,379
until we get
back down there.

225
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:31,568
So what's my weakness?

226
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:35,294
Ha! Yours is tricky.

227
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,868
Now, you don't
talk about yourself much,

228
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:42,005
and you're a shapeshifter.

229
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:49,252
Loyalty. Loyalty
is your weakness.

230
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:51,546
Loyalty is not
a weakness.

231
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:55,050
It is when it causes you to do
something you know you shouldn't.

232
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:58,611
Nearly killing
octavia...

233
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,725
Betraying you
at mount weather.

234
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,810
Echo. Echo, we have
all done bad things,

235
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:10,662
some of them
to each other.

236
00:14:11,872 --> 00:14:14,864
But we are a team now.

237
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:16,238
A unit.

238
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,138
That's the reason we'll
get back to the ground.

239
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:23,094
Think you could
be loyal to us?

240
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:26,247
I'd like that.

241
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,833
Bellamy,
this isn't real.

242
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:34,326
As soon as we get back to the ground,
all of this...

243
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:05,780
I miss him, too.

244
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:07,873
I don't wanna talk.

245
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,349
I know you're
in pain, echo.

246
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:14,838
I feel it.

247
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:21,622
So, what?
Are we friends now?

248
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:26,422
I'm the monster from hope's
bedtime stories, remember?

249
00:15:26,997 --> 00:15:30,812
Echo, we've all done things
we wish we could take back.

250
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:34,302
When Lincoln died,
I beat my brother.

251
00:15:34,544 --> 00:15:35,982
He let me...

252
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:39,693
Because he thought
I needed it.

253
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:45,286
I wish I could
take that moment back.

254
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:50,165
I wish I'd
hugged him instead.

255
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,460
Let go of me.
Let go of me.

256
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:56,630
No. No. No way. No.

257
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,874
It's not your fault.

258
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:04,896
I've been there.
It's not your fault.

259
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:14,985
You're my family, too.

260
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:27,001
Echo!

261
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,832
Echo the one
who taught you to fight?

262
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,865
No. My father did that.

263
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:37,212
Did he now?

264
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:40,048
Dev, a disciple prisoner
who showed up

265
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,759
6 months after you left.

266
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:45,428
I suppose I should
be grateful for that.

267
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,305
He was a good man.

268
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:48,912
Was?

269
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:53,247
Next time this door opens,
we attack from each side.

270
00:16:54,076 --> 00:16:57,440
They'll come in hot and
with numbers. Bad plan.

271
00:16:57,524 --> 00:16:59,609
Ok, then tell me how the
hell you got up the last time.

272
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:00,777
That's dishes,
young lady.

273
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:02,195
Mom, I'm serious.

274
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,655
How did you do it?

275
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,423
I ripped a man's jugular
out with my teeth,

276
00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:10,071
then scooped his eye out and
used it on the retinal scanner.

277
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:15,000
It won't work again.

278
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:18,252
I was on my way to octavia
and then back to skyring.

279
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:20,338
Why did you come here?

280
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:22,007
To save you.

281
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:23,883
I know your heart was
in the right place, but...

282
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,553
- But?
- But you're my child!

283
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,305
It's not your job to
rescue me.

284
00:17:28,389 --> 00:17:29,973
I was coming for you.

285
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:32,225
And now you're gonna
rot in here with me

286
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:34,194
until they execute us,
but hey,

287
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,979
at least we get to
die together.

288
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:39,483
You're just mad because I
turned out to be a killer like you.

289
00:17:54,475 --> 00:17:56,935
So what's your
endgame, Nikki?

290
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:59,234
Well, gee, Nelson,
I don't know.

291
00:17:59,522 --> 00:18:01,232
Does revenge count?

292
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:03,763
You lost your husband.

293
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:05,872
I'm sorry about that.

294
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:07,974
But the children
of Gabriel have a mission,

295
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:11,021
and it does not involve
getting innocent people killed.

296
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,396
Don't kid yourself,
honey.

297
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,959
There's no innocent people
at the end of the world.

298
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:18,291
I don't care what planet
you're standing on.

299
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,919
Look, you've
had it rough.

300
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:26,576
But from where I sit,
our mission is over.

301
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:28,576
You said Russell is dead

302
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:31,005
and so are Daniel
and Kaylee.

303
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:33,388
What does death
to primes mean

304
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:35,529
if there are no more
primes to make dead?

305
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:38,393
Join us.

306
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:40,888
A little deprogramming,
some revenge.

307
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:43,350
We'll split this place
50/50,

308
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:45,529
but I get the palace.

309
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,653
What do you say?

310
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:49,497
Partners?

311
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:54,404
Nelson!

312
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,568
There you are.

313
00:18:57,388 --> 00:18:59,807
Well, look at you!

314
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,646
All perky and pretty.

315
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:04,443
I guess raven knew you'd
bounce right back, huh?

316
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:07,724
Or is it palace life
that's giving you that glow?

317
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,279
We're in the palace to
maintain peace. That's all.

318
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:14,896
Oh! Well, you are
doing a bang-up job.

319
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:18,216
My offer's good till lunch.

320
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:24,856
Mind if I sit?

321
00:19:25,002 --> 00:19:26,421
Why would I mind?

322
00:19:28,576 --> 00:19:29,772
I'm not here.

323
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:31,989
- Wait...
- Don't touch me, prime!

324
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:35,615
My people are watching.

325
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,724
What the hell
do you want?

326
00:19:39,163 --> 00:19:42,208
What I want
is to help your people.

327
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:44,701
All of them.

328
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:48,005
Not just the children
of Gabriel.

329
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,661
And I know
you do, too.

330
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:54,873
You know nothing
about me.

331
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,771
Mmm.

332
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,091
I know how you feel,

333
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,505
'cause I felt it,
too.

334
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:04,605
You better
get to the point.

335
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:13,155
When I was a child
on earth,

336
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,544
people like me were seen
as a stain on the bloodline.

337
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:19,810
They called us
frikdreina,

338
00:20:19,895 --> 00:20:22,481
not nulls, but it's
the same thing.

339
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:26,187
I know what it's like to be
thrown out like garbage

340
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,091
by the people who should
love you the most.

341
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:32,925
I'm still waiting
on that point.

342
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:40,536
I would give anything for
the chance to see them again,

343
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:44,154
ask them why,
show them

344
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,896
how wrong they
were about me.

345
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,939
I don't give a damn
about any of that.

346
00:20:48,023 --> 00:20:49,372
Then why are you
still here?

347
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,334
Go back to whatever
cave you lived in.

348
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,794
I'm done
living in caves.

349
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,677
This is my home.

350
00:20:57,762 --> 00:20:59,513
Yes, it is.

351
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:02,405
The ceremony
is this afternoon.

352
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,841
I can reunite you with your family,
Nelson.

353
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,857
Let me do that.

354
00:21:13,734 --> 00:21:15,568
They can burn
for all I care.

355
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:19,450
Let's go.

356
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,013
Oh, now I remember 
why I hate chess.

357
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:31,341
Why?

358
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:33,769
Too much thinking.
Make your move.

359
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,739
Somewhere else
you need to be?

360
00:21:37,823 --> 00:21:40,449
Somebody else I need
to not disappoint.

361
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,142
Ah, yes.

362
00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:46,707
The frikdreina.

363
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:51,642
That's it?
20 minutes for that?

364
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:53,839
You could have
taken my castle.

365
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:56,425
Oh, I'll get it
soon enough.

366
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:00,579
Must be hard settling
for one woman,

367
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:04,309
when as a god you could
have as many as you want.

368
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:05,812
You don't know Emori.

369
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,727
Perhaps not,
but from what I've seen,

370
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:11,438
she's taking a liking
to being worshipped.

371
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,845
What about you?

372
00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:19,298
What about me what?

373
00:22:19,383 --> 00:22:21,907
I mean,
I assume you don't like women very much,

374
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:23,993
but then again,
how could you?

375
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:26,663
Mother gave you up
to fight in the conclave

376
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:30,431
and become commander,
then there's the whole lexa thing.

377
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:35,172
Knowing that she is everybody's
favorite when they hated you.

378
00:22:35,256 --> 00:22:36,735
Then again, she did
unite the clans.

379
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,493
I united the clans!

380
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:41,829
Please. The only people you
united were the flamekeepers

381
00:22:41,914 --> 00:22:44,845
who banded together
to kill you.

382
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,642
They killed me because
they were afraid of my ideas.

383
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:50,907
Just like they killed Lexa.

384
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,107
But don't worry.

385
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:56,776
I won't let that
happen again.

386
00:22:57,134 --> 00:22:58,704
Again.

387
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:02,324
So that is what you want,
to be back in power, big man?

388
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:05,994
Well done,
John. You just figured out what indra knew

389
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:09,540
the moment she realized
that I was alive.

390
00:23:10,894 --> 00:23:14,897
So much for
the queen's gambit.

391
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,714
Ahh...

392
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:22,886
There are leaders,
and there are followers.

393
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,180
How you respond to
the loss of your queen

394
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:27,474
will tell me
what you are.

395
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:29,768
Well, I'm gonna
tell you right now.

396
00:23:29,852 --> 00:23:32,354
The answer's "c,"
none of the above.

397
00:23:32,438 --> 00:23:34,439
A rebel, then.

398
00:23:34,523 --> 00:23:36,066
Is that what you think?

399
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:39,777
I do what I have to
to survive, yeah.

400
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:42,149
Then why are you here?

401
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:44,658
Playing chess with
a man who could kill you

402
00:23:44,742 --> 00:23:46,493
more ways than
can be counted

403
00:23:46,577 --> 00:23:50,247
in order to satisfy
an inner need to be loved

404
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:52,916
is not the move
of a survivor.

405
00:23:54,955 --> 00:23:56,915
Let's just play the game.

406
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,626
Chess is more
than a game, John.

407
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,931
It's strategy
and uncertainty

408
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:08,223
governed by choices.

409
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:16,517
Avenging your queen.

410
00:24:16,906 --> 00:24:18,096
Predictable.

411
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:20,174
Enough with
the chess metaphors!

412
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,533
If anything happens
to Emori...

413
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:24,821
Before you threaten me,
think carefully.

414
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:31,746
I like you, John.

415
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:33,773
You amuse me.

416
00:24:34,517 --> 00:24:38,876
But a real survivor would
choose to stay on my good side

417
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:42,110
in the off chance
I escape this cage

418
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:45,384
and take my rightful
place on the throne.

419
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:49,072
Are you willing
to bet against that?

420
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:53,852
If you knew
what I was planning,

421
00:24:53,936 --> 00:24:55,437
I don't think
you would be.

422
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:57,647
Tell me what it is,
and I'll decide.

423
00:24:57,731 --> 00:24:59,595
Win the game...

424
00:25:00,797 --> 00:25:02,563
And I will.

425
00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:11,400
What else did
Gabriel tell you?

426
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,543
I take it he said
I was a killer.

427
00:25:13,627 --> 00:25:16,086
I'm asking
how much do you know.

428
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:18,840
It doesn't matter.

429
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:20,843
It does to me.

430
00:25:31,391 --> 00:25:34,836
He said you were a Navy
seal and a decorated hero

431
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:39,164
who saved thousands of lives
in the battle of San Francisco

432
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:42,570
before becoming
a freedom fighter.

433
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,781
You mean terrorist?

434
00:25:47,912 --> 00:25:50,125
He said terrorist,
right?

435
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:51,929
What difference
does it make?

436
00:25:52,014 --> 00:25:53,598
All the difference.

437
00:25:55,574 --> 00:25:57,516
God, I hate that
you know that.

438
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:01,844
You weren't gonna
tell me?

439
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:04,098
Sure, eventually,
when you were old enough.

440
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:05,392
I'm 25.

441
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:10,391
To me, you're not.

442
00:26:11,188 --> 00:26:13,228
From the first time
you looked at me

443
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:14,980
with those
big brown eyes,

444
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:16,641
you only saw mommy.

445
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:20,959
But other people,
they see a killer,

446
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,280
a mass murderer,

447
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:24,990
a terrorist.

448
00:26:25,074 --> 00:26:27,159
I knew if you ever
looked at me like that,

449
00:26:27,243 --> 00:26:29,077
my heart would break
into 1,000 pieces.

450
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:30,602
I don't.

451
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:33,664
Now I know you were trying
to do the right thing.

452
00:26:33,749 --> 00:26:37,781
Doing the right thing the wrong
way isn't doing the right thing.

453
00:26:38,025 --> 00:26:39,902
I know that now.

454
00:26:40,162 --> 00:26:42,997
Innocent people died
from my right thing.

455
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,672
Civilians.

456
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:46,143
Children.

457
00:26:46,922 --> 00:26:48,773
And for what?
Nothing!

458
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,692
Earth is gone,
blown up.

459
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:52,406
Twice.

460
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,312
You can thank your
real father

461
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:56,414
for that,
by the way.

462
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:58,883
You never mentioned
my father before.

463
00:26:59,188 --> 00:27:01,026
How much do you
want to know?

464
00:27:01,297 --> 00:27:02,797
Everything.

465
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,352
He was a psychopath

466
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:07,165
and a cold-blooded killer.

467
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,449
I had sex with him
to get him on my side

468
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:11,320
in an uprising
on the mining ship.

469
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:13,323
Not my best decision,

470
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:19,023
but it led to the best thing
that ever happened to me.

471
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:22,047
And you're right.
The last thing I want

472
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:24,056
is for you to follow
in my footsteps.

473
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:26,551
Everyone I ever loved
was killed fighting in wars,

474
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,695
some that didn't need
to be fought,

475
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,164
and I'm not gonna let
that happen to you.

476
00:27:31,304 --> 00:27:33,764
So, what,
we stay here?

477
00:27:34,313 --> 00:27:35,938
Do nothing?

478
00:27:36,023 --> 00:27:39,109
I trained for 15 years
under 2 disciples.

479
00:27:39,194 --> 00:27:41,321
The last 5 of them
were with echo.

480
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,617
I did that to save you
and aunty o.

481
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:46,664
Hell of a job you did.

482
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,125
You're alive,
aren't you?

483
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,366
So is she.

484
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,201
Sure, until we're not!

485
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:52,744
If they want to kill us,
then let them tr...

486
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:54,162
Hope, don't be stupid.

487
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:55,539
What are we
gonna do?

488
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:57,374
Take on an entire army?

489
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,406
If we have to.

490
00:28:00,002 --> 00:28:02,446
With octavia, echo,
you, and me,

491
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:03,672
I like our chances.

492
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:06,758
You say you're not a
child. Stop talking like one.

493
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,967
You want to
take on an army?

494
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:13,977
Tell you what...

495
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:17,039
Put me on my ass,
and I'll let you.

496
00:28:17,186 --> 00:28:19,063
Hell, I'll even
help you.

497
00:28:20,981 --> 00:28:23,108
Go ahead.
Take your best shot.

498
00:28:23,192 --> 00:28:24,568
I don't want to hurt you.

499
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:28,734
It's ok.
I can take it.

500
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,289
- Uhh!
- Oh, come on.

501
00:28:32,374 --> 00:28:33,539
Is that all you got?

502
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:38,945
Come on, little one.

503
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:41,936
Next time that door opens,
we gotta attack, right?

504
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:44,440
- Uhh!
- Aah!

505
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,313
Are we having
fun yet?

506
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:56,586
- No!
- Stop!

507
00:28:57,101 --> 00:29:00,313
Violence and rage will
only destroy your soul.

508
00:29:00,422 --> 00:29:03,181
Revenge is a game
with no winners.

509
00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:06,344
And we've
lost too much already.

510
00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:16,787
Just disappeared.

511
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:21,727
Just like that,
you were gone.

512
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,945
Out of nowhere.

513
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:30,092
Just gone.

514
00:29:33,578 --> 00:29:38,570
All I want to do is go back to
the way things were, but we can't.

515
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,500
They took my mommy away.

516
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:47,250
They took my mommy.

517
00:29:49,165 --> 00:29:51,334
I know, little one.

518
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,214
That's why I can't
lose you again.

519
00:29:57,494 --> 00:29:58,996
I can't...

520
00:30:01,206 --> 00:30:02,508
And I won't.

521
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:09,063
Something's different.

522
00:30:09,148 --> 00:30:12,211
There's plenty of cells,
but they put us together.

523
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:15,500
They're feeding us.
We have blankets.

524
00:30:15,611 --> 00:30:17,398
Why?

525
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,973
Do you know why
azgeda warriors

526
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:22,227
scarred
their own faces?

527
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:26,273
E-Echo?

528
00:30:30,986 --> 00:30:33,602
We do it to symbolize
that the pain is over,

529
00:30:34,438 --> 00:30:37,055
the wound is healed,

530
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:38,883
so that we
never forget.

531
00:30:38,968 --> 00:30:41,446
Sit down and let
me call you a...

532
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:45,793
No. Orlando told us that all
they care about is their last war.

533
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:49,705
They want us to
fight with them.

534
00:30:49,797 --> 00:30:51,453
That's why
it's different.

535
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:53,844
We're not prisoners.

536
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:56,688
We're recruits.

537
00:30:59,168 --> 00:31:00,508
We're ready to
fight with you!

538
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:02,058
Please,
this is crazy.

539
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:05,438
...<i>Purity of mind,</i>

540
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,410
<i>We are blessed
to live in an age</i>

541
00:31:07,495 --> 00:31:10,563
<i>where we have conquered
our lesser emotions.</i>

542
00:31:12,148 --> 00:31:14,778
<i>The great battle that is
to come will be recorded</i>

543
00:31:14,863 --> 00:31:17,211
<i>in this life or the next.</i>

544
00:31:17,464 --> 00:31:24,012
<i>War, pestilence,
famine, death.</i>

545
00:31:24,312 --> 00:31:26,047
<i>Eventually, it does...</i>

546
00:31:26,132 --> 00:31:27,541
This is how
my people show

547
00:31:27,626 --> 00:31:28,836
they're ready
to go to war.

548
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,878
Mmm.
I'm glad to hear that.

549
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,813
Do the rest of you
agree with echo?

550
00:31:32,898 --> 00:31:37,094
All right. Free us,
and we'll fight your war.

551
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,993
The last war will
free us all, miss Blake.

552
00:31:41,078 --> 00:31:42,787
Training starts tomorrow.

553
00:31:43,516 --> 00:31:46,047
We'll make disciples
of you yet.

554
00:31:46,353 --> 00:31:49,008
<i>There will come
a time again, soon,</i>

555
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:51,352
<i>where we will be
tested to a man,</i>

556
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:55,945
<i>and we will be victorious
for all mankind!</i>

557
00:32:07,282 --> 00:32:09,563
It's pretty cool
what you've done here.

558
00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:13,676
Now all we need
is John.

559
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,460
Welcome. I'm glad you came.

560
00:32:21,544 --> 00:32:23,477
May I ask? Our boy...

561
00:32:23,617 --> 00:32:27,007
Not everyone is here yet,
but I am sure he will be.

562
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:30,953
Jeremiah, please show
Nelson's parents to their table.

563
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:33,673
If it's not
too much trouble,

564
00:32:33,758 --> 00:32:35,641
I think I might feel
better about this

565
00:32:35,725 --> 00:32:37,643
with Daniel prime's
blessing.

566
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:39,770
Daniel will be here
momentarily.

567
00:32:39,854 --> 00:32:41,731
You know how he is
with time.

568
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,945
<i>Welcome.</i>

569
00:32:45,817 --> 00:32:47,656
<i>Enjoy.</i>

570
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:08,215
You're less
confident now.

571
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:11,301
Perhaps that's because
you've seen how this ends.

572
00:33:11,561 --> 00:33:12,928
It's not over yet.

573
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:15,920
Most dangerous
when I'm cornered.

574
00:33:16,348 --> 00:33:18,514
That makes two of us.

575
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:30,085
Check.

576
00:33:30,192 --> 00:33:32,453
Why? You could have
won with your queen.

577
00:33:32,538 --> 00:33:34,074
That was
the checkmate move.

578
00:33:34,475 --> 00:33:36,070
You just want
to keep me here.

579
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:37,869
Kaylee's always been
too soft.

580
00:33:37,953 --> 00:33:40,921
Only Daniel's words hold
water with the true fanatics.

581
00:33:41,006 --> 00:33:43,583
Without him,
your frikdreina's ceremony

582
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:45,961
will almost
certainly fail.

583
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:48,553
Aah! Aah!

584
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,124
Aah!

585
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:53,069
If you make a sound,
I'll kill you.

586
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:55,269
Checkmate.

587
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:08,728
 This was
a bad idea.

588
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,437
And yet,
you're here.

589
00:34:10,522 --> 00:34:13,834
If I had the chance,
I'd have come, too.

590
00:34:15,702 --> 00:34:17,367
So how do we do it?

591
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:20,920
I already have.
Don't be mad.

592
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,311
I know you said no,
but I took your glass

593
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:29,342
and I matched your DNA because
I hoped you'd change your mind.

594
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:32,799
Your parents are here

595
00:34:32,952 --> 00:34:34,802
if you want to meet them.

596
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:40,140
They're nervous, too.

597
00:34:40,473 --> 00:34:41,640
Come on.

598
00:34:41,725 --> 00:34:44,436
Paula? Zahir?

599
00:34:45,811 --> 00:34:49,139
This is your son
Nelson.

600
00:34:55,788 --> 00:34:57,456
Sachin.

601
00:34:59,233 --> 00:35:00,953
That's what we called you.

602
00:35:02,886 --> 00:35:04,545
It means "pure."

603
00:35:35,085 --> 00:35:36,587
No.

604
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:40,889
We did the right thing.

605
00:35:41,368 --> 00:35:44,037
You are an abomination.

606
00:35:44,121 --> 00:35:45,709
All of you are!

607
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:49,334
Zahir, no!

608
00:35:49,418 --> 00:35:52,498
Guards! Guards!

609
00:35:52,826 --> 00:35:55,553
Guards!
Zahir, stop!

610
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,194
You can call for
help now.

611
00:36:31,401 --> 00:36:33,862
Help! Guards,
let me out of here!

612
00:36:41,147 --> 00:36:43,358
Isn't this a lovely party?

613
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:46,349
What the hell
are you doing?

614
00:36:46,433 --> 00:36:48,519
Uhh!
Shut up!

615
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,234
Partners?

616
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:54,775
I'm with you.

617
00:36:56,545 --> 00:36:57,777
And so are my people.

618
00:36:57,861 --> 00:36:59,446
Good choice.

619
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,405
All COGs get guns.

620
00:37:04,326 --> 00:37:06,703
Nelson, don't do this.

621
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:09,456
You did this,
and now

622
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,376
you get to die for
it, Kaylee prime.

623
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:16,389
Oh! Oh!

624
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,257
Oh, slow down, cowboy.

625
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:22,177
First we make demands,

626
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:24,596
and then we get
to kill people.

627
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,310
There's no need to
rush the good stuff.

628
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,363
Been entering codes
for 3 months,

629
00:37:43,448 --> 00:37:45,200
and I'm losing my mind.

630
00:37:45,491 --> 00:37:48,194
Whew. How do you
stand it?

631
00:37:48,507 --> 00:37:50,175
I know it's not
exciting,

632
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:52,272
but good science
takes time.

633
00:37:52,419 --> 00:37:54,087
This isn't science.

634
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:55,763
It's trial and error.

635
00:37:56,436 --> 00:37:58,967
How long has it been since
you found a new function?

636
00:37:59,129 --> 00:38:00,922
It was before
I joined the team,

637
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,108
before I was born,
actually,

638
00:38:03,389 --> 00:38:04,963
but it was a good one.

639
00:38:05,094 --> 00:38:07,936
The 10-digit code that allows
us to harness the power

640
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:10,600
of what you call
the "anomaly."

641
00:38:12,717 --> 00:38:15,241
Hold the work.
Someone's coming through.

642
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,241
From where?

643
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,709
Looks like nakara.

644
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:23,940
We need some
disciples in here.

645
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:25,943
Don't move!

646
00:38:26,028 --> 00:38:27,655
Clarke.

647
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:31,807
They've been waiting
for you.

648
00:38:32,008 --> 00:38:33,553
<i>The key. It's her.</i>

649
00:38:33,638 --> 00:38:34,820
Gabriel?

650
00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:36,806
- It's good to see you.
- Where are the others?

651
00:38:36,891 --> 00:38:39,226
Bellamy? Octavia? Echo?

652
00:38:39,827 --> 00:38:41,373
Octavia and echo are here.

653
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:44,294
But I'm sorry.

654
00:38:44,675 --> 00:38:46,218
Bellamy's dead.

655
00:39:09,158 --> 00:39:11,351
Sepulcher chamber.

656
00:39:13,678 --> 00:39:15,638
<i>Access granted.</i>

657
00:39:43,662 --> 00:39:46,912
From the ashes,
through the bridge

658
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,154
the Shepherd will rise.

659
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:18,811
You again?

660
00:40:19,272 --> 00:40:22,444
Anders, my Shepherd.

661
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,256
Please call me Bill.

662
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,975
Bill.

663
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,622
Uhh!

664
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:36,609
If you've woken me
this early,

665
00:40:36,694 --> 00:40:38,905
I suspect
you have news.

666
00:40:39,164 --> 00:40:41,006
Have we cracked
the code?

667
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:42,342
Has the war begun?

668
00:40:42,586 --> 00:40:44,116
No, not yet, sir.

669
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:45,896
But...

670
00:40:46,656 --> 00:40:48,975
We have the key.

<i>- It's coming!</i>

2
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:05,477
<i>The time between here
and sanctum doesn't square up.</i>

3
00:00:05,562 --> 00:00:07,481
The good news is you can
be here for years,

4
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:08,658
and no one would miss you.

5
00:00:08,743 --> 00:00:11,358
<i>Octavia, you fool!
There is no hope!</i>

6
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:13,121
<i>- On your feet. Move.

00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:14,918

 <i>You were here

<i>Did you know
they were taking Bellamy, too?</i>

11
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:22,301
What is it
about Bellamy

12
00:00:22,386 --> 00:00:23,761
that has otherwise
sensible women

<i>willing to die for him?</i>

14
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:27,579
I made a deal
to save my mother.

15
00:00:27,664 --> 00:00:29,598
<i>The plan was for me
to jump back in</i>

00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,956
It's been recharged.

00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:03,617
She's clean.
Transfer to m-cap.

00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:06,065
- Yes, sir.
- Uh! Ugh.

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,014
Uh!

33
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:54,316
<i>We are
blessed to live in an age</i>

34

36
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:01,564
How the hell do I
get out of here?

37
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:04,852
Level two.
Arboretum level.

<i>Level two, squad A.
We have a visual contact.</i>

Uh!

00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,589
Ugh.

42
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:50,767
Ohh.

Uh!

What happened?

50
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,169
- It's the faithful.
- Excuse me?

51
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,125
What the fools
who still believe

52
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,488
are calling
themselves now.

53
00:03:57,573 --> 00:04:00,127
They barricaded themselves
inside our tavern

54
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:02,408
and are demanding
to speak to Clarke.

55
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:05,063
We already spared
Russell's life.

56
00:04:05,148 --> 00:04:06,370
What do they want now?

57
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,312
 Indra, we need
to talk about Russell.

58
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:10,590
Get some sleep, Nelson.
It's late.

59
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:12,372
Russell dies,
and I don't expose

60
00:04:12,457 --> 00:04:14,157
Kaylee and Daniel.
That was our deal.

61
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:16,713
Letting Russell live
is how we keep the peace.

62
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,598
Keeping our deal
is, too.

63
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,777
Are you
threatening me?

64
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:27,515
If I was,
what could you do about it

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,245
without an army?

66
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:34,407
Wo<i>Blessed
be the primes and sanctum.</i>

67
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:36,446
<i>Glory and praise to the primes.</i>

68
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:37,708
<i>Holy are they...</i>

69
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:39,001
This should be good.

70
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:43,394
- I asked for Clarke.
- You got me.

71
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,007
What do you want?

72
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,018
On behalf of the faithful,

73
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,336
I demand the release
of Russell Prime.

74
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:53,087
We already spared
his life today.

75
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:55,090
That's as far as
we're willing to go.

76
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:58,126
As you know, he ordered
you to stand down.

77
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,216
That was
before he was shot.

78
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,527
- Yes, by one of yours.
- Not ours.

79
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:03,135
We are the keepers
of the light.

80
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,834
Russell Prime is
a being of divine love,

81
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,706
yet you keep him
in chains

82
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,193
like one of the prisoners
you pollute our home with.

83
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:18,150
All any of us wants
is peace.

84
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,872
Russell wants
that, too.

85
00:05:19,957 --> 00:05:22,153
We had peace
before you arrived,

86
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,129
and we won't rest
until we get back

87
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:25,806
everything you've
stolen from us.

88
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,721
So you defy
the will of your god?

89
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:29,690
No.
We obey.

90
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:33,510
We won't take up arms
against our enemies,

91
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:36,919
but we will sacrifice
our lives for his

92
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,654
one by one every hour
until his release.

93
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:42,688
Trey, don't be a fool.

94
00:05:42,773 --> 00:05:45,110
Will you release
Russell Prime?

95
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:52,791
I told you, that's
not going to happen.

96
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:58,614
For the glory and the grace
of the primes.

97
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:04,454
<i>Out of the way!
Move!</i>

98
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:07,214
<i>Move!</i>

99
00:06:07,773 --> 00:06:09,150
Get off!

100
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,758
One per hour.
You try to take the tavern,

101
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:24,470
and we all die
at once.

102
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,009
Rack up another one
for faith.

103
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:39,485
Faith isn't
the problem.

104
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,095
Blind faith is.

105
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,598
Let me
see those hands.

106
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,030
 That was a brave thing you did,
Nelson.

107
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:47,948
They may hate us,

108
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:50,748
but they're still
our people.

109
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:53,412
Even though you
were cast out?

110
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,431
What's the matter,
Kaylee Prime?

111
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,832
You forget we are one?

112
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,387
Easy, big buy.
If not for her,

113
00:06:59,472 --> 00:07:01,817
we'd all look like that girl
you didn't save right now.

114
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:03,421
Minor burns.
Let me clean them up

115
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,048
and get you something
for the pain.

116
00:07:07,972 --> 00:07:11,334
How does it feel to know they're
willing to die for your freedom?

117
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,066
- Awful.
-  Liar.

118
00:07:14,336 --> 00:07:15,655
You put them
up to this.

119
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:18,339
Why would I tell
my followers

120
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:20,009
to kill themselves

121
00:07:20,342 --> 00:07:22,306
when they're the only
thing preventing you

122
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:23,525
from killing me?

123
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,618
In that case,
maybe we let them.

124
00:07:30,164 --> 00:07:32,318
What? Am I the only one
who sees this

125
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:34,248
as a solution
and not a problem?

126
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,497
If the faithful are the
only reason we're keeping

127
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,259
this son of a bitch alive,
then I say we live and let die.

128
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,786
Or you could
free me.

129
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:48,023
Fine then.
Send me in.

130
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,026
I'll talk them
down... again.

131
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:53,430
 No. From now on,
we dictate terms.

132
00:07:53,693 --> 00:07:55,745
Indra,
we can't just let them

133
00:07:55,888 --> 00:07:57,488
- burn themselves alive.
- We won't.

134
00:07:57,573 --> 00:07:58,924
Russell
isn't the only prime

135
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:00,607
- in sanctum.
- I'm in.

136
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:02,015
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

137
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,170
Emori, Emori,
you can barely walk.

138
00:08:04,262 --> 00:08:05,295
I'm fine. I'm ok.

139
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,662
Sit...
please.

140
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,972
Great doctoring.
You said she was fine.

141
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,231
She will be.
Recovery from radiation exposure

142
00:08:16,316 --> 00:08:18,024
doesn't always progress
in a straight line.

143
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:19,706
 And Murphy...
how is he?

144
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:21,573
Cleared for duty.

145
00:08:25,301 --> 00:08:28,077
Fine, but the others
better come back soon

146
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:30,814
because I am getting
tired of being the hero.

147
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:43,275
<i>This is
a very important assignment.</i>

148
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:44,990
<i>We need to know
where she came from</i>

149
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:48,363
<i>and how she got there,
and we need to know it fast.</i>

150
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,281
<i>Hello, Octavia.</i>

151
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,286
I'm gonna start by asking you
a few baseline questions.

152
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,129
Who are you?

153
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:06,081
Mr. Levitt asked
you a question.

154
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:09,826
Who are you?

155
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:12,024
None of your
damn business.

156
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:17,754
Octavia, please
don't struggle.

157
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:20,224
Memory capture uses a
laser-guided neural interface.

158
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,600
If you're not careful,
it could lobotomize you.

159
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:28,246
She doesn't even
understand what that means.

160
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:31,291
- Get on with it.
- Sir, with all due respect,

161
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:32,763
we do things
a certain way.

162
00:09:32,848 --> 00:09:35,216
Well, this is routine
then, is that it,

163
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:38,284
just another standard
disciple psych evaluation?

164
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,666
We found two
seemingly human,

165
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:43,781
clearly dangerous individuals
living on our prison planet.

166
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,439
How did they get there?

167
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,665
How many more
of them are there?

168
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:49,826
What do they know
about the stones?

169
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:52,821
Ask.

170
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:02,596
What are you doing?

171
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:13,122
 There's nothing
to be afraid of

172
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:15,106
as long as you
cooperate.

173
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,285
Let's try this path.

174
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:22,109
You're in
an endless desert

175
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:24,039
with a vast
purple sky.

176
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:26,750
A hand reaches out
for your own.

177
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:28,335
Whose is it?

178
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:35,509
<i>Bellamy!</i>

179
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,796
Good.

180
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,148
The neural link
is engaged.

181
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:41,013
Go float yourself.

182
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:43,129
Show me.

183
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:45,329
Hologram mode.

184
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,235
Octavia, who
is Bellamy?

185
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,270
I'm not giving you
anything.

186
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,772
Dial up the frequency.

187
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,835
- Sir, that could damage...
- Do it.

188
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:11,789
Skaikru
wasn't the only clan

189
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:13,576
that showed dishonor
at the conclave.

190
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:15,051
If A.I.I.E.
Can find us...

191
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:16,918
Are you
out of your mind?

192
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:18,962
You didn't have
to kill anyone!

193
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:20,226
I'll kill you.

194
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:23,282
Get out of my head!

195
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:45,982
- Tough crowd.
- We don't need an army.

196
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:47,372
We need you to do
your job.

197
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,541
Yeah, but gods
love armies.

198
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:52,084
Listen. Can we at
least ask if they'll help?

199
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,944
Relax. You're not
going inside.

200
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,798
Anyone makes a move,
I'll shoot them myself.

201
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,523
I got it.

202
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:42,857
Daniel prime.

203
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,996
Uh, come in, please.

204
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:50,954
Self-immolation, Trey?
Really?

205
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:54,140
Don't you think
that's a tad excessive?

206
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,735
A kid?

207
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,113
Are you out
of your mind?

208
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:03,124
Get out of my way!

209
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:11,164
Move. Step away
from the boy!

210
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:24,177
Is this your kid?

211
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:27,784
And you want him
to die?

212
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,116
No, sir.

213
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:36,765
Of course, if it serves the glory
and the grace of the primes...

214
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,256
It doesn't.

215
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,787
Get him out of here.

216
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:49,991
The rest of the children,
come with me.

217
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,373
Now.

218
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:55,385
You should all be
ashamed of yourselves.

219
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:56,986
Come on.

220
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:01,175
Open the door.

221
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:08,678
So we meet again.

222
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:11,896
Bet you're wondering
why I never called.

223
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,882
Zev, what
are you doing?

224
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:18,067
Name the 4 pillars
of sanctum.

225
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,429
How dare you try
to test me?

226
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,091
He doesn't know.

227
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:25,027
Of course I do.

228
00:14:26,644 --> 00:14:28,145
Repent.

229
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:31,794
Renew.

230
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,709
Restore.

231
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:37,500
Rebirth.

232
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:39,923
Thank you, Trey.

233
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:42,825
Now open the door... oof!

234
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:53,532
Pillar 3
is rejoice, not restore,

235
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:57,488
and we will
when we watch you burn.

236
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:01,446
I'll survive.

237
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:06,862
 Tell me
about this John Murphy.

238
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,731
Is he family,

239
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:10,950
friend, lover?

240
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,134
We've been at this
for 11 days.

241
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,405
Please just
let me in.

242
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,121
If I don't give
Anders something soon,

243
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:24,768
they'll replace me with
someone that will burn

244
00:15:24,852 --> 00:15:26,466
their way right
through your head.

245
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,341
I'm trying not
to do that, ok?

246
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:29,921
I hope by now
you can trust me.

247
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:31,759
Hope,
get back here.

248
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:33,890
Come and get me!

249
00:15:37,373 --> 00:15:38,958
I did it.

250
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:40,218
That's penance.

251
00:15:40,393 --> 00:15:41,940
I love you.

252
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,934
Octavia, stop.
Just relax.

253
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:50,539
There was a child
with you.

254
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:54,978
Who is she?

255
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:57,443
Octavia, if she's
still on penance...

256
00:15:57,528 --> 00:15:59,888
Skyring, you idiot.

257
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,430
We call it skyring.

258
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:04,384
I like that.

259
00:16:04,894 --> 00:16:06,427
You do know that
in the time

260
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:08,175
you've been here,

261
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:12,187
years have passed
for her.

262
00:16:15,596 --> 00:16:18,607
You have to
let me go, please.

263
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:21,284
I need to get
back to her.

264
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,210
I'm begging you.

265
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:26,932
I have my orders.

266
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:30,151
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,374
I'll cooperate.

268
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,569
Leave her out
of your report

269
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:43,053
and let me go
back to her,

270
00:16:43,138 --> 00:16:45,365
I'll show you
everything.

271
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,165
Please.

272
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,073
Deal.

273
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,143
Thank you.

274
00:17:03,728 --> 00:17:05,348
Let's start again.

275
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:09,327
Ok, but you're not
gonna like what you see.

276
00:17:16,729 --> 00:17:18,981
Blodreina
gave that honor to me.

277
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:20,419
You're dead to me!

278
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:23,753
You caused the world
to be destroyed!

279
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:24,981
Redemption!

280
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,139
They won't stop
till they're out cold.

281
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:32,902
 Copy that.
Go for the knockout.

282
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:40,272
It's ok.

283
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:46,700
Yes!

284
00:17:48,974 --> 00:17:52,857
Sorry. It's just...
You're amazing.

285
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:56,574
I'm a killer,
nothing more.

286
00:17:56,893 --> 00:17:58,404
That's not true.

287
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:00,850
What the hell
do you know?

288
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:07,191
I've just spent
3 days in your head.

289
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:09,384
Maybe you lost
your way somewhere,

290
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:10,893
but you've
sacrificed so much

291
00:18:10,978 --> 00:18:12,297
for the people
you love,

292
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,634
even as a child forced
to hide under the floor.

293
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,345
You were terrified, but
you never made a sound

294
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,307
because you knew
that if they found you,

295
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:21,809
they'd punish Bellamy
and kill your mother.

296
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:28,292
You're not a killer,
Octavia.

297
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:30,301
You're a warrior
to be sure,

298
00:18:30,665 --> 00:18:32,962
but your heart
is pure.

299
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,530
Wait till you meet
Blodreina.

300
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:37,859
First, let's get
back to Clarke

301
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:39,486
and her journey
that day.

302
00:18:42,426 --> 00:18:44,032
Did she survive
the city of light?

303
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:46,089
Why are you so interested
in Clarke?

304
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:49,608
Our time's not
up yet.

305
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,800
Anders can wait,
and if not,

306
00:18:51,885 --> 00:18:53,235
he can go
float himself.

307
00:18:53,848 --> 00:18:55,874
Get her out
of that chair now!

308
00:18:58,289 --> 00:18:59,596
Diyoza?

309
00:18:59,965 --> 00:19:01,365
What are you doing
to her?

310
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,433
Diyoza, no.
We need him.

311
00:19:03,754 --> 00:19:06,047
He's gonna help us
save hope.

312
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:13,075
We need him.

313
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:21,779
Aunty O...

314
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:26,828
It's me.

315
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:33,532
Hope.

316
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,448
Hope.

317
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,090
 You
shouldn't be here.

318
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,946
Where is my mother?

319
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:45,599
Take us to her.

320
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:48,790
Hey. No, no, no.
Not you.

321
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,146
You can hardly stand.

322
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,814
I'm gonna send you home,
and then

323
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,887
I'm gonna go
get mom.

324
00:19:57,624 --> 00:19:59,389
The stone room's
on the way to the cell block.

325
00:19:59,473 --> 00:20:01,450
If anyone asks,
we're escorting the prisoner

326
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:02,685
back to her cell.

327
00:20:02,778 --> 00:20:04,370
You say one word
other than that,

328
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:07,632
and I will cut your throat,
do you understand?

329
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,835
Heh.

330
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:21,510
You triggered
a biohazard alert

331
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,929
to keep people away.

332
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,072
- Clever.
- Wasn't my idea.

333
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,655
Safe to assume
the retrieval team

334
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,092
sent for whoever helped you
isn't coming back?

335
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,409
- No.
- Then you know you have

336
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,577
30 minutes until
we send another.

337
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:37,434
Yep. Dev knew
everything.

338
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:43,053
Show me the star map.

339
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:44,450
- No.
- You're shivering.

340
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,049
I said,
show me the star map.

341
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:49,205
I believe
this is yours.

342
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:50,957
Something's wrong.

343
00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:53,483
Dev said all I had to do
is think it.

344
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:58,345
- Sanctum, I presume.
- Yes.

345
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,990
Unlike Dev, I actually
do know everything.

346
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,880
I hope you weren't
in trouble when you left.

347
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:05,893
Thanks to time dilation,
despite the years

348
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:07,267
you spent on skyring
and the length

349
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:08,600
of your stay here,

350
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,839
you'll be returning
at almost the same time.

351
00:21:11,872 --> 00:21:14,432
Soon as I touch this, the bridge will open,
and people will know.

352
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:16,491
- Give her your helmet.
- What? Why?

353
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,333
So she doesn't lose
her memory.

354
00:21:19,636 --> 00:21:20,904
It's a side effect
of jumping

355
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,385
to a slower
time-dilated planet.

356
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,107
She'll forget everything
from the moment she left

357
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:26,443
to the moment she returns.

358
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:27,980
She'll forget you.

359
00:21:28,065 --> 00:21:30,024
No. I need the helmet
to ghost.

360
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:33,307
Without it,
I can't get mom.

361
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:36,084
Even with the helmet,
you could still get caught,

362
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,153
and I won't be
able to help you.

363
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:41,005
Wait. I have an idea.

364
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:44,469
This was here
before we were.

365
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,198
The native bardoans
used it to pull people back

366
00:21:46,282 --> 00:21:47,989
who got stuck
in the bridge.

367
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,231
Let's hope it
still works.

368
00:21:55,228 --> 00:21:56,731
Look here
and try not to blink.

369
00:21:56,912 --> 00:22:00,105
The eyes are the windows
to the soul.

370
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,261
Every mind has
a unique code.

371
00:22:02,346 --> 00:22:05,785
With it, the stone
can find you.

372
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:07,688
That's you.

373
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,901
You can enter this code
into the stone there.

374
00:22:13,986 --> 00:22:15,750
It'll pull her across
the bridge remotely.

375
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,085
You won't remember
each other,

376
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,674
but at least
you'll be alive.

377
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,009
Turn around.

378
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:22,098
We need to tattoo her code
onto your back.

379
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:24,501
If you're right,
she won't remember what it means.

380
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,809
One problem at a time, ok?
We have to do this now.

381
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,475
Easy, easy.

382
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,735
What if she
doesn't see it?

383
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:40,525
It's the only place
big enough.

384
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,689
Believe it or not,
it used to fit on a bardoan's arm.

385
00:22:42,797 --> 00:22:44,454
The success rate's
a little dodgy, though.

386
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,905
8 out of 10 times,
it's safe.

387
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,884
The other two times,
uh-uh, not so much.

388
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:50,702
That's why we stopped
using it.

389
00:22:50,928 --> 00:22:52,471
There. Done.

390
00:22:53,978 --> 00:22:55,521
Hey. I got you.

391
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:02,641
- Thank you.
- Of course.

392
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:06,408
For your own good.

393
00:23:06,493 --> 00:23:09,338
It can't look like
you helped us.

394
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:12,141
Uh!

395
00:23:16,998 --> 00:23:18,855
May we meet again.

396
00:23:19,276 --> 00:23:20,628
May we meet again.

397
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,486
I've got you.
Come on.

398
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:28,531
Levitt, open
the bridge.

399
00:23:28,702 --> 00:23:30,162
 On it.

400
00:23:36,535 --> 00:23:39,008
Hope... I'm so sorry

401
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:41,475
I never came back
for you,

402
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,171
but you're strong.

403
00:23:43,398 --> 00:23:44,740
I can see it.

404
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,729
Your mother
will be so proud.

405
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,551
I love you,
little one.

406
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:55,935
Don't you ever
forget it.

407
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:01,528
Octavia,
you need to go.

408
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:13,785
You'll never make it.
You need to go, too.

409
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,953
- I have to try.
- Hope, you don't understand.

410
00:24:16,116 --> 00:24:18,109
They'll have helmets, too,
that means that...

411
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:33,690
In the light
of the Shepherd.

412
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:36,682
For all mankind.

413
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,409
He will save us
from the war to end all wars.

414
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,844
WoHere comes
the retrieval team.

415
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:46,976
Took them
long enough.

416
00:24:52,441 --> 00:24:53,488
Uh!

417
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:00,504
Echo, what the hell
are you doing?

418
00:25:00,646 --> 00:25:02,092
It wasn't me.

419
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:10,149
Without Orlando,
we don't need to take unnecessary risks.

420
00:25:10,252 --> 00:25:13,845
Leaving Orlando was
the unnecessary risk.

421
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,427
Echo, enough.

422
00:25:15,512 --> 00:25:17,458
Hope,
take the conductor.

423
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:19,461
Focus. We're
on the clock.

424
00:25:19,546 --> 00:25:22,215
Clock? We drilled
for 5 years.

425
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,573
We have 30 minutes
to get to the cell block,

426
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:28,161
get our people,
and get back here before shift change.

427
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:29,943
With Orlando opening
the doors,

428
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,791
the best we ever did
was 28 minutes.

429
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:33,656
Then I guess we'd
better hurry.

430
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,867
Look. We all know this can't
be done without an inside man.

431
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:39,252
We have
an inside man.

432
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:40,885
What if he's not
in m-cap?

433
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,123
What if who's
not in m-cap?

434
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,444
The man who helped
before... Levitt.

435
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:47,956
<i>M-cap's
on this level.</i>

436
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:49,920
<i>We won't lose
much time.</i>

437
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:52,876
<i>The Shepherd
brings us wisdom.</i>

438
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:58,209
<i>The Shepherd brings us love
for all mankind.</i>

439
00:25:58,294 --> 00:25:59,724
<i>For all mankind!</i>

440
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,395
28 minutes let.

441
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,835
We can all see
that, Gabriel.

442
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:04,207
Plenty of time.

443
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:05,970
This is m-cap.

444
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,123
Wo<i>You 3, fall in.
We're late.</i>

445
00:26:10,332 --> 00:26:12,319
<i>Your ancestors
chose another path,</i>

446
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,696
<i>a difficult one.</i>

447
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,364
<i>There will come
a time again soon</i>

448
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:17,241
<i>where we will be tested
to a man,</i>

449
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,868
<i>and we will be victorious.</i>

450
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,244
<i>For all mankind!</i>

451
00:26:20,336 --> 00:26:21,879
<i>For all mankind!</i>

452
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:26,644
<i>And now it is
my greatest honor to present</i>

453
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:29,307
<i>the esteemed first disciple,
who will lead us</i>

454
00:26:29,392 --> 00:26:32,132
<i>through today's lesson
on the book of allness.</i>

455
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,969
<i>Thank you, Emilio.</i>

456
00:26:34,054 --> 00:26:36,192
<i>In the light
of the Shepherd.</i>

457
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,711
- Helmets off.
- <i>For all mankind.</i>

458
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:40,524
<i>For all mankind!</i>

459
00:26:42,088 --> 00:26:44,225
That's Anders.

460
00:26:45,123 --> 00:26:47,564
<i>Let's first take
a moment to acknowledge</i>

461
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:50,650
<i>Our newest class
of level 9s.</i>

462
00:26:50,829 --> 00:26:53,675
<i>You've each demonstrated
impressive devotion</i>

463
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,834
<i>to the Shepherd.</i>

464
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,963
<i>Our predecessors on this planet</i>

465
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,575
<i>did not share that faith.</i>

466
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,411
<i>Like our ancestors on earth,</i>

467
00:27:02,546 --> 00:27:05,122
<i>they destroyed their world.</i>

468
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:08,433
<i>Even before they were
wiped out by gen 9</i>

469
00:27:08,518 --> 00:27:11,061
<i>and turned into
crystal giants,</i>

470
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:13,025
<i>their atmosphere
was so polluted,</i>

471
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,893
<i>they were forced to build
forests underground</i>

472
00:27:15,978 --> 00:27:18,094
<i>in order to breathe.</i>

473
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:21,973
<i>Even the rain that should
fall from the sky</i>

474
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:26,059
falls instead
by their technology.

475
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:31,732
<i>For that, we thank them,
but where are they now?</i>

476
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:34,360
<i>We know that by the time
the Shepherd delivered us</i>

477
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:38,540
with the stone that
the bardoans were gone, extinct.

478
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,415
Why is that?

479
00:27:40,502 --> 00:27:41,826
WoThey didn't
have the Shepherd!

480
00:27:43,131 --> 00:27:44,389
No, they didn't
did they?

481
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:46,492
He said the stone
delivered them.

482
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:48,540
So?

483
00:27:48,662 --> 00:27:50,863
So they weren't
eligius.

484
00:27:51,681 --> 00:27:52,962
There was a stone
on earth.

485
00:27:53,135 --> 00:27:55,923
 <i>That same enemy
is coming after us,</i>

486
00:27:56,036 --> 00:27:59,363
<i>but in the light
of the Shepherd,</i>

487
00:27:59,451 --> 00:28:02,185
<i>we will not lose.</i>

488
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,171
<i>For all mankind!</i>

489
00:28:05,776 --> 00:28:08,167
That means Orlando
didn't tell us everything.

490
00:28:08,344 --> 00:28:11,096
- We should go.
- Where's hope?

491
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:13,190
 We're close now.

492
00:28:13,489 --> 00:28:15,658
We've located the key.

493
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:21,546
After hundreds of years,
it has returned to us.

494
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:27,038
Ours is the generation
that will win the last war!

495
00:28:30,762 --> 00:28:32,090
Our Shepherd will rise...

496
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:33,384
We're on a mission.

497
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:35,129
Are you out
of your mind?

498
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:39,800
 <i>As we fight
this fight for all mankind!</i>

499
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,264
Look. I know
how you feel,

500
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,141
but what do you
say this time

501
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,078
we don't fail?

502
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,147
For all mankind!

503
00:28:54,248 --> 00:28:57,373
<i>For all mankind!</i>

504
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,413
<i>You're bleeding.</i>

505
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,648
What happened?

506
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:08,624
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

507
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,342
What happened to her?
Who did this?

508
00:29:12,427 --> 00:29:13,850
We need her well
for the mission

509
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:15,057
she's about to undertake.

510
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:16,392
It wasn't us, sir.

511
00:29:16,477 --> 00:29:18,520
No one's been in or out
for the last 24 days.

512
00:29:18,605 --> 00:29:20,792
She and another
m-cap session with Levitt.

513
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:22,377
His report should be
in your system.

514
00:29:22,462 --> 00:29:24,841
I've seen it.
It was worthless to us.

515
00:29:24,926 --> 00:29:27,848
Unlike Octavia,
she knows nothing about the key.

516
00:29:27,941 --> 00:29:29,433
Be careful
of this one.

517
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:31,774
She turned an I-7
and set free

518
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:35,163
our most important asset
before getting captured.

519
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:38,609
Roll up her sleeve,
see what's wrong with her.

520
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,112
Touch me, and I won't
do your bidding.

521
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,365
Oh, I think you will.
Your mother's life depends on it,

522
00:29:44,555 --> 00:29:46,351
and that is not
a weapon we gave you.

523
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:48,282
It's a tagging device.

524
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,769
This is what happens
when you value individuals

525
00:29:50,895 --> 00:29:52,087
above the collective.

526
00:29:52,172 --> 00:29:54,007
It's called love,
you son of a bitch.

527
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,212
It's why Dev turned.

528
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,880
It's why you're
a prisoner

529
00:30:00,361 --> 00:30:01,821
dressed like a savage,

530
00:30:01,906 --> 00:30:03,983
so you can get close
enough stick that blade

531
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,705
into aunty O. And
bring her back to me.

532
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,016
- Why do you care about her?
- I don't.

533
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,275
I care about Clarke.

534
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,449
She's the key
to everything.

535
00:30:12,763 --> 00:30:14,098
What?

536
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:20,651
It's go time, captain.

537
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,805
Remember, because
of time dilation,

538
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,030
no one will come for you
if you fail.

539
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,712
- We understand.
- Good.

540
00:30:26,797 --> 00:30:29,832
I want Clarke Griffin
back here unharmed.

541
00:30:30,588 --> 00:30:32,629
The Shepherd is
counting on you.

542
00:30:32,876 --> 00:30:34,729
What about
the girl... Hope?

543
00:30:34,814 --> 00:30:37,006
She's clearly
a threat.

544
00:30:38,071 --> 00:30:39,954
Once her job is done,

545
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:42,707
terminate.

546
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,764
Hope.

547
00:30:49,893 --> 00:30:51,682
I couldn't
get out of it.

548
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,698
He has my mother.

549
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,780
I'm so sorry,
Octavia.

550
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,587
Octavia,
what's happening?

551
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:01,461
- Knife!
- O.

552
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,536
 Hello,
miss Blake.

553
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:27,513
Hmm. Be thankful you
came back in one piece.

554
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,140
Get her to medical.

555
00:31:33,512 --> 00:31:36,124
I want her back in m-cap
by the end of the day.

556
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:38,119
We're not finished yet.

557
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:50,262
Ok. Now that
just tickles.

558
00:31:50,347 --> 00:31:52,994
That's enough.
It's time.

559
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,787
Really? I was just
starting to enjoy that.

560
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,316
Looks like you'll finally
burn for our blasphemy.

561
00:31:57,401 --> 00:31:59,379
We can talk about this.
You don't have to do this!

562
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:01,526
Shut up, false god!
You burn today!

563
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:02,632
Get the hell
off of me!

564
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,578
<i>Russell Prime!</i>

565
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:09,300
Russell, Kaylee,
hallowed be your names.

566
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,212
Hallowed
be your hames.

567
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:13,116
- Hey, sis.
- Silence, false God.

568
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,368
- False God?
- Yes, holiness.

569
00:32:16,453 --> 00:32:17,925
This man is
an impostor.

570
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,478
It's not
Daniel Prime.

571
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,824
I wasn't speaking
to you.

572
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,638
It's the truth,
my lord.

573
00:32:24,723 --> 00:32:25,924
Daniel prime and I
were close.

574
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:27,219
This man didn't
recognize me.

575
00:32:27,304 --> 00:32:29,070
He couldn't even name
the 4 pillar...

576
00:32:32,072 --> 00:32:34,395
I should tear
your tongue

577
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,452
through your
throat for that.

578
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,902
 Russell,
get to the point.

579
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,005
Daniel, Kaylee, and I
are the last of the primes.

580
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:49,038
Just tonight, he gave me
his blood

581
00:32:49,123 --> 00:32:50,697
so that this body
would live

582
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:54,415
after one of the fallen
tried to take my life.

583
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:58,705
I love him like a son.

584
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,313
Now release him!

585
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:16,869
Certainly took
you long enough.

586
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:19,281
Had to find
the right dress.

587
00:33:20,483 --> 00:33:22,030
You did.

588
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,211
My, my, my.

589
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:31,334
What foolish
little lambs you are.

590
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:37,514
The last thing I want
is for all of you to die.

591
00:33:37,698 --> 00:33:41,188
In the same night your
uprising stayed my execution,

592
00:33:41,273 --> 00:33:45,205
you thought it wise
to sacrifice yourselves?

593
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,150
You're the only thing
keeping me alive!

594
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:51,779
Please forgive us,
Russell.

595
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,239
You want forgiveness,

596
00:33:55,471 --> 00:33:56,992
then show me
your fealty.

597
00:33:57,155 --> 00:33:59,620
Anything. Just
tell me what to do.

598
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,246
Hmm.

599
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,540
Kneel.

600
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,031
All of you,
kneel or die.

601
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,236
Indra, what's wrong?

602
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:16,875
I've heard
that before.

603
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,329
That's better.

604
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,337
No go home and pray
on your sins.

605
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:28,046
Good show.

606
00:34:29,696 --> 00:34:31,156
You're welcome.

607
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,800
Escort Russell Prime
back to the lab.

608
00:35:25,836 --> 00:35:27,212
Leave us.

609
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,720
Now we know what
happened to the code

610
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:34,029
when we saved
the commander.

611
00:35:34,114 --> 00:35:35,394
Hmm.

612
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:38,325
She was too weak
to be a commander,

613
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,626
and you know it.

614
00:36:05,053 --> 00:36:06,471
Ah.

615
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,592
And you know what happens
if you make me a martyr.

616
00:36:13,077 --> 00:36:15,606
Yes. The same thing
that happens

617
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:18,085
if anyone finds out
who you are.

618
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,569
Ah.

619
00:36:20,147 --> 00:36:22,399
Only then,
as the people riot

620
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:24,503
for the loss
of their God,

621
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:26,487
I can slit
your throat.

622
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,310
Ahh.

623
00:36:30,157 --> 00:36:31,492
Come in!

624
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:38,175
What's the meaning
of this?

625
00:36:39,486 --> 00:36:42,782
- Up.
- Agh! Agh.

626
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:44,843
I might not be
able to kill you,

627
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,009
but I can make sure
when I do,

628
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,503
you don't come back.

629
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,445
Death to Primes.

630
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:58,172
For the pain.
 No.

631
00:36:58,815 --> 00:37:01,134
Let him feel it...

632
00:37:01,373 --> 00:37:02,720
For Abby.

633
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:39,088
 Octavia?

634
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:41,800
Octavia!

635
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,563
I'm so sorry
this happened to you.

636
00:37:43,648 --> 00:37:45,359
I did everything I could
to help hope,

637
00:37:45,444 --> 00:37:48,348
including surgically implanting
a message in her arm.

638
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,507
I'm sorry to say this
will be our last session.

639
00:37:50,592 --> 00:37:51,833
- Why?
- They're taking me

640
00:37:51,918 --> 00:37:54,191
off your case. I think they
think I've gotten too close.

641
00:37:54,276 --> 00:37:56,480
Listen to me.
Who ever takes my place,

642
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,687
you can't fight them.

643
00:37:57,772 --> 00:37:59,023
Your brain
will hemorrhage,

644
00:37:59,108 --> 00:38:00,342
but you can beat
the machine

645
00:38:00,427 --> 00:38:02,129
if you keep your mind focused
on a single thought,

646
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:05,049
a mantra like your mom
had you say under the floor.

647
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,576
- "I'm not afraid."
- Yes. Good.

648
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,961
Let's try it.

649
00:38:13,344 --> 00:38:14,636
Can I help you, sir?

650
00:38:14,775 --> 00:38:17,025
Her brother
is here.

651
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:19,464
I need her to
talk him down.

652
00:38:20,203 --> 00:38:22,658
No one else
has to die.

653
00:38:32,665 --> 00:38:34,792
I am not afraid.

654
00:38:34,987 --> 00:38:37,308
I am not afraid.

655
00:38:37,896 --> 00:38:39,509
I am not afraid.

656
00:38:39,596 --> 00:38:42,054
- Levitt?
- I am not afraid.

657
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:43,982
It's not him.
Hey.

658
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:45,743
I am not afraid.

659
00:38:45,858 --> 00:38:47,782
- Aunty O.
- I am not afraid.

660
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,133
Aunty o., it's me.

661
00:38:49,218 --> 00:38:51,078
I am not afraid.

662
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,923
Her brother,
where is he?

663
00:38:56,241 --> 00:38:59,543
Show me,
or I take an eye.

664
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,506
I am not afraid.

665
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:04,718
I am not afraid.

666
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:13,127
Hey, big brother.

667
00:39:13,212 --> 00:39:15,178
Let her go
right now.

668
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:16,987
 We can't do that.

669
00:39:17,072 --> 00:39:19,022
These good men,
who you killed,

670
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,680
brought you here from
sanctum for a reason.

671
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:25,320
Let the conductor go,
and then we can talk.

672
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,628
Her first.

673
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:29,879
Here's no other way out
of this for you, Mr. Blake.

674
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,922
Bell, he's right.

675
00:39:32,614 --> 00:39:35,497
Open the bridge
and send him back to sanctum.

676
00:39:35,783 --> 00:39:38,097
I'll tell you everything
you want to know,

677
00:39:38,182 --> 00:39:40,431
even about Clarke.

678
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,648
What the hell are
you talking about?

679
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:53,098
- No. Sir, you can't. The...
- Shut up!

680
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,954
Bell, it's ok.

681
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:58,784
I can't let you
die to save me.

682
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:04,591
Jump through.
I'll be ok.

683
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,820
No way...

684
00:40:07,101 --> 00:40:08,280
Not without you.

685
00:40:08,446 --> 00:40:10,512
I do the Shepherd's
bidding

686
00:40:10,735 --> 00:40:12,093
for all mankind.

687
00:40:13,683 --> 00:40:15,241
Bellamy, get down!

688
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:31,433
<i>There's been explosion
in the stone room.</i>

689
00:40:31,534 --> 00:40:34,884
<i>I repeat. There's been
an explosion in the stone room.</i>

690
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:38,485
Bellamy!

691
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:51,032
No.

692
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,832
Uh! Uh!

693
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:02,144
That can't be real.

694
00:41:03,288 --> 00:41:04,957
Is that real?

695
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:09,479
Time's up.
They know we're here!

696
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,417
Echo, I'm sorry
about Bellamy,

697
00:41:12,502 --> 00:41:13,727
but we need to take him

698
00:41:13,812 --> 00:41:15,324
- as a hostage.
- Raah!

699
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:20,284
Echo. Echo?

700
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,015
Uh!

701
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:26,149
Echo, echo, no.
We need him.

702
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,567
Aah!

703
00:41:29,743 --> 00:41:31,087
Uhh!

704
00:41:42,324 --> 00:41:44,739
We'll never find
my mother.

00:09:11,647 --> 00:09:12,744
What?

162
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,413
Raven: The planet's
primary use.

163
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:17,079
I'm pretty sure it means
a place to store your dead.

164
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,069
I've seen that
symbol before.

165
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:23,041
Show me the star map.

166
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:24,763
I bet you it's
the planet where

167
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:25,974
the people who took
our friends are from.

168
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:27,225
- Knife.
- Here.

169
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,426
Thanks.

170
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:32,093
Uh! Ah!

171
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:35,679
Huh. Human.

172
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:40,761
Bummer.

173
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:42,973
What?

174
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,906
Seeing an alien
would be awesome.

175
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:47,684
Here.

176
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:50,790
At least we know
where we're going now.

177
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,206
[Panting]

178
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:56,466
Let's find that stone
and get our friends back.

179
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:18,824
Jordan:
Uh...

180
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,173
Don't be such wimps.

181
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,004
Come on. The stone's
200 meters this way.

182
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:26,756
Uhh...

183
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:29,097
[Exhales]

184
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,384
Wish this thing
had a light.

[Beeping]

186
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,047
Heh. Cool.

187
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,522
I hope no one's
claustrophobic.

188
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:44,861

really doing this? Oh...

[Beeping]

190
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:54,431
What's
that smell?

191
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,490
[Beeping]

192
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:03,107
It is me, or is it
warm in here?

193
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:04,791
It's not you.

194
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:07,086
The temperature's up
50 degrees from the surface.

195
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:11,420
There must be some kind of
thermal heat source down here.

196
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,058
[Screech]

197
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:15,531
Huh!

198
00:11:19,432 --> 00:11:21,790
Raven: 150 meters.

199
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,390
[Beeping]

200
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:26,935
Huh. There's an opening
up ahead.

[Screech]

203
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,159
Anyone else
hear that?

204
00:11:36,244 --> 00:11:38,497
I sure did.

205
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:46,830
[Beeping]

206
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,270
[Screech]

207
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:50,813
What was that?

208
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:54,588
Clarke: Raven,
why are you stopping?

209
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:56,798
[WHISPERING]
Something's down here.

210

God! Aah! Aah! Aah!

214
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:11,773
- Aah!
- Go back! Go back!

215
00:12:11,858 --> 00:12:12,897
Jordan: Shoot it
with the laser!

216
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:14,482
No. It's a cave.
It could collapse on us.

217
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:16,318
Raven: Aah! Aah!

218
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:19,404
Aah! Aah! Oh! Uh!

219

Uh! Uh!

00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:25,729
Yah! Uh!

[Panting]

222
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:31,473
Raven, are you ok?

223
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:35,724
Yeah. It's gone.

224

[All panting]

225
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:41,468
Clarke: Ok. We've
got to keep moving.

226
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:43,809
Jordan: Wait. We're going
towards that thing?

227
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:46,604
Clarke: We don't have a choice.
We've got to get to the stone.

228
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,104
[All panting]

00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:08,952
Hey, are
you hurt?

232
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:13,500
- No. I'm fine.
- Yeah.

233
00:13:17,323 --> 00:13:19,756
- What was it?
- How should I know?

234
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,549
We should go
back, right?

235
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:22,884
There might be
more of them.

236
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,595
[Rumbling]

237
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,891
Guys...

238
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:34,684
Where's the
damn tunnel?

239

Jordan: What
the hell? Acid.

243
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,465
We're not going
that way, anyway.

244
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:54,735
Come on.

245
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,671
[Whoosh]

246
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,140
The stone's this way.

00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,679
Miller: You, uh, still
think aliens are awesome?

248
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,868
Oh, hey.

249
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,369
How's your boy?

250
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,747
Alive,
thanks to you.

251
00:14:34,328 --> 00:14:35,749
You want a drink?

252
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:37,743
Me? With you?

253
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,921
Yeah.

254
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:48,803
Excuse me, but I need
to borrow your God.

255
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,631
Hey, it's ok.
What's your name?

256
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:54,531
Jeremiah.

257
00:14:54,904 --> 00:14:56,853
I'd say we go with Jerry.
What do you think?

258
00:14:58,478 --> 00:14:59,814
All right. Perfect.

259
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:02,293
Probably gonna need
to owe you that drink,

260
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:03,818
though, jer.

261
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,866
Oh, I'm not gonna
like this, am I?

262
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:12,327
Our guns were stolen.

263
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,995
I need your help
getting them back.

264

Mm.

The leader
of the convicts,

the one who died
in the reactor,

267
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:21,252
what do you know
of his thief wife?

268
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,784
Oh, machine gun
Annie?

269
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:26,160
She and hatch
were bank robbers.

270
00:15:26,422 --> 00:15:28,196
Hatch liked the money.
She liked the chaos.

271
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:30,261
If she's got the guns,
we've got problems.

272
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:32,205
Let's find out.

Indra: There was a break-in
last night.

276
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:53,201
And you think
we're responsible?

277
00:15:53,507 --> 00:15:55,036
Once a convict,
always a convict?

278
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,371
Is that it?

279
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,705
Look. You've
been through a lot.

280
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,582
We all have.

281
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:01,717
Hatch was a good man.

282
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:03,163
We just want to know
if you've seen anything

283
00:16:03,247 --> 00:16:04,587
or heard anything.

284
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:07,006
Yeah. I heard
something.

285
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:09,884
I heard you have
blood alteration,

286
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,386
means you were never
in any danger

287
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,805
going into
that reactor.

288
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,023
Raven knew exactly
what she was doing

289
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,068
when she sent my people
down there to die.

290
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:21,980
I think maybe she
should die for that.

What do you think?
You're the man now.

292
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,069
Sound like
justice to you?

293

You didn't ask
what was stolen.

Seems like
the obvious question

unless you
already know.

296
00:16:37,004 --> 00:16:38,631
Where are the guns?

Oh.

They searched me
for weapons...

336
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:38,143
Just not very well,
maybe because

337
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:40,360
they think
I'm satisfied

you would have

wants... power.

00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:56,799
the attempt
on Russell's life.

495
00:27:57,471 --> 00:27:59,093
You know last night,
a woman set herself

496
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,886
on fire for him.

497
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,265
That's nothing compared
to what I fear comes next.

498
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:09,395
Our guns were stolen,
nearly 50 of them,

499
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,480
over 2,000 rounds.

500
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,107
I have a good idea
who has them,

501
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,358
but I can't
get them back

502
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,826
unless all of wonkru
is with me.

Madi...

504
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,514
We need
our commander.

505
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:28,872
I know you
don't want this.

506
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:30,749
I don't want
this for you,

507
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:32,793
but there are forces
at play here

508
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,796
that are greater
than our wants,

509
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:38,872
responsibilities
we must yield to.

510
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:42,720
What about Clarke?

511
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,682
I'll talk with Clarke,
but the truth is,

512
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,426
no one understands this
more than her.

513
00:28:49,238 --> 00:28:50,436
That's why she's
out there right now

514
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,688
looking for
her friends.

515
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:57,527
Her people need her
like yours need you.

00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,602
Stay so
damn strong.

523
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,063
Whatever happens,

524
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,898
Clarke Griffin
doesn't break.

525
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,400
That's not true.

Really?

527
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,364
I killed 4 people in
the nuclear reactor...

528
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,078
8 more later that night
for good measure,

529
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,665

my soul's cracked open.

hum along

Raven...

533
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,302
Maybe
this is Karma

534
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,222
for everything
we've done,

535
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,058
all the people
we've killed.

536
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,561
Hey, the people
we've killed

537
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:17,690
we've killed to save
the people we love.

538
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,567
They loved
people, too.

539
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:23,404
When does it end?

540
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,031
It doesn't end here.

541
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:29,034
I don't believe
in Karma, Raven,

542
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,663
and if we have a soul,
yours isn't cracked.

543
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:36,751
You're a good person,
maybe the best I know.

544

Best you know, huh?

Then why didn't
I go in?

I could've welded
those pipes myself,

but instead, I sent hatch
and his people to die.

548
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:04,403
I could've welded
myself, but I was...

549
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,864
I was afraid.

wonkru is gathering

at the request
of the commander.

What are
you doing?

but you'll find them.

Why did you
bring them?

they care about her,

I can do this.

you were born
for this.

I told you to say?

You say one more word
to stop this,

fight, please.

Cut me down because
that's the only way

what is it?

00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:08,837
Let us help.

00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:12,091
Sheidheda.

612
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,469
What?

613
00:34:15,727 --> 00:34:17,237
In Madi?
But I thought...

614
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:19,473
Not in Madi.
In Russell.

615
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,558
When we removed
the flame from Madi,

616
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,477
sheidheda's
consciousness

617
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,312
disappeared
into the computer.

618
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,897
From there,
it jumped

619
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,525
- into the mind drive.
- The mind drive.

620
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:32,694
So kill him.

621
00:34:32,778 --> 00:34:34,821
Murphy: We can't.

622
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:37,700
Fanatics think he's Russell.
They'll burn it all down.

623
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,412
Of course, if we tell them
he isn't Russell,

624
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:43,789
they'll still
burn it all down.

625
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,165
Either way,
their God is dead.

626
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,708
Which will be the
least of our worries

627
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:49,336
because if
we tell them,

628
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,673
wonkru will know
sheidheda is back.

629
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:55,509
You really think
they'd follow him?

630
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,469
Sangedakru would,

631
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,012
and eventually, the
others would kneel.

632
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:00,263
I've seen it
before.

633
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:01,598
That's why
we need Madi.

634
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,518
No. That is why
we need you.

in that bunker,

it takes a genius

you don't want it,

it's why you
should do it.

00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,486
Woman, on P.A.:
Attention all guards.

658
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:47,073
Prisoners last seen
on level 12 by the ward.

659
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:48,742
There's nothing
to be scared of.

660
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,493
Just tell us how
to get outside.

661
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:52,245
- To the surface?
- Yes.

662
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,122
You can't, not
without rebreathers.

663
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,374
What happens
without rebreathers?

664
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:58,501
Same thing as happened
to the bardoans...

665
00:38:58,585 --> 00:39:02,464
Extinction, only
slower, I expect.

666
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:06,468
Levitt wouldn't have told us to
do this if it wasn't survivable.

667
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,969
Agh!

668
00:39:08,053 --> 00:39:09,554
Woman, on pa:
Attention all guards.

669
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,265
Prisoners last seen
on level 12 by the ward.

670
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,892
What the hell's
the matter with you?

671
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,810
She said his name.

672
00:39:15,894 --> 00:39:18,563
We still might need
levitt on the inside.

673
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,066
- On me.
- You just heard him.

674
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,859
It's too dangerous.

675
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,695
He wants his answers.
That's all he's ever wanted.

676
00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:27,113
No. That's not true.
I want to live.

677
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:28,740
Then I suggest
stepping aside.

678
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,242
- We don't have time for this.
- No. Wait.

679
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,701
Woman, on pa:
Attention all guards.

680
00:39:31,785 --> 00:39:33,328
Prisoners last seen
on level 12...

681
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,748
Octavia: They're coming.
I trust levitt. Let's go.

682
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,834
Move!

683
00:39:39,918 --> 00:39:41,086
Dyoza: Gabriel,
open the door.

684
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,379
I can't let you
risk it.

685
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,422
Gabriel, what
are you waiting for?

686
00:39:44,506 --> 00:39:45,924
Uh!

687
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,926
Uhh...

688
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,344
He's with them.

689
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,180
Weapons disengaged.
I surrender.

690
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,848
Uh!

691
00:39:53,932 --> 00:39:56,226
Uh...

692
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,818
Raven, any change?

693
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,820
Still waiting.

694
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,322
That thing damaged the helmet.
The map's too blurry.

695
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:11,116
So think it
into focus.

696
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,201
I'm trying. I can't tell
which is the right symbol.

697
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,329
- I think you need to pick one.
- No way, not again.

698
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:18,123
Niylah's right.

699
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,708
I don't want to go
to a planet where

700
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,002
they feed their dead to
some cave beast, anyway.

701
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,796
Niylah...

702
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,388
Look familiar?

703
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,349
The second dawn.

704
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:38,977
How is it possible
there's people here

705
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,937
from the bunker
in polis?

706
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,189
It's got to be
a coincidence, right?

707
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:44,607
[Screeching]

708
00:40:44,691 --> 00:40:47,485
Guys, focus.
It's coming back.

709
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:49,446
It's more
than just one.

710
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,697
Raven...

711
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,490
I'm trying.
I can almost see it.

712
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:57,162
There! I got it.
Get ready.

713
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,291
Entering the code now.

714
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,216
There!

715
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,468
[Screeching]

716
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,887
Faster, Raven!

717
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,765
- Raven, now!
- Almost there.

718
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,477
[Screeching]

719
00:41:23,042 --> 00:41:24,645
Clarke: Let's go.

720
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:27,130
Weapons hot.

721
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:29,580
We don't know what's waiting
for us on the other side.

721
00:41:30,305 --> 00:42:30,207

you make your move.

we'll only have 5 minutes

the bridge closes.

what you've done?

73
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:10,659
I couldn't
let you leave

75
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:13,221

Ugh!

00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:22,166
Let him go.

79
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:25,399
He can't help us
off this planet if he's dead.

80
00:07:25,484 --> 00:07:27,110
Help us? He just
destroyed

81
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:29,155
our one way
off this planet.

82
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,199
Does he look like
he can help us?

83
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,424
If he doesn't,
then we're dead.

84
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:37,769
We have 5 years
to train for a jump

85
00:07:37,854 --> 00:07:39,086
into the middle
of a fortress

86
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,865
guarded by thousands
of highly trained soldiers

87
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,007
to rescue the people
we love.

88
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,311
By then,
he'll love us.

89
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:47,718
That's... why
he'll help us.

90
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:52,763
Trust me. I've done
this before.

Bellamy?

95
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:32,019
Had to be.
He had the only gun.

96
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:34,627
Maybe not.
The foragers that found it,

97
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:36,777
said that they saw
no sign of our people.

98
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:40,618
Well, let's see
who's in there.

99
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,246
Whoa, no.
We need it intact.

100
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,915
Raven will figure it out.
Where is she?

101
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,333
You said she was
here.

102
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:54,918
Scene of the crime.
The reactor.

103
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,077
She's taking it
pretty hard.

104
00:08:57,222 --> 00:08:58,389
I'll get her.

105
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:04,511
Another one?

106
00:09:04,595 --> 00:09:06,763
Oh. Golden face
has friends.

107
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,640
How many were there?

108
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:11,810
It's ok. He came to the
tavern looking for you.

109
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:13,395
Tell her how many
you saw.

110
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:16,022
Just one
outside the shield.

111
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:17,566
Alive?

112
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,901
Apparently, he asked
for Clarke by name.

113
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:21,861
They have our people.

114
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:23,738
- We'll need backup.
- Wait a minute.

115
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:25,699
You're going
just like that?

116
00:09:25,783 --> 00:09:26,919
Of course she is.

117
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:28,276
No backup.
Thanks to gaia,

everyone we got's
on duty.

119

00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:41,496
Hey.

122
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:43,883
I'm busy.
What do you need?

123
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:50,224
Bellamy, echo,
and octavia are in trouble.

124
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,701
Yeah. You should see
the other guy.

125
00:09:56,868 --> 00:09:57,981
Tell me what's wrong.

126
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,691
- Raven.
- Clarke, I'm fine!

127
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,109
Tell me what's wrong.

128
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:02,733
You're not fine.

129
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:06,356
Fine. You're right.
I'm not.

130
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,422
You didn't kill
those people.

131
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:12,578
A nuclear rector
almost melted down.

132
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:14,213
If you didn't do
what you did,

133
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:15,757
those people would
still be dead,

134
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:18,573
and so would everyone else
in sanctum.

135
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:23,190
I can't forget
their faces.

136
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,008
And you won't.

137
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:27,924
Just don't forget
the ones you saved.

138
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:30,701
Come on. It's easier
if I just show you

139
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:32,524
what we're dealing with.

140
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:49,115
Clarke Griffin,
thank you for...

141
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:50,784
Where are my friends?

142
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:53,453
Your friends killed
3 of mine.

143
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:55,432
I believe you have
one of their bodies.

144
00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:57,369
I'll need her back.

145
00:10:57,454 --> 00:11:00,039
Maybe you think we can't
shoot through the shield.

146
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:02,420
- We can.
- Good.

147
00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:04,200
That means
we can, too.

148
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:11,353
Your friends
are safe for now.

149
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:16,833
What the hell does that
mean? Who are you?

150
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:19,504
We are the disciples
of a greater truth,

151
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:21,738
and we need your help,
Clarke.

152
00:11:21,857 --> 00:11:24,513
Our leader believes
that you are the key

153
00:11:24,598 --> 00:11:27,987
to winning the last war
mankind will ever wage.

154
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:30,008
Just that, huh?

155
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,784
Come with us, Clarke.

156
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:33,786
You have my word
you'll be unharmed.

157
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:36,152
You're out your mind
if you think she's going... <font color="#ffff00">- Fine.</font>

158
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:42,053
First, I want
my friends back.

159
00:11:42,138 --> 00:11:43,723
Done.
We'll retrieve them.

160
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:45,434
You can meet them
at the bridge.

161
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,020
- Bridge?
- I believe you call it

162
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:48,337
the anomaly.

163
00:11:48,422 --> 00:11:50,522
We've harnessed
its power.

164
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:53,755
Gabriel Santiago's camp.
Shall we?

165
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,016
We'll meet you there.

166
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,768
You should know time moves
much faster

167
00:11:57,852 --> 00:11:59,478
where your friends are.

168
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:01,814
Every second counts.

169
00:12:15,124 --> 00:12:17,794
There must be some kind
of latching mechanism.

170
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:22,006
What?

171
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:24,746
A lot's happened...

172
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,832
Since the first time
we worked together

173
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:31,149
just us on the ship.

174
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:34,390
We realized sanctum
was a moon

175
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:36,361
before we screwed
everything.

176
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:38,031
Yeah, I was there.

177
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:42,713
I got stabbed.
Did you know that?

178
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:51,703
I'm sorry we didn't
come for you sooner, ok?

179
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,208
Damn. Nikki did
you good, huh?

180
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:07,300
Cool tattoos.
What do they mean?

181
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:08,910
How should I know?

182
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:10,930
I need a minute.

183
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:12,508
We don't have
that long.

184
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:14,224
What have you
found out?

185
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:15,680
What have
you found out?

186
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:17,705
Invisibility.

187
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:19,977
No way.

188
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:21,933
They have
our friends.

189
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:23,853
I'm leaving now
to get them back,

190
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:25,818
but I need to know what
else we're dealing with.

191
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:27,004
We're on it.

192
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:29,145
We're taking two of the
bikes to Gabriel's camp.

193
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,065
Miller claims
he can ride.

194
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:33,408
If you find out anything
else about these suits...

195
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:35,066
I'll ride out
and meet you.

196
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:37,269
Ryker showed me.

197
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:39,721
Ok. Work fast.

198
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,500
Clarke, wait.

199
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:44,758
Bellamy, octavia,
and echo...

200
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:47,547
Where are they?

201
00:13:50,803 --> 00:13:52,521
5 years.

202
00:13:54,643 --> 00:13:56,182
Thinking about
it makes it worse.

203
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:59,018
She's right.
Give us a hand.

204
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,064
Playing in the dirt won't
make time pass faster.

205
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:04,233
Maybe not,
but it will give

206
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:06,545
our friend out there
something to long for,

207
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,739
seeing the 3 of us
working together as a team.

208
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:11,992
Trust me.
He'll want that.

209
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:13,870
We should hunt him down.

210
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:16,165
Is that how you make
friends in the ice nation?

211
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,390
Just ice nation.
There's no "The."

212
00:14:21,793 --> 00:14:23,657
There's clearly
no gardening either.

213
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:26,839
That one's still alive.
Raspberries?

214
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:28,590
Paint berries.

215
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:30,867
Eat them, and they
make you sick.

216
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:37,942
Is that what you
used on this?

217
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,394
Is "H" for hope?

218
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:44,591
No. Hesperides.

219
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:59,163
"Hess-pe-rides."

220
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:01,998
"Hess-pair-ih-dees."
3 maidens.

221
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,792
- Like us.
- Yep. You're right.

222
00:15:03,876 --> 00:15:05,461
Exactly. Like us.

223
00:15:05,545 --> 00:15:09,134
3 maidens...
Guarding a garden.

224
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:11,592
You said that they were
guarding a golden apple,

225
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:15,838
the one
herc-a-lees stole,

226
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:17,684
but we don't have
any apples.

227
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:20,477
Duh. That's why I
planted those.

228
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:23,645
But those aren't
apple blossoms, aunty O.

229
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:25,834
I know that,
smarty pants,

230
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:29,402
but they're beautiful
just like you.

231
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:35,840
What should we
call them?

232
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:41,830
The Hercules roses
are opening.

233
00:15:41,914 --> 00:15:43,540
It's herc-a-lees.

234
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:45,042
Don't pick them.

235
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:50,998
Heh.

236
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:55,677
Here you go.

237
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:58,811
Some powdered jelly fish.

238
00:15:58,895 --> 00:16:01,976
Trust me. It's better
than monty's algae.

239
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,083
Sorry.

240
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:05,422
Ahem.

241
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:10,072
Yes, Gabriel,
I'm talking to the plants.

242
00:16:10,156 --> 00:16:12,199
Makes them taste bet...

243
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:13,819
I found these.

244
00:16:15,745 --> 00:16:17,267
Uh, pumpkin seeds.

245
00:16:18,164 --> 00:16:19,832
Hope likes
pumpkins.

246
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,171
Um...

247
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:28,439
Go for it.

248
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,127
Is she here?

249
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:31,802
She is.

250
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:34,191
Plant the seeds.
I'll go get her.

251
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:36,933
Right there's fine.

252
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:01,449
Hey, hey. No.
It's ok, it's ok.

253
00:17:01,874 --> 00:17:04,043
I'm not gonna
hurt you. No. Wait.

254
00:17:08,131 --> 00:17:10,713
3 months playing happy
family to lure him in,

255
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,153
and you blew it.

256
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:14,104
Screw that.
Look at the tomatoes.

257
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:15,949
He'll be back.

258
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:18,546
He's on the hook now.

259
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:20,384
We just need to
reel him in.

260
00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:23,998
Let's eat lunch outside
again so he can see us.

261
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,237
Bait on the hook.

262
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,479
I got a better idea.

263
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:32,705
We bait the hook...

264
00:17:33,781 --> 00:17:35,248
- With you.
- Heh.

265
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:40,474
Ok. Pay attention. Ok.

266
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,878
Really? Are you sure?

267
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,756
Ok, but not too smart.

268
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:57,384
Heh heh. See?
I warned you.

269
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,259
Help!
Somebody, help!

270
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:02,935
Hope!

271
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:06,188
- Help!
- Hold on! I'm coming!

272
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:08,316
Help me!

273
00:18:20,244 --> 00:18:21,488
Agh!

274
00:18:21,746 --> 00:18:23,039
No!

275
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:27,726
Hold on. I got you.

276
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:36,876
Hope, are you ok?

277
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:40,331
I am now,
thanks to you.

278
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:43,141
What the hell
were you doing?

279
00:18:43,226 --> 00:18:44,768
I was trying to get to
bardo to save my family.

280
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:47,117
You can't. The
bridge is too deep.

281
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,406
Hey, hey. We're
your family, too, ok?

282
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:53,173
We'll get there together.

283
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,022
We'll find away.

284
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:58,031
The only way
off this planet

285
00:18:58,115 --> 00:19:00,200
is on my
absolution day.

286
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:03,954
4 years, 10 months,
22 days.

287
00:19:04,413 --> 00:19:06,479
It's your
absolution day maybe,

288
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:08,458
but they'll kill us.

289
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:09,835
Hope, too.

290
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:15,481
I won't let that
happen.

291
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,730
Th... thank you.

292
00:19:35,236 --> 00:19:37,571
The garden will be
producing soon,

293
00:19:37,655 --> 00:19:40,616
but for now,
jellyfish ettouffee.

294
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,201
- Uhh.
- Mmm.

295
00:19:42,285 --> 00:19:44,759
Do not listen to them.
They love it.

296
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:46,585
It was my mother's
specialty.

297
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,380
Yeah. Navy seal
turned terrorist chef.

298
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:52,401
Hate to see what happened
if you sent it back.

299
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:55,077
You ok?

300
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:56,802
Terrorist?

301
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:01,299
- She didn't tell you.
- I was 10 when they took her.

302
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:05,099
She was a freedom fighter,
not a terrorist,

303
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:07,274
but that wouldn't have been
as funny with chef, so...

304
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:08,474
It wasn't that funny.

305
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,228
I always wondered why she
wouldn't let aunty O train me.

306
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:13,717
She was so adamant.

307
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:15,856
Now it makes sense.

308
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:18,198
She didn't want you
to be like her.

309
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:20,709
Wait till she sees
you now.

310
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:22,952
Guys, we're being rude.

311
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:24,668
Orlando, tell us
about you.

312
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,740
What are these?

313
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:29,543
Uh, it's, um...

314
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:33,092
12 symbols. It means you're a level-12,
right?

315
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:37,595
The I-7 who atoned
here before me,

316
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,087
he teach you that?

317
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,216
Yes. Dev,

318
00:20:44,436 --> 00:20:46,721
and he taught me
as much as he could,

319
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:49,233
but we were afraid that
I wouldn't have answers

320
00:20:49,318 --> 00:20:52,107
if I was stopped by anyone
higher once we were inside.

321
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:55,368
And was he right?
Is that why you failed?

322
00:20:59,101 --> 00:21:00,974
Uh... no.

323
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,914
We failed because
I hesitated

324
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,805
when it was time
to kill.

325
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:10,833
He's dead because
of me.

326
00:21:11,547 --> 00:21:13,940
His body is at your
skeleton picnic.

327
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:15,485
Heh.

328
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:22,640
So, uh, tell us
about bardo, Orlando.

329
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:25,741
You know,
I've got a theory

330
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,520
about how your people
got there.

331
00:21:27,604 --> 00:21:30,190
- Would you like to, uh...
- The Shepherd delivered us.

332
00:21:30,274 --> 00:21:33,984
I'm sorry about Dev.
I'll Bury him with honor.

333
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,946
You have my word.

334
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:39,594
Thank you.

335
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:41,907
Was the Shepherd
on eligius III, as well?

336
00:21:41,992 --> 00:21:43,820
Don't say his name.

337
00:21:46,206 --> 00:21:47,605
You still believe
all that stuff

338
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,246
even after they
locked you up?

339
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,711
Why did
they lock you up?

340
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:53,296
Shepherd's law
number 4...

341
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,642
"honor the day of rest

342
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:56,520
to be efficient
the rest of the week."

343
00:21:56,605 --> 00:21:59,822
I chose not to rest,
and I was punished for it,

344
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:03,891
and, yes,
I still believe.

345
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:11,408
Wait, Orlando,
stay, please.

346
00:22:11,493 --> 00:22:14,028
Nah. Thanks
for everything.

347
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:15,990
It was... it was lovely.

348
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:22,572
Orlando.

349
00:22:22,657 --> 00:22:27,509
Ehh. Too bad your mom,
the Navy seal,

350
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:29,666
didn't teach you
how to swim.

351
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:32,878
Heh.

352
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,386
Well, that could've
gone better.

353
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:39,847
Mm-hmm.

354
00:22:40,052 --> 00:22:42,684
Level-12 is
hardcore.

355
00:22:42,843 --> 00:22:44,556
If we can turn him,
we'll have access

356
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,563
to everything
in bardo.

357
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:49,811
Well, then it's
a good thing we have time

358
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:51,522
because we're gonna
need it.

359
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:57,610
You can take it apart
and put it together again

360
00:22:57,694 --> 00:22:59,368
after we find out
what it can do.

361
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,211
 As of now,
we can't even turn it on.

362
00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:05,240
I don't even see
a power source.

363
00:23:06,662 --> 00:23:08,997
I've read theories on how
certain materials charged

364
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:10,957
a certain way can
produce an invisibility field,

365
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,748
but this...

366
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:15,974
This is way beyond
what we're capable of.

367
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,991
You think?

368
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:21,384
You think.
That's it.

369
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:28,683
It worked!

370
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:31,814
Thought control.
Cool!

371
00:23:32,312 --> 00:23:36,558
So beyond our capabilities
means what, alien?

372
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:38,766
We're all aliens now.

373
00:23:38,903 --> 00:23:43,113
Oh. One of the symbols that
was on that girl's face is in here.

374
00:23:43,198 --> 00:23:44,926
I'm gonna select
that one.

375
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:50,163
What is it?
What's wrong?

376
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:51,518
Nothing.

377
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:53,809
So what do you see?

378
00:23:53,894 --> 00:23:55,312
Everything.

379
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,681
Oh, it's beautiful.

380
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,351
Jordan, there's
an anomaly here, too.

381
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:07,725
Where? How about
I get a turn?

382
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,768
Hold on. Widen out
one step.

383
00:24:15,564 --> 00:24:17,332
How are they all
connected?

384
00:24:19,818 --> 00:24:22,114
- Wormholes.
- What?

385
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:24,890
- No way.
- Yes way!

386
00:24:24,975 --> 00:24:27,075
The anomaly is
a wormhole,

387
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:28,910
and whatever
these people are,

388
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:31,236
they can travel
anywhere in the universe.

389
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:34,246
Oh. Guess I'm out
of a job.

390
00:24:34,629 --> 00:24:36,597
What do they want
with Clarke?

391
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:40,876
They know things.

392
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:42,507
How's that possible?

393
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:45,441
"Rendition"?

394
00:24:46,658 --> 00:24:49,285
Clarke's a target.

395
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,216
We have to warn
them.

396
00:25:00,575 --> 00:25:02,176
- One!
- Damn it!

397
00:25:02,261 --> 00:25:04,054
Ah! Every time.

398
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:05,491
- You're dead.
- I'm not dead.

399
00:25:05,576 --> 00:25:07,822
I'm invisible.
You're dead,

400
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:09,435
and that really hurt.

401
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,602
Is this a game
to you?

402
00:25:10,686 --> 00:25:12,897
Easy. He's back.

403
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:19,570
And Gabriel's right.
If they ghost, we're dead.

404
00:25:19,654 --> 00:25:21,113
Let's go again.

405
00:25:21,197 --> 00:25:23,287
- Are we entertaining you?
- Echo, calm down.

406
00:25:23,372 --> 00:25:25,960
If you got
something to say, say it!

407
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:29,850
Or maybe you're gonna run away again,
huh?

408
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:33,387
Hey. Hold on.

409
00:25:33,472 --> 00:25:34,973
L-12, huh?

410
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,963
Is that supposed to
scare me?

411
00:25:37,854 --> 00:25:41,212
If it doesn't,
it's because you don't know what we can do.

412
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:43,567
Now I'm
really scared.

413
00:25:43,651 --> 00:25:45,277
I'll tell you what.
If I lose,

414
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:46,946
you get
the cabin back.

415
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,538
If you lose,
you help us train.

416
00:25:50,658 --> 00:25:51,867
Tell us what we
need to know.

417
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:53,369
Need to know
to kill my people?

418
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:55,378
That's gonna happen
anyway.

419
00:25:55,913 --> 00:25:58,289
The only question is
are you gonna die

420
00:25:58,374 --> 00:26:00,518
with them
when they come?

421
00:26:08,415 --> 00:26:13,128
Ha! Aunty O would have loved
seeing you get your ass kicked. Ha ha!

422
00:26:22,531 --> 00:26:25,158
Careful.
That stuff's dangerous.

423
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:27,653
Tell me about m-cap again.

424
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,424
Memory capture.

425
00:26:33,242 --> 00:26:36,556
It's not torture
unless you fight it.

426
00:26:38,456 --> 00:26:40,029
Aunty o did,

427
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:44,796
and apparently,
so did my mom.

428
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,467
Bellamy will, too.

429
00:26:52,553 --> 00:26:55,084
I don't know what
I'll do if I lose him.

430
00:26:56,307 --> 00:26:58,064
You won't.

431
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:00,094
A year here for us
has only been

432
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:01,646
a few days for him.

433
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:07,359
Well, from now on,
you want to bet something...

434
00:27:07,443 --> 00:27:11,291
Ohh... you leave my bed
out of it.

435
00:27:12,115 --> 00:27:13,889
Good night,
echo.

436
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:17,036
- Good night, Gabriel.
- Yep.

437
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:26,295
Good night, Orlando!

438
00:27:37,515 --> 00:27:39,099
 In the shadow
of the Shepherd.

439
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:40,809
For all mankind,

440
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:43,395
he saved us from the fire
that consumed the earth.

441
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:45,272
In the light
of the shep...

442
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:47,186
Sorry to
interrupt.

443
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,340
Just, um... just wanted
to give you these.

444
00:27:53,114 --> 00:27:55,111
- Why?
- Your skin tone's off.

445
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:56,658
I've noticed
you lost weight.

446
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,952
Fairly certain your
body's in ketosis.

447
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:00,704
Trust me.

448
00:28:00,788 --> 00:28:02,373
Eat your Greens.

449
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:04,762
- You a doctor or something?
- I am,

450
00:28:05,126 --> 00:28:06,460
so take the advice.

451
00:28:06,544 --> 00:28:07,972
- <i>Damn it!</i>
- <i>Don't pout.</i>

452
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:09,432
I should go.

453
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,816
Echo's firing
live rounds again.

454
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:13,905
You won't pull it off.

455
00:28:15,052 --> 00:28:16,970
Because of what happened
last time with Dev,

456
00:28:17,054 --> 00:28:18,815
they'll send more people.

457
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,631
They?

458
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:22,335
We.

459
00:28:22,847 --> 00:28:25,037
No, no. I see.

460
00:28:27,356 --> 00:28:28,909
Well, we have
more people, so...

461
00:28:28,994 --> 00:28:30,275
Not enough.

462
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,130
So help us.

463
00:28:33,403 --> 00:28:34,603
Thanks for the veggies.

464
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,996
We don't want to kill
your people, ok?

465
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:38,892
We just... we just
want to save ours.

466
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:41,161
Would the Shepherd
not understand that?

467
00:28:41,245 --> 00:28:42,874
I told you not to
say his name.

468
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:45,685
Sorry. Ok. It's just

469
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:49,169
I know a thing or two
about worshiping false gods.

470
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:50,587
What did you just say?

471
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:52,350
I mean no offense.

472
00:28:52,882 --> 00:28:54,908
Look. We all come
from earth, ok?

473
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:57,829
A ship brought us
across the stars

474
00:28:57,914 --> 00:28:59,791
to escape
a world on fire

475
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:02,134
largely thanks to
people bastardizing

476
00:29:02,219 --> 00:29:04,351
the words
of their gods.

477
00:29:04,435 --> 00:29:06,270
Would the Shepherd
that saved you condone

478
00:29:06,354 --> 00:29:08,780
torturing my friends,
who did nothing to you.

479
00:29:09,698 --> 00:29:11,269
Would he condone
sending a man

480
00:29:11,354 --> 00:29:13,897
as devoted to him
as you to prison?

481
00:29:14,111 --> 00:29:17,593
No. No. Men
condone those things.

482
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:20,920
Weak men follow
their orders.

483
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,788
Enjoy your salad.

484
00:29:25,615 --> 00:29:27,116
Don't give up.

485
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:33,438
66, 67.

486
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:34,938
Still not fast enough.

487
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,303
 We don't
kill anyone,

488
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:38,798
you get your people,
and you get out.

489
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:42,332
Best efforts.

490
00:29:43,474 --> 00:29:46,268
You're a soldier. You know
that in battle things can...

491
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:47,770
Done.

492
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:50,931
I've got 4 years,
8 months,

493
00:29:51,016 --> 00:29:53,479
and 17 days to turn
you into disciples.

494
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:55,663
If you survive,

495
00:29:56,153 --> 00:29:57,738
you may be ready.

496
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,182
Get some rest.
We start at dawn.

497
00:30:19,832 --> 00:30:22,668
 Congratulations
on reaching level-12.

498
00:30:31,969 --> 00:30:34,012
Hey. Dev would
be proud of you.

499
00:30:34,373 --> 00:30:36,000
I know I am.

500
00:30:37,182 --> 00:30:39,351
That goes for both
of you, too.

501
00:30:39,435 --> 00:30:42,103
I wish all my trainees
were as determined as you.

502
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:45,274
The war to end all wars
would be a lot easier.

503
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,445
Who's next?

504
00:30:50,904 --> 00:30:53,667
You go. I'm eating.

505
00:30:54,074 --> 00:30:55,326
You're
always eating.

506
00:30:59,788 --> 00:31:02,551
I can never eat
the night before battle.

507
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,199
I wouldn't know.

508
00:31:08,797 --> 00:31:10,840
It must be hard
to dedicate your whole life

509
00:31:10,924 --> 00:31:12,926
to something that
may never come.

510
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,261
Not really.

511
00:31:14,345 --> 00:31:16,471
I didn't know
anything else

512
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:18,349
until I met
all of you.

513
00:31:22,686 --> 00:31:24,229
Once it's done
and we're out of your hair,

514
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:26,242
what re you
gonna do?

515
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,746
He's gonna miss us.

516
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,590
Of course I am.

517
00:31:33,947 --> 00:31:35,699
So come with us.

518
00:31:35,783 --> 00:31:38,194
Where? Sanctum?
Red Sun toxin,

519
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,168
immortal body-snatchers?

520
00:31:40,788 --> 00:31:44,040
Thanks, but I'll stick
with honor and duty.

521
00:31:44,124 --> 00:31:45,794
Heh heh.

522
00:31:46,043 --> 00:31:48,017
Now stop talking,

523
00:31:48,504 --> 00:31:50,088
or I won't just take
the beating

524
00:31:50,172 --> 00:31:51,965
I'm about let
you give me.

525
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:11,860
<i>Master Orlando,
time for your absolution.</i>

526
00:32:11,944 --> 00:32:14,988
Quiet. Knowing Orlando,
he would have been at the bridge.

527
00:32:15,072 --> 00:32:16,698
I don't like this.

528
00:32:16,782 --> 00:32:19,202
WoNo.
It's a trap!

529
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:21,154
Ghost mode now!

530
00:32:23,956 --> 00:32:25,290
Nice shot.

531
00:32:25,374 --> 00:32:27,800
Bridge closes
in 5 minutes. Move, move!

532
00:32:30,504 --> 00:32:32,836
Get the armor off and secure
them before they wake up.

533
00:32:36,178 --> 00:32:39,049
Not again.

534
00:32:39,134 --> 00:32:40,594
No!

535
00:32:48,564 --> 00:32:50,398
Thank you.

536
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,484
- Suit up.
- Ok.

537
00:32:52,568 --> 00:32:55,120
- How much time?
- 4 minutes, 10 seconds.

538
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,427
She had no choice,
and you know it.

539
00:33:06,165 --> 00:33:07,916
No, no.

540
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:12,379
Orlando, we're sorry.

541
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:14,214
We'll suit up,
then cut you loose.

542
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:19,373
2.5 minutes to spare.
It's time to go.

543
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:23,691
No. He knew that girl,
trained her I'm guessing.

544
00:33:24,975 --> 00:33:28,101
How many more people will
he know on the other side?

545
00:33:32,065 --> 00:33:33,775
I have to save bellamy.

546
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:38,988
Echo.

547
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:41,866
No!

548
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,535
Echo, what in the hell
are you doing?

549
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:45,829
- This isn't the plan.
- Plans change.

550
00:33:45,913 --> 00:33:47,705
If we leave them alive,
he'll tell them

551
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:50,626
everything, and they'll
come after us.

552
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:53,253
We're running
out of time.

553
00:33:53,337 --> 00:33:54,671
- We have to go.
- No!

554
00:33:54,755 --> 00:33:56,215
Echo!

555
00:33:57,937 --> 00:34:00,760
He'll be with us,
acting like our hostage,

556
00:34:00,845 --> 00:34:02,137
leading us
through the compound.

557
00:34:02,221 --> 00:34:04,658
- That's the plan!
- No, he won't!

558
00:34:05,891 --> 00:34:07,898
We're leaving him here?

559
00:34:08,017 --> 00:34:10,395
No. No way.
He's our friend!

560
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,988
Yes!

561
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:16,119
But we are not
his people.

562
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:21,091
Grab your helmets.

563
00:34:21,176 --> 00:34:22,844
Echo, this is wrong.

564
00:34:26,537 --> 00:34:28,739
You want to stay,
or do you want the answers

565
00:34:28,824 --> 00:34:31,413
that are waiting for you
on the other side?

566
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:39,685
Echo,
no, no, no, no, no!

567
00:34:41,802 --> 00:34:43,688
Cut yourself free.

568
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,806
I am sorry.

569
00:34:49,226 --> 00:34:50,982
He'll be alone
for years.

570
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,242
The bridge is
closing.

571
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,249
Nice fence. Not sure
Gabriel would approve,

572
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:33,300
but I like what you've
done with the place.

573
00:35:33,526 --> 00:35:35,581
- Where are my friends?
- In the woods watching

574
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:38,553
your back, no doubt.

575
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,074
Good guess.

576
00:35:40,158 --> 00:35:43,161
Not those friends.

577
00:35:43,245 --> 00:35:46,748
They were on penance.
They're not anymore.

578
00:35:46,832 --> 00:35:48,666
- Penance?
- Penal planet.

579
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,586
I told you time moves
much faster there.

580
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,130
They managed to kill
5 more of my people.

581
00:35:54,214 --> 00:35:57,675
We found the graves along with
the body of a disciple prisoner,

582
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:59,886
who apparently spent
5 years with them.

583
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,306
He killed himself
after they betrayed him.

584
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,892
- You're lying.
- Then he is, too.

585
00:36:05,976 --> 00:36:07,446
Suicide note.

586
00:36:08,886 --> 00:36:10,346
Toss it.

587
00:36:15,402 --> 00:36:16,819
I've been civil
with you

588
00:36:16,903 --> 00:36:20,218
despite the fact
that at last count

589
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,828
9 of my people
are dead.

590
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,333
I'd really rather not
make it 10.

591
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:31,897
On this we agree.

592
00:36:37,387 --> 00:36:38,922
Good trick.

593
00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:42,384
Trust me.

594
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:45,697
These things only work if
you're willing to pull the trigger.

595
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,464
Since you already said
you need me,

596
00:36:47,549 --> 00:36:49,353
give me the damn note.

597
00:36:52,314 --> 00:36:54,898
It seems our intel
on you is correct.

598
00:36:55,692 --> 00:36:57,599
You're smart, brave,

599
00:36:58,107 --> 00:36:59,654
willing to risk
your own life.

600
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:01,573
Too bad you're not
willing to risk the lives

601
00:37:01,657 --> 00:37:02,938
of your friends.

602
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:06,600
Once she shoots me,
kill her friends.

603
00:37:08,956 --> 00:37:11,748
Now you can answer
my questions voluntarily,

604
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:14,294
or you can wake up
connected to a machine

605
00:37:14,378 --> 00:37:17,526
that will extract everything
we need to know.

606
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,335
Either way,

607
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,005
you're going to serve
the Shepherd.

608
00:37:22,234 --> 00:37:24,820
Good.
I'm in time.

609
00:37:25,031 --> 00:37:26,764
Jordan?

610
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,737
What are you doing?

611
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:31,492
Saving you. You can thank
me after you

612
00:37:31,577 --> 00:37:32,869
get down!

613
00:37:44,241 --> 00:37:46,367
Raven reyes,
ladies and gentlemen.

614
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:47,744
Everybody, eyes
on the woods.

615
00:37:47,828 --> 00:37:49,329
There may be more
of them.

616
00:37:52,781 --> 00:37:57,869
Hey. It's ok.
You did it.

617
00:37:58,255 --> 00:38:01,167
I just killed 8 people.
Nothing about that is ok.

618
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:06,054
 Now let's go
find that wormhole

619
00:38:06,138 --> 00:38:07,639
and bring our friends home.

620
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,401
Where does
it lead?

621
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:22,445
Everywhere.

622
00:38:22,706 --> 00:38:25,031
We need to go to
penance and find their trail.

623
00:38:25,115 --> 00:38:26,240
How do we get there?

624
00:38:26,324 --> 00:38:27,784
We use the map.

625
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,581
Show me penance.

626
00:38:34,124 --> 00:38:35,799
It's not responding.
It...

627
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:39,670
The map doesn't use names,
only symbols.

628
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:41,881
Ok. Looks like there's
6 planets

629
00:38:41,965 --> 00:38:43,549
in what could be
a network.

630
00:38:43,633 --> 00:38:45,343
One seems to be offline,

631
00:38:45,427 --> 00:38:47,303
and one is sanctum.

632
00:38:47,387 --> 00:38:49,347
- Two stars?
- Yeah.

633
00:38:49,431 --> 00:38:51,182
So that gives us
a 1 in 4 chance.

634
00:38:51,266 --> 00:38:53,351
That's if one
of them is penance.

635
00:38:53,435 --> 00:38:55,770
We try them all.

636
00:38:55,854 --> 00:38:58,731
Pick one
and enter the code.

637
00:38:58,815 --> 00:39:00,233
Ok.

638
00:39:00,317 --> 00:39:02,444
This one looks fun.

639
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:06,156
It's showing me
what symbols to touch.

640
00:39:10,076 --> 00:39:12,829
What if the fun one
isn't survivable?

641
00:39:15,248 --> 00:39:17,002
No one has to do this.

642
00:39:17,334 --> 00:39:19,877
You should each decide
for yourselves,

643
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:21,694
but I'm not losing
anyone else.

644
00:39:21,905 --> 00:39:23,373
Well, in that case,
maybe you should consider

645
00:39:23,457 --> 00:39:25,716
what happens when the dead
disciples up there don't check in.

646
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,011
They'll send more.

647
00:39:28,763 --> 00:39:32,198
I'll stay to warn
the others and protect madi.

648
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:36,019
 Boom.

649
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,816
Who wants to go
for a ride?

650
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:48,073
Why not?

651
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:52,055
I'm in.

652
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:55,035
What the hell? This
planet sucks anyway.

653
00:39:58,124 --> 00:39:59,584
Thank you.

654
00:40:01,804 --> 00:40:03,203
Bring them home.

655
00:40:05,131 --> 00:40:06,554
We'll be waiting.

656
00:40:21,507 --> 00:40:23,107
Ladies and gentlemen,

657
00:40:23,294 --> 00:40:26,152
Clarke Griffin
has left the planet.

658
00:40:54,123 --> 00:40:56,877
Huh! Unh!

659
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,714
Aah! Unh!

660
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:19,958
Is everyone ok?

661
00:41:22,517 --> 00:41:24,818
You like this planet
better, Miller?

662
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,279
I say we try
the next one.

663
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:31,524
Yeah. Only one problem.

664
00:41:31,913 --> 00:41:34,519
We need an anomaly stone
for that.

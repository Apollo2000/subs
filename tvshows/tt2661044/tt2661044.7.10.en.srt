1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,810
Previously on "the 100"...

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,320
This is how my people
show they're ready
to go to war.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,860
Do the rest of you
agree with echo?

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,900
Octavia: free us,

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,150
And we'll fight
your war.

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,450
Anders: training
starts tomorrow.

7
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,910
I'll make disciples
of your yet.

8
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,200
How does it work?

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,530
Well, you killed
my best friend,

10
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,080
So I'm not sure
I want to help you.

11
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,500
-I'll do anything.
-Our other friends--

12
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,790
Bring them here.

13
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,080
Cadogan:
send in their friends.

14
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,460
Murphy: indra,
what are you doing?

15
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,960
Indra: killing a demon.

16
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,920
This is what he wanted.
Open the door!

18
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,930
Emori: we've got
another live one!

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,360
I need you to
stay still, ok?

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,530
Ok. We're gonna
get you out of here.

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,030
Oh, no! Ohh!

22
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,740
Take care of my son.

23
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,870
You take care of him
yourself, all right?

24
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,700
I'm not letting
you die.

25
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,830
Indra: sheidheda--
where is he?

26
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,710
Emori: we rushed in
to help the faithful.

27
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,710
Before we knew it,
he was gone.

28
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,800
Indra: he escaped
through the secret passage.

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,840
We need to find him
before he can reach wonkru.

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,260
Well, might be
a little late for that.

31
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,100
Your buddy knight's
gone, too.

32
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,810
Sangedakru will
follow him.

33
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,430
He's one of their own.

34
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,440
The other clans will
take more convincing,

35
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,020
But with
no alternative--

36
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,150
Emori: there is
an alternative.

37
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,400
Madi!

38
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,090
Man: let's leave.

39
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,960
Go, go, go.
Come on.

40
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,310
Madi kom louwoda
kliron kru.

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,020
Russell?

42
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,060
I--i didn't know you
you spoke--

43
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,910
Sheidheda.

44
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,130
In the flesh...again.

45
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,300
You betrayed me,
madi.

46
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,430
I offered you
the world,

47
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,100
And you chose
weakness,

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,100
Love.

49
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,060
I'd like to see
you bleed.

50
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,200
Unfortunately for me,

51
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,820
Indra's reign
has changed things.

52
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,370
Yeah. Yes.
They follow her.

53
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,500
Despite the redness
of her blood. Hmm?

54
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,920
This free rein
won't do at all.

55
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,140
I'm in a quandary,
madi.

56
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,100
As a fellow
former commander,

57
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,820
You have a claim
to the throne,

58
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,440
And while killing you
solves that problem,

59
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,780
It makes my indra
problem worse.

60
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,200
She may be an imposter,
but she does have
followers,

61
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Trikru fools mostly,

62
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,960
But grounders
just the same,

63
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,210
My people
just the same.

64
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,630
I'll give them
a chance to kneel

65
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,380
Just like I'm
giving it to you.

66
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,590
Kneel for me
right now, madi,

67
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,890
And I'll let you live.

68
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,600
Refuse to kneel...

69
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,150
And I'll slice open
the chests

70
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,610
Of every person
you love

71
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,780
And feed their hearts
to your dog.

72
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,870
Hmm?

73
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,240
Hmm.

74
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,920
Good girl.

75
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,420
I'm so glad we've come
to this understanding.

76
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,150
Let them go.

77
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,240
They're not
my prisoners, clarke.

78
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,200
Great. Then
here's the deal.

79
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,790
I'll use the key
to help you

80
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,420
But only after you
let my people return
to sanctum,

81
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,790
All of them.

82
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,590
You're free to go
with her.

83
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,800
Echo: we're not
going anywhere.

84
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,440
We have a war
to fight.

85
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,240
We're staying,
too, sir.

86
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,720
What did you
do to them?

87
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,430
Anders: we didn't
do anything.

88
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,600
They're simply committed
to the cause,

89
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,390
Ready to serve mankind
in the last war.

90
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,270
A moment that will
soon be upon us

91
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,640
Now that you're here

92
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,060
With the help
of the key.

93
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,860
So here's
the new deal.

94
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,940
We talk to our
friends alone.

95
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,650
I don't even want
to see your men
in the halls.

96
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,450
You want my help?
Earn it.

97
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,530
First disciple anders,
have all nonessential
personnel

98
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,160
Return to livsec.

99
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,750
Sir, I'm not sure
if that's--

100
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,120
Yes, my shepherd.

101
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,130
Good.

102
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,590
Your shepherd
stays here.

103
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,380
The rest of you out.

104
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,260
Now!

105
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,550
Miller: in other words,

106
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,430
Get the flock
out of here.

107
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,260
Go. I'll be fine.

108
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,490
Clarke: miller, put him
against the wall.

109
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,820
Miller: let's go.

110
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,040
Jordan:
I have questions.

111
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,200
Yeah. Get in line.

112
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,250
Echo, octavia,
and diyoza are
with them now?

113
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,090
Clarke: why the hell
do they think I have
the flame in my head?

114
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,670
That was for one day
over 100 years ago.

115
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,880
M-cap,
memory capture,

116
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,880
A device that's
able to pull
select memories

117
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,390
From one's mind.

118
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,050
They put octavia
in it.

119
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,970
And saw the flame
going into her head
in polis.

120
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,600
Amazing.

121
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,140
Wait. If they still think
it's in clark's head,

122
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,440
Then echo, octavia,
and diyoza never told
them it isn't, meaning--

123
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,650
Niylah: they're not
with them.

124
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,450
Ok. Niylah, gabriel,
jordan, you stay here,

125
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,570
Watch cadogan,
and hold this room.

126
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,660
If things go south,
we're gonna need
a way out.

127
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,580
Let's go find out
what the 3 most
dangerous women

128
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,870
On this or any
planet are up to.

129
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,670
Woman: moving day.
On your feet.

130
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,340
You're really gonna
let them send me
to penance?

131
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,560
Err! Aah!

132
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,680
Aah!

133
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,900
Aah!

134
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,440
Seeker diyoza,
you will never commit

135
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,230
To the cause if
you continue to--

136
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,860
Unh!

137
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,910
What? You didn't really
think I believe this garbage.

138
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,330
We're gonna kill them,
all of them.

139
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,500
You have a plan.

140
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,460
Took some convincing
to get our friend levitt
to help me,

141
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,000
But, yes,
I have a plan.

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,380
What can I do?

143
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,010
There's been
a complication.

144
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,970
Our people are here--

145
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,680
Clarke, raven, miller,
niylah, jordan.

146
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,770
The watches
are synched.

147
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,520
Put on the guard's
uniform and take this.

148
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
I'll give you exactly
one hour to get everyone

149
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,650
We care about
off this planet.

150
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,860
One hour, hope.

151
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,110
What if I can't?

152
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,950
Can't isn't an option.

153
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,360
You tell them if
they're still here

154
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,740
Then they die, too.

155
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,160
They'll want to know
how I'm doing this.

156
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,870
That's why I haven't
told you.

157
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,290
One hour.

158
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,710
Ok.

159
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,210
Madi!
Madi, are you here?

160
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,050
Are we sure this
is where she went?

161
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,340
It's the last place
she was seen.

162
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,220
Go search the perimeters.

163
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,680
I'll take the kitchen.
Emori, the basement.

164
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,100
Murphy.

165
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,510
I got upstairs.

166
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,650
Oh, god. Hey.

167
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,980
Madi, madi, madi,
stop.

168
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,520
It's ok. It's ok.
It's me.

169
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,980
Murphy?
Thank god.

170
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,440
Hey. Hey.

171
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,780
You're ok.
You're ok.

172
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,700
Guys, I got her!

173
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,700
Sheidheda--he--he's
alive. He's here.

174
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,660
Hey. Look at me.
You are safe now, ok?

175
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,500
Just sit down,
sit down, sit down.

176
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,460
Look at me, look at me

177
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,630
And breathe in through
your nose, all right,
with me like this.

178
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,180
One more time.

179
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,140
There you go.

180
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,600
Emori: madi.

181
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,030
See? We won't let
anything happen to you.

182
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,780
He's broadcasting
from the palace.

183
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,240
Murphy:
madi, come with us.

184
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,960
Indra: let's move.
We know where he is.

185
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,010
I gave you an order!

186
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,930
Keep madi safe.

187
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,850
Go get the bastard.

188
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,250
She must have been
important,

189
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,420
My callie, for her
language to survive
all this time.

190
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,930
Kalliope pramfleimkepa.

191
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,300
They say she was
brave, strong.

192
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,060
Legend has it
when she died, even
her enemies wept.

193
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,560
What does pram...

194
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,360
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

195
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,070
Gabriel: funny.
I remember you
differently.

196
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,490
How are you
still alive?

197
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,160
Cryogenics.

198
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,000
Plus a well-balanced diet.

199
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,460
Ah.

200
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,420
Yes.

201
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,260
Gabriel, right?

202
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,090
Anders said you
were like me--

203
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,930
Immortal, from earth,
worshipped by his people.

204
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,430
Uh, no. No.
Not like you.

205
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,100
I lost my way
for a time,

206
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,150
But I never actually
believed I was a god.

207
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,770
We're all gods, doctor,
and we're all

208
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,270
On a journey
to transcendence

209
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,030
Even if we took
different paths.

210
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,900
Now that sounds
like you.

211
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,360
I must say...

212
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,660
It is nice to talk
to someone from that time,

213
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,040
And, yes, I was
different then,

214
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,200
But a man learns a lot
as the centuries tick past,

215
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,750
Wouldn't you agree,
doctor?

216
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,080
Hmm. So what
have you learned?

217
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,250
Ah.

218
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,920
We found these logs

219
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,890
When we arrived,

220
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,850
Remnants from
the civilization

221
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,980
That lived here
before--the bardoans.

222
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,850
It took centuries.

223
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,610
We finally translated
the characters.

224
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,610
It's a story
not unlike our own,

225
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,650
But this is the part
I find most intriguing.

226
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,330
"The orb becomes
like a star,

227
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,160
"Challenging all
we have done

228
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,540
And all that we are."

229
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,790
Beautiful,
don't you think?

230
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,670
"Only then will
the last war begin.

231
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,470
"Make it past and cease
to be fallible.

232
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,260
"Transcend into greatness.

233
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,220
Evolve into more."

234
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,930
I like the rhyming part
better.

235
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,890
Gabriel: the bardoans
didn't record the code?

236
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,310
Oh, I wish it
were that easy.

237
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,860
That's why
you need clarke.

238
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,190
Yes. The ai
knows the code.

239
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,690
We enter it,

240
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,780
And our last war
begins.

241
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,740
Jordan: ridiculous.

242
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,540
We evolve to a higher level
through our lowest behavior?

243
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,410
The answer to all
this violence isn't

244
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,000
Just more violence.

245
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,500
Cadogan: the end
of violence,

246
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,290
The last war.

247
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,260
Every war seems like
the last one until the next.

248
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,720
You don't believe me?

249
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,850
Have at it.
It's all there.

250
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,390
In the meantime,

251
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,140
I'm famished.

252
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,770
Niylah: stop.
What are you doing?

253
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,270
Having lunch.

254
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,150
You're all welcome
to join me.

255
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,820
Gabriel: no, no, no.
If we shoot him, we
lose our leverage.

256
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,900
What do we do?
We can't leave here.

257
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,320
I'll bring him back
after lunch.

258
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,120
What the hell
is she thinking?

259
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,670
Oh, I get playing
good, little soldier
to stay alive,

260
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,670
But when somebody
hands you a one-way
ticket out of here,

261
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,210
You take it.

262
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,130
Will you
stop pacing?

263
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,630
We'll get to hope
before they take her
to penance.

264
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,760
How?

265
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,970
Octavia: whoa.

266
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,020
I'm so sorry,
octavia.

267
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,730
I know.

268
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,110
So am i.

269
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,530
No guards?

270
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,120
Raven: clarke
threatened not to help

271
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,120
With the flame if they
got in her way.

272
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,000
Thanks for playing
that one cards down,
by the way.

273
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,410
I thought it was
good leverage,

274
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,120
Knowing you would
eventually show up.

275
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,340
We're glad you did.

276
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,890
Just hug me back, miller.

277
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,190
Diyoza: wait!

278
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,730
She's not one
of them.

279
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,900
Clarke.

280
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,070
Raven.

281
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,530
Miller.

282
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,490
You described
them well.

283
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,830
Diyoza: this is hope,
my daughter.

284
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,120
Time dilation's
a bitch.

285
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,080
How'd you get out?

286
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,670
Doesn't matter.
Right now, we need to

287
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,090
Get ourselves
to the stone room

288
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,460
And get out of bardo.

289
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,550
We can get
acquainted later.

290
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,800
Let's go.

291
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,470
Hey. Where's echo?

292
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,970
She'll catch up.

293
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,020
Diyoza: she will, huh?
What's going on?

294
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,730
Hope.

295
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,690
She's getting revenge
for bellamy.

296
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,980
Talk now.

297
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,150
All I know is
that we have...

298
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,160
45 Minutes to get
you off this planet.

299
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,870
What happens
in 45 minutes?

300
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,540
I don't know.

301
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,250
Really. Levitt
helped her with something,

302
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,870
And she didn't tell me
what it was

303
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,420
Because she knew you'd
get it out of me

304
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,880
And try and stop her.

305
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,130
Octavia: levitt
wouldn't help her.

306
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,550
What did she
do to him?

307
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,800
-He's alive, ok?
-Let's move.

308
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,590
Aunty o.,
Where are you going?

309
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,220
To find levitt.

310
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,550
-Hope.
-Shh.

311
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,140
Someone could hear us.

312
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,060
How could you let
her do this?

313
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,520
Because I want her to.

314
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,640
They took everything
from me.

315
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,020
I know what it's like
to kill innocent people
for a cause,

316
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,940
And I promise you, it's
not gonna fill that hole
in your heart.

317
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,200
Only we can do that.

318
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,370
There are no
innocent people here.

319
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,570
Woman: liar.

320
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,370
Look at their eyes.
They hate us.

321
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,370
At least they're
alive to hate us.

322
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,210
Yeah. Sure. At least until
sheidheda and his army

323
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,420
Come back to finish
what he started.

324
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,050
No. Indra won't
let that happen.

325
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,300
No? Look. You saw
the faces of her guards

326
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,130
When he was speaking.

327
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,840
They were trikru,
loyal to her,

328
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,850
And he was still
getting to them.

329
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,310
Well, john, even if
he does take control,

330
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,600
These people aren't
a threat to him.

331
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,190
They will be.

332
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,980
When we were playing
chess, he made sure

333
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,440
To take my pawns
so they couldn't move

334
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,650
Across the board
to get promoted.

335
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,490
Taking out the faithful
before they can get
revenge will be

336
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,950
Right below madi
on his list

337
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,200
Of priorities,
all right?

338
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,040
I'm telling you,
these people
are in danger.

339
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,080
If you're right
and we help them,

340
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,000
Then so are we.

341
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,750
Yeah. I'm aware.

342
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,930
Come. Sit. I think
you'll enjoy this.

343
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,810
It's some things
from our time.

344
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,600
Not my time.

345
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,940
My, uh--my
mother's maybe.

346
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,770
Ho ho ho!

347
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,310
That was just mean.

348
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,320
It's hard to make me
feel older than I am,

349
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,610
But, uh, go ahead.

350
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,360
Just take a sip.

351
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,290
Heh. Kombucha.

352
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,830
It's wonderful,
isn't it?

353
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,460
It's good
for the gut, too.

354
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,790
It reminds you
of something.

355
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,750
Yeah. My grandmother
in colombia.

356
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,550
She made her own

357
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,470
Right before they cut
off her drinking water

358
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,100
So the rich could
water their lawns.

359
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,890
Then you
are self-made.

360
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,600
Hmm.
Me, too.

361
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,770
My first job was
flipping burgers,

362
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,020
Dreaming of the day
I'd escape.

363
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,650
Well, you certainly
did that.

364
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,480
That I did. I knew there
had to be something more

365
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,530
Than politics,
the dying ecosystem,

366
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,860
The memes.

367
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,910
Earth was
pretty terrible.

368
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,950
It got worse
after you left.

369
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,000
Good for the cult
business, though,
am I right?

370
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,830
Hmm. Heh.

371
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,540
We weren't a cult...

372
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,840
But being right is
always good for business.

373
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,510
Look. I don't mean
to be rude,

374
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,760
But, uh, as I said,

375
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,390
I have some experience
with people

376
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,010
Claiming to be gods.

377
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,350
Hmm. I don't claim that.

378
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,440
In fact, I don't
even believe in god.

379
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,980
I do, however, believe
that I was chosen

380
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,900
Mm-hmm.

381
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,200
By whom if not god?

382
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,320
We'll find out
when we win the war.

383
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,780
What if you lose?

384
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,790
We...won't.

385
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,790
"For all mankind."
Is that it?

386
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,540
Damn right.

387
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,960
You can thank me
when we save you,

388
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,500
Or you can join us.

389
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,300
Join your war to
save the human race

390
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,390
By renouncing everything
that makes me human?

391
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,480
Love, family--
those are the things
that connect us.

392
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,980
We're not just dna.
We're emotion.

393
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,480
Without that, what
are you fighting for?

394
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,190
Let me ask you
something, doctor.

395
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,740
Have you ever done
anything you regret

396
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,830
In the name of love?

397
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,660
I'll take that
as a yes.

398
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,000
The point is,
we all have.

399
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,960
We all fight
for our families,
our countries.

400
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,550
We do whatever
we have to

401
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,050
So that our side
can survive,

402
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,090
And when someone
you love...

403
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,100
Betrays you...

404
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,350
Well, that is
the worst pain there is.

405
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,020
We have none
of that here.

406
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,320
With all--ahem--
due respect,

407
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,120
You can't fight
a war for the soul

408
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,830
Of the human race
with an inhuman army.

409
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:16,500
Who says we can't?
I mean, this life,

410
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,290
It doesn't matter,

411
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,670
Even lives
as long as ours.

412
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,420
What matters is...
What comes next.

413
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,090
We're about to find out
what that is.

414
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,510
The answers that we've
both been seeking
for so long,

415
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,470
They're finally
within our grasp.

416
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,650
Isn't that worth
a little sacrifice?

417
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,990
Anders: sir,
I need a moment.

418
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,030
Thank you
for your company.

419
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,080
Please escort dr. Santiago
back to his friends.

420
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,680
What is it?

421
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,060
We have a problem.

422
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,400
Levitt.

423
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,650
-Hey.
-Ohh!

424
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,400
What happened?

425
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,780
I failed.

426
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,200
She killed two people
in front of me,

427
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,570
And...i broke.

428
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,500
Wait. Not yet.

429
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,620
We need to find out
what echo's planning.

430
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,670
The key has landed.

431
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,550
Octavia: what did
echo make you do?

432
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,930
I helped her get it.

433
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,640
Gem9.

434
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,100
Miller: gem9?
Diyoza: a bioweapon.

435
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,730
It's the reason
the species that was

436
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,230
Here before they arrived
isn't here now.

437
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,810
How's she
deploying it?

438
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,650
Central humidification
system, the machine level.

439
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,160
I told her how.
I'm so sorry.

440
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,120
Raven: so I'm guessing
it spreads through water.

441
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,450
Humidification would
make it airborne.

442
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,000
Raven reyes.
Of course you'd know that.

443
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,540
Clarke: airborne means
it's a suicide mission.

444
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,000
No, no, not
necessarily.

445
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,710
It will take time
for the compound

446
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,340
To go from its entry point
to the vents.

447
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,760
Echo will make a run
for the stone room.

448
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,590
Which is what
we should do.

449
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,180
She gave me an hour
to get you all out.

450
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,550
We still got time.

451
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,100
That means we can
still stop her.

452
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
Untie me, please,
so I can get help.

453
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,350
Hope: aunty o.,
They will kill her.

454
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,940
She'll kill us all.

455
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,160
-No.
-I'm sorry.

456
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,540
octavia! Octavia!

457
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,620
Help!

458
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,130
Niylah: what are the odds
everything works out

459
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:13,170
And we just walk
out of here?

460
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,640
That's what I thought.

461
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,010
Oh, my god.

462
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,310
-What?
-Maybe it's structured

463
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,930
Like korean.

464
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,310
What?

465
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,690
My dad's father
was korean.

466
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,940
He taught me
the language,

467
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,610
What he knew of it,
anyway.

468
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,570
I didn't want to learn
it at first.

469
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,240
It looked like there
would be thousands
of characters to study.

470
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,200
But there weren't?

471
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,240
No. That's not
how korean works.

472
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,330
It uses an alphabet,
same as english,

473
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,160
Just with the letters
stacked into blocks
of syllables,

474
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:48,580
Blocks that are
easy to mistake
as characters.

475
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,170
You think cadogan didn't
decode the text right?

476
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:56,010
I think it's
possible. Look.

477
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,180
What if each
of these strokes

478
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,220
Is just a letter?

479
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,350
They could have
the whole language
completely wrong.

480
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,970
Well, maybe not
the whole thing

481
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,730
But multiple word phrases
like "last war."

482
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,730
Now it just sounds like
you're trying to find proof

483
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,810
To support what you
want to believe.

484
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,440
How is that any different
than what they're doing?

485
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,280
We all see what
we want to see.

486
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,360
If you're looking
for the wrong answer,

487
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,990
It's easy to miss
the right one.

488
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:24,330
Come on. Look at what's
written about unlocking
the stone.

489
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,040
There's no mention
about violence or pain,

490
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,590
Just...preparation,
judgment.

491
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:38,840
-Like a test.
-Exactly. Like a test.

492
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,640
It would make sense.

493
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:47,100
Niylah: where's
cadogan or the gun
you took?

494
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,980
Yeah. The look on anders' face
made it clear

495
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,770
That neither would be
coming back with me.

496
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,900
What did I miss?

497
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,490
Not much. Just...

498
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,740
That I'm a genius.

499
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,830
Jordan has a theory.

500
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,290
That they got it wrong.

501
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,160
The last war isn't
a war at all.

502
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,000
-If I'm right...
-And that's a big if.

503
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,500
Then it's a test.

504
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,460
Now, I'm just
guessing here

505
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,000
But probably to be
taken by whoever
enters the code.

506
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,470
One individual representing
a whole species.

507
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,380
No pressure there.

508
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,550
You got to admit
it makes more sense
than a war.

509
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,760
Should we tell them?

510
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,220
No. No, no, no. No way.

511
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,190
If there is a test
to decide the fate

512
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,690
Of the human race,
bill cadogan should not be

513
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,310
The one to take it.

514
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,610
Come.

515
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,190
Show me what you--
what you mean.

516
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:44,030
Ok. My father's side
of the family was korean.

517
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,330
Now, if you look at these...

518
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:53,170
He's not here, either.

519
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,960
We should enlist the help
of the other clans.

520
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,920
We can't trust
the other clans.

521
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,880
Now move out.
There are other
rooms to--

522
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,850
He's reciting
the lineage.

523
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,160
Now that that's out of the way,

524
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:32,790
I--malachi kom sangedakru,
the last true commander--

525
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:37,340
Vow to honor and defend
our traditions

526
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,840
And my people,

527
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,180
But first, you must prove
that you are my people

528
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,720
By bending the knee.

529
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,310
It's quite simple, really.

530
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,140
If you don't kneel,

531
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,480
You die.

532
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,540
Your path
to the throne

533
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,210
Leads through me.

534
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,790
You say you honor
our traditions,

535
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,670
So honor this one.

536
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,260
I was hoping
you'd say that.

537
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,820
New look for me.

538
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,190
I'm flattered.

539
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,860
Mine's nice, too,
don't you think?

540
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,160
Raah!

541
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,240
Thank you, indra,
for giving me

542
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,910
Exactly
what I wanted--

543
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,750
A chance to return
to the old ways,

544
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,040
My ways.

545
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,290
we'll see.

546
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,130
Huh!

547
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,550
Agh!

548
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,350
Hyah!

549
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,230
Yah!

550
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,320
Arr, aah, arr!

551
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,040
You looking for this?

552
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
Hyah!

553
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,960
Indra: get out
of the way!

554
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,920
Get out of the way!

555
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,840
Aah! Aah!

556
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,050
-Agh!
-Hyah!

557
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,520
Unh!

558
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,400
Kneel or die.

559
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,820
I won't let you
take my people.

560
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,240
Unh.

561
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,620
Die it is.

562
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,750
Raah!

563
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,170
Aah!

564
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,500
Ohh!

565
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,130
Aah!

566
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,010
Aah!

567
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,850
Stop!

568
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:47,230
Spare her life.

569
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,530
I will kneel.

570
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,080
Ahh. Ahh.

571
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,410
Uh-huh.

572
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,610
Ohh.

573
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,930
Err.

574
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,910
Ahh.

575
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,360
-No, heda.
-Ahh.

576
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,880
You were right, then.
Sheidheda won.

577
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,890
We're safe in here,
all right?

578
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,730
The reactor door
is sealed.

579
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,270
No one can get to us.

580
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,860
So, what now?

581
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,240
That's tomorrow's
problem.

582
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,740
Today, we survive,
all of us.

583
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,910
Don't look now, john,

584
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:47,000
But I think you just
might be someone
worth believing in.

585
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,550
Raven: echo, no!

586
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,590
Stop!

587
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,390
You were supposed
to get them out.

588
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,850
Octavia: it's not her fault.
We wouldn't leave

589
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,220
Without you, echo.

590
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,270
You don't
have to do this.

591
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,980
I get it. Everything
they took from you

592
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,440
They took
from me, too,

593
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,150
But there are
good people here.

594
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,730
Who? Levitt?

595
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,240
The man who stole
your memories

596
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,780
And gave them
to the enemy?

597
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,240
All of this happened
because of him.

598
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,330
Way to honor
your brother's memory.

599
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:11,330
Echo, this is
not who you are.

600
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,380
I know you think
this is the right
thing to do,

601
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,500
But--trust me--
it's not.

602
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,380
There's always
another way.

603
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,470
Grief is something
we can learn
to live with,

604
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,840
But once you make
a choice like this,

605
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,470
It stays with you.

606
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,930
This is nothing like
the choices you make, clarke.

607
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:33,640
You take lives
to save the people you love.

608
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,480
This is vengeance
pure and simple.

609
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,240
Clarke: echo, stop.

610
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,280
This is not what
bellamy would
have wanted.

611
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,820
Echo: you have no idea
what bellamy wanted!

612
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,700
If they killed me or you
or you, octavia,

613
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,040
He would be standing
right where I am.

614
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,540
Raven: I don't
think so.

615
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,040
Stay back!

616
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,050
The bellamy who helped
massacre a sleeping army

617
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,130
That was sent
to protect us

618
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,760
Maybe he might
be there,

619
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,180
But not the man we spent
6 years on the ring with,

620
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,060
Not the man you
fell in love with.

621
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,600
Echo, you're my sister,

622
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,480
And my sister
wouldn't do this.

623
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,950
You're wrong.

624
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,160
I'm not leaving, echo.

625
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,080
If you drop that,

626
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,420
I am staying right here.

627
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,250
You will have
to kill me, too.

628
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,930
Aah!

629
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:53,020
Hey, hey, hey.

630
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,180
It's ok.

631
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,150
It's ok. It's ok.
We're here now.

632
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:06,860
Come on.
Let's take you home, ok?

633
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,070
We're gonna go home.

634
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,910
Anders: good choice.

635
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,620
Clarke: we had a deal.
I told cadogan

636
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,290
If I saw any of you,
I wouldn't help him.

637
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,460
Anders: that was before
we knew that one of you

638
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,710
Killed 3 more of us,
torturing another

639
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,420
Just to get him
to give you a weapon

640
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:27,340
With which
to commit genocide.

641
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,800
The man makes
a good point.

642
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,680
Let's call it even.

643
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,270
Even? I just told you
3 disciples are dead.

644
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,730
You people disgust me.

645
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,480
Look at yourselves.

646
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,740
Raised in the wild.

647
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,320
You're nothing
but primal beasts

648
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,620
Utterly in thrall
to your feelings,

649
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,620
Prioritizing
the want of self

650
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,750
Over the need
of all others.

651
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,330
You don't deserve
the shepherd's mercy.

652
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,290
Miller: brave words
coming from a man

653
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:05,800
Standing alone
in front of a pack
of armed beasts.

654
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,220
Diyoza: he's not alone.
Anders: smart girl.

655
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,470
Diyoza: probably
not a good idea
to fire lasers

656
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,180
In a room
with a wmd.

657
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:20,350
Let's get back to
the shepherd's mercy.

658
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,360
Echo will be sent
to penance for 20 years,

659
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,360
But she'll be back
before you know it

660
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,900
Unless by then the code
hasn't been entered

661
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,400
To begin the last war

662
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,570
In which case,
she dies there.

663
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,240
Hope: I have a better idea.

664
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,740
You die here.

665
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,910
Hope, no!

666
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,330
Unh!

667
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,320
Hope: no, mom!
Diyoza: get her out of here!

668
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,280
Hope: no! No!
Octavia: hope, it's too late!

669
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,200
Hope: no. No, mom! No!

670
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,330
Go!

671
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,040
What are you all
waiting for?

672
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,540
Move! Go!

673
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,880
Mom, I'm sorry!

674
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,710
Hope, we have
no choice.

675
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:31,380
I cannot lose her,
not--not again!

676
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,510
Don't waste this,
little one!

677
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:37,050
Be better than me.

678
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,560
Octavia: get the door!

679
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:47,150
Mom! Mom!

680
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,480
Aah! No!

680
00:41:50,305 --> 00:42:50,673

1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:01,265
Previously on "The 100"...

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,631
I don't know what it means.
I just know I have to go.

3
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:05,711
If you go in there, you'll die!

4
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:07,425
Diyoza, wait!

5
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,178
Octavia called you Hope,

6
00:00:10,203 --> 00:00:12,369
the name Diyoza chose
for her unborn child.

7
00:00:12,505 --> 00:00:13,946
They're taking Bellamy through,

8
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,287
and they don't want us to follow.

9
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:16,521
We go through together.

10
00:00:16,546 --> 00:00:17,701
If we're even seconds apart,

11
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,108
we could be separated by months. OK?

12

13
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:52,180
Diyoza!

14
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:53,804
Diyoza, I'm coming!

15
00:01:58,177 --> 00:02:00,544
Do it! Make it move already!

16
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:08,899
Ohh. Look who's here.

17
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,323
What happened? Are you...

18
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:14,881
No. It's too soon.

19
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:16,393
You said you were only 6 months.

20
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:18,351
I've been here for 3.

21
00:02:19,632 --> 00:02:21,432
What took you so long?

22
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:23,706
I was right behind you.

23
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:31,175
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:34,589
You have no idea how
happy I am you're here.

25
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:37,248
I thought I was gonna
have to do this all alone.

26
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:40,100
- No.
- Now pull this little spud out,

27
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:43,294
and the 3 of us can
watch the sunset together.

28
00:02:44,657 --> 00:02:46,857
Ooh.

29
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,307
OK. You can do this. Just look at me

30
00:02:50,332 --> 00:02:52,406
and think of someplace else,

31
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:53,731
a place where you're happy.

32
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,643
Oh, not a lot of choices there.

33
00:02:55,668 --> 00:02:57,534
Come on. You can think of someplace.

34
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,203
I think I'm gonna pass out.

35
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:01,482
- No way.
- We're doing this together.

36
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:03,173
- Just look at me...
- Mm-hmm.

37
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:06,691
And... breathe.

38
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,324
Let it go.

39
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:11,191
I'm thinking of someplace.

40
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:13,153
Good. That's good for you.

41
00:03:13,177 --> 00:03:15,068
Someplace... I want to push!

42
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:18,474
Oh, God. It's happening. It's happening.

43
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:20,824
OK.

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,660
Come on. One big one. Let's go.

45
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,100
Yeah. Good. She's coming!

46
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:28,756
Good. OK. One more!

47
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:29,920
Come on.

48
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,272
Yes! Ohh! Oh, my...

49
00:03:37,276 --> 00:03:39,209
There she comes.

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,915
Oh, Diyoza. She's here. She's here.

51
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:49,119
Ohh. This is Octavia, my friend.

52
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:54,958
Diyoza?

53
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:06,314
Oh, God.

54
00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:12,443
Here. Here.

55
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,133
It worked. It worked.

56
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:23,491
Just like me.

57
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:27,601
Thank you, Bell.

58
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:25,348
Welcome to Skyring.

59
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:27,278
Creative.

60
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:28,349
I named it when I was 3.

61
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:30,506
What do you expect?

62
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:32,456
She remembers.

63
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:45,269
My gun... I lost it coming through.

64
00:05:45,404 --> 00:05:47,404
Let's hope you don't need it.

65
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:50,144
Hope, slow down. Where are you going?

66
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:56,213
What is this place?

67
00:05:56,348 --> 00:05:57,648
Did you live here?

68
00:05:57,783 --> 00:05:59,283
Octavia said you were smart.

69
00:06:13,313 --> 00:06:14,545
Where is it?

70
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:27,190
Hope, what are you doing?

71
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:28,714
Interesting taste in toys.

72
00:06:29,048 --> 00:06:30,447
That's not mine.

73
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,149
Is this your house, or isn't it?

74
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:35,586
I was with you on
Sanctum for, what, a day?

75
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:36,841
Given the time differential,

76
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:38,880
I haven't been here
for hundreds of years.

77
00:06:38,905 --> 00:06:40,171
It's incredible.

78
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:42,169
Enough! We need answers,

79
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,428
starting with where the hell is Bellamy?

80
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:46,396
Once they got here, they used the bridge

81
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,232
to take him to Bardo.

82
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,600
- Bardo?
- They?

83
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:52,469
Yes. The next stop.

84
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:54,410
They are the disciples,

85
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:56,340
the guys that were
chasing us in the woods.

86
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:59,129
Anders said if I tagged Octavia,

87
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:00,618
they would let my mother live.

88
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:01,842
And Anders is?

89
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:06,529
Head of the disciples.

90
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:10,106
Now. I'm gonna go to Bardo

91
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:12,523
and make sure he kept his word.

92
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:13,850
Hey!

93
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:19,296
You traded Diyoza's life for Octavia's?

94
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:23,100
No. I was not trying
to kill her. I told you.

95
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,768
It was a locator tag.

96
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,204
I didn't have a choice. She understood.

97
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:28,839
- She understood?
- Yes.

98
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:32,075
My mother, my responsibility.

99
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:33,844
You said they used the bridge.

100
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:36,246
Well, I'm assuming that's
what we call the Anomaly,

101
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:39,049
a bridge between worlds.

102
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:41,685
Is there a way to control it here, too?

103
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,522
Yes. She's standing on it.

104
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:14,418
I don't believe it.

105
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:18,165
I used to play down here as a kid.

106
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:20,695
Little did I know it was
a bridge to the stars.

107
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:24,383
"C.B."

108
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:26,118
So how do we get to Bardo?

109
00:08:26,254 --> 00:08:28,221
"Trust Bellamy."

110
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,034
Of course. You have the code.

111
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,026
A friend on the inside gave it to me.

112
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:37,096
No, no, no.

113
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,042
The code, it's washed away.

114
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,366
We're not going anywhere.

115
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,226
Shh.

116
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:57,961
Work with me.

117
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:02,388
Here.

118
00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:06,051
How'd Bellamy do this?

119
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,308
Oh, God.

120
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,957
Looks like she figured out that milk

121
00:09:12,982 --> 00:09:14,778
doesn't come from a pinky.

122
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:16,870
Should you be walking around?

123
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:20,163
Well, I just squeezed something
the size of a watermelon

124
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:23,453
out of something the size of a grape.

125
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:27,513
I'll survive. Hi.

126
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:31,385
Hello, little person.

127
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:35,442
Sorry mama conked out on you back there.

128
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,035
It'll never happen again.

129
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:43,173
How did this happen?

130
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:44,901
I left seconds after you

131
00:09:44,926 --> 00:09:48,345
but got here months later. Explain.

132
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:51,181
Do I look like Einstein to you?

133
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:52,840
Near as I can figure

134
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:55,411
time between here and
Sanctum doesn't square up.

135
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:57,495
The good news is you
can be here for years,

136
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,664
and no one would miss you.

137
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:02,336
I mean, no one would
miss you anyway, so...

138
00:10:02,361 --> 00:10:03,827
Thanks, and the bad news is?

139
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:06,129
The bad news is there's no way off.

140
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:12,352
On second thought, there's no bad news.

141
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:14,824
Look at this place.

142
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:19,042
I've had time to scout.

143
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:21,812
As far as I can tell,
there are no threats.

144
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:25,944
There's plenty of food,
water, we have shelter.

145
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:30,128
When you told me to think of
someplace that makes me happy,

146
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:31,616
it's here.

147
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:35,192
That's why the Anomaly called us.

148
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:37,721
Thank God we didn't cut
your arm off, by the way.

149
00:10:45,816 --> 00:10:47,949
I can't stay here.

150
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:51,452
Where are you going?

151
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:53,176
To the Anomaly.

152
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:55,178
Where do you think?

153
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:58,415
Trust me when I tell you it is too deep.

154
00:10:58,776 --> 00:11:00,526
The dive will kill you.

155
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:04,521
How long did you expect us to stay?

156
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:06,667
What is it about Bellamy that has

157
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:09,426
otherwise sensible women
willing to die for him?

158
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:15,691
Octavia tried for 6 years
to get back to her brother.

159
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:19,113
You were here for 6 years?

160
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:22,644
I was here for 20 years.

161
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:25,008
She was here for 10,

162
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:27,273
6 of them spent trying
to reach the pretty light

163
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:28,876
at the bottom of the lake.

164
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:32,133
Hey. I think I can read this.

165
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:34,785
Let's hope you learn faster.

166
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:42,798
Once it dries, I'll use the charcoal

167
00:11:42,823 --> 00:11:44,963
to bring out the
indentations in the paper.

168
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:48,265
Now tell me about the code.

169
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,634
Told you. It operates the bridge.

170
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:53,126
Right. Like the, uh,
one on Octavia's back.

171
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:55,272
No. That was for me.

172
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:56,713
From what I gather,

173
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:59,699
every mind has its own unique code.

174
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:02,022
They call it a... a biometric...

175
00:12:02,047 --> 00:12:05,683
Signature. Heh. A
consciousness code. Of course.

176
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,392
When you put mine in on
Sanctum, you pulled me over.

177
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,453
And sent Octavia to the other side.

178
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:12,366
No. I did that.

179
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:14,157
You can pull someone through

180
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:16,537
by entering in their
code, or you can tag them

181
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,517
with a tracker.

182
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:20,330
It's got to be in deep,

183
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:21,889
or they could end up inside out

184
00:12:21,914 --> 00:12:23,947
or something.

185
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:27,103
- That's why you stabbed her.
- Yeah.

186
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:28,939
Tell me the truth.

187
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:31,241
Did you know they were
taking Bellamy, too?

188
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:34,454
No. Of course not.
No. Octavia loves him.

189
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:37,052
I made a deal to save my mother.

190
00:12:37,077 --> 00:12:39,099
The plan was for me to jump back in,

191
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:41,770
rescue her and Aunty O,

192
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,286
and kill anyone who got in my way.

193
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:44,855
Oh. So you're a killer, are you?

194
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,860
You got training, I'll give you that,

195
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:48,325
but you're no killer.

196
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,727
Don't worry. I'm here now,

197
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:53,892
and if they have Bellamy, then
kill them all sounds about right.

198
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:56,166
We'd have to get there for that,

199
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:58,928
and we are not going anywhere,

200
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:02,036
not with this anyway.

201
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,332
Looks like we're swimming
to the Anomaly after all.

202
00:13:05,357 --> 00:13:07,354
I told you. It's not an anomaly.

203
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:10,410
It's a bridge, a transit system.

204
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:12,480
The one on Sanctum leads here,

205
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,425
and the one under the
lake leads to Bardo.

206
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,553
The stones are connected.

207
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:18,722
Each one must have a unique code.

208
00:13:18,857 --> 00:13:20,636
Glad that's exciting for you,

209
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:23,199
but we're still stuck here.

210
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:28,198
It's warm.

211
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:36,143
There's someone here.

212
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:39,567
Bellamy?

213
00:13:39,592 --> 00:13:41,259
I told you. He's not here.

214
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:47,099
Get out of my house!

215
00:13:53,926 --> 00:13:57,318
Hope, I'm sorry. I'll come back for you!

216
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:04,435
He called the doll Hope.

217
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,305
The numbers on his
arm were counting down.

218
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,541
It's how long he's a prisoner here.

219
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:13,253
5 years.

220
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,513
That is how long I expect us to stay.

221
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,180
You said prisoners.

222
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:27,159
- You don't mean this is a prison?
- I did mean.

223
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:30,706
Skyring is the place where they
send people to atone for their sins.

224
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:34,456
OK. This garden is one of his.

225
00:14:34,592 --> 00:14:35,772
We have to start planting soon

226
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:37,284
if we want to harvest before winter.

227
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,508
Come on. We need to find him.

228
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:40,842
Slow down!

229
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:42,530
What are you talking about?

230
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:43,836
From the looks of our new friend,

231
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,641
he's surviving on jellies alone.

232
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:47,743
Eating like that, he
won't make it 5 years,

233
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:49,352
and we need him to.

234
00:14:49,377 --> 00:14:51,807
- Why?
- Because he's our way to Bardo.

235
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:53,652
When the timer on his arm hits zero,

236
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:55,711
the disciples come for him.

237
00:14:55,846 --> 00:14:57,457
Right, and you think
they'll take us, too?

238
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,514
Of course not.

239
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,185
No. We kill them, take their suits,

240
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,750
jump to Bardo.

241
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:06,298
There she goes talking
about killing again.

242
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,704
What is the matter? Are you afraid?

243
00:15:09,393 --> 00:15:11,229
You know, Octavia might
not have liked you,

244
00:15:11,254 --> 00:15:12,504
but she did say you were brave.

245
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:13,763
You have to be out of your mind

246
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,661
if you think I'm waiting 5 years.

247
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:20,631
Funny. She said that, too.

248
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:49,980
120.

249
00:15:57,876 --> 00:16:00,295
I was under for 120 seconds,

250
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,628
and it's still not long enough.

251
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:03,619
- Shh. Hope just fell asleep.
- Sorry.

252
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:06,592
Maybe if I used heavier
rocks to pull me down faster.

253
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:08,701
Do that, and you'll be too
far down to come back up

254
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:10,162
when survival instincts kick in.

255
00:16:10,187 --> 00:16:11,345
During my SEALs training...

256
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,499
No more stories about SEALs training.

257
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:14,884
I'm at 2 minutes.

258
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:16,725
If I get to 3, I'll be at the glow.

259
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,650
Holding your breath is
not the hardest part.

260
00:16:18,684 --> 00:16:20,050
Ohh. Here we go.

261
00:16:20,075 --> 00:16:22,812
The 20 meters, if you
don't equalize right,

262
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:24,209
your eardrums burst.

263
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,902
Go deeper, an untrained diver like you,

264
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:29,405
blood vessels burst in your trachea,

265
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,509
your lungs fill with fluid.

266
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:32,133
I mean, you might make
it to the other side,

267
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,523
but you just won't know it.

268
00:16:35,713 --> 00:16:37,112
3 years.

269
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,604
Every day you try it,
and every day you fail.

270
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:41,796
It'd be boring if it
wasn't so depressing.

271
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:49,658
This is our life now.
Stop torturing yourself...

272
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:51,193
And me.

273
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,884
Yesterday, Hope came up
with a name for the planet,

274
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,521
but guess who was
underwater when she did.

275
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:10,581
So what's our planet called?

276
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:13,382
Skyring.

277
00:17:16,024 --> 00:17:17,490
Of course it is.

278
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:35,537
Not bad for a prison.

279
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:37,547
Nah. Isolation is the prison,

280
00:17:37,572 --> 00:17:39,406
like... like solitary.

281
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,376
Now depending on the time dilation

282
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:42,978
relative to Bardo, you could serve

283
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:44,823
a 20-year-sentence here on a weekend.

284
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:47,708
It's efficient.

285
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:50,352
I take it you've dealt
with these prisoners before.

286
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:53,021
- One, yes.
- Dangerous?

287
00:17:53,046 --> 00:17:54,205
It depends.

288
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,170
Everyone on Bardo is
raised to be a disciple.

289
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,481
Every single one of them is a warrior,

290
00:17:58,506 --> 00:18:01,091
not like the flower
children who worshiped you.

291
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:06,275
Fortunately, they send people here

292
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,336
who aren't pulling their own weight,

293
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:10,572
not devout enough,

294
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:12,462
not strong enough.

295
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:18,046
If everything I've heard
about you two is true,

296
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,112
we can take him.

297
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:23,718
All right. Be quiet. We're close.

298
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:31,837
Who taught you how to track?

299
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,830
The girl you stabbed
and kicked over a cliff.

300
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:37,098
It's a little more
complicated than that.

301
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:38,500
Sounds like a good story.

302
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:40,792
You just heard it.

303
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,238
The spy stabbed her boyfriend's sister

304
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,440
and kicked her over a cliff.

305
00:18:49,414 --> 00:18:50,880
He went through here.

306
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:56,146
I liked you better without a memory.

307
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:11,333
What is this?

308
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,413
I have no idea.

309
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:18,329
Looks like he dug up the
dead so he could have company.

310
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:23,546
Dev.

311
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:27,048
Leave us alone!

312
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,585
I didn't invite them here, I swear it.

313
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:32,397
I didn't invite you.

314
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,973
Isolation madness.

315
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:36,265
Broke into our house.
I tried to save Hope.

316
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,660
I tried, but I couldn't.

317
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:40,495
I'm sorry. I'm...

318
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,105
- Hey. I'm Hope.
- I'm sorry.

319
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:49,615
I grew up here.

320
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:53,675
- Wait.
- No, no, no.

321
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,392
Damn it. I told you we need him.

322
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:57,683
Maybe we don't.

323
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:05,520
C-o-l. Colonel? Military?

324
00:20:05,766 --> 00:20:09,167
Colin, last name Benson. C.B.

325
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:11,646
It was on the wall near the stone.

326
00:20:26,387 --> 00:20:30,222
A mind drive? How?

327
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:31,713
Eligius III was here.

328
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:39,684
We're on planet Beta.

329
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,427
Skyring's better.

330
00:20:48,962 --> 00:20:51,434
Everyone on the Eligius mission got one.

331
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,759
Becca Franko designed the mind...

332
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:56,928
I mean, memory drives to
be a data retrieval system

333
00:20:56,953 --> 00:20:59,155
so the mothership crew could determine

334
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,984
what happened if they returned
to find a mission team dead,

335
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:05,759
you know, like a... like
a airplane black box.

336
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:08,848
Russell and I
reverse-engineered their tech

337
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:11,310
to hold an entire mind.

338
00:21:11,446 --> 00:21:13,637
Wait. That'll play his memories?

339
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:16,315
Yeah.

340
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,074
Josephine?

341
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,831
Yeah.

342
00:21:24,092 --> 00:21:26,092
I needed to make sure
she was really gone.

343
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:36,035
Just... just wait. It's
repairing corrupted data.

344
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:40,506
So what are the odds that Eligius III

345
00:21:40,531 --> 00:21:43,619
randomly chose two planets
connected by Anomaly stones?

346
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:46,584
Long. I'd say it suggests

347
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,982
that the people on Bardo
descend from Eligius, as well,

348
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,576
and if I'm right, it
could mean that the species

349
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:56,756
that created the stones thousands,
perhaps millions of years ago,

350
00:21:57,077 --> 00:21:59,525
were looking for a new home, too.

351
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:02,021
I mean, think about it, right?

352
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:04,887
No need for spaceships or... or cryo

353
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:07,099
or mind drives.

354
00:22:07,622 --> 00:22:10,069
You could explore an entire universe.

355
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:14,562
Not to point out the obvious,

356
00:22:14,587 --> 00:22:16,140
but if your friend here figured out

357
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:18,319
how to operate the stone,
he'd have used it to leave.

358
00:22:18,344 --> 00:22:20,446
He wouldn't be here
playing chess with the dead.

359
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:21,516
Heh heh. No, no, no.

360
00:22:21,652 --> 00:22:25,161
Colin was a quantum physicist,
a fields medal winner.

361
00:22:25,186 --> 00:22:26,819
If anyone could figure out how to...

362
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:29,565
Dr. Benson, blink if you can hear me.

363
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,423
Dr. Benson.

364
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:33,000
Becca?

365
00:22:34,907 --> 00:22:36,606
God, I had a crush on her.

366
00:22:36,741 --> 00:22:38,741
The procedure was a success.

367
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:40,499
We'll remove the
breathing tube in a moment.

368
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:42,478
How do you feel?

369
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:46,705
Good. The implant will start
collecting your memory now.

370
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:48,059
If you die out there,

371
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:50,435
my face will be the first
that the follow team sees.

372
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:55,914
I envy you. You are going
on the greatest adventure

373
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:59,061
in the history of history.

374
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,823
Lightbourne, the pompous ass, thinks

375
00:23:00,848 --> 00:23:02,090
that Alpha is the one.

376
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:04,259
He's afraid that Beta's
too far from the black hole

377
00:23:04,284 --> 00:23:06,657
relative to the others,
but if you ask me,

378
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:09,528
time dilation is sexy as hell.

379
00:23:09,664 --> 00:23:12,665
You'll get to the future faster.

380
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,867
Don't go anywhere.

381
00:23:15,114 --> 00:23:17,503
The black hole. Of course.

382
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,206
That's why time is so accelerated here.

383
00:23:20,247 --> 00:23:21,978
- Can you fast forward.
- Just quiet.

384
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:24,288
You'll be here in post-op
for another hour or so

385
00:23:24,312 --> 00:23:26,178
until you're through recovery.

386
00:23:26,424 --> 00:23:28,991
This is gonna take a while.

387
00:23:29,218 --> 00:23:32,151
That guy out there is gonna come home.

388
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:35,117
Unless we want to wind up as
guests at his picnic, I think...

389
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:37,437
- I'll take the first watch.
- Yeah.

390
00:23:38,492 --> 00:23:40,214
You should be able to
start to drink water

391
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:41,838
in about an hour or so.

392
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:44,207
Don't be concerned if you still...

393
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:47,099
Nice work. Go grab me a shovel.

394
00:23:56,891 --> 00:23:59,858
So remember, only 3 seeds per hole.

395
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:02,433
Copy that. 3. Can I bury them?

396
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,577
Mm-hmm.

397
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:05,969
New plot is looking good.

398
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:08,220
I want those tomatoes.

399
00:24:13,694 --> 00:24:16,729
Hey. Who's hungry?

400
00:24:16,864 --> 00:24:19,720
Let me guess. We're vegan again.

401
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:20,926
Only if you're not in the mood

402
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,449
for my jellyfish étouffée.

403
00:24:22,904 --> 00:24:25,004
- Jellyfish and chips.
- Yes.

404
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:27,820
I got that beat. Peanut
butter and jellyfish.

405
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,178
Jellyfish pot pie it is.

406
00:24:33,314 --> 00:24:35,714
Come on. Earth skills before dinner.

407
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,817
Aunty O's gonna teach you how to sew.

408
00:24:38,953 --> 00:24:40,132
I'll be right behind you.

409
00:24:40,157 --> 00:24:42,000
Just finishing up with my rows.

410
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:45,591
Mom, I want to stay and
help Aunty O with the garden.

411
00:24:45,726 --> 00:24:46,992
That's what I like to hear.

412
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:48,808
Teamwork makes the dream work.

413
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,129
That's right.

414
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,275
OK.

415
00:24:57,571 --> 00:24:59,618
Hey. What are you doing?

416
00:24:59,643 --> 00:25:01,440
She'll hear you.

417
00:25:01,684 --> 00:25:05,356
I'm training so I can
help you save your brother.

418
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:09,348
My brother doesn't
even know I'm gone yet.

419
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,500
6 years for us is, like, a
blink of an eye where he is.

420
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:15,854
That means we have time
for you to make me like you.

421
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:23,268
Ow!

422
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:31,130
Ooh! What is it?

423
00:25:34,412 --> 00:25:36,612
I don't know. It looks...

424
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,859
Hope!

425
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:41,844
Diyoza, she shouldn't be out here.

426
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:46,007
Go inside now.

427
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,687
This isn't the first time
something was planted here.

428
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:53,997
Help me get him out of here.

429
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:56,335
Hey. Easy.

430
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:59,142
This is my way out.

431
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,532
Oh, God. Here we go.

432
00:26:00,668 --> 00:26:02,167
There's a whole suit here.

433
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:04,951
This could easily add
a minute to my dive.

434
00:26:05,706 --> 00:26:08,040
- You know I'm right.
- You're right.

435
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:10,784
It might buy you some time,

436
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:13,178
but this gear's probably biometric.

437
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:16,235
That means you put it on, and it
lets his people know we're here,

438
00:26:16,428 --> 00:26:18,028
and I don't know about you,

439
00:26:18,053 --> 00:26:21,787
but I'd rather not face a...
an army of guys like this.

440
00:26:21,922 --> 00:26:25,224
Come on. Give me a hand
before Hope comes back out.

441
00:26:25,568 --> 00:26:27,636
Stop. If there's tech in this thing,

442
00:26:27,661 --> 00:26:28,871
it's deader than he is.

443
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:30,763
This gets me to Sanctum.

444
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:33,132
I come back with our own army.

445
00:26:33,462 --> 00:26:35,162
Let these guys try to come.

446
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:39,465
Do you hear yourself?

447
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,021
Do you?

448
00:26:43,046 --> 00:26:44,887
You really want to
expose Hope to that...

449
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:47,779
Armies, a war?

450
00:26:48,544 --> 00:26:51,196
You're just trying to
guilt me into staying.

451
00:26:51,221 --> 00:26:54,054
Yes, because it's the
only tactic I haven't used.

452
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,617
You know I have to warn
Bellamy about the Primes.

453
00:26:56,642 --> 00:27:00,415
What about us? Aren't
we your family, too?

454
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:03,618
Of course you are.

455
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,532
I'll come back, I'll bring the others.

456
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,259
Hope can have a real life.

457
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,156
In the time you waited to
follow me into the Anomaly,

458
00:27:12,181 --> 00:27:14,376
I was already here for 3 months.

459
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:17,443
When you come back, I'll
be dust, and so will Hope

460
00:27:17,578 --> 00:27:21,007
after living alone for however
long she's alive once she buries me.

461
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:25,787
We had a good run, though, right?

462
00:27:53,763 --> 00:27:55,832
Aunty O, wait.

463
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,274
Don't leave.

464
00:28:04,273 --> 00:28:06,507
I miss you already.

465
00:28:06,578 --> 00:28:08,945
I don't want to grow up without you.

466
00:28:12,096 --> 00:28:14,284
Maybe you don't have to.

467
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:17,980
We don't know how the
Anomaly works, right?

468
00:28:18,521 --> 00:28:20,012
Before you know it,

469
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:22,743
I could be back with
Bellamy, Clarke, and Madi.

470
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,335
And Murphy?

471
00:28:24,582 --> 00:28:27,347
Him, too. All of them.

472
00:28:28,818 --> 00:28:30,653
I love you, little one.

473
00:28:31,534 --> 00:28:33,400
Don't you ever forget it.

474
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:47,537
I thought you were too
mad at me to say good-bye.

475
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:49,545
This isn't good-bye.

476
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:52,720
You won't accept this now, but
I'm probably saving your life

477
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:54,565
because even with that thing on...

478
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:58,002
You want to hate me, hate me,

479
00:28:58,138 --> 00:28:59,457
but Hope needs you.

480
00:28:59,482 --> 00:29:01,305
Stop making this about Hope.

481
00:29:03,921 --> 00:29:07,022
Fine. I need you, too. Is
that what you want to hear?

482
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:09,761
Your brother left you to die.

483
00:29:09,786 --> 00:29:11,872
Why are you so eager to run back to him?

484
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,847
Why aren't we enough?

485
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:19,130
I just need to tell him I understand.

486
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:29,694
Because of Hope, I understand.

487
00:29:30,483 --> 00:29:32,083
I need to tell him.

488
00:29:36,481 --> 00:29:38,181
This is your home now.

489
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:02,880
OK. How's about this one?

490
00:30:03,587 --> 00:30:05,053
Reading first, little one.

491
00:30:22,602 --> 00:30:25,600
OK. Go ahead. School can wait.

492
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,717
Well, what are you waiting for?

493
00:30:37,914 --> 00:30:39,348
Plant.

494
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:44,918
Bell, I hope against hope

495
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,661
that this letter reaches you.

496
00:30:46,686 --> 00:30:49,136
♪ Gonna buy you a diamond ring. ♪

497
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:52,717
I need you to know that you were right.

498
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:55,036
There was a darkness in me,

499
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,911
but Diyoza helped me past that darkness.

500
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,980
It's behind me now.

501
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:06,230
I need you to know that
I finally understand

502
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:08,262
all you did to protect me,

503
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,441
watch over me,

504
00:31:12,697 --> 00:31:14,197
love me.

505
00:31:18,388 --> 00:31:21,523
I wish I could see
your face and hug you...

506
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:27,276
And tell you that I get it now.

507
00:31:27,773 --> 00:31:29,883
I wish I could thank you.

508
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:32,460
By the time you get this,

509
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,273
if you get this,

510
00:31:35,298 --> 00:31:38,499
I'll probably be an old lady or dead.

511
00:31:38,854 --> 00:31:41,046
I want you to know I was happy.

512
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,192
I have Hope.

513
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:48,762
Diyoza's a pain in
the ass, but I love her

514
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:50,892
like I love you.

515
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,028
Please don't worry about me.

516
00:31:58,311 --> 00:32:00,934
You deserve to be happy, big brother.

517
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:06,380
Always yours, Octavia.

518
00:33:03,462 --> 00:33:05,095
Where did you get that?

519
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,663
I found it here.

520
00:33:06,743 --> 00:33:08,742
That was not meant for you.

521
00:33:09,902 --> 00:33:11,134
It's my watch.

522
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:18,108
Stay alert, Hope.

523
00:33:18,203 --> 00:33:20,237
He could come back at any time.

524
00:33:21,824 --> 00:33:24,097
OK. Try again.

525
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,561
The Eligius transport crashed here.

526
00:33:28,284 --> 00:33:30,297
Colin was the sole survivor.

527
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:32,493
He found the stone the same way we did,

528
00:33:32,518 --> 00:33:34,568
by tracking the radio interference.

529
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,380
Built this cabin above it.

530
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:38,038
What's all that?

531
00:33:38,174 --> 00:33:41,447
It's brilliant. He used
a ground vibration sensor

532
00:33:41,472 --> 00:33:43,697
and a stethoscope
salvaged form the wreckage

533
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,829
to measure tiny
fluctuations in the stone

534
00:33:45,854 --> 00:33:48,705
caused when the correct symbol
was touched in the right order.

535
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,244
So we have the code?

536
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:54,665
No, no, not yet.

537
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,782
There's still millions
of possible combinations,

538
00:33:56,807 --> 00:33:58,533
but he'll get it.

539
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:01,038
I'm sure of it.

540
00:34:01,063 --> 00:34:03,530
Very great importance, I think.

541
00:34:19,115 --> 00:34:21,994
I remember when she threw
this into the bridge.

542
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:25,073
We still thought Sanctum
was on the other side.

543
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,883
It must have been how
they knew we were here.

544
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:34,361
Hey.

545
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,901
Come here. Come here.

546
00:34:48,728 --> 00:34:52,579
We'll get them back together,

547
00:34:52,955 --> 00:34:54,892
whatever it takes.

548
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:58,252
We'll get them all back.

549
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,135
OK. Back to the trenches.

550
00:35:02,432 --> 00:35:04,977
"It is the same! For,
be it joy or sorrow,

551
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,211
the path of its departure still is free:

552
00:35:07,236 --> 00:35:08,921
Man's yesterday may ne'er be"...

553
00:35:08,946 --> 00:35:10,430
Same damn poem every day.

554
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:12,295
"Nought may endure but mutability."

555
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,359
You must think I'm so weak.

556
00:35:15,148 --> 00:35:18,805
No. The opposite.

557
00:35:19,171 --> 00:35:21,074
I've seen your moves,

558
00:35:21,444 --> 00:35:24,411
and with teachers like
Diyoza and Octavia,

559
00:35:24,657 --> 00:35:26,257
I wouldn't want to face you in battle.

560
00:35:26,282 --> 00:35:28,608
They didn't teach me to fight.

561
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,397
No. My mom wouldn't allow it.

562
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,288
No. A prisoner came here

563
00:35:34,647 --> 00:35:37,990
a few months after they left... Dev.

564
00:35:39,247 --> 00:35:41,330
He taught me.

565
00:35:42,498 --> 00:35:45,865
- The body.
- Yeah.

566
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:48,402
OK. Let's try again.

567
00:35:48,443 --> 00:35:51,099
Wait. There.

568
00:35:51,636 --> 00:35:53,769
The operations are in sync.

569
00:35:53,976 --> 00:35:56,143
Something's happening.

570
00:35:56,168 --> 00:35:57,701
Here we go.

571
00:36:02,151 --> 00:36:03,951
What is that?

572
00:36:06,311 --> 00:36:08,511
The portal rises from the lake.

573
00:36:08,757 --> 00:36:10,223
Of course.

574
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:15,918
Pen. I need a pen. Um...

575
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:18,966
A pen! He did it!

576
00:36:19,101 --> 00:36:20,500
I need a pen.

577
00:36:21,457 --> 00:36:22,646
He did it!

578
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:23,918
I need something to write with,

579
00:36:23,943 --> 00:36:26,528
uh, the charcoal, a pen, anything!

580
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,913
Be careful with that.

581
00:36:35,918 --> 00:36:37,784
Hey, hey.

582
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:39,964
What is this?

583
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,756
It's OK. No one's gonna hurt you.

584
00:36:43,043 --> 00:36:45,559
That's a memory viewer, OK?

585
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,627
My friend was here.

586
00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:51,141
Now that man just entered the
code and opened the bridge.

587
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:54,634
We need to rewind it
so that once we see it

588
00:36:55,035 --> 00:36:58,271
we can open the bridge ourselves, OK?

589
00:36:58,526 --> 00:37:00,199
You can go home.

590
00:37:01,198 --> 00:37:04,487
Too soon. I must serve my time.

591
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,104
OK.

592
00:37:07,604 --> 00:37:09,760
If you want to stay, you can stay.

593
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:11,988
Just give us back...

594
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:13,546
No!

595
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:15,486
I serve the master.

596
00:37:15,557 --> 00:37:19,292
I am his shield and his sword

597
00:37:19,564 --> 00:37:21,395
for all mankind!

598
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,480
No, no, no, no!

599
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:23,905
No!

600
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,590
You aced your reading, but your math...

601
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:03,382
you're gonna do it again after dinner.

602
00:38:06,298 --> 00:38:08,157
Remember this?

603
00:38:10,464 --> 00:38:13,387
I remember carrying your
ass through the woods in it.

604
00:38:16,098 --> 00:38:18,120
That's me on dishes.

605
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:21,725
I could have made your
daughter a pair of pants

606
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:23,606
if you didn't rip the sleeve off.

607
00:38:23,631 --> 00:38:26,427
I ripped the sleeve off to
save that gnarly arm of yours.

608
00:38:26,452 --> 00:38:28,834
It's time to throw that damn thing away.

609
00:38:29,008 --> 00:38:30,908
That's dishes tomorrow, too.

610
00:38:33,488 --> 00:38:34,754
Yep.

611
00:38:47,965 --> 00:38:49,164
Keep her out of sight.

612
00:38:49,189 --> 00:38:50,345
Wait. What are you doing?

613
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,541
Please just do what I say.

614
00:38:51,566 --> 00:38:53,270
- Mom?
- Don't worry about it.

615
00:38:53,294 --> 00:38:54,970
Hey, hey. It'll be OK.

616
00:39:21,846 --> 00:39:25,114
Who are you... Octavia or Diyoza?

617
00:39:25,225 --> 00:39:27,726
You speak English. Great.

618
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:30,110
You just tell me what this is about.

619
00:39:35,521 --> 00:39:37,857
Octavia left a long time ago,

620
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,653
right after she dropped this note.

621
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:41,773
I'm alone here now.

622
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,886
Search the cabin for the other one.

623
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,854
Restrain her.

624
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:48,888
Octavia, you fool! There is no hope!

625
00:39:48,913 --> 00:39:50,754
- Cut them off.
- Come out now!

626
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:52,211
Go now.

627
00:39:55,588 --> 00:39:57,454
Get in. Hurry!

628
00:40:01,772 --> 00:40:03,138
I need you to stay quiet.

629
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:05,305
No matter what you hear,

630
00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:07,466
you have to stay quiet,
do you understand?

631
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:10,481
I promise you Mommy and Aunty
O will come back for you,

632
00:40:10,506 --> 00:40:13,052
but right now, you shh.

633
00:40:13,685 --> 00:40:15,551
Come out!

634
00:40:15,724 --> 00:40:17,423
You be brave.

635
00:40:19,246 --> 00:40:20,779
Come out and surrender.

636
00:40:23,817 --> 00:40:25,750
All right! Front!

637
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,545
On your knees right now!

638
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,632
Come on.

639
00:40:40,657 --> 00:40:42,761
- Stop resisting!
- Let me go!

640
00:40:42,786 --> 00:40:45,303
- We don't want to hurt you.
- Let me go!

641
00:40:52,812 --> 00:40:54,378
Secure them.

642
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,361
Helmets on.

643
00:40:59,497 --> 00:41:01,597
Anders wants them to
remember everything.

644
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:04,167
On your feet. Move.

645
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:22,826
Mom! Octavia!

646
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:27,527
Mom!

647
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:34,619
Mom?

648
00:41:38,775 --> 00:41:43,775

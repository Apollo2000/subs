NOTTING HILL, LONDON, 1968

3
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,800
WOGS OUT

4
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,520
These are new men,
new types of human beings.

5
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,440
It is in them that are to be found

6
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
all the traditional virtues
of the English nation,

7
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,440
not in decay as they are in official
society, but in full flower...

8
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,040
Rita.

9
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,480
...because these men
have perspective....

10
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Is where you been?

11
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,560
Note particularly that they glory
in the struggle.

12
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,880
They are not demoralised or defeated
or despairing persons.

13
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,880
They are leaders, but are rooted deep
among those they lead.

14
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,440
Linton, I tell you enough times yuh
catching your tail in front of here.

15
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,040
Just liming with the limers, man.

16
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,080
Get yuh backside somewhere else.

17
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,000
Oh, man.
Respect, bright man.

18
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,200
BLACK OWNERSHIP

19
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,000
The place stinking of varnish.

20
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,040
When we have cook up,
no one will smell nutting.

21
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,080
We need a little something to make
the place look nice, no?

22
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,840
Yuh asking me? And all day Kendrick
sitting on his backside.

23
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,880
Kendrick, run down the market and get
some flowers for our opening night.

24
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,880
I don't know a thing about flowers.
What if someone seen me?

25
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,920
Say yuh in love. Go.

26
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,480
Yuh see what I mean, Frank.
Good for nutten.

27
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,840
Miss Agnes?

28
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,360
-Mr Charles?
-Yes, sir?

29
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,520
Okay, we gonna do fish curry.
Goat curry. Mutton curry.

30
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
Yes, sir.

31
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,440
Me mother's crab and dumpling. But
first, we will start with the roots.

32
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,560
The Trinidadian barrister,
Darcus Howe,

33
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,760
thinks things could build
up dangerous social tensions.

34
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,200
The policeman who,
who frames a black man is doing so

35
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,000
with a confidence that the system
is going to give him a conviction.

36
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,960
And the section of the community
who one must call the most alienated

37
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,080
either are going to turn to crime

38
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,160
in that they are going
to be arrested anyway,

39
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,560
or seek their revenge against
the society in another form.

40
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,880
Now, at this point in time that form
has not been expressed

41
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,480
and I hope it wouldn't be
but one must be very direct here,

42
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,560
and say that the police
must either stop it

43
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,000
or the black community will have
to stop them doing it.

44
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,200
Excellent work!

45
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,200
A toast, a toast.
A toast to my beautiful wife Selma,

46
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,320
who brought this vitally important
programme together.

47
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,400
And to my husband, the great CLR James,
who I thank for his love and support.

48
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,840
And Darcus. He's a leader!
He'll make a great lawyer one day.

49
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,600
Yeah, he done alright, didn't he?
But let's get one thing straight:

50
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,280
Darcus isn't interested in being a
barrister. He is interested in change.

51
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
-To change.
-Change...

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,400
Hey, bruh.

53
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,720
What's happening?

54
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Oh, so my brudda gone all bourgeois
in de ghetto.

55
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,040
You wanna cappuccino?

56
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,600
Hey, Frank. Listen,
to de Mangrove. A fresh thing.

57
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,920
A fresh thing, yes!

58
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll drink to that.

59
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,840
Frank... Come on!

60
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,200
Come on, everybody. Let's play outside.
Come on...

61
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,120
You see the thing about the black
man is he's got his place.

62
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,280
He's just gotta know his place.

63
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,160
If he oversteps he's gotta
be gently nudged back in....

64
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,480
And then you get the odd one or two
who need more of a...

65
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,320
you know... just like the Micks.

66
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,880
What you have to understand, Dickie,
is that the army isn't up for it.

67
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,720
Not like the old days
when they'd have got

68
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,280
a small battalion together
and, bam.

69
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,400
Wipe the whole lot out in one go....

70
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,720
Did you ever want
to be in the army?

71
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,000
No. I grew up thinking
I'd never see my country

72
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,600
fighting anyone
else's war ever again.

73
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,600
That's why I'm Bill through
and through.

74
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,640
But you never wanted to, you know,
be a sergeant or anything?

75
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,560
I've seen enough.

76
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,000
-You reading Black Jacobins again?
-That's what you should be teaching.

77
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,760
They're primary school children,

78
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,400
I'm not sure they're ready
for Black Jacobins just yet.

79
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,400
You're never too young to start.

80
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,280
I've lost count of the amount
of times I've read it.

81
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,520
What are you on about?

82
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,760
One TV show and you think you're
the second coming or what?

83
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,800
No. But not far behind.

84
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,200
Oh, it's all about you, innit?

85
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,680
You grew up in a society where black
people were the majority, yeah?

86
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,080
I grew up in an environment
where I was the minority.

87
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,280
From day one I was judged as being
'too Negroid' to be adopted.

88
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,480
So don't you come at me with your lofty
words and your Black Jacobins, alright?

89
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,800
Look, you're right to say that
sometimes words aren't enough.

90
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,640
But know this... No one is going
to help us unless we help ourselves.

91
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,520
Yeah, you're absolutely right,
actions do speak louder than words.

92
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,520
And the first thing that I want you
to do is tidy up the bloody mess

93
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,600
that you have made in the kitchen.

94
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,120
Move it!

95
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,560
You still there? Good for nothing
but making a whole of a mess.

96
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,360
Yuh varnish your house like this?
You stinking up the place!

97
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,600
PC Pulley.
Yes, how can I help you?

98
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,120
I want to talk to the manager
of this fancy new... what is it?

99
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,800
It's a restaurant.
And I is the owner, not the manager.

100
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,480
-Aren't you the golden goose?
-Yeah, and we closed right now.

101
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,760
Smells like a sex club
to me, Mr Crichlow.

102
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,120
No, sir, sex club is not my thing.
We setting up for lunch....

103
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,120
So how about a sausage
and egg then?

104
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Yeah, the Mangrove don't do
that kind of thing.

105
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,040
It's just spicy food you know.
For a particular palate.

106
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,240
Irregardless you have to book
to eat here.

107
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,120
What, with this?

108
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,680
No. With our reservation book.

109
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,400
Do I have to spell it out?

110
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,920
No, I understand enough.
I met many a hustler, Constable.

111
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,720
-What did you just call me?
-I call you Constable.

112
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,360
-Maybe you're an Officer now.
-I'll arrest you right now, bastard.

113
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,760
Arrest me for what?

114
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,600
I haven't forgotten your antics at your
last shithole. The Rio. Degenerates.

115
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,200
-Illegal gambling, ponces, nonces...
-This is a new business.

116
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,320
-Late night queer parties.
-It's a different kind of thing.

117
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,360
-Drug-dealing.
-I've never taken drugs in my life.

118
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,560
We'll shut you down
before you can say, eenie...

119
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,000
-I don't want no trouble.
-We got company....

120
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
-Hey, leave the Mangrove alone.
-Leave him alone.

121
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,440
-He said move.
-Leave the Mangrove alone.

122
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,440
-Move on, Pulley. Move on.
-Move your backside from our area.

123
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,240
-You not got jobs to go to?
-Get out of here, man. Get out.

124
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Move your backside. Move.

125
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,640
The Mangrove is a restaurant.

126
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,400
It serves West Indian cuisine to people
who eat that kind of food.

127
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,760
Just like any other restaurant.

128
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,720
Greek, French, English,
for that matter. We the Mangrove.

129
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,880
We pay we taxes, we pay we bills,
and we pay we staff.

130
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,280
You gonna try and arrest
me for that, or what?

131
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,640
-Yes, Frank.
-Tell him, Frank. Tell him.

132
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,640
You can't out-smart them
blue necks, man.

133
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,760
No! The Mangrove ain't nothing
like the Rio.

134
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,720
They have no business here so long
as we keep the place clean.

135
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,480
End of the story.

136
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,640
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

137
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,160
My name is Altheia Jones.

138
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,360
I am a student studying biochemistry
in this country,

139
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,360
but today I am here as a member
of the Black Panther movement.

140
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,560
I have been invited here by your
trade union

141
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,040
to talk you about your workers' rights
and your power as a collective force.

142
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,400
We have discovered,
discovered and rediscovered,

143
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,360
the ways in which we can overcome
the fragmentation

144
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,560
our people have suffered
throughout our history.

145
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,840
The way is through joining
the struggle

146
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,960
and being part
of an organised struggle.

147
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,720
For it is the struggle actually,
which makes us whole.

148
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,520
So I have come here today
to encourage you

149
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,600
to actively support
your trade union.

150
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,280
Because the virtue of lending
your voice to collective bargaining

151
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,120
is that together
we become stronger.

152
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,160
If colonialism is good for anything
it brought us together on this table.

153
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,600
-Sorry, where's your bathroom?
-Through the kitchen.

154
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,920
Excuse me.

155
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,760
Good evening....

156
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,120
Skippy never used to go home.

157
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,480
Skippy carries his toothbrush
in his suit pocket.

158
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,480
But that was the Rio.
And this place ain't nothing like that.

159
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,440
Cappuccino....

160
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,920
I think they were serving
a different type of coffee at the Rio.

161
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Frank. A beautiful evening.
Thank you very much....

162
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,000
-I hope you're walking.
-No, I'm flying.

163
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,440
Goodnight, goodnight.

164
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,200
When all the girls
in town feeling bad,...

165
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,200
No more Yankees in Trinidad...

166
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,320
They going to close down
the base for good

167
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,480
Them girls have to make
out all they could...

168
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,400
Brother is now
they park up in town

169
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,360
In for a penny,
and in for a pound

170
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,560
Believe me it's competition for so

171
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
Trouble in the town
when the price drop low

172
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,520
So when you bounce up
Jean and Dinah

173
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,760
Rosita and Clemintina,
round the corner posing

174
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,360
Bet your life is something they selling

175
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,160
And if you catch them broken

176
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,960
You can get them all for nothing

177
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,800
Don't make a row, the yankees gone,

178
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,600
Sparrow take over now

179
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,120
Hey, I sorry, yeah.
I miss the bus now

180
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,320
See, this is why I don't wait
for nobody. I said meet me at two.

181
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,320
-You better be here for two.
-Look, just fifteen minutes, now.

182
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,560
No excuses, man.
Now we're late, and I'm never late.

183
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,120
The government believes
the British state,

184
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,560
with over a million black people living
here now, is in grave danger.

185
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,200
Yeah, Roddy speak truth, nuh.

186
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,360
But that shouldn't come as a surprise
to any of us here.

187
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,680
I think the Black Panthers need
to actively prepare

188
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,960
in order to defend the Black
institutions and businesses

189
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,560
that can come under threat.

190
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,360
Like Frank Crichlow
over at the Mangrove.

191
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,880
C'mon, man, Frank is not interested
in the movement....

192
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
What you mean?

193
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,000
We have nutten but love
for the man, Frank, alright,

194
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,480
but that man blood run
purer than politics.

195
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,120
If you can call an inveterate
gambler pure.

196
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,800
-No, listen.
-You're wicked you, you know.

197
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,800
Frank is a charming and gentle person
who doesn't realise

198
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,640
what he has done for our community
in simply providing us the space.

199
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,840
The Mangrove is now a focal point for
black people to come and sit, talk,

200
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,360
and exchange views.
That is a rare and precious gift.

201
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,600
Damn right. And that Betty
make the best roti.

202
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,520
But seriously talking, we need
to defend ourselves against Powell

203
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,240
and his Rivers of Blood nonsense,

204
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,920
before that stream winds
its way to our door.

205
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,280
Guy need to wind himself into the
sewer, damn rat. Talking foolishness.

206
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,200
Ladies first, yeah....

207
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,560
You know how long
I've been waiting?

208
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,360
All complaints go through
the old lady of the house....

209
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Up! Get up, you black bastard.

210
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,520
-Don't fucking move!
-Where is your warrant?

211
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,760
Frank!

212
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,520
Betty!

213
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,600
Get down. Get fucking down.

214
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,160
You black bastard!
Where do you think you're...

215
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,040
Kenny!

216
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,000
If Scotland Yard can't accept
responsibility

217
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,600
for the raid on my restaurant,

218
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,080
then I have to make a report
of an illegal entry

219
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,960
on Friday evening of last week.

220
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,320
What happened?

221
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,920
Notting Dale CID carried out the
raid, and you can't tell me why?

222
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,160
It take you three days to find out
who and now you can't say why!

223
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,120
The Dangerous Drug Act?!

224
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,520
What does that have to do
with a legitimate restaurant, man?

225
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,960
Chuts, it's stupidness!

226
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,240
They're outside right now you
know, Frank. Two of them.

227
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,160
Shit!...

228
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,040
I said no trouble inside this place.
No trouble, it's a restaurant.

229
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,400
-You want to eat? You come here to eat?
-Hold on!

230
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,960
I come here to offer my support
and the support of the Black Panthers.

231
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,360
But, yes, I want to eat, thank you.

232
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,840
-I'm sorry. It's a stress.
-Nothing to say sorry for.

233
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,800
Just as long as you ain't run out
of crab and callallo?

234
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,240
-So, what are you writing?
-Pamphlet. Black Dimension.

235
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,600
It's going to focus on the community
and the Police State in West London.

236
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,720
Especially that brute, Pulley.

237
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,440
I like the sound of that. Hold on.

238
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,720
The Black Panthers can
do a press release.

239
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,920
I don't want the Mangrove
to have a reputation

240
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,160
for what the police do and done.

241
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,560
I lived all that bother at the Rio.

242
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,400
This is a restaurant,
a respectable restaurant,

243
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,520
and I want to keep it that way.

244
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,120
That's not to say I ain't grateful
for all your offering of support,

245
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,480
but I can't make no complaint,
yah know?

246
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,640
It's a restaurant,
not a battleground....

247
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,400
I hear you.

248
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,720
-Food is good.
-Yah?

249
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,280
You know, in the Ifa tradition
of the Yoruba,

250
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,520
Ogun is the energy whose
machete is used to clear the path.

251
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,720
Ogun is the energy of iron and
Ogun is the energy of the steel pan.

252
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,560
Why you mention Ogun?
Why you say that?

253
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,520
Dunno. Perhaps I feeling
a little of that energy.

254
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,120
-You pan?
-Once or twice, a long time ago.

255
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,960
Okay. Well, let we agree.

256
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,600
You can have your Panther meetings
upstairs as long as you agree

257
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,160
to play in the Mangrove
steel band this carnival.

258
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,120
Oh, gosh! As long as you can't change
your mind when you listen me try?

259
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
-No, no. You want pan?
-I want pan.

260
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,040
-You want pan now?
-No, no.

261
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,880
-Look! Yeah!
-No, settle yourself.

262
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,800
-We made an agreement.
-We have everything you need.

263
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,920
Gentlemen,
some lead for your pencil.

264
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,520
-Royce.
-Cheers, gov.

265
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,640
-Not married, are you?
-No.

266
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,920
-Got a girlfriend?
-No. I'd like one though.

267
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,120
-Well, we better find you one.
-That would be nice.

268
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,080
Well, I hope you settle in. You're in
a foreign country now, aren't you?

269
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,600
-What do you mean?
-We all look after each other here.

270
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,760
-What?
-Quick game.

271
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,040
-What have I done?
-Ace of Spades. You know the rules.

272
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,400
What rules?

273
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,800
No one told him?
Well, that's not very fair, gents.

274
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,360
Rules are rules.

275
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,320
Whoever draws the ace of spades has
to go out

276
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,360
and nick the first black
bastard they clap eyes on.

277
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,440
-Nick him for what?
-You'll learn.

278
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,120
-This is urgent. What's your name?
-Who are you, more like?

279
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,760
I am Frank Crichlow,
and this is Mrs Manning.

280
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,320
She son, Kendrick Manning, is missing,
and we have reason to believe...

281
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,200
-How long has he been missing?
-Well, he disappeared from...

282
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,320
I didn't ask you. Did I?
How long?

283
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,400
Kenny's supposed to reach home
at nine. Nine o'clock.

284
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,960
Six hours? Nah, that don't
make a missing person.

285
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,720
-I know something happened to my boy.
-How?

286
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,320
Hey, let me tell you something.

287
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,640
Kendrick Manning vanished
on Tavistock Gardens

288
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,160
leaving his family's food
shopping on the street.

289
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,760
-I can repeat it for you?
-Alright, alright. Take a seat.

290
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,160
No. I insist on seeing him...

291
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,000
You having trouble understanding?
Take a seat I said!

292
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,800
-Frank ! Calm down, calm down.
-Calm down.

293
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,920
Come, let we sit down, let we sit down.
We're right here.

294
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,040
-Come, let we sit down.
-That's it.

295
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,960
Davis, do we have any visitors?

296
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,560
Yeah, perfect timing....

297
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,680
Looks like he had a fall....

298
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,200
Calm her down. Out.

299
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,280
Calm down, madam.

300
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,880
You need to calm down.

301
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,040
You need to calm down.

302
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,600
See you, you devil!

303
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,160
Hey, Frank, let it go.

304
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,960
Go back to wherever
you come from.

305
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,240
How's your tea?

306
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,440
How many you thinking about
doing this time?

307
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,440
I'm going for a bigger run.

308
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,120
-You can read, can't you?
-Get out of my house!

309
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,000
Shut up, you whore!

310
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,320
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

311
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,320
-You'll regret this.
-You're the one who's gonna regret it.

312
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,240
Get out. Get out.

313
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,280
-Smash that for us.
-Get out of my house!

314
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,200
Get out.

315
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,840
Get out.

316
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,040
Police!

317
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,400
-Stay down.
-I haven't done nothing.

318
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,240
Kendrick! Don't resist.

319
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,000
Shut it you fucking black bastard.
Shut it!

320
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,400
Who want to play me
for the Mangrove?

321
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,840
You're joking or what?

322
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,760
No, I serious. Number Eight All
Saints Road. What you saying?

323
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,680
Look, nobody is gonna take that.

324
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,640
Alright, it's my business.

325
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,280
Come on.
What I can't give it away?...

326
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,040
Mangrove man. Him listen?

327
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,760
Who do good fuh jumbie
is dem jumbie does frighten.

328
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,120
Me want tuh hail out de good yuh mek
fuh de people. Nutten go unseen.

329
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,600
But de Mangrove's a burden yuh
gonna have to carry yuhself.

330
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,360
Dat ah truth.

331
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,200
Go on, man.

332
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,760
Play the cards.

333
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,000
Pulley will sue me for criminal libel

334
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,200
as long as my black skin
is in Notting Hill.

335
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,080
I actively encourage you to go
and live in the North of England.

336
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,000
-In East Lancashire.
-Yeah, that could work.

337
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,960
I could come and visit you all
the time, maybe...

338
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,400
Pulley will still be able to sue my
black backside in East Lancashire.

339
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,080
Tunapuna. Trinidad.
I will go home....

340
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,480
You can't do that, Darcus, because
I'll never get to see you, will I?

341
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,480
At this moment in history you
could inspire a revolution.

342
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,480
Yeah, and how we gonna afford
to do that, then? You selfish git.

343
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,080
Excuse me, sorry.

344
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,480
-Just let me get set up, Frank.
-I will send them up in a minute.

345
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,600
Right, listen up, boys.
This is Mr Stedman.

346
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,120
I brought him down
here to help with the police.

347
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,360
So, listen, and listen carefully.

348
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,760
Go ahead, Mr Stedman.

349
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,280
Now, if you get stopped
and searched...

350
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,920
You mean when.

351
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Yes. I mean, as a citizen of this
country you are legally intitled

352
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,360
to insist on having a lawyer present
before you say anything.

353
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,280
But how is we supposed
to say something,

354
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,640
if you is saying we ain't
supposed to say anything.

355
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,000
You're supposed to say something,
fool, you just don't say nothing.

356
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,480
I can see I haven't explained
it too well.

357
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,160
I advise you to say nothing other than
to remind them you that have the right

358
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,800
to remain silent and require a lawyer
present before you say anything else.

359
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,840
-So we is supposed to say something.
-Yes, look, the system is...

360
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,680
The system? The system crooked as
a damn ram's horn, that's what it is...

361
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,080
We were waltzing together

362
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,400
To a sweet, sweet melody

363
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,080
When they called out, 'change partners'

364
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,520
And you waltzed away from me

365
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,120
Open the door.

366
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,080
Tell them we're closed.

367
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,560
We're closed!

368
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,080
Police! Open the door!

369
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,240
What you doing?

370
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,520
Don't touch me!

371
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,080
Betty!

372
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,600
Get your hands off me.
Betty! Betty!

373
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,760
-Warrant.
-I don't care for no blasted warrant.

374
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,400
What in God's name is
going on in here?

375
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,760
You serving drinks without
a license? At this hour?

376
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,720
Tea. We're drinking blasted tea.

377
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,520
You're breaking the law of this
country, that's what's happening.

378
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,040
Who d'you think you are?

379
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,600
Opening up a restaurant, thinking
your some sort of... chief.

380
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,720
I opened this place for people to come
and go no matter who they are.

381
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,680
And that's all well and good.

382
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,240
But the problem is your menu.
Certain things have to be added

383
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,320
in order for you to continue
with your establishment.

384
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,280
We only serve spicy cuisine here!

385
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,640
You see, you people
don't really understand, do you?

386
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,760
You come over here with your bright
clothes, you sleep with our women,

387
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,920
make like you're a big shot.

388
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,560
But guess what?
It isn't happening.

389
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,680
Not on my watch.

390
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,400
Pulley, stop! Pulley!

391
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,520
You bastard! You devil!...

392
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,800
You are a devil! You are a devil!
What's wrong with you?...

393
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,920
You're a devil, Pulley....

394
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,440
Shall we go and play some music?

395
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,640
Crichlow?

396
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,480
Which leaves me to ask the question,
was the Mangrove used as a night café?

397
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,640
I find that it was.
I do not feel it's necessary for it

398
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,360
to be open if customers
can knock and be let in....

399
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,080
It's also not necessary to prove that
money has changed hands.

400
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,920
The defendant is fined £25

401
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,120
and must pay for the legal costs of all
those involved. Next.

402
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,920
I want a transcript
of what the judge just said.

403
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,600
Biting your finger nail.
What you thinking?

404
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,200
Nothing, Tanty.

405
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,080
Crapaud smoke yuh pipe.
Why you lying?

406
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,360
Don't play with me, child.

407
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,120
Me head hot.

408
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,640
Seems like we reaching the end
of the road, yah know....

409
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,880
One raid lead to another raid lead
to another raid,

410
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,720
then they use that as an excuse to give
me a different type of licks.

411
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,080
They taking away
the alcohol license now....

412
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,360
The police in cahoots with the council,
the council with the damn judge,

413
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,760
the judge with the police....

414
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,160
And the customers not
stepping foot in here.

415
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,960
Too frighten.
They ain't coming day or night.

416
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,320
Why the police harassing us
in this place, eh?

417
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,720
The business buss.

418
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,480
Well, you don't put water in your
mouth to spell it out, eh.

419
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,360
Me don't have
nobody to cook for!

420
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,600
The place is like a jumbie ballroom!

421
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,880
I ain't know why I boddering.

422
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,760
Frank? Frank?

423
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,600
Oh, Miss Tetley.

424
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,160
Dorothy, if you come with your belly
hungry, you're in luck.

425
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,400
Betty in need of a mouth to feed.

426
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,160
I come for give you this.

427
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,200
Every Sunday since me come ah England,
me ah save ah likkle ting.

428
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,720
Thinking about going back Jamaica,
one time.

429
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,920
I can't do that...

430
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,080
The Mangrove is part of this story
and me need to say this.

431
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,480
This ah the place what makes me know
this really my home from home now.

432
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,320
And everybody in the community say
that them need this place, too.

433
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,240
So this, for you.

434
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,840
If me stay, me a gwan cry.

435
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,920
Just know, Frank,
this make me happy.

436
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,560
Probably nothing but a shilling.

437
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,520
Elizabeth Crichlow! Get your dirty
fingers off that thing there.

438
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,040
And you sit there with
your face screw-up.

439
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,480
Dolston?...

440
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,600
What?...

441
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,160
We closing down the restaurant....

442
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,120
Yeah, boy. But we keeping the Mangrove
open. Twenty four hours a day open.

443
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,480
Yeah, you hear me correct?...

444
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,720
I want poker games. Dice. As many
tables as the police ain't broke.

445
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,760
But we keeping this place open
by the hook or by the crook.

446
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,000
You gone cuckoo?
Close down the kitchen and what?

447
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,720
You can still use your long broom
to sweep up in the corner.

448
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,560
Yes, what you want, boy?

449
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,920
Wanna seat at the big
table downstairs.

450
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,440
Listen, we don't have no drugs
in here, you understand?

451
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,920
You think me stupid enough
to bring drugs in here

452
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,240
when them raid four times
in the last six weeks?

453
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,640
-Nine times.
-See? What cat can handle that?

454
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,040
Look, that's a man's nine lives
right there, Frank.

455
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,880
Come again.

456
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,800
Fucking business, no!

457
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,480
What in hell... this boy.
Stop, stop. Pull over, pull over.

458
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,440
Hold up. Pull up, pull over.

459
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,400
Leave the boy alone, man.

460
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,960
You alright, Benson? Yeah?

461
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,160
Marsha. Go up to the Mangrove
and get Mr Stedman, okay? Go. Go!

462
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,840
-Why you stop the boy?
-Are you interfering with police?

463
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,520
Yes! Why you stopping the boy?

464
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,800
-He matches the description.
-Description? What description?

465
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,400
Pulley. There's a robbery in progress.
We've gotta go. Sir.

466
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,000
Just your luck.

467
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,120
-Go and get your r'aas out.
-Shut up, you twat!

468
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,760
Why'd he stop you?

469
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,400
-No reason.
-No reason?

470
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,200
Come, we go. Come. Come.

471
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,880
Trinidad has been remade, Frank.
I saw it. I heard it.

472
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,760
The revolution has changed the
very rhythm of the people's speech.

473
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,560
They, they talking with greater
deliberation,

474
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,040
they pausing before
speaking and such.

475
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,360
It's as if it has provoked an
unconscious social patience that...

476
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,360
it was truly something to behold.

477
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,040
Yeah.

478
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,240
Yeah. It is a complete harassment
on this restaurant.

479
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,840
A complete harassment
on a Black business.

480
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,920
They're trying to destroy it. And all
the people they're afraid to come.

481
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,560
We've made complaints. We've
made complaints to the Home Office.

482
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,400
To my embassy. And now to you,
my local Member of Parliament...

483
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,680
Because the bodderation continue
and continue and I know it is

484
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,240
because I am a Black citizen
of this country

485
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,040
which is why I am being
discriminated against...

486
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,520
Pr-proof? What more proof you need,
man? Chuts, man.

487
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,120
All development come
from self-movement.

488
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,120
Not because of external forces
acting on the organism.

489
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,640
What shit you talking?

490
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:41,040
Your strategy of relying on the white
establishment will never work, Frank.

491
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Not... Darco, not now.

492
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,760
I see a man before me, right, a man
of, of great patience and humility

493
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,440
who, unbeknownst to him,
has become a leader of his people.

494
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,080
CLR James have it written.

495
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,040
'These are new men.'

496
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,680
He say, 'new types of human beings,
because these men have perspective.

497
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,560
They are leaders, but leaders who are
rooted deep among those they lead.'

498
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,280
Now, he speaks of you, Frank.

499
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,160
He does too....

500
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,840
But I see this leader suffering
the consequences

501
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,240
of a state-sponsored attempt
to close down his business.

502
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:27,040
My brother, this government will never
take up its responsibility

503
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,720
to you and this community,

504
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,960
not unless it sees
people on the street.

505
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,000
Let us organise a demonstration....

506
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,640
We're not in Trinidad now, boy.
This is Notting Hill.

507
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:45,720
This is Notting Hill. This place,
the Mangrove, it is Notting Hill.

508
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,160
Whether you can recognise so or not.
This is the front line.

509
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,200
The Mangrove...
the, this, this, is community,

510
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,880
the black community
is your community.

511
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,680
The Black community who rely
on the Mangrove

512
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,040
just as much as you rely on them....

513
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,920
Take it to the street.
Take it to the street, Frank....

514
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,800
They'd just use it as an excuse
to take down the whole dam thing.

515
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,120
That is the truth.
If we hold a demonstration,

516
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,600
right, you stand to lose the restaurant
you have spent your life building.

517
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,840
They might use it to shut down
the Mangrove permanently.

518
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,640
But a demonstration
is the right thing to do.

519
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,000
Self-movement....

520
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,600
Yeah, we march.

521
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,280
Who dat? Who dat?

522
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,800
Watch it, man.

523
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,440
-Hi.
-So, what you have in that bag?

524
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,680
Just been at the butchers.
It's a surprise.

525
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,840
HANDS OFF MANGROVE

526
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,800
Hands off the Mangrove!

527
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,240
'The pigs, the pigs.
We gotta get rid of the pigs.

528
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,160
The pigs, the pigs.
We gotta get rid of the pigs'

529
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,840
What our Mother country seeks to do is
not just to close down a restaurant,

530
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,080
but to close down
what they see as a space

531
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,280
where Black people
can put up some kind of resistance

532
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,920
to day-to-day harassments
by the police.

533
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,640
And I believe the Mangrove
not only serves as a negative

534
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,400
in putting up that space
for black people.

535
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,240
But I believe it serves
as a positive purpose

536
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,880
in that people in the community
have a place to call our own,

537
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,520
and we as Black people have lacked
that since we were invited here.

538
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,800
So this attack
on a Black establishment

539
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,960
and our right to gather
is not an isolated event.

540
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,920
But a sustained campaign against
Black people by the British State,

541
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,120
and today we are saying
enough is enough!

542
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,800
Black power! Black power!

543
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,800
Black power! Black power!

544
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,560
So let we go and march,
and let we march peacefully.

545
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,440
Brothers and sisters.

546
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,640
It has been for some time now

547
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:44,480
that Black people have been caught up
in complaining to police about police.

548
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,200
That's right.

549
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,200
Complaining to magistrates
about magistrates.

550
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,320
Complaining to judges about judges.

551
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,000
We must become the shepherds
of our own destiny.

552
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,360
What our objective is today,
what it's going to continue to be,

553
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,360
is a concerted, determined attempt

554
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,840
to prevent any infringement
on our rights.

555
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,200
-Hands off.
-Black people!

556
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,200
Where is Pulley?

557
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,480
Where is Pulley?

558
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,000
Wait, wait, wait.
What's going on?

559
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,800
Shut your mouth, you fucking...

560
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,920
Get in there, lads.

561
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,160
Black Power!

562
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,160
People Power!

563
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,360
What?

564
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,280
Get back. Get back.

565
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,520
Let's go. Go!

566
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,920
Black Power!

567
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,320
-What the hell's going on?
-Hold on!

568
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,600
Black Power! Black Power!

569
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,880
I told you.

570
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,160
-Get back. Back off.
-Don't touch me.

571
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,240
Bloody savages.

572
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,080
Black Power!
Black Power! Black...

573
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,160
Take your fucking sign and fuck off....

574
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,400
What the fuck are you doing?

575
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,000
Barbara! Barbara!

576
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,080
Take your fucking hands off her.
Barbara! Barbara!

577
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,680
Get off me.
Get your fucking hands off me!

578
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,680
Why are you doing that? Eh?
Are you mad?

579
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,320
Get off me. Get off me.
Hey. Eddie!

580
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,280
-Altheia!
-Eddie!

581
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,160
Take your fucking hands off her...
Take your hands off her.

582
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,560
Come on, boys!

583
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,280
In you come.

584
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,800
Alright, boys.

585
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,440
Out the fucking lot of you
black bastards. Come on.

586
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,040
Alright, Frank. It's Frank.
You're nicked.

587
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,920
-Why're you doing this, man?
-You not happy to see me?

588
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,120
Man, leave us alone,
we've done nothing wrong, man.

589
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,040
Ian.

590
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,400
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I've had
to bring him with me in the end.

591
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,800
Don't worry about it.
No, no, it's no trouble, not at all.

592
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,040
Hello!

593
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,360
So... I thought the Old Bailey
was for proper criminals.

594
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,400
You know, like bank robbers,
murderers and that.

595
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,920
It's only a courtroom if you think
about it. Nothing more.

596
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,960
Yeah, but we were already
found innocent.

597
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,200
The last magistrate threw the charges
straight out of court. And now this.

598
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,560
It's been nearly a year and we're
already back to where we started,

599
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,840
only this time at the Old Bailey.
I mean, what's it all about, Ian?

600
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,920
Well, you're on the front line
of change, Barbara.

601
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,840
So they want to try to make
an example out of you.

602
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,640
But they can't do that, can they?

603
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,880
I don't even
understand who's doing this.

604
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,280
So, the Director of Public Prosecutions
has introduced

605
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,920
a new charge of riot and affray.
It's a very serious charge indeed,

606
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,440
and I'm afraid they're not obliged
to explain themselves to anyone.

607
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,000
But, with your permission, I intend
to make it much more unpleasant

608
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,920
for them than it has
to be for you.

609
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,760
No, I'm not interested
in playing silly games.

610
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,160
I've got this one to worry about now.

611
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,920
I can't have him ending up like me.
I won't.

612
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,920
If the two of us get sent away... It
just makes me sick to think about it.

613
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,640
I know.

614
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,400
I thought you were retired anyway?

615
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,640
No. I was never retired, honestly.
And plus, the revolution's coming,

616
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,960
so I certainly never intended
to be practicing law when it did.

617
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,240
-Yeah, well, it's a nightmare, innit?
-Well, maybe we're about to wake up.

618
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,440
Wake up?
I just wanna wake up now, Ian.

619
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,360
I hoped never to see us all together
in one place again.

620
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,560
No offence to anybody,

621
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,640
but what is with this? How could this
be allowed to happen, eh?

622
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,480
Ay, relax man.
Where is the father, eh?

623
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,360
Oh, don't ask me, mate.

624
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,960
Sorry, I'm Ian McDonald.

625
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,520
I'm representing Barbara
for those that don't know.

626
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,160
I hope you don't mind
if I just jump in.

627
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,160
The trial,
as I'm sure you're all aware,

628
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,360
is taking place at the Old Bailey.

629
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,880
Somewhere normally reserved
for only the most serious of crimes.

630
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,040
Murder, terrorism and treason,

631
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,000
so this is just another example
of intimidation.

632
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,000
-Hello, Mr Croft!
-You look ridiculous.

633
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,080
Oh, thank you.

634
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,440
Early retirement's been very kind
to me. I highly recommend it.

635
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,640
I'm delighted to see you here.
Makes me feel safer already.

636
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,760
You don't need to worry, this is
the finest legal system in the world.

637
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,960
How you can trust the system
when one judge say

638
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,880
you're innocent of the riot and affray.

639
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,720
Only for them to bring the charges
then back! That don't make no sense.

640
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,280
Five years!

641
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,680
The counsel tell me to plead guilty
and accept five years jail time.

642
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,160
-What?
-For real, boy.

643
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,600
So I said I'll spend five years
with your wife.

644
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,120
What are you talking
about his wife for, eh?

645
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:46,120
But concerning legal proceedings
and all that skullduggery...

646
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,640
British courtroom is designed to keep
the defendant shackled to ignorance.

647
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:56,280
I say no more. Not in my name.
I spent enough time at the bar,

648
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,680
so Darcus Howe going
to represent himself.

649
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,480
Which bar you been to?
The Red Lion? You wanna go ah prison?

650
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,840
-I studied law, you know, Rhodan.
-This case isn't just about you.

651
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,280
It's nine defendants, Darcus.

652
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,760
You're making a decision
that will affect everyone.

653
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,680
-Me say nuh.
-Actually, that's a brilliant idea.

654
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,160
Darcus self-representing,
that's brilliant.

655
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:21,000
It's the perfect way to challenge
the courts archaic set up,

656
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,000
and really take your message inside
that building. No, it's brilliant.

657
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:29,080
Self-representing means being able
to cross-examine witnesses.

658
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,800
Think about that. Make objections
in the courtroom. But......

659
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:37,640
Most importantly, it allows you
to speak directly to the jury

660
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,520
in a manner
that I for one couldn't.

661
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,080
Him talking a set of shit
to the jury is never gonna help nobody.

662
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,200
I agree with Darcus.
I will also represent myself.

663
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,840
-Ah ya yie! Nobody listen to me.
-I think that's a good idea.

664
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,760
Oh, listen! Listen!
We need to challenge the system.

665
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,360
Is a system where the judge
wearing a dress,

666
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,480
the lawyer all put on a dress
and they all wearing a wig.

667
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,440
But the men are all just
himself to himself.

668
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,200
They speak only
himself to himself.

669
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,520
We mustn't be victims but protagonists
of our stories.

670
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,120
And what better way
of representing ourselves,

671
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,760
than self-representing ourselves.
He's right!

672
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,280
Hold on, hold on.
Everybody turn crazy or something?

673
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,160
It's not a game
we're playing here now.

674
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,280
This is our lives.
We are facing ten years in prison.

675
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,440
The legal system is designed
for experts.

676
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,080
You're harming yourselves
by pursuing this course.

677
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,720
You'll have to learn how to cross
examine witnesses.

678
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,800
It's going to be a lot
of extra work for you.

679
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,920
Doesn't matter,
we can all work together.

680
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,240
Listen, all of you heading
to the jail-house. Not me, no sir.

681
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,960
I agree with Mr Gordon.
This is a grave mistake.

682
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,800
I wish you luck
Mrs Jones-Le Cointe.

683
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,360
No, no, no. We don't need
luck, mister. We need justice.

684
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,760
We need more than that.
We need more than that for true.

685
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,600
Oh God, man.

686
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,680
Yes, man.

687
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,840
Over here. Name?

688
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,960
Mr Darcus Howe, acting counsel.

689
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,280
Says you're in the dock down here.
Up arms.

690
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,200
If you were to make
a more thorough investigation,

691
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,640
you'll find that I am in fact,
acting counsel.

692
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,680
-I should be treated as such.
-Up!

693
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,640
Sorry, is there...
Is there an issue here?

694
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,080
I can confirm that Mr Howe
is acting counsel.

695
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,800
Self-representing, are we?
First time for everything.

696
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,320
So you'll be wanting to search
me too then, yes?

697
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,680
No, sir.
That won't be necessary.

698
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,080
Right. Thank you, Darcus.
This way.

699
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,360
-Self-representing?
-No.

700
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,680
Let's have the bag.

701
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:18,960
Up arms. Round you go.
Thank you.

702
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:22,280
-Name?
-Altheia Jones. Self-representing.

703
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,920
Mangrove nine are innocent!
The police should be on trial!

704
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,120
The Mangrove nine are innocent!
The police should be on trial!

705
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,560
The Mangrove nine are innocent!

706
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,400
Clerk of the court.

707
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,400
Mr Mendel, please ensure
that none of the protesters

708
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,320
are admitted this morning.

709
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,240
I don't care if they have tickets.

710
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,960
Okay. Everyone, everyone.

711
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,200
Now, as you all know,

712
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,680
Altheia and Darcus will be representing
themselves in court today.

713
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,000
Meaning that they will be
able to cross examine witnesses,

714
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,440
make submissions to the judge
and so on.

715
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,280
My role, as well
as defending Barbara,

716
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,480
will be to act as a sort of...
bridge for those less familiar

717
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,960
with the legal witchcraftery
that's practised in this building.

718
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:39,120
So, I'd like to start by bringing
everyone up to speed on his Lordship.

719
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,040
Judge Edward Clark.
Now the good news for us

720
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,160
is that he's an old, cantankerous,
upper-class bully.

721
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,000
And Mr Short Back and Sides,
that's a good thing, is it?

722
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,800
Yes, it is, because it means he
won't like being wound up.

723
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,960
But wind him up, we must.
And wind him up, we will.

724
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,960
I'm struggling to understand
how you consider

725
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,640
antagonising the judge
to be a viable strategy.

726
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,920
That's just the start, Mr Croft.

727
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,480
We also have to find ourselves
an all-black jury.

728
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,160
A black jury?

729
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,720
Yes, okay, if you want
to pass these round.

730
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,960
We pay a pound for a list
of all the proposed jurors.

731
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,080
-Make sure everyone's got one.
-Wimbledon? Ealing and such?

732
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,240
Doctors, civil servants
don't understand our struggle.

733
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,400
You're damn right!
Their mind's made up already.

734
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,400
Listen, some of them
got to be black.

735
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,920
But if every one of us exercises our
right to reject seven jurors.

736
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,400
That's seven-nines.

737
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,280
Sixty-three.
We've got sixty-three attempts.

738
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,480
Exactly.

739
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,680
Look, ain't no matter.
The system is rigged me a tell you.

740
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,400
The judge man a bully.

741
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,000
You think him let a single black man
on the jury? Hear me counsel.

742
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,120
All ah youse better start listening to
him instead of running up your mouth.

743
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,640
Well with all due respect, Rhodan.
And to you too, Mr Lock.

744
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,120
I actually think that mouthing off
might be our best strategy.

745
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,960
We are here to defend our lives.

746
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,400
So we are going to be loud
and we are going to be decisive.

747
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,680
Step aside, please sir.

748
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,200
I have my ticket. Look.

749
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,360
If you'd like to step
to one side, please.

750
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,680
It's my wife on trial.
No, you have to let me in.

751
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,600
Sir. Step to one side.

752
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,440
Ya tell all need to have a ticket.
Look it's right here.

753
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,280
Ya blasted ragamuffin.

754
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,560
And you. You only standing
there not saying nothing.

755
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,520
Ya see how they treating me.
And the ticket right here!

756
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,240
And you only standing there like some
macco. Man, take your fucking ticket.

757
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,120
Silence. Be upstanding in court.

758
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,400
All persons who have anything
to do before My Lords and Ladies,

759
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:36,440
the Queen's justices draw near and give
your attention. God save the Queen.

760
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,440
Good morning.

761
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,600
Mr Hill, are we ready to proceed?

762
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,680
Good morning, My Lord.
Almost ready.

763
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,320
Before jury selection, we will discuss
access to the courtroom.

764
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:55,640
The defence will then raise concerns
about the composition of the jury....

765
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,640
Thank you, Mr Hill, thank you.

766
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,200
Good morning, your Lordship!

767
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,320
My Lord, some relatives
were prevented

768
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,560
from entering court this morning.

769
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,360
I'm a little disturbed that
at the very beginning of this case,

770
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,000
the very people who need to hear
what happens

771
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,600
suffered at the door of the court.

772
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,960
The public do not have
unreserved access to my courtroom.

773
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,280
-'My courtroom,' your Lordship?
-In this instance, my courtroom.

774
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,360
The officers have every right
to keep out those

775
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,040
who are not playing an
essential part in this case.

776
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,840
But, your Lordship, such is the public
interest in this case

777
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,280
that might I actually suggest
a few extra seats be made available.

778
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,520
Somewhere at the rear of the courtroom,
I think we can squeeze a couple in.

779
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,280
You need know,
I issued the instructions myself.

780
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,280
And it's not a matter I wish to
continue discussing in this courtroom.

781
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:49,080
Well, justice must be seen to be done
by members of the public surely?

782
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,760
For Christ's sake,
get a hold of yourself man.

783
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,680
On the matter of extra seats...
Your application is denied.

784
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,120
When the jury have been sworn in,
it can be a matter...

785
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,280
My husband was refused admission
to the public gallery,

786
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,240
even though he had a valid ticket.

787
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:07,560
That is the luck of the draw
as with most things in life.

788
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,520
What do the defence have to say
about selection of the jury?

789
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,320
Yes, My Lord.

790
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,160
On behalf of my client and the rest
of the defendants sat,

791
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,080
rather uncomfortably,
in the dock today.

792
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,600
I am making an application
for an all-black jury to be appointed.

793
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,440
The decision to grant this application
would be hailed throughout the world...

794
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,600
as a great victory for liberty.

795
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,720
And why on God's Earth
would I agree to that?

796
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,360
Well, an all-black jury is
required in this case, your Lordship,

797
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,000
because they are
the only persons who qualify,

798
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,840
in the conditions of our modern
society, as equals of the defendants.

799
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:49,640
And are you implying that a white jury
would not treat the defendants fairly,

800
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,760
as they are required to do by law.

801
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,720
No. Not at all, your Lordship, no.

802
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,200
Only that, with a white jury you
cannot guarantee against persons

803
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:01,640
prejudicing the defendants solely
because they are black.

804
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,880
My Lord, as my esteemed colleague
Mr Howe here has enlightened me,

805
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,200
my request is based on
the common law of England,

806
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,920
which has existed for
over seven-hundred years.

807
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:15,720
Stretching as far back as the Magna
Carta, which was in twelve-fifteen,

808
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:20,240
there's a great swathe of historical
examples that give precedent

809
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:23,600
that a man should be tried
by his peers, or his equals.

810
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,320
So what I am asking for is something

811
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,360
that I am entitled
to under British law.

812
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,080
I'm not asking for an extension
of the law,

813
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,200
nor am I asking the court to make
any special concessions.

814
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:42,240
I am grateful for your argument
but your application is rejected.

815
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:49,760
Would his Lordship consider expanding
on the reasons for his judgement?

816
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,880
I do not regard these circumstances
so exceptional

817
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,520
that I should give my reasons.

818
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,360
My Lord, I have no precedence to state,
but I have a sense of justice.

819
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:02,760
Need I repeat myself?
The application is rejected. Move on.

820
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,080
My Lord. I'd ask the court
for a short adjournment

821
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,400
so that I might consult
with the defendants.

822
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,040
Your request is rejected.

823
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:16,520
A lot of very simple things are already
becoming complicated in this case.

824
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,880
Do not make inflammatory remarks,
Mr McDonald.

825
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,400
I am trying to keep things simple

826
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,760
because there are unrepresented
defendants in the dock.

827
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,400
-Do not do it again.
-Of course.

828
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,480
Take the Bible in your right hand.

829
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,880
-I swear...
-Challenge!

830
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,480
-Take the Bible in your right hand.
-Challenge!

831
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,920
-Take the Bible in your right...
-Challenge!

832
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,720
Exercising my right, My Lord.

833
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,120
Challenging the jury may be
within your judicial rights,

834
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,400
but I don't want this trial
to deteriorate

835
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,920
into a black and white contest.

836
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,000
If you are going to challenge,

837
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,600
I ask you to do it before the swearing
in begins. Understood?

838
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,280
Of course.

839
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,920
-Take the Bible in your right hand.
-Challenge!

840
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,640
My Lord, you've just said that all
challenges must be lodged

841
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,280
before the oaths commence.

842
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,200
As was the case. Challenge upheld.
You may leave the court.

843
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,640
-My Lord...
-Mr McDonald! I said upheld.

844
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:27,880
You're not doing anyone any favours
by behaving like that.

845
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,120
Well once Altheia and Darcus
get going Mr Croft

846
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,520
I'm gonna seem positively timid.
I'm just warming the old bastard up.

847
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,040
The judge wanna purge all ah we.
I see it in the eye, plain as day.

848
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,800
Every request we make
he rejects straight up.

849
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,440
Just a likkle sparring man.
Me wanna join in.

850
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,280
British justice. What a joke.
It's a disaster, isn't it, Ian.

851
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,560
No! It's not a disaster, no.

852
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,600
See, we just made a judge at the Old
Bailey discuss race in his courtroom.

853
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,120
He didn't want to do that.
He want to pretend this is a case

854
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,960
about violence, about criminals,
about malcontents.

855
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,920
But we have made it about what it is.
About the colour of our skin.

856
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,040
It's a victory, uh?

857
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,440
It's our first victory.

858
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,640
Darcus is right. It might not be
pretty but we keep it going.

859
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,160
An idea float eventually by itself.

860
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,440
Me have a idea.

861
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,080
For real.

862
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:29,520
On Sunday the ninth
of August in North Kensington,

863
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,640
a demonstration took
place against the police

864
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:40,080
which degenerated into totally
inexcusable and unacceptable violence.

865
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,680
There may be some in here
who believe

866
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,320
that they have been the victim
of injustice

867
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,360
at the hands of the police.

868
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:53,480
But there are others who like
parasites feed on these beliefs.

869
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,960
And seek to turn them
to their own advantage.

870
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,560
Encouraging, and sometimes
deliberately creating

871
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,640
hate, mistrust and violence.

872
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,760
Ladies and gentlemen,

873
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,640
this was not just a flamboyant
demonstration that got out of control.

874
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:15,280
The crown will prove, that this
demonstration was led by those

875
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:19,680
intent on fanning what they
knew to be an emotional situation.

876
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:24,720
They egged on the violence
and deliberately joined in.

877
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,160
These defendants are all guilty

878
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:31,000
of the serious criminal offence
riot and affray.

879
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:34,360
My Lord, I detect a certain
vagueness in the way the prosecution

880
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:38,320
has brought this new charge of affray.
As a famous philosopher once said...

881
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,000
I am giving you enormous
latitude here, Mr Howe.

882
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,880
Sit down before I find you
in contempt of court.

883
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,920
And take that ridiculous hat off.

884
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,720
-Will you please proceed, Mr Hill.
-Thank you, My Lord.

885
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:44,040
Would you like to take
the affirmation or the oath?

886
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,360
The oath.

887
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:49,320
Please hold the Bible
and read the oath out aloud.

888
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:53,160
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give,

889
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:57,120
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

890
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,800
Please state your name and rank.

891
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,040
Police Constable, Frank Pulley.

892
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,520
PC Pulley, when did you
join the police force?

893
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,240
-Nineteen-fifty-four.
-Seventeen years ago.

894
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,880
And in all that time, how many
complaints have been made against you?

895
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:21,280
No more than is normal. Maybe
seven or eight official complaints.

896
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,040
None of them have been
substantiated.

897
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,800
And how many times have you
been commended for service

898
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,880
to Her Majesty's police force?

899
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,800
A few times. More than a few.

900
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,600
My Lord, my understanding
from you is that questions

901
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,440
are to be focused on matters
concerning the trial.

902
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,760
Madam, I think the jury
will understand

903
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,440
that this is a member
of the Metropolitan Police

904
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,640
and is to be respected as such....

905
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,560
As long as the defendants
are afforded

906
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,760
the same privileges
as PC Pulley, Your Lordship.

907
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,640
Mr MacDonald, sit down and
be quiet. Mr Hill, please continue.

908
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,560
Thank you, My Lord.
Do go on, PC Pulley.

909
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,560
About my commendations.

910
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,000
In nineteen-sixty-eight I received
the British Empire medal

911
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,960
for gallantry whilst on duty.

912
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,000
Thank you.

913
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,800
Can you describe your role
on the day of the demonstration?

914
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:17,000
At two-fifteen p.m., myself and
three other police constables,

915
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,920
PC Dixon, PC Royce and PC Johnson

916
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,560
went to the Mangrove
in an observation van.

917
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,200
For what purpose?

918
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,720
For the purpose of identifying people
who were involved in the demonstration.

919
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,720
We arrived just before Howe
addressed the crowd.

920
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,800
What did he say?

921
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,880
We were going back and forth
in our vehicle,

922
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,920
so I couldn't make any note
of what he said.

923
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,560
So the demonstration then set off
from All Saints Road

924
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,240
in the direction of Notting Dale
police station, correct?

925
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,760
Correct. With Howe and
Crichlow leading the way.

926
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,120
I did see them also leave
the main procession to try

927
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,200
and get more people to join in.

928
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,640
Millet was selling newspapers.

929
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:00,720
I saw him approach a black woman
with a half-caste child.

930
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,000
And she said to him

931
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:07,600
'Go away and leave us alone, man.
You stupid troublemakers.'

932
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,560
Did you hear his response?

933
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,680
Millet told her
'You better think black, baby.

934
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,360
Or you die with the white pigs
when the time comes.'

935
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,000
Liar. No...

936
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,840
THE PIGS THE PIGS HANDS OFF BLACK

937
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,640
Did you see what started
the fighting?

938
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:38,680
I did not, no. I saw Crichlow
and Howe talking together

939
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,560
before joining in the main fight.

940
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,320
Please describe their actions for
the courtroom as you recorded it.

941
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,680
They were acting like savages.

942
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,680
Howe was encouraging the mob and
standing on a brick wall screaming,

943
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,400
'Kill the white pigs.'

944
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,640
I saw Crichlow throw a piece
of wood right at an officer.

945
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,400
Him and LeCointe,
both throwing bricks and bottles.

946
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,320
How's Darcus coping in all this?

947
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:15,560
Yeah, okay. I think he's nervous
about his coming speech.

948
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,640
Not that Darcus. Darcus junior.

949
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:27,240
Yeah. He's teething,
you know, so he's not sleeping.

950
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,640
What if he's taken into care?
Like I was?

951
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,840
It's not going to happen.

952
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,840
Well, it will if both of his parents
get sent away. It will.

953
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:42,280
I'm scared too, you know.
But we have to have faith.

954
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,240
Faith in the British
justice system.

955
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,920
Yeah.
Yeah, there's a thought.

956
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:09,840
At least they can't take yours away
from you. Not whilst it's in there.

957
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:15,280
And they can't take yours either.
Not whilst he's in here.

958
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,080
You gon' eat a likkle, Frank?

959
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,840
Just now....

960
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,720
What you're doing' is a good ting,
you know.

961
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:24,560
Might not feel like it but... it is.

962
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:31,640
Everybody come together over this.
Have so much food...

963
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,880
I can't go to the jail-house, Dol.

964
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,760
Justice stay upon your side, eh?

965
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:41,880
My backside maybe.

966
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,440
Dice fix you up, man.
A game later tonight.

967
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,800
No. But don't make me stop
you lose your pension.

968
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,320
You me pension, Frank.

969
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,120
You and everybody else.

970
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:24,360
-Can you take him a minute, please?
-I can't, I working.

971
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,200
-Yeah, well I'm working too.
-Look, I can't hear myself think!

972
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,120
I'm trying to prepare for cross
examining Pulley,

973
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,960
can you just shut up!

974
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,000
Come on.

975
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,880
I have it.
I have them this time.

976
01:18:53,960 --> 01:19:00,560
My Lord. I am defending myself against
some very serious allegations

977
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:05,160
made by PC Pulley
and three other police officers

978
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,080
who were stationed in a van.

979
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,160
I would like to start by stating
my intention to question

980
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:18,480
the credibility of this witness,
PC Frank Pulley.

981
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,720
Noted.
Now is your opportunity.

982
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:33,160
May I ask, PC Pulley,
if you think

983
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:36,800
anybody who goes to the Mangrove
restaurant is already corrupted?

984
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,080
Yes, I believe so.

985
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,120
So frequent visitors like,

986
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:47,040
the local MP, Mr Bruce Douglas-Mann
are corrupted?

987
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,120
Is this what you are suggesting?

988
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,880
I don't know the local MP.

989
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,040
Are you suggesting I am corrupted?

990
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,280
I have been to the Mangrove
on several occasions.

991
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,080
I should think you are, yes.

992
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,480
I know the place to be a haunt
of criminals,

993
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,640
prostitutes,
ponces and the like.

994
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,560
I put it to you, that all your
comments on this case,

995
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:14,080
all the information you put
to the jury is rooted in prejudice.

996
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:18,040
It's rooted in experience of an area
I have served

997
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,240
as a police officer for
a considerable length of time.

998
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,000
-When did you join the police force?
-Nineteen-fifty-four.

999
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:30,400
Almost the same time as Detective
Inspector Stockwell joined too?

1000
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,800
Yes.

1001
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,120
And yet you are a constable still?

1002
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,960
That's correct.

1003
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:41,120
May I be so bold as to ask why you
have never risen through the ranks?

1004
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,480
I left school quite young.

1005
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,160
Truth is I've never been able to pass
the police examinations.

1006
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,320
My Lord, I cannot see the relevance.

1007
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,160
Mr Howe, please keep
to the incidents of August the ninth.

1008
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,880
Very well, my Lord.

1009
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,040
Police Constable Pulley,
you made a statement,

1010
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:07,960
that at the beginning of the
demonstration during the speeches

1011
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,840
that the crowd had started chanting.

1012
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,160
I ask you to compare your statement

1013
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,640
with that of your three other
colleagues present,

1014
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,760
who had made
no mention of chanting.

1015
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,160
They hadn't said they couldn't hear,
there is a difference.

1016
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:28,560
Did you and your other colleagues
in the observation van,

1017
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:32,400
did you write your statements
at the same time, in the same room?

1018
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:35,400
Yes, we did. When you work
in the same room, that's normal.

1019
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,200
Is it quite normal too,

1020
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,480
to decide together what to put in,
and what to leave out your statements?

1021
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,920
I'm not sure where you're going
with this, but we did no such thing.

1022
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,360
Of course not.

1023
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,680
Far be it from me
to imply such chicanery.

1024
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,440
PC Pulley, can you please confirm

1025
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:04,640
that this is the size of the slit
in the observation van?

1026
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,680
It's roughly the same I guess,
yeah.

1027
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:13,720
Very good guess, PC Pulley.
This is roughly the size of the slit.

1028
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,280
Two by eight inches....

1029
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:22,240
Not much bigger,
and not much smaller.

1030
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,920
It is your testament that you,

1031
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:32,040
PC Dixon and PC Johnson were
all looking through this same hole

1032
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,720
at the same time. Correct?

1033
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:46,080
-I'm sorry. Is that correct?
-Yes, that's correct.

1034
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,920
I would like to know, PC Pulley,

1035
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:55,600
how it is possible that even two men

1036
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,720
could look through this same hole
at the same time?

1037
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,000
Quiet, at once!

1038
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:12,600
It's possible if you... It's possible
if they both look through one eye.

1039
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:18,680
So, where was your face PC Pulley?

1040
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:22,400
Next to PC Royce
or next to PC Dixon?

1041
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,840
Was it like this?

1042
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,400
Or like this?

1043
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,600
Where was your face, Pulley?

1044
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,520
My Lord, please direct Mr Howe
to address the witness correctly.

1045
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,680
Constable Pulley, you know why
you are now being ridiculed?

1046
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,320
The image of four police officers

1047
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:42,320
behaving in such a manner is
worthy of ridicule, is it not?

1048
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,160
It could make a stuffed bird laugh.

1049
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,840
Could make a stuffed bird laugh.

1050
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,520
PC Pulley, I suggest that
substantial and important parts

1051
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,960
of your evidence are deliberate lies.

1052
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,640
Deliberate and conspiratorial lies,

1053
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:02,240
designed to have my freedom
taken away from me!

1054
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:13,240
So, where exactly
was your face then?

1055
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,880
Like this? Or perhaps like this?
Where was it?

1056
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,720
I don't remember.

1057
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,120
You don't remember.

1058
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,040
No.

1059
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:32,760
PC Royce, thirteen times you say,
you don't remember or you can't say.

1060
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:37,920
PC Pulley said thirty-three
times he didn't remember.

1061
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,160
PC Johnson, twenty-eight times.

1062
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:45,320
About seventy times the three
of you say, you can't remember.

1063
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,240
You were put
in a van to observe and record.

1064
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:52,120
From beginning to end,
in order to provide information

1065
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:55,000
that would give the truth
as to what took place.

1066
01:24:55,400 --> 01:25:02,120
I suggest you failed distinctly in your
responsibility to observe and record.

1067
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:08,920
Let me ask you again.
Where was your face, PC Royce?

1068
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,440
Where was your face?

1069
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:15,760
If you do not accept
responsibility now,

1070
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,360
history will bestow it upon you.

1071
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,440
Pulley's signalling at the witness.

1072
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,360
I seen him. Royce taking instruction
upon the witness stand.

1073
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,560
Is a breach ah court,
a court breach.

1074
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,960
Constable Pulley,
this is a very serious allegation.

1075
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,360
I must ask that you leave
the courtroom at once.

1076
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:33,520
Is only that? Shouldn't a crooked man
be lock up or something?

1077
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,920
Will the defendant
sit down at once!

1078
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,600
Mr Pulley....

1079
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,680
You will not return until your fellow
officers in the observation van

1080
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,840
have all given their evidence.

1081
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:48,040
You should consider yourself lucky
that no further action will be taken.

1082
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,640
No further questions, my Lord.

1083
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,600
Should have been bang-up if you ask me.
Least been given some licks.

1084
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:02,200
But if you hadn't shouted at the judge
we'd have had a much better chance

1085
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:03,440
at a sterner punishment.

1086
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,840
Don't give me a six for a nine.
Cause you is working for me.

1087
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,000
-Brother, no hot up you head now?
-Gonna cool down, boy?

1088
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,440
It's alright for you. The cunumunu
supposed to be working for me!

1089
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:14,960
Me done. Me don't need no counsel.
Go on! Get out my eyeball range!

1090
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,240
Rhodan.
Where you go to, boy?

1091
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:20,360
I'll represent myself.
If them two can, me can too.

1092
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:24,160
No disrespect, yah?
But ya sure you up for that?

1093
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:28,040
Altheia and Darcus they put
in the work, you know?

1094
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,440
And if you vex the judge,
that could do you more harm.

1095
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,440
That could do all ah we more harm.

1096
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,440
Frank! It's every man
for him own self.

1097
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:40,120
It's dem and we.

1098
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:03,800
Be upstanding in court.

1099
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,600
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence

1100
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:31,680
I shall give shall be the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

1101
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,240
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

1102
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,280
shall be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

1103
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,400
-State your name and rank.
-PC Charles Wheeler.

1104
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:29,520
-Where are you stationed?
-Notting Dale police station.

1105
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,960
And how long have you been serving
in the Metropolitan police?

1106
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,920
It's been about five years now.

1107
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,680
And in those five years, how many
complaints have been made against you?

1108
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,280
None. None at all.

1109
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,040
None? And how many
commendations?

1110
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,760
I've had three.

1111
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,880
Could you please tell the court what
the first commendation was for?

1112
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,840
I was involved in a rescue.

1113
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,880
A rescue? What sort of rescue?

1114
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:55,280
A father had abducted a...

1115
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,760
It's also repetitious and irrelevant.
Where is the justice?

1116
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,040
Sit down!

1117
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:03,800
No! No, no I won't. The officer
has nothing to do with the case.

1118
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:07,600
It is a complete waste of time!
Where is the justice?

1119
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,320
The officer has nothing
to do with the case.

1120
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:14,280
The officer has nothing to do
with the case.

1121
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,000
I am warning you.
Take control of your client.

1122
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,800
Silence in court!

1123
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,560
Silence!

1124
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,560
Nothing to do with the case!...

1125
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,320
Silence!

1126
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,480
If any, of the defendants...

1127
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,200
Whatever man,
it's a bloodclaat conspiracy, man!

1128
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:50,880
If any of the defendants continue
to disrupt these proceedings

1129
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,960
they will be taken downstairs!
Is that understood?

1130
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,320
To let emotions settle,

1131
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,880
we will continue with the Crown's
witness after an adjournment.

1132
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,160
-God's sake!
-Justice!

1133
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:07,760
-Bumbaclaat!
-Typical!

1134
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,080
Come on, now. Come on down.
Clear the court.

1135
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:13,400
-Ian!
-Yes?

1136
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,960
-Talk to me, boy.
-I said, clear the court!

1137
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,680
Take your hands off him!

1138
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,880
Darcus do not resist.
Don't resist! Darcus!

1139
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:33,560
Get in there!...

1140
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:39,760
What's wrong with you?

1141
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:45,760
Come on, then. Come on, then.
Fight me, come on!

1142
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:54,320
All of ya, come on! Fight me!

1143
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:56,760
Fight me!

1144
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:01,840
Ya savages!
All a' ya wicked men, ya wicked!

1145
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:09,360
Ya dutty mothers, nanas skunt.
Ya skunt. All ya wicked men.

1146
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,400
What's wrong with you?

1147
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,160
Come on! Come on!

1148
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:28,440
Ya dirty, ya dirt nanas skunt.

1149
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:32,920
Ya skunt. All you wicked,
you wicked men.

1150
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:37,480
Ya dirty, nasty skunt. Ya skunt!

1151
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:41,160
What's wrong with you!

1152
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,040
Let the court be upstanding.

1153
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,640
Your Honour.

1154
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:47,000
It's my Lord or Your Lordship.
Yes, Mr Howe.

1155
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,360
My Lord. I want to bring
a matter to your attention.

1156
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:00,240
Before the break, I was trying to speak
to my co-counsel, Mr MacDonald.

1157
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,960
As acting counsel,
I'm perfectly entitled to do this.

1158
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:07,600
When a prison officer,
suddenly went berserk,

1159
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,520
manhandling me worse than
if I were a convicted prisoner.

1160
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:16,840
So I said, 'hold on, please let me
have a few words with him.'

1161
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:22,480
Whereupon he dragged me to the top
there, slammed me down the stairs.

1162
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:27,240
I am now concerned
about my physical well-being

1163
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:31,160
which I had presumed safe
at the Old Bailey.

1164
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,240
Are there any witnesses
to these allegations?

1165
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:38,080
I can confirm that Mr Howe's version
of events is correct my Lord, yes.

1166
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:43,000
My Lord. My client Frank Crichlow was
also manhandled by court officers.

1167
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,400
Thank you, Mr Woodley, but
that is quite enough on this matter....

1168
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,680
Mr Howe, this should not have
been discussed in front of the jury....

1169
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:53,400
The jury must not be concerned
with external matters

1170
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,920
that have nothing at
all to do with this case.

1171
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:59,320
Please, find a way to purge
this from your minds.

1172
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:03,320
Your sole considerations are with
those events that happened last year

1173
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:05,360
on August the ninth on Portnall Road.

1174
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:08,800
My Lord. This is a matter
of the utmost seriousness.

1175
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,320
And all we are asking is that it
should be dealt with accordingly.

1176
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,400
And that is precisely what
this court intends to do.

1177
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:20,440
But according to the law. I insist
that you apologise for your rudeness.

1178
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:25,760
I'll apologise to His Lordship, when
His Lordship apologises to Mr Howe.

1179
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:32,720
Mr Mendel, after the break I suggest
all court officers be replaced.

1180
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,800
I see the matter ending there.

1181
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,920
The aerobic and anaerobic organisms
transmitted by the mouth

1182
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,800
when human teeth pierce or lacerate
the skin can cause cellulitis,

1183
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,280
an infection that...

1184
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,000
Thank you, Dr Chadee.

1185
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:54,800
Where in your statement do you mention
punctures or lacerations to the skin?

1186
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,600
Nowhere in your statement.

1187
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:04,000
You only talk of bite marks
and indentations to the skin.

1188
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:09,480
Now can you tell the courtroom,
how many days after the demonstration,

1189
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,920
and my subsequent arrest
on the ninth of August,

1190
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,960
was it before you examined
the police officers?

1191
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,400
And if you need any sort of help,

1192
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,280
it is written clearly at the top of
your statement.

1193
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:26,960
-Four days.
-Sorry, so we can all hear.

1194
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:31,080
Four days later.

1195
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,440
Four days later?

1196
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,600
Thank you. So my question is this.

1197
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:43,360
In your expert medical opinion,
how much time do you have,

1198
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:47,880
once these bite marks,
these indentations have been inflicted

1199
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,880
to precisely identify
when they were made.

1200
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,800
Oh, gosh. You quiet.

1201
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,320
It's not a trick question.
Shall I repeat it for you?

1202
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:11,080
Three hours.
About three hours.

1203
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:14,960
And so, after three hours,

1204
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:20,240
it is no longer possible to tell when
the bite marks were made, correct?

1205
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:26,000
I've been accused of biting a
police officer who was examined by you

1206
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,600
four days after the events,
Dr Chadee.

1207
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:35,200
Four days! Someone is obviously lying
in this courtroom. Is it you?

1208
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,360
My Lord, I must object to the phrase
used in the line of questioning.

1209
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:41,400
Please rephrase your question
Miss Jones-LeCointe.

1210
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,760
Seems like a fitting way
to end a prosecution's case

1211
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:51,720
if you ask me, My Lord.

1212
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,160
No further questions.

1213
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,880
Dr Chadee, you may stand down.

1214
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:02,200
Now that the prosecution's
case has come to an end,

1215
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:07,680
we will adjourn for a few days while
legal submissions are made.

1216
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:11,400
What they gonna do to try
and get us this time?

1217
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:17,640
Forgive me, My Lord,
but it is evidently clear

1218
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,760
that there are pronounced
contradictions and inconsistencies

1219
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,920
between the Crown
and prosecution.

1220
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,920
Therefore, if it please
Your Lordship,

1221
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,920
the defence submit that the
prosecution's case should not proceed,

1222
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,560
that there is no case to answer,

1223
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:33,480
and that these matters should
not be left with a jury.

1224
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:38,440
Much as there is a temptation to remove
your presence from this court.

1225
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:41,480
I find there is a Prima facie
case to be made.

1226
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,360
I reject your submission.

1227
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:48,920
Be upstanding in court.

1228
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,280
I don't wanna go to jail.

1229
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,440
The only crime you've committed
is to give a space to these people.

1230
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,000
You're a law-abiding citizen.

1231
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:54,360
Your premises were overrun
by a bunch of agitators.

1232
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:55,960
What ya really saying, man?

1233
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,520
I can't help these people,
Mr Crichlow.

1234
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,960
But I can help you,
if you plead guilty.

1235
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,400
Is what he telling you, Frank?

1236
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:12,600
Look how you screwing up your face.
Is what he telling you to do?

1237
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,600
Plead guilty.

1238
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:24,880
Plead what?
Is that what you said for real?

1239
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:28,360
Mrs Jones-LeCointe, these are very
serious charges

1240
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:30,720
and now that you all have to give
testimony on the witness stand.

1241
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,240
I think it highly likely you
will be found guilty!

1242
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:36,880
All a' ya wicked.
You flipping...

1243
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,320
-What you say? Plead what?
-Guilty.

1244
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:42,200
All ya better take this
fricking man out my face.

1245
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,800
Move out my face!

1246
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,760
Is that what you gon' do?

1247
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:52,920
You can't be doing that.

1248
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:58,320
Not now, you can't, Frank.
He trying to divide us.

1249
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,120
For four-hundred years people like him

1250
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:04,120
trying to divide our people,
undermine us.

1251
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:10,880
This trial is another way
of doing that.

1252
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:15,240
Of destroying a strong black
movement in this country.

1253
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:20,600
We have to stick together.
As a collective.

1254
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,720
The Mangrove Nine.
As a people.

1255
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:26,120
It's what you telling me, boy?

1256
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,840
That's all that matters.

1257
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,120
I don't get it.

1258
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:37,720
You want to sit in a courthouse
for the next six weeks

1259
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,400
so we can get more time in jail?

1260
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,840
I don't want go to jail.
You understand?

1261
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,840
These people, they like vampires.

1262
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:52,880
You think you beat them, but they keep
coming back and back, again, again.

1263
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,840
It's like a silver bullet ain't enough.

1264
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:59,120
You have to stick them
through the heart.

1265
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:02,200
Then get the garlic,
then chop off their head too.

1266
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,880
It's never enough.

1267
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:07,280
The best we can hope
for is a draw. A draw.

1268
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,240
The system rigged. It's rotten.

1269
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:16,760
And what are we fighting for, huh?
For what, Altheia?...

1270
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:20,920
For my unborn child.

1271
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,480
That's what.

1272
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:33,760
All of this...

1273
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:39,800
All of our fight...
It counts beyond us here.

1274
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,680
This trial is more than just
about our freedom.

1275
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:50,560
What is being called into question
in this case is the right of anybody,

1276
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:54,760
not just us as black people, but
the right of anybody to demonstrate.

1277
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:01,320
I'm not just here defending myself,
but trying to defend all of us.

1278
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:05,600
But if we fold now and we let,
and we let them take over,

1279
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:08,440
and we give in to them,
they will take it all from us.

1280
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:12,000
And they will take it
from our children, too.

1281
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:21,040
We are the example,
and we must bear this responsibility.

1282
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:28,280
Please, if all ya want
to take your plea, you take it.

1283
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,680
As is your right to.

1284
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,840
What's the matter?

1285
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,080
Nothing.

1286
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,960
Come back to bed.

1287
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:06,040
-So where were you then?
-I told you, Portnall.

1288
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:07,960
Speak up, Mr Crichlow.

1289
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:10,800
If I can't hear you, how can the jury
be expected to?

1290
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:13,480
I was on Portnall Road.

1291
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,280
Where the fighting was?

1292
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:18,480
So you went there deliberately to get
involved in the fighting,

1293
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:21,080
which had by then, you say,
already started?

1294
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:24,320
No, I told you. I already knew
where the march was headed....

1295
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,520
Because you organised
the demonstration?

1296
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:29,200
Because I was on the organising
committee, yes.

1297
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,840
But, it was an accident
that we meet when we did.

1298
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:33,400
So, let me get this correct.

1299
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:35,760
You knew exactly
where the march was going

1300
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:40,000
but it was just an accident that you
joined up with it again when you did?

1301
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,680
-The whole thing was an accident.
-An accident?

1302
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:46,760
Even the Chief Inspector say so.
You don't know Notting Hill.

1303
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,440
-Possibly not.
-You understand nothing.

1304
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:52,000
What I would strongly suggest,
Mr Crichlow,

1305
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:54,600
is that you were at the heart
of the disturbance,

1306
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:56,360
and one of its chief agitators.

1307
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:58,760
Well, like I said,
you understand nothing.

1308
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:02,680
-You already knew PC Pulley?
-What you yapping, man?

1309
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:05,880
Everyone know the heavy mob
in Notting Hill.

1310
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:09,280
So please describe PC Pulley's
standing in the community.

1311
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:11,720
His standing?

1312
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,480
Forgive me,
members of the jury.

1313
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:20,400
I find it difficult to control myself
when the prosecutor chat

1314
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,320
about the stature of Pulley.

1315
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:24,720
I have known that man for ten years

1316
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:30,320
and no bigger bully, no greater thug,
no greater gangster plant him big foot

1317
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:32,840
in the Notting Hill in all that time.

1318
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:34,280
No, sir.

1319
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:38,280
Mr Gordon, I am once again granting
an enormous amount of latitude here.

1320
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:40,320
Channa man!

1321
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,920
Mr Gordon.

1322
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,560
I was not holding the pig's
head at that point.

1323
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:47,840
What were you holding?

1324
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:50,600
A placard that said,
'Hands off Black people.'

1325
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:53,560
And then a man came
and snatched it away from me.

1326
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:57,640
A white man, tall and heavily built.
He looked like a lunatic.

1327
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:01,040
I asked him what the hell
he thought he was doing,

1328
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:03,160
but he just broke
the placard over his knee.

1329
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:04,880
So I tried to get it back from him.

1330
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,400
You tried to get it back from him,

1331
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:09,080
even though, as you say,
he looked like a lunatic.

1332
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:12,440
Not afraid of loons. Been surrounded
by them all my life.

1333
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:14,360
So you attacked the man?

1334
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,840
No, I did not. Before I knew it,
I was being arrested.

1335
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,480
Did you resist arrest?

1336
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:23,440
Course I resisted arrest.
Done nothing wrong, had I?

1337
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,800
Did you ask where the demonstration
was going?

1338
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:29,440
No. I hung around
to show my solidarity.

1339
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,520
You see, I wasn't too concerned
with where it was going

1340
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:35,840
because I'd always intended to get
myself down to prayer meeting

1341
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:38,080
down at Acklam Road
at three-thirty.

1342
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:40,000
-Hallelujah.
-Yeah, man....

1343
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:44,960
But whilst on All Saints Road,
did you join in with the chants?

1344
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:48,280
No, I did not. Although it is true
that me daughter,

1345
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:50,840
she did like the one that went

1346
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:55,160
'The pigs. The pigs.
We have to get rid of the pigs.'

1347
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,040
Mr Caboo, please take the stand....

1348
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:05,480
I am not Roy Caboo,
as identified by the arrest warrant.

1349
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:08,640
My name is Godfrey Millett.

1350
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:13,120
But, in fact and truth,
Millett is only my slave name....

1351
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,800
I myself deny all the charges
made against me.

1352
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:20,240
I do also deny saying to a black woman,

1353
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:24,600
'Think black, baby, or die with
the white pigs, when the time comes.'

1354
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:28,160
I am innocent of all the charges.

1355
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:42,520
Over the past eleven weeks,
you have heard expressions of passion,

1356
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:46,920
of emotion and perhaps of prejudice.

1357
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:52,120
There was nothing illegal in police
searching the Mangrove restaurant.

1358
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:57,240
They were acting within the law.
And yet, members of the jury,

1359
01:48:57,920 --> 01:48:59,440
you are here being asked

1360
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:04,040
if you accept the testimony of the
Metropolitan policemen as truth?

1361
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:07,200
The prosecution invites you
to say that you do.

1362
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,680
Because they are officers of the law
in whom you can

1363
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:13,600
and should place an absolute trust.

1364
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,960
There is no grey area
about PC Pulley.

1365
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:21,240
PC Pulley is either telling the truth,
or he is totally dishonest.

1366
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:25,360
Do you really imagine that police
officers would take the risk

1367
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:29,560
of making up evidence?
Of course not. They wouldn't dare.

1368
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:34,320
The prosecution contends
that this demonstration,

1369
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:39,920
organised and inflamed by the men
and women in the dock before you today,

1370
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:43,040
was violent in manner and in tone.

1371
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:47,120
It was mounted generally
and specifically against the police,

1372
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:50,760
and in favour of what is called
'the black community.'

1373
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:55,960
We have heard from distinguished
witnesses who described

1374
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:59,360
a 'screaming mob',
that were 'behaving like savages'.

1375
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:04,720
Like savages.
The prosecution says that you can rely

1376
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:07,840
on the testimony of an experienced
police officer,

1377
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:13,480
and, difficult as it may be, that you
are bound to accept his evidence

1378
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:17,600
and faithfully to return your
verdict, of guilty.

1379
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:23,040
That is the case for the Crown.

1380
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:38,320
-Go on, Darcus.
-Silence....

1381
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,280
The time is out of joint....

1382
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:58,640
Oh cursed spite,

1383
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:06,720
that ever a black people,
were born to set it right....

1384
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:18,760
We say it's closing time....

1385
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:23,760
But in a certain sense,
the matter has just begun.

1386
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:30,840
For I believe that this case has opened
issues which are likely to decide

1387
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:35,480
the shape and future
of British society.

1388
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:38,760
I believe. And Europe.

1389
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:42,960
I believe that this case
has opened issues.

1390
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:47,120
It has seared the consciousness
of the Black community to an extent

1391
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:51,320
that the history of Britain cannot
now be written without it.

1392
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:59,000
I want to make myself abundantly clear.

1393
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:06,240
Whatever verdict you come to,
I mean it when I say, 'I don't care.'

1394
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:11,640
I don't care because I believe
history is on my side.

1395
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:16,560
That if riot and affray carries that
maximum sentence,

1396
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:21,560
the sky's the limit. I don't care.
I don't care. I don't care!

1397
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:30,960
I stand accused of riot and affray.
No.

1398
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:36,240
I stand here accusing those
who've been involved in conspiracy.

1399
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,280
That's my position.

1400
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:40,920
It's closing time....

1401
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:44,520
Now you have heard
an awful lot about the Mangrove.

1402
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:50,040
It has been portrayed by the
prosecution as an ordinary restaurant

1403
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,120
with licensing problems.

1404
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,440
How ignorant can people get?...

1405
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:57,760
How superficial,
and surface-like can people be?

1406
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:00,840
It's not his fault. His masters' fault.

1407
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:06,120
Black people are criminals,
ponces and prostitutes.

1408
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:10,000
That is a myth that has been
created about us.

1409
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:13,600
That was a statement that was made
by one police officer

1410
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:15,920
who gave evidence during
this trial.

1411
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:21,400
But I submit to you that
Notting Hill is a very unique community

1412
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:25,040
where many people
from the West Indies live.

1413
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:29,400
It is a community that was born
out of a resistance

1414
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:32,840
to a series of backward attacks from
the police

1415
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:36,840
that had nothing to do
with the advanced ideas

1416
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:40,640
and values going around
in the twentieth century.

1417
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:45,760
It has something that was located
somewhere

1418
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:51,360
in the stench of British colonialism.
His masters again.

1419
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:55,840
In defending themselves against
attack a community is born.

1420
01:53:56,160 --> 01:54:00,880
And wherever a community is born it
creates institutions that it needs.

1421
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:05,080
Frank Crichlow.

1422
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:10,120
He wasn't conscious of the fact that he
was forming a community restaurant.

1423
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:15,640
But that sense of community,
born out of struggle in Notting Hill,

1424
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:19,800
was so profound that there was
no other way for it to be

1425
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,960
but a community restaurant.

1426
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:25,240
We created the Mangrove.
We shaped it....

1427
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:28,160
We formed it to satisfy
our needs....

1428
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:31,440
The Mangrove is ours.
It is ours....

1429
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:34,880
It's not Frank's. He lost
it to the community, he knows that.

1430
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:39,960
And so when the Mangrove came
under attack from the police.

1431
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:44,760
Not once, not twice but three times,
members of the jury. Three times!

1432
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:47,760
We said no more.

1433
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:52,600
I have been forced to take a stand
and to take a stand I will.

1434
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:58,720
They prefer to call a riot
and affray inquiry

1435
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,120
instead of an inquiry
into the police.

1436
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:04,040
They prefer that,
but let it be, eh?...

1437
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:07,640
It's closing time....

1438
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:13,000
It's closing time....

1439
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:18,520
History will take its course,
so frequently a brutal one,

1440
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:22,760
and we will continue to resist
intelligently and reasonably.

1441
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:26,440
That is what the demonstration
was about.

1442
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:32,280
An intelligent and reasonable
resistance to certain concrete facts.

1443
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:03,160
Members of the jury.

1444
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:07,640
After what has been an unusually
wearisome case,

1445
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:10,640
a long eleven weeks in court,

1446
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:14,960
at last comes the time for you
to consider your verdicts.

1447
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:20,600
There have been many attacks
on people during this trial.

1448
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:23,280
The prosecution accused of prejudice.

1449
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:27,560
And you the jury told that
only two among you,

1450
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:31,520
the two black members,
are in a position to judge.

1451
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:37,320
If any of the counsel have overstepped
the bounds of propriety

1452
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:38,760
in their remarks,

1453
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:41,640
you should not hold that
against the defendant.

1454
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:47,800
You have sworn on oaths to try this
case on the evidence you have heard.

1455
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:52,920
Do not count uniforms,
and most important,

1456
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:57,480
do not take into account
the colour of anyone's skin.

1457
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:55,640
Silence.
Be upstanding in court....

1458
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:20,200
Will the first defendant,
Mr Crichlow, please stand.

1459
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:28,560
Will the foreman
of the jury please stand.

1460
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:33,720
Have you reached any verdicts
upon which you are all agreed?

1461
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:35,760
We have....

1462
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:38,080
On count one,
the charge of riot,

1463
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:41,160
how do you find the first defendant,
Mr Crichlow?

1464
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:43,160
Not guilty....

1465
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:48,520
On count two, affray, how do you
find the first defendant, Mr Crichlow?

1466
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:50,480
Not guilty....

1467
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:57,880
Will the second defendant,
Mr Howe, please stand.

1468
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:02,200
On count one, the charge of riot,

1469
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:05,120
how do you find the second defendant,
Mr Howe?

1470
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:07,000
Not guilty....

1471
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:13,000
On count two, affray, how do you
find the second defendant, Mr Howe?

1472
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:15,160
Not guilty....

1473
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:20,480
Will the third defendant,
Miss Beese, please stand.

1474
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:24,920
On count one, the charge of riot,

1475
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:27,920
how do you find the third defendant,
Miss Beese?

1476
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,480
Not guilty....

1477
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:33,600
On count two, affray, how do you
find the third defendant, Miss Beese?

1478
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:35,720
Not guilty....

1479
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:41,200
Will the fourth defendant,
Miss Jones-LeCointe, please stand.

1480
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:44,200
On count one, the charge of riot,

1481
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:47,880
how do you find the fourth defendant,
Althea Jones-LeCointe?

1482
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:49,640
Not guilty....

1483
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:52,120
On count two, affray, how do you
find the fourth defendant...

1484
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:57,200
This has been a very unpleasant
experience for everyone concerned.

1485
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:01,480
Regrettably,
what this trial has shown

1486
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:06,280
is that there is evidence of racial
hatred on both sides....

1487
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:11,680
The penalties I am going to impose

1488
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:14,680
on the four defendants guilty
of the lesser charges,

1489
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:20,880
are imposed in a spirit
of this particular season of the year,

1490
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:28,920
which should be a season for promoting
peace and goodwill to all men...

1491
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:35,520
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I wasn't sure,
you know. I wasn't sure...

1492
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:37,320
Congratulations.

1493
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,560
Barbara.

1494
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:45,040
-Yes, Frank!
-Thank you.

1495
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:47,920
-Mrs Tetley, you reach?...
-Reach long time....

1496
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:49,760
Lovely....

1497
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:29,520
We have three jury inside of there
and they celebrating. With us.

1498
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:31,840
You told me.

1499
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:33,960
I never see the like.

1500
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:37,600
We might ah won the battle, Frank.

1501
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:39,480
But we'll see about the war.

1502
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:46,040
I can't suffer another winter here,
boss. I going back home.

1503
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:50,680
This we home, Dol.
The Mangrove.

1504
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,560
I going back inside.

1505
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:05,280
Yes, Frank!

1506
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,280
-Granville?...
-Liming at last.

1507
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:12,520
Respect, Frank.
Respect, brother.

1508
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,240
Little roll on the dice to celebrate?

1509
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:19,160
I will catch ya soon yeah,
Granville....

1510
02:03:57,640 --> 02:04:00,120
The Mangrove restaurant and Frank
Crichlow continued to be harassed

1511
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:01,840
for a further eighteen years.

1512

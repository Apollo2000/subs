the circulation is limited,

822
00:41:22,963 --> 00:41:26,197
but the potency of this marker
is on par with a stroke victim.

823
00:41:26,363 --> 00:41:28,029
So you think we all had strokes?

824
00:41:28,198 --> 00:41:29,498
No, not exactly.

825
00:41:29,658 --> 00:41:32,071
If we were taken close to death...

826
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:34,063
extremely close
and then brought back...

827
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,977
if the faucet of blood
circulation has been turned off

828
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,807
and then suddenly it
was turned on high,

829
00:41:38,894 --> 00:41:40,375
that's what it would look like.

830
00:41:40,561 --> 00:41:42,807
Interesting theory.
How do we know for sure?

831
00:41:42,941 --> 00:41:46,281
Right, so my thinking was if
I had some brain tissue,

832
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:47,992
I could test for that rebound.

833
00:41:48,129 --> 00:41:50,095
If they take a sample
during an autopsy,

834
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,403
maybe I could have some access.

835
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:53,400
You're thinking of Kelly Taylor.

836
00:41:53,957 --> 00:41:55,733
So, I logged into the M.E.'s database.

837
00:41:55,758 --> 00:41:57,475
These are all the bodies that
have been registered

838
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,052
in the Long Island morgue
in the last 48 hours.

839
00:42:00,196 --> 00:42:02,163
There is no Kelly Taylor.

840
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:04,593
I've looked everywhere.
She's not in the system.

841
00:42:04,681 --> 00:42:06,147
And then when I do a search...

842
00:42:15,345 --> 00:42:18,316
That's why the feds stepped in.
They wanted Kelly's body.

843
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:23,385
Where is she?

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,697
Previously on "Manifest"...

2
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:04,322
Police! Hands where I can
see them! Down on the ground!

3
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:05,890
The pain I'll bring down on you,

4
00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:07,992
a holy vengeance like
nothing you've ever seen.

5
00:00:07,994 --> 00:00:09,594
Let him go.

6
00:00:09,596 --> 00:00:13,005
At the bust, I got a Calling
that told me to "let him go".

7
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:15,700
And I didn't. I've never
defied a Calling before.

8
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:17,569
I think you made the right choice.

9
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:19,003
Zeke, what is this?

10
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:20,895
Frostbite. I may be freezing to death.

11
00:00:20,897 --> 00:00:22,153
Saanvi thinks she can help.

12
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,444
I'm sorry, Dr. Bahl,

13
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:25,035
but I'm afraid we have
to ask you to leave.

14
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:26,626
Who authorized this?!

15
00:00:26,628 --> 00:00:30,833
Will you marry me, Michaela?

16
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:33,924
Yes. Yes, I will.

17
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,122
What's this one?

18
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:37,914
It was the first one I ever drew,

19
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,972
and I actually never
figured out what it meant.

20
00:00:52,155 --> 00:00:54,690
Am I supposed to be scared of you?

21
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,557
'Cause staring daggers at
me doesn't change the fact

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,127
that we found over
$1 million worth of meth

23
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:03,529
in your place, Jace.

24
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,664
I'm just thinking about the best way.

25
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,473
The best way to what?

26
00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:10,164
To hurt you the most.

27
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:12,056
You see, I don't forgive.

28
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:14,581
And I don't forget.

29
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,741
I get not turning on
your little brother.

30
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:20,099
But, I mean, Kory?

31
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:23,459
I mean... why'd he even keep you around?

32
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:27,720
You're a liability, slab
of meat with a temper.

33
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:30,045
At least that's what he said.

34
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:31,803
I'm sorry. What did you just say?

35
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:33,595
You're telling me you're not
the mastermind behind all this?

36
00:01:33,597 --> 00:01:35,553
You have a vivid imagination, detective.

37
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:36,644
I'm just a bus driver.

38
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:38,703
Oh, you wanna play dumb?

39
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:40,461
Oh. Well, fine by me.

40
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:42,019
I mean, you're gonna
go to prison for so long

41
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:43,710
you're gonna forget what
a bus actually looks like,

42
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:45,668
much less drive one.

43
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,093
Or...

44
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:48,793
you can tell me what you
know about your partners,

45
00:01:48,795 --> 00:01:50,418
and we can cut a deal.

46
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,543
But I don't know anything!

47
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,234
I know you're scared.

48
00:01:54,236 --> 00:01:57,560
And I know you've had a
clean sheet up until now.

49
00:01:57,562 --> 00:01:58,785
So, what?

50
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:01,544
So, I want to help you.

51
00:02:01,546 --> 00:02:03,235
But you need to help me first.

52
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,910
I can't.

53
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,578
Three for three.

54
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,146
Looks like no one's caving tonight.

55
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:20,014
Nope.

56
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:21,649
- You alright?
- No, of course not.

57
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:23,751
I mean, you've seen the way
that these cases play out.

58
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:25,687
Separate trials, different
defense attorneys

59
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,355
all claiming that their
client doesn't know anything

60
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:30,425
while pointing at an empty
chair creates reasonable doubt.

61
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:31,949
They all walk.

62
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,708
That all that's bugging you?

63
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,169
The way that Jace looks at me,
the way that he talks to me,

64
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:41,561
it's like he can see right through me.

65
00:02:41,563 --> 00:02:43,320
- It's like he knows that...
- You think...

66
00:02:43,322 --> 00:02:45,278
it's connected to the Calling?

67
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,436
- "Let him go"?
- I don't know.

68
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:49,248
Well, let's let 'em
sweat it out overnight.

69
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,016
We'll take another stab
at them in the morning

70
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:52,284
before they get on the bus to Rikers.

71
00:02:52,286 --> 00:02:55,520
Um, yeah, small problem.
I'm... I'm not available.

72
00:02:55,522 --> 00:02:57,189
What?

73
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,358
You were all fired up, wanting answers.

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,715
Where do you have to be
that's more important?

75
00:03:00,717 --> 00:03:02,640
I'm getting married.

76
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,204
Wow.

77
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:18,388
Tomorrow?

78
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,401
Zeke's dying, J. He's got two days left.

79
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:23,736
I shouldn't even be here,
but I can't help but feel

80
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:26,239
like Jace knows something...

81
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:30,009
something that could help save Zeke.

82
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:31,778
I'm sorry, Mick.

83
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,480
He wants a final celebration,

84
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:39,086
instead of being hooked up to
the machines at the hospital.

85
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:40,811
Look, I'm... I'm sorry. I...

86
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:42,836
The last thing that I want
to do is cause you pain.

87
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:44,728
Grace asked if I wanted to invite you.

88
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,386
I told her I didn't
even want to tell you,

89
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:49,445
- let alone have you stand there at...
- Mick, Mick, Mick, Mick.

90
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:51,147
It's okay.

91
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,713
I'll be there.

92
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:00,886
What can I do?

93
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,324
Get me a conviction.

94
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:11,954
Whatcha watching?

95
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:15,323
Aah! You snuck up on me!

96
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:17,715
Sorry. You wanted me to drop by.

97
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:20,174
Early wedding present.

98
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,967
I had to crawl through
the attic to find this.

99
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:24,492
Hey, you got it?

100
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:27,084
Wow! Look at that, Daddy!

101
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:29,643
Look at the camera, Michaela. Big smile!

102
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,334
There you go!

103
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:34,694
Isn't she beautiful? Look at you!

104
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:39,311
Oh! Isn't she great, daddy?

105
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:40,569
Okay, you ready?

106
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,126
Here we go.

107
00:04:45,722 --> 00:04:48,246
Show daddy how beautiful you are.

108
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:49,737
You're my girl.

109
00:04:57,788 --> 00:04:59,644
You should wear mom's dress.

110
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:02,070
Or veil. At least, you know,

111
00:05:02,072 --> 00:05:03,995
a part of her will
be with you in spirit.

112
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:05,853
Yeah, I thought about that, um...

113
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:10,360
but dad got rid of all
her stuff when she died.

114
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:13,997
Guess the memories were too much.

115
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:16,867
Kind of like how this
might be too much for me.

116
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:18,292
I guess I...

117
00:05:18,294 --> 00:05:19,915
I didn't fully process that saying yes

118
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:22,541
meant letting him pull
the plug on his own life.

119
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:24,199
Why does it have to mean that?

120
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:25,790
'Cause that's what he
wants. I mean, he...

121
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,448
If I call off the weeding

122
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,940
and force him back into the hospital,

123
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:31,498
he will never forgive me.

124
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:36,792
She'd know what to do.

126
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,742
Dr. Cardoso!

127
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:31,044
I need to get into my lab.
My research is in there.

128
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:32,112
You need to reinstate me.

129
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:33,313
I can't discuss this. I'm sorry.

130
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:35,182
Please. I'm begging you.

131
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:37,418
There are gravely ill
patients who I need to treat

132
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,153
who will die without my intervention.

133
00:06:39,155 --> 00:06:40,788
Do you want their blood on your hands?

134
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,045
I want to help you, Saanvi. I do.

135
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:44,995
So, believe me when I say,
the decision to fire you

136
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:46,786
was made by people
well above my pay grade.

137
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:48,044
But you're the chair of the department.

138
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:49,702
I can't revoke people's licenses.

139
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:51,961
Only the NIH can do that.

140
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:53,252
Is there anyone in the government

141
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:55,777
who has a reason to shut you down?

142
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:10,191
_

143
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,837
- Michaela Beth...
- _

144
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,772
even people that have made mistakes

145
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:25,974
deserve happiness.

146
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,711
You know my favorite verse...

147
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:32,013
"All things work together for good".

148
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:33,514
Couldn't sleep?

149
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:35,650
I've already got you
beat on the cold feet.

150
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:37,008
It's a big day.

151
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,432
There's lots to think about.

152
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:39,634
Yeah.

153
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:50,142
Your going through with
this means the world to me.

154
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:53,613
Having our families
together, celebrating us...

155
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:55,181
that's the memory I want to hold onto.

156
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,450
You get that, right?

157
00:07:57,452 --> 00:07:59,018
I do, but...

158
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,585
you can have all of that

159
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:04,311
and still do a quick
round of treatments.

160
00:08:06,005 --> 00:08:08,987
No more meds. No more needles.

161
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,490
Just an epic wedding, a honeymoon,

162
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,193
and a last night in your arms.

163
00:08:20,586 --> 00:08:22,887
Do you have any idea where
your mom keeps the sheet pans?

164
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:25,190
Not since my dad
turned our entire garage

165
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:27,058
into the Upside Down.

166
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:30,625
I'm gonna look over here.

167
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,466
So, uh... winter break's coming up,

168
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:38,069
and I was wondering if
you wanted to go skiing.

169
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:40,461
Oh, uh... I'm not really into skiing.

170
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:43,287
Okay, well, I'm open to any other ideas.

171
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,112
Yeah, maybe we can
talk about this later.

172
00:08:45,114 --> 00:08:46,503
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,962
It's just hard to focus with the wedding

174
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:50,653
and finals.

175
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:55,271
Found them.

176
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:01,934
The bride and groom!

177
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:03,592
Hi, you guys.

178
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:05,050
Come on in.

179
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:06,151
Thank you.

180
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,137
So...

181
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:14,158
Team Stone has been full steam ahead.

182
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,327
I've got all the mushroom
puffs, blinis, and tartlets

183
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:19,163
your little hearts could desire.

184
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:22,189
- And Ben has been in construction mode...
- Oh.

185
00:09:22,191 --> 00:09:24,007
- ... since the crack of dawn.
- Yeah, no, of course he has.

186
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:26,143
I mean, has the protractor come out?

187
00:09:33,437 --> 00:09:34,470
Hey, bud.

188
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:35,938
How's it going?

189
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,173
Good.

190
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:48,017
I'm getting a Calling.

191
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:50,686
Cal is lying his butt off.

192
00:09:52,313 --> 00:09:55,971
Talk to me.

193
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:58,597
I thought weddings
were supposed to be fun,

194
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,133
but what's fun about...

195
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:04,331
Me dying?

196
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,633
Yeah.

197
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:08,034
But hey...

198
00:10:08,036 --> 00:10:09,703
we still have some time together.

199
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:11,304
And we haven't even done the best part

200
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:13,807
of planning a wedding...
the bachelor party.

201
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:15,432
Seriously?

202
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:17,123
You're my best man.

203
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,582
You gotta throw me a killer party.

204
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,273
You in?

205
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,649
Looks pretty good, huh?

206
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:29,807
Uh... yeah.

207
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:31,332
Your dad's coming to the rescue.

208
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:32,823
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

209
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:35,015
Yeah, it's gonna look great once we...

210
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:41,986
Ben? Ben?!

211
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:43,443
Hey, you okay?

212
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:47,093
No.

213
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:49,852
Flight 828... It...

214
00:10:49,854 --> 00:10:53,022
It just... blew up all over again.

215
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:56,594
What's the plane blowing up
supposed to mean?

216
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:59,386
It's gotta be a sign.
The question is, of what?

217
00:10:59,388 --> 00:11:00,877
I mean, you said it yourself.

218
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,052
Maybe the Callings are
trying to teach us something.

219
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:04,777
Why else would you get
a vision of the plane

220
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,502
right before Zeke's Death Date?

221
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:10,351
But Zeke wasn't on the plane, Mick.

222
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:12,549
- I-I think you're grasping.
- Ben, for months, you've been saying

223
00:11:12,551 --> 00:11:14,245
that our only hope
of surviving the Death Date

224
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:15,715
is by following these Callings.

225
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,835
I know, okay? I know it's a long shot,

226
00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:19,393
but if there's any way of saving Zeke,

227
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:22,288
you got to figure out what it means.

228
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,522
Alright.

229
00:11:23,524 --> 00:11:25,028
I'll drive out to the airport.

230
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,940
I'll see if there's maybe something

231
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:28,394
at the explosion site.

232
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,463
Just please be back in
time for the wedding.

233
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:32,698
Promise. I'll be there.

234
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,833
Thank you.

235
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:38,838
- Ohh!
- After the sugar rush

236
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,007
comes the sugar crash.

237
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:42,541
I'm gonna need a nap.

238
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:44,210
We're not done yet.

239
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:49,915
Monopoly?

240
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,651
Haven't played this in ages.

241
00:11:51,653 --> 00:11:53,886
I don't know if we
have time, though, bud.

242
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:55,855
We should... We should probably
get downstairs and help set up.

243
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:58,157
How many more chances are
you gonna have to play?

244
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,392
Alright.

245
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:00,760
Let's go.

246
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,731
Do you think there
might be a way for you

247
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:06,899
to beat the Death Date?

248
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:08,701
I don't know.

249
00:12:08,703 --> 00:12:10,169
What do you think?

250
00:12:10,171 --> 00:12:12,838
Well... before the plane disappeared,

251
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,407
no one thought I could beat cancer,

252
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:17,343
but here I am.

253
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:19,378
True.

254
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,447
Somehow I think this is
a little bit different.

255
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:35,594
You threw me the best bachelor party

256
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:37,063
I could ask for.

257
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,867
Too bad I'm gonna have
to crush you at Monopoly.

258
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:43,636
You think you're gonna beat me?

259
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,304
Please!

260
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,941
I call the race car.

261
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:50,781
This is certainly an unusual case.

262
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:52,485
In fact, the Chief of Police told us

263
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:53,879
- he'd never seen anything like it...
- Hey.

264
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,214
- ... in all his years on the force.
- Hey.

265
00:12:55,216 --> 00:12:56,949
- How can I...
- In the wake of NYPD

266
00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:59,085
arresting three suspected drug dealers

267
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:02,421
in possession of over $1
million in methamphetamine,

268
00:13:02,423 --> 00:13:05,758
the story took a shocking turn
when their cook house exploded.

269
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,593
- According to some local eyewitnesses...
- That's not possible.

270
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:08,728
... the debris shattered...

271
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,265
- Uh, definitely suspicious.
- How could it blow up?

272
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:14,800
HAZMAT came in and cleaned
up all the chemicals.

273
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:16,168
The apartment was empty.

274
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,372
Unless... "Let him go".

275
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:21,292
You think the Calling has
something to do with this?

276
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:23,809
I never understood why it didn't
want me to arrest the dealers,

277
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:25,644
but what if the Callings
wanted them in that lab?

278
00:13:25,646 --> 00:13:26,912
What if they were supposed to die?

279
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:28,347
Mick, that'd be some
serious retribution.

280
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,582
More likely, one of these guys,

281
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:30,816
or someone above them in the food chain,

282
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:31,984
had their hand in the explosion.

283
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:33,786
You know, a cover up.

284
00:13:33,788 --> 00:13:35,654
I'll take one more stab at them.

285
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:37,323
Thanks.

286
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:41,160
Jared?

287
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:42,261
Hey, what are you doing?

288
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:43,295
I promised Mick.

289
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:45,698
Hey!

290
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,766
How'd you do it?

291
00:13:46,768 --> 00:13:49,268
Do what?

292
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,804
Empty cook houses don't
blow up for no reason.

293
00:13:51,806 --> 00:13:54,039
Arson on a crowded block like yours?

294
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,598
That's attempted murder.

295
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,395
I'm guessing your buddies
are not gonna think twice

296
00:13:57,397 --> 00:13:58,409
about cutting a deal.

297
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:00,479
They're more afraid of me than
they are dying in the joint.

298
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:01,881
You should be, too.

299
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,816
Once we're out, I'll be coming for you,

300
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:06,652
right after I pay a visit to
your little blonde girlfriend.

301
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:09,121
Hey! Hey! Knock it off!

302
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:11,624
Always got the ladies helping
you out, huh, detective?

303
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,060
Forget him.

304
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:51,363
Ward.

305
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:52,398
Ward Attwood?

306
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,359
Hey, wait up.

307
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,895
My name is Ben Stone. I
was on the flight with you.

308
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:01,173
I've been trying to find
you since we returned.

309
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:02,731
I was hoping we could talk.

310
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,326
I know exactly what
you want to talk about.

311
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:06,045
And...

312
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:07,546
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,048
It's all my fault.

314
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,683
Wait. What's your fault?

315
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:12,218
I'm the one who okayed the flight

316
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,719
to take off from Jamaica.

317
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:16,255
I rushed my inspection.

318
00:15:16,257 --> 00:15:17,890
I missed something.

319
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:19,758
Foreign object debris
in the compressor blades,

320
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,293
contaminants in the fuel.

321
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,309
All I was thinking about
was hopping the jump seat

322
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:24,396
to get home.

323
00:15:24,398 --> 00:15:26,065
But we landed. We're safe.

324
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:28,100
So why the hell am I being haunted

325
00:15:28,102 --> 00:15:31,103
by visions of the flight exploding?

326
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:33,138
You saw it, too.

327
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,908
What do you mean? You saw it?

328
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:39,645
It happens to a lot of passengers.

329
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,047
Ward, I-I've been where you are.

330
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:43,148
I know what you're going through.

331
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,283
You can't.

332
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:46,785
I haven't worked, slept.

333
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:50,756
And every time I hear about a
passenger in trouble, dying...

334
00:15:50,758 --> 00:15:52,591
I know it's my fault.

335
00:15:52,593 --> 00:15:54,760
The visions never end.

336
00:15:54,762 --> 00:15:56,762
That's why I'm here.

337
00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:59,465
I've got to figure out what went wrong.

338
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:02,067
That vision... It brought me here today,

339
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:03,769
to you.

340
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:06,405
I think we're supposed
to figure it out together.

341
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,311
I know it's not your mom's, but, um...

342
00:16:12,313 --> 00:16:15,014
I figured "something borrowed".

343
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,849
Priscilla, this is beautiful.

344
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,017
Um...

345
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,786
- thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

346
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:22,187
There you are.

347
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,089
Come.

348
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:26,025
I want a photo with the bride and groom.

349
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,459
Hey.

350
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:28,661
Oh, Mom, there'll be plenty of time

351
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:30,095
to take photos at the wedding.

352
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:32,965
Zeke, I love you,

353
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:36,635
and I'm so happy for you and Michaela.

354
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:38,370
Truly.

355
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,773
But with your father coming,

356
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:42,675
I...

357
00:16:42,677 --> 00:16:45,611
- I can't attend the wedding.
- What?

358
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:47,479
What he did to you...

359
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:50,115
and to me after Chloe died,

360
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:51,450
I...

361
00:16:51,452 --> 00:16:53,319
I will not be in the same room with him.

362
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:54,687
Mom, you have to come.

363
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:56,388
This is your one chance
to see me get married.

364
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,825
No, there'll be so many other milestones

365
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:03,295
for us to celebrate together.

366
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:10,502
Actually, there won't be.

367
00:17:10,504 --> 00:17:12,071
I'm dying, Mom.

368
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,644
Not with your, uh, treatments...

369
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:21,580
The doctors don't have
a cure for what I have.

370
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:25,050
Oh, God.

371
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,721
No, this can't be true.

372
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:30,689
There... There must be
something that you can do.

373
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:32,691
It was hard for me
to process at first, too,

374
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:34,326
but I've come to accept it.

375
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:35,828
I mean, it...

376
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,863
This last year's been a blessing.

377
00:17:37,865 --> 00:17:40,599
I-I got to make peace with my past,

378
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,702
make amends with you and Dad,

379
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:45,938
found Michaela.

380
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,408
I've never had one day in my adult life

381
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,077
where I've just celebrated the moment.

382
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,747
To go out knowing I married
the great love of my life

383
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:58,083
and to have you there supporting me...

384
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:00,786
I couldn't ask for anything more.

385
00:18:19,205 --> 00:18:22,374
Remember, if things go south
and you ever need to contact me,

386
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:23,942
you just call the travel agency...

387
00:18:23,944 --> 00:18:26,145
I know the drill.

388
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:33,786
Please leave a message at the tone.

389
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:36,121
I'm sorry to call on such short notice,

390
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:38,924
but I-I need a-a
non-stop ticket to Havana.

391
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:41,760
It is an emergency. It's life or death.

392
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:44,563
And you're my only hope.

393
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:48,862
I need your help.

394
00:18:48,864 --> 00:18:50,153
Yeah, of course.

395
00:18:50,155 --> 00:18:51,735
Uh, just let me find something first.

396
00:18:51,737 --> 00:18:53,693
I'm helping another
passenger with a Calling.

397
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:56,194
Today? What's the Calling?

398
00:18:56,196 --> 00:18:57,829
The plane exploding.

399
00:18:57,831 --> 00:18:59,464
Wow.

400
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:01,500
Yeah, I can't make heads
or tails of these reports,

401
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:02,634
but maybe Ward can.

402
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:03,836
How's your research?

403
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:05,201
Anything to help Zeke?

404
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,493
- Uh, not since I got fired.
- What?!

405
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:08,751
Yeah, I got kicked out of my lab,

406
00:19:08,753 --> 00:19:10,409
had my medical license suspended.

407
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:12,577
My boss tells me
the government's involved.

408
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:13,979
The Major?

409
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:16,214
Yeah. Who else?

410
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:19,518
I don't know what to do. I'm desperate.

411
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,387
I can't get to my research,
and without my license,

412
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:23,646
I can't get my hands on any medication

413
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:25,704
that can help Zeke's hypothermia.

414
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,562
I need to figure out
why the Major's back.

415
00:19:27,564 --> 00:19:29,161
It's why I need to talk to Vance.

416
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:30,652
Did you try the travel agency?

417
00:19:30,654 --> 00:19:32,954
It's empty. Called in a "Havana 9-1-1".

418
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:35,290
Nothing. He just vanished.

419
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:39,871
- You know how to reach him.
- Saanvi, he made me promise...

420
00:19:39,873 --> 00:19:42,731
Ben, you are following
the Callings to help Zeke!

421
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:44,622
This is my way of helping him.

422
00:19:44,624 --> 00:19:46,839
Even if there is a slim chance
that I figure this out in time,

423
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:48,797
don't you think that he deserves it?

424
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:53,033
Help me!

425
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:54,568
His wife.

426
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,403
You think she knows that he's alive?

427
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:57,505
100%.

428
00:19:57,507 --> 00:19:59,240
He told me as much.

429
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:01,041
She's a principal downtown.

430
00:20:01,043 --> 00:20:03,010
Now, Vance may not return your call,

431
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:05,412
but he'll never ignore hers.

432
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:06,881
Okay. Thank you.

433
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:28,903
There's nothing.

434
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:32,840
My pre-flight inspection checklist

435
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:37,678
compared with post-flight
government inspection report.

436
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,581
There is nothing different.

437
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:44,852
I didn't do anything wrong.

438
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:46,420
This is proof.

439
00:20:46,422 --> 00:20:47,888
The plane landed in New York

440
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,790
in the exact same
condition it left Jamaica.

441
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:53,093
Yeah, but what about the
lost time, the explosion?

442
00:20:53,095 --> 00:20:56,230
No one knows how this happened,
not even the government.

443
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:58,432
But it's not your fault, Ward.

444
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:00,768
You don't have to feel guilty anymore.

445
00:21:04,706 --> 00:21:06,574
I still don't get why, uh...

446
00:21:06,576 --> 00:21:08,943
you got the same vision
of the plane exploding.

447
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:11,111
I'm not sure.

448
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:14,381
I guess I was hoping for a miracle.

449
00:21:14,383 --> 00:21:15,616
Maybe it was never about me.

450
00:21:15,618 --> 00:21:17,384
Maybe we were brought together

451
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:18,819
so I could...

452
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:21,088
help you.

453
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,325
You did.

454
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:25,826
Thank you.

455
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:05,099
Hey!

456
00:22:05,101 --> 00:22:06,667
Something's wrong!

457
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:08,535
Damn it, sit up!

458
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:12,640
He's having a seizure or something!

459
00:22:12,642 --> 00:22:14,228
Hey, we got a problem
over here. Pull over.

460
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,729
Hurry!

461
00:22:23,185 --> 00:22:24,451
- Hurry!
- Hey, hey, hey.

462
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:26,654
- Come on, man. Come on.
- Yeah, okay.

463
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:27,688
Jesus.

464
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,956
Hey, get off him!

465
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,625
Hands up! Get 'em up!

466
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:33,727
Don't you move, you scumbag.

467
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:45,639
Everyone okay?

468
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:47,074
Get the keys.

469
00:22:58,988 --> 00:23:00,854
Use your cuffs on the driver.

470
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:03,524
Hook 'em up to the seat.
Make sure it's tight.

471
00:23:12,535 --> 00:23:14,001
What are you doing?!

472
00:23:14,003 --> 00:23:16,370
You wanna be a cop killer, too?

473
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:19,506
If it's the right cop.

474
00:23:19,508 --> 00:23:21,709
Let's go find her.

475
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:23,177
Get back what's ours.

476
00:23:31,468 --> 00:23:32,724
Estelle, please.

477
00:23:32,726 --> 00:23:34,291
My husband is dead.

478
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:36,160
When all seemed lost,
there was one person

479
00:23:36,162 --> 00:23:38,495
who stepped in and helped
me, and that was your husband.

480
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:41,799
Okay, lives are at stake, and
we are running out of time.

481
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,029
So, please,

482
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:44,587
could you just tell me
where I can find him?

483
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,912
I need his help. This is my last resort.

484
00:23:46,914 --> 00:23:48,827
Someone is about to die.

485
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:51,430
You want to know where
you can find my husband?

486
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:52,798
At the cemetery.

487
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,366
Please, just call him.

488
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:58,036
Get off this property
before I call the police.

489
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:11,216
Oh! Pretty dress.

490
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:13,118
Yeah. It reminded me of Mom's.

491
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,187
I got it at a thrift shop.

492
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:16,855
- No! No!
- Ohh, hey.

493
00:24:16,857 --> 00:24:18,691
- It's... It's... It's okay.
- No, dad! It's not!

494
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:20,225
It's not even close to okay!

495
00:24:22,997 --> 00:24:25,130
I don't think I can do this.

496
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:31,370
I know the feeling.

497
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:35,007
I couldn't breathe on my wedding day.

498
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:38,010
My tux felt like an iron lung.

499
00:24:40,347 --> 00:24:42,581
She loved seeing you dressed up.

500
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:44,650
She would have given anything

501
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:46,652
to see you walk down that aisle.

502
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:54,693
If you had met her and
she was already sick,

503
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:56,195
would you have married her?

504
00:24:56,197 --> 00:24:57,930
Even if I knew

505
00:24:57,932 --> 00:25:01,266
I'd only be married to
her for five minutes,

506
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:03,936
I would have done it all again.

507
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:05,170
In a heartbeat.

508
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:07,539
She loved you so much.

509
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:10,876
And I loved her.

510
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:14,012
But love doesn't mean a thing

511
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,381
without a little faith.

512
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:20,953
If she were me, what would she do?

513
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:24,189
I wish I knew, but...

514
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:26,191
I'm here for you,

515
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:30,128
no matter what you decide.

516
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,030
We all are.

517
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,775
I got it. I got it.

518
00:25:43,777 --> 00:25:45,244
Sorry, I'm just...

519
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:47,746
ready for the ceremony to get started.

520
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:50,749
Yeah.

521
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:59,291
Zeke, I'm sorry I wasn't there for you

522
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:02,427
when you needed me most.

523

Me, too.

524
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:11,103
Look, when I'm gone,
Mom's gonna need a friend.

525
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:13,672
I'm gonna need you to step
up and be there for her.

526
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:16,441
She's not gonna want
it, but she'll need it.

527
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:29,788
I can't believe this.

528

My stomach is in knots. I thought...

574
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:39,279
I thought maybe Ben
might have found something

575
00:28:39,281 --> 00:28:41,727
that would help save Zeke
and this would all make sense,

576
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:43,622
or... or I'd get a
sign, a voice, a vision,

577
00:28:43,624 --> 00:28:45,824
something that told me that marrying him

578
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:48,093
and letting him end his treatments

579
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:50,262
was the right thing to do,
but none of that's happened.

So...

581
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,500
I can't go through with this.

00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:58,303
Mick.

Please, anything, Ben.

It is.

00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:29,668

sign if there ever was one.

Zeke and Michaela have made

to stand together as partners in life.

598
00:30:55,903 --> 00:30:58,237
And they have written
their own vows of commitment

599
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,906
to one another.

600
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:04,314
Michaela...

601
00:31:04,316 --> 00:31:07,006
we'll never have enough time

604
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:15,390
care for me, love me

605
00:31:15,392 --> 00:31:17,458
has been the greatest gift of my life.

606
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,761

607
00:31:19,763 --> 00:31:22,764

to be your husband,

best wife that I can be,

Yeah. Of course.

my license revoked,

to make you disappear.

00:39:50,337 --> 00:39:51,826
Run away?

744
00:39:51,828 --> 00:39:52,950
It's for your own safety.

745
00:39:52,952 --> 00:39:55,876
No, I don't think you understand.

746
00:39:55,878 --> 00:39:57,667

747

756
00:40:37,442 --> 00:40:41,077
I thought I'd figured it out.

757
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,679
I guess I didn't.

758

759
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,946
Hopefully someone with some good news.

You get us back or stash

765
00:41:36,378 --> 00:41:37,811

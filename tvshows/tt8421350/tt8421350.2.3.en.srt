1
00:00:02,797 --> 00:00:04,798
Previously on "Manifest"...

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,855
Stop!

3
00:00:05,857 --> 00:00:08,417
- What just happened?
- I just h-heard my own voice.

4
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:10,019
You just had a Calling.

5
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:12,288
Not all answers can be found in books.

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,522
Here.

7
00:00:13,524 --> 00:00:15,558
We shouldn't be talking to believers.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,294
It went sideways even
before the plane disappeared.

9
00:00:18,296 --> 00:00:20,563
The person I was supposed to go with...

10
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:22,305
Just didn't work out.

11
00:00:22,307 --> 00:00:23,873
Right. 8B.

12
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,374
The seat beside you was empty.

13
00:00:25,376 --> 00:00:28,678
How the hell does the Major
know about Saanvi's discovery?

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,747
I had a new realization
about the Callings,

15
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:32,872
that they might be
transferable genetically.

16
00:00:32,874 --> 00:00:34,129
It is really exciting.

17
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:35,287
Ben Stone?

18
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:37,312
- Suzanne?
- I'm a dean.

19
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:39,437
I'm on a job hunt, so if
you hear of anything...

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,083
Send me your C.V. today.

21
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:42,841
You need me to have
your back around here.

22
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:44,799
Actually, I think I just
need you to let this go.

23
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:46,056
Maybe it's for the best... clean break.

24
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:47,081
We have to talk to Zeke.

25
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:48,739
Well, once he's out on
bail, we can talk to him.

26
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:50,330
We have to save him, just like we have

27
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:52,121
to save the rest of the passengers.

28
00:00:52,123 --> 00:00:54,329
As to the count of assault in
the first degree, I plead guilty.

29
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:56,187
Zeke, stop. No, you can fight this.

30
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,354
I plead guilty.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

32
00:01:09,364 --> 00:01:11,065
Hi. Where are you?

33
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:14,368
You're, uh... You're making
me really nervous, babe.

34
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,528
Okay, I had a really
exciting breakthrough today,

35
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,408
and I'm dying to tell you about
it, so just please hurry, okay?

36
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,676
Bye.

37
00:01:22,678 --> 00:01:24,011
Oh. Excuse me.

38
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:26,547
- Oh.
- Ooh. Oh.

39
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,415
Excuse me.

40
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:32,276
Well, well, well, Jamaica, here we come!

41
00:01:32,278 --> 00:01:33,400
It's our honeymoon.

42
00:01:33,402 --> 00:01:35,558
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

43
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,079
Hold the door.

44
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,136
One more coming.

45
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:40,427
Come on, baby. Come on.

46
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:43,824
Come on, come on.

47
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:45,659
There's your seat.

48
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:02,639
Welcome to Flight 727.

49
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:03,797
Oh, hey.

50
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,921
Nonstop service from JFK
to Montego Bay, Jamaica.

51
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:06,445
- Um, do you mind if my hubby sits here?
- No.

52
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:08,613
Flight attendants, prepare for takeoff.

53
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:09,915
Looks like sun and...

54
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:11,783
Something in me died that day,

55
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:13,785
and it still hurts.

56
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:21,793
When we came back,

57
00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:24,029
I thought...

58
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:26,067
Alex might be there.

59
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:30,110
I mean, it was all over the news.

60
00:02:30,112 --> 00:02:32,846
Have you thought about
what you'd say to Alex?

61
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:35,782
There's an e-mail in my
drafts folder I keep rewriting.

62
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:37,117
Why haven't you sent it?

63
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,652
I don't know.

64
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:41,474
I'm still so angry.

65
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:43,209
And I'm hurt.

66
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:45,244
And I'm in love.

67
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:48,748
I can never find the right words.

68
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,624
Saanvi, you wrote the e-mail.

69
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:52,825
Send it.

70
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:55,928
You need completion
so you can finally move on.

71
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,931
Yeah, you're probably right.

72
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,533
Maybe I will.

73
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:02,735
So, that was your thorn.

74
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:04,270
What about your rose?

75
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:07,006
Work's good. I mean, I'm exhausted.

76
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:08,274
Why is that?

77
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:10,510
Just in a hurry to prove that I'm right,

78
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:13,713
you know, that we were
all genetically changed

79
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:16,282
on that plane.

80
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:19,752
I've been running a DNA sequencer 24/7.

81
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:23,222
It's like a needle in a haystack,
but I know it's there.

82
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:25,697
I admire your perseverance, Saanvi.

83
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,800
Truly remarkable.

84
00:03:28,802 --> 00:03:30,668
- Hey.
- Hey.

85
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,203
Who died?

86
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:34,973
- He's got another job interview.
- Oh!

87
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:36,741
It's the same job I've been chasing,

88
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:38,777
an adjunct professor at Astoria.

89
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:41,179
- There's just been a lot of hoops
to jump through. - Okay.

90
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:43,081
Which he has been doing
with flying colors.

91
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:46,636
So far. They're having me
guest-lecture on Combinatorics.

92
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:48,838
I don't get it. You were
on a tenure track before.

93
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,940
Yeah, well, now I
can't get on any track.

94
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:53,142
Soon as they hear I'm a passenger,

95
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:54,844
- I might as well have the plague.
- Mm.

96
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:56,117
Only reason I got this chance

97
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:58,019
- is because I ran into an old colleague.
- Mm.

98
00:03:58,021 --> 00:04:00,021
She was a little more
than an old colleague.

99
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,258
Love you.

100
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,593
See you later.

101
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:09,687
Okay, I need coffee.

102
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:10,945
Oh, yeah, here you go.

103
00:04:10,947 --> 00:04:14,187
Wow, why'd you d... Loving the hair.

104
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,456
Sort of.

105
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,857
Thanks.

106
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,092
I love it, too.

107
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:21,060
See you after school.

108
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,530
Oh, come on, she looks cute.

109
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,900
I mean, I had a buzz cut
and a nose ring at that age.

110
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:29,192
Oh, I remember, and it was disturbing.

111
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:30,904
No, it...

112
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:33,907
So, what, did you just
stop by to throw shade?

113
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:36,611
I don't know. Being here
makes me feel less alone.

114
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:38,146
What's the word on Saanvi?

115
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:41,216
Vance has been surveilling her
around the clock, but nothing.

116
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:43,351
She still doesn't know she has a leak?

117
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:45,954
Vance says it's too risky.

118
00:04:45,956 --> 00:04:48,023
Still, I hate lying to her.

119
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:50,292
Ben, you got to detach.

120
00:04:50,294 --> 00:04:51,860
Oh.

121
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:53,828
Like you're doing with Zeke.

122
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:58,552
Okay, fine. Yes, I'm attached.

123
00:04:58,554 --> 00:04:59,886
Have you talked to him?

124
00:05:01,023 --> 00:05:03,093
Um, no, buddy, not yet,

125
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,292
- but I've got some ideas.
- Hey.

126
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:06,493
Guess who's riding shotgun.

127
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:08,295
Yes!

128
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:13,166
Give this to Zeke when you see him.

129
00:05:22,644 --> 00:05:26,396
To be wiped from the face of the Earth,

130
00:05:26,398 --> 00:05:30,550
only to return is an undeniable
message to the world.

131
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:35,477
Hope, faith, belief...
all shall be rewarded.

132
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,726
The miracle of 828 was for all.

133
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:42,829
Now, those who feel called
to testify are welcome.

134
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:51,529
Thanks.

135
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:56,901
I'm Maxine.

136
00:05:56,903 --> 00:05:59,070
Hi, Maxine.

137
00:05:59,072 --> 00:06:01,005
I'm a Believer.

138
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:03,941
I was pretty broken
when I first came here.

139
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:05,309
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.

140
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,377
My parents, they just...

141
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:10,348
they didn't get me, and I was lost.

142
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:16,153
But then I heard Adrian talk
about how we're all connected,

143
00:06:16,155 --> 00:06:21,058
about how we're all a
part of the miracle of 828.

144
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,996
And Adrian says if you
accept that miracle,

145
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:27,932
we'll all be saved.

146
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:31,978
Well, it's already saved my life.

147
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,279
- I believe.
- Yes.

148
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,926
I have to get him out of there.

149
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:48,984
Decorated cop versus ex-con

150
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:50,752
carrying an illegally purchased firearm.

151
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:51,777
He was trying to protect...

152
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,388
Guy goes on the run for, what, 62 days?

153
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,623
He turned himself in...

154
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,960
And said ex-con admitted he shot you.

155
00:06:57,962 --> 00:07:00,295
Now you go.

156
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:02,597
He's not supposed to be in there.

157
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:10,238
Your guy pled guilty, no lawyer?

158
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,198
That's at least grounds to
petition for a plea withdrawal.

159
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,456
Tell him to let the court know

160
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,023
that I'll be representing him now.

161
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:18,625
Thanks, Teresa, but we're
not exactly in communication.

162
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:21,161
Can we get the ball
rolling first, and then,

163
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:23,330
- once I talk to him or...
- I can start some digging,

164
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:27,067
but until I'm his lawyer,
my hands are tied.

165
00:07:29,905 --> 00:07:32,940
Saanvi's server is clean.

166
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:34,675
Swept for bugs, her lab's clean.

167
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:35,743
So, where's the leak?

168
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:37,110
The Major has someone
inside the hospital?

169
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:38,845
- Presumably.
- Any clue who it is?

170
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:40,158
My guys are keeping a close eye...

171
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,793
Well, that's not good
enough. Saanvi's in danger.

172
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,828
I have a plan if you'll
just shut up for a minute.

173
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,475
Vance, we need to find this mole.

174
00:07:45,477 --> 00:07:46,810
No.

175
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:50,547
We need to let the mole
lead us to the Major.

176
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:53,550
Everything we know tells
us what the Major wants

177
00:07:53,552 --> 00:07:55,118
is to control the Callings,

178
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,088
to be sending the messages
you're compelled to follow...

179
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,090
you, your... your sister, your son.

180
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:02,893
We'd... be her toy soldiers.

181
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:06,029
So let's point her to
the ultimate soldier,

182
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:08,832
a passenger whose Callings
are stronger than Cal's even.

183
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:11,168
Yeah, but I haven't
found anyone who's...

184
00:08:14,964 --> 00:08:16,974
You mean we feed the Major a fake.

185
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:19,776
Pick someone from your
board. Make it look legit.

186
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:21,223
I have an address in Pennsylvania.

187
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:22,992
You'll tell Saanvi he's there.

188
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:26,495
The ruse percolates up
to the Major, she'll bite.

189
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,535
So not only do we continue
to lie to Saanvi...

190
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:36,038
We use her. This... This sucks.

191
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,341
No one said making
the world a safer place

192
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:41,027
was gonna be easy, but the
sooner we find the Major,

193
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:43,396
the sooner we all go back to our lives.

194
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:47,834
And this leak in your friend's
lab, it's our best shot.

195
00:08:49,303 --> 00:08:50,770
Set the trap.

196
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:56,976
Bye.

197
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,106
Oh.

198
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:02,041
Are you okay?

199
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,743
Thought I'd puke less this time.

200
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:05,545
Oh, here.

201
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:08,948
Only thing that keeps food down.

202
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,316
I'm not a fan of ginger,

203
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:12,919
but I'll eat roadkill
if it quells the nausea.

204
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:15,188
I feel you.

205
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,924
Not only am I bigger
than I was with twins...

206
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:19,392
I'm also sicker.

207
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:22,195
I swear my 6-year-old
thinks her mommy's hung over.

208
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:23,262
You haven't told her yet?

209
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:24,764
Once we're out of the woods.

210
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:25,840
Here, thanks.

211
00:09:25,842 --> 00:09:27,742
Keep it. I can make more.

212
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:29,944
You made these?

213
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:31,078
We can't be friends.

214
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,913
Oh. But I offer free refills.

215
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,916
- Solidarity!
- Thanks.

216
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,553
Open her eyes.

217
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,119
Hey, there. How you doing?

218
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:04,854
I'm here to see Ezekiel Landon.

219
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:06,323
You gonna be on the list this time?

220
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:12,195
Look, man. I just... I
really need to see him.

221
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:13,663
Hold up.

222
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:16,733
He's not here. It seems
he's been transferred.

223
00:10:16,735 --> 00:10:18,268
What's... Where?

224
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,936
Doesn't say. The system's messed up.

225
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:21,604
It could take a few days to update.

226
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:26,543
What did you give me?

227
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:30,747
What'd you give me, damn it?!

228
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:31,815
Okay, calm down.

229
00:10:31,817 --> 00:10:33,106
It was just something to help you sleep.

230
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:35,051
- What the hell was it?!
- Mostly midazolam.

231
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:37,020
I'm in recovery! You
can't give me that junk!

232
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:38,655
Look, your doctor rounds in the morning.

233
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:40,123
We'll take it up with him.

234
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,792
But if you don't want any
more, you need to chill.

235
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:49,332
I'm worried, Ben. What if it's
not just an error in the system?

236
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:52,102
What if it's the Major? I mean,
she's taken people before.

237
00:10:52,104 --> 00:10:53,754
Yeah, but not from police custody.

238
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:55,732
What if that's what the
Callings are warning us about?

239
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:58,041
I mean, I'm not gonna lose
him, okay? Not like that.

240
00:10:58,043 --> 00:11:01,077
Mick, you're spinning.
Just keep looking.

241
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,981
And if the Major did take
Zeke, we will find him...

242
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:07,217
when we find her.

243
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:09,252
Talk to you later.

244
00:11:13,358 --> 00:11:15,125
There you are.

245
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:18,428
Why is a public defender
asking for Zeke's arrest report?

246
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,696
Why do you think?

247
00:11:19,698 --> 00:11:21,531
Christ, Mick.

248
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:22,932
The guy confessed.

249
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:24,334
Just let it go already.

250
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:26,336
You want to know how
I let this go, Jared?

251
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:28,071
You revise the report, and you clarify

252
00:11:28,073 --> 00:11:29,672
that the shooting was an accident.

253
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:30,765
I won't do that.

254
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:32,842
It was an accident.

255
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:34,144
We both know that.

256
00:11:34,146 --> 00:11:36,546
No, it was a legit collar.

257
00:11:36,548 --> 00:11:39,182
I know that, and so does
everybody else in this office.

258
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:43,353
Mick, you keep pushing this,
it's not gonna end well for you.

259
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:45,789
Is that a threat?

260
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:50,393
I am trying to get an
innocent man out of jail.

261
00:11:50,395 --> 00:11:53,163
Please, do not make this about us.

262
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:55,965
Seriously?

263
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:59,636
This has everything to do with us.

264
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:02,305
I blew up my entire life for you.

265
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:09,312
Yeah, I know.

266
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:15,852
I need us to do the right
thing, though, please.

267
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:19,522
I'm asking for us to fix this together.

268
00:12:23,061 --> 00:12:25,395
You're asking for too much, Mick.

269
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:27,329
I'm sorry, but I'm not
gonna torpedo my career

270
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,665
- for some guy I barely trust.
- Just stop. Please.

271
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:36,506
I am not trying to hurt you. Truly.

272
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:40,977
But I'm gonna help Zeke,

273
00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:43,580
and I'm gonna do whatever
it takes to do that.

274
00:12:43,582 --> 00:12:48,751
If you don't want to help
me, that is your choice.

275
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:51,387
But be prepared.

276
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:54,257
Was that a threat?

277
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:56,726
Didn't have to be.

278
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:12,609
- Hey.
- Hey.

279
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:14,410
Mom had another Calling.

280
00:13:14,412 --> 00:13:16,045
Really?

281
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:19,082
Yeah, I met this great mom
at the yoga studio today.

282
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:21,518
And when she was leaving,
I heard myself saying,

283
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,253
"Open her eyes".

284
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:27,562
And then I saw this
awful gargoyle on her car,

285
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:28,953
like, looming.

286
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:31,245
Honey, that's terrifying.
Are... Are you okay?

287
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:33,303
I'm fine. I'm just...
I'm worried about her.

288
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:34,764
I can't shake this bad feeling.

289
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:37,857
This creature was terrifying,
but we looked up gargoyles,

290
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,187
and, apparently, they're supposed

291
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:41,142
to protect you from evil.

292
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:42,499
So I don't know.

293
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:44,064
Maybe I'm supposed to
open her eyes to that?

294
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:45,650
Maybe she's in some kind of trouble?

295
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:48,077
Maybe she'll be in the next class?

296
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,513
I can't wait till then.

297
00:13:50,515 --> 00:13:52,482
So...

298
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:53,750
track her down.

299
00:13:53,752 --> 00:13:55,118
Yeah.

300
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,921
She had a Metro Kids
Soccer bumper sticker.

301
00:13:57,923 --> 00:13:59,989
I'll look up where the teams practice.

302
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,427
- What are you doing?
- Helping you.

303
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:06,763
Absolutely not. You have
enough on your plate.

304
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:08,431
We got this.

305
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:10,867
Well, is there anything
I can do to help?

306
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:12,669
No, babe.

307
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:14,932
We're good. You get your work done.

308
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:16,490
I found the website.

309
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:17,681
Awesome.

310
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:20,400
Wow. I'll leave you to it, then.

311
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,169
Call if you need me.

312
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:23,913
Bye.

313
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:26,762
So, she said her kid was 6.

314
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:29,152
Does it say where the
younger teams practice?

315
00:14:31,756 --> 00:14:34,324
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

316
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:36,359
Gimme aces!

317
00:14:41,232 --> 00:14:44,233
What are we looking for, exactly?

318
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:46,773
I know, I know. Drug-company NDA.

319
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:48,271
I'm just a fly on the wall.

320
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:51,507
Just thank me when you get your Nobel.

321
00:14:59,653 --> 00:15:02,278
I'm vibing epic fail.

322
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,720
We have time for another round.

323
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:07,757
Um... burnout is actually a thing.

324
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,126
When is the last time you slept?

325
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:18,534
- Hi.
- Hey.

326
00:15:18,536 --> 00:15:19,936
I wasn't expecting you today.

327
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,742
I think I found a new Holy Grail.

328
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:35,827
This guy's Callings are insane, Ben.

329
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:37,099
If you didn't interview him yourself,

330
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:38,521
I would never believe it.

331
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:40,605
He's in Philly?

332
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,496
Okay, I need to get his
bloodwork for the lab.

333
00:15:42,498 --> 00:15:43,659
When can we go see him?

334
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:45,607
Uh, I'll check my calendar.

335
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:47,098
Well, how about now?

336
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,796
If this guy is having
more intense Callings,

337
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:50,499
he may have a longer
strand of the mutated gene.

338
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:52,303
It might be easier for me to isolate.

339
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,207
What's wrong with you?

340
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:57,455
What do you mean?

341
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,687
Well, why aren't you more excited?

342
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:00,157
This could be our breakthrough.

343
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,233
The Callings, the Death
Date could all go away.

344
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:05,096
I mean, isn't this what we've
been working our asses off for?

345
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,298
Oh, of course it is.

346
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,400
I may have gotten a job.

347
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,906
That's really great news.

348
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:12,831
I need to give a lecture,
meet the faculty.

349
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,672
There's a lot right now.

350
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,874
Well, they would be
really lucky to have you.

351
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,912
Just as soon as you can.

352
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,481
Yeah.

353
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,089
He would've just transferred
in the other day or...

354
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,759
Are you sure there's nothing?

355
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,394
Okay. Thank you.

356
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:39,130
Ezekiel Landon? Nothing?

357
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,220
Okay.

358
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:41,912
Uh, yeah. Hi. Just checking in.

359
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:47,304
Checking in to see if you got
my message about Ezekiel Landon.

360
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,165
Hi there.

361
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:53,177
I'm Detective Stone from the 129th.

362
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,846
Uh, I'm good. Thank you. How are you?

363
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,649
Yeah, um, just need some help
tracking down an inmate...

364
00:16:58,651 --> 00:16:59,784
Ezekiel Landon.

365
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:02,253
E- Z-E-K...

366
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,588
You do? You have him?

367
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,756
Can I talk to him?

368
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,525
No, no, no, please,
I just need one minute

369
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,493
to just talk to him about something.

370
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,599
Zeke!

371
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,574
Zeke! Zeke!

372
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,242
Grab my hand!

373
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,611
Zeke, please! Come on! Come on!

374
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,047
Grab my hand!

375
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,653
Zeke, no!

376
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:46,817
So, your fate's in the hands
of the Hiring Committee.

377
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:48,576
They're all sitting in. I talked you up.

378
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:49,810
Thanks for that.

379
00:17:49,812 --> 00:17:51,245
Left out the part about us.

380
00:17:51,247 --> 00:17:52,546
Doubly thanks for that.

381
00:17:52,548 --> 00:17:53,881
Dr. Tobin in the middle?

382
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:55,983
Big fan of your paper
on computational math.

383
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:57,818
- Her vote's in the bag.
- Uh-huh.

384
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,888
Bow tie's the one to impress... Simon.

385
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,022
Okay.

386
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:03,524
Professor Stone.

387
00:18:03,526 --> 00:18:05,459
TJ!

388
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:06,927
What are you doing here?

389
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:09,163
I saw the tweet about your
lecture, figured I'd sit in.

390
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:10,931
Why? 'Cause you needed a nap?

391
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:12,533
I'll try not to snore too loud.

392
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:13,667
Okay, I'll see you in there.

393
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:14,735
- Good luck.
- Alright.

394
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:16,103
What did I tell you all?

395
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:19,306
He's already a favorite
with the students.

396
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:20,708
Professors Gin Otani...

397
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,376
- Hi. How you doing?
- ... Carol Tobin...

398
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:24,078
- Hi.
- ... Simon White.

399
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,379
- Hi.
- Professor Stone.

400
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:26,981
Suzanne raves about you, Ben.

401
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:28,716
We're delighted you're considering us.

402
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:30,251
I'm glad to be here.

403
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:33,153
Okay. Well, let's get
this party started.

404
00:18:34,756 --> 00:18:37,558
This will be a great
way to ease back in.

405
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,759
It's a pretty sleepy class.

406
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:41,195
Enrollment's about half capacity.

407
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:42,730
Okay.

408
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:44,298
Okay.

409
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,370
Mm.

410
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:52,806
Guess my tweet about our special
guest lecture piqued interest.

411
00:19:04,152 --> 00:19:07,388
You all know this is
Combinatorics, right?

412
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,290
I hear Game Theory's down the hall.

413
00:19:10,993 --> 00:19:13,927
No one? Alright.

414
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:19,376
So, how many of you are
actually math majors?

415
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:21,235
Okay.

416
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:24,338
Uh, anyone like old movies?

417
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,673
- Sure.
- Mm-hmm.

418
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:26,807
Who's seen "The Matrix"?

419
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:28,275
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

420
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:30,044
Welcome back from outer space!

421
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,748
Thank you. I guess.

422
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,625
Now, the fun thing about higher math...

423
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:40,319
and, yes, I said fun... is
that it can describe something

424
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:42,790
as complex as simulated reality.

425
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:45,092
Let's say this is Earth.

426
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:47,695
Speaking of, where do
you think the plane went?

427
00:19:47,697 --> 00:19:50,207
What's the probability 828
got sucked through a wormhole,

428
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,099
versus being hijacked by aliens?

429
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:55,978
While you propose a
fascinating hypothetical,

430
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,304
to assess a baseline...

431
00:19:57,306 --> 00:19:59,873
Professor Stone, is your IQ
higher than it used to be?

432
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,528
I heard that one of the
passengers cured cancer.

433
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,562
Flight 828 didn't touch
down for 5 and a half years.

434
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:06,780
- Where did it fly?
- Are you, like, smarter than Einstein?

435
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:08,148
- Uh...
- Did you shrink?

436
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,090
Can you predict the future?

437
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:12,122
To assess a... a...

438
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:15,422
I read your thesis on
combinatorial matrix theory.

439
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:18,258
Couldn't that have been used
to map the flight plan of 828?

440
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,127
Great question.

441
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:25,061
We'll start simple and define
some geocentric coordinates.

442
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:29,837
Now, to compute the coordinates
of "C" using Bancroft's method,

443
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,172
we'll construct a four-by-four matrix

444
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:36,710
with the satellites' coordinates
and respective pseudoranges...

445
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:38,579
not to be confused with pseudo-oranges,

446
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:40,147
which taste terrible.

447
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:43,250
But we can use them to help us find

448
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:45,185
our unknown receiver quantities.

449
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:49,823
And then we will encapsulate
them in a vector "U".

450
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:54,495
It says the U6 girls
practice on the east field.

451
00:20:54,497 --> 00:20:56,096
Good job, sleuth!

452
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:00,667
I wish I could see a gargoyle.

453
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:03,437
No, you don't. Trust me.

454
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:06,140
Mom, I've seen way worse stuff.

455
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,286
I wish you didn't have to.

456
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:12,880
Bring it in! Snack time!

457
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:14,982
Good effort, girls! Good effort!

458
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:17,284
- Orange slices.
- That's her.

459
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,026
Good job. Good job.

460
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:31,498
Alright.

461
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,333
Erika?

462
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:34,501
Hi.

463
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,970
Grace. Ginger lady?

464
00:21:36,972 --> 00:21:38,839
Oh. Right.

465
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:41,137
Hi. I haven't seen you here before.

466
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:42,409
No, it's our first time.

467
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:45,612
Actually, I'm trying to get
my bookworm son into a sport.

468
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:48,682
Right.

469
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:50,851
I think sign-ups are closed.

470
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:53,334
Um, you're not green,

471
00:21:53,336 --> 00:21:55,422
so I take it the nausea's better.

472
00:21:55,424 --> 00:21:56,723
Is everything else okay?

473
00:21:56,725 --> 00:21:58,685
I know second pregnancies
can be so hard.

474
00:21:58,687 --> 00:21:59,960
- Pulled in every dire...
- I have to run.

475
00:21:59,962 --> 00:22:01,795
My husband's waiting for me.

476
00:22:01,797 --> 00:22:02,996
Holly!

477
00:22:02,998 --> 00:22:04,998
Come on. What are you doing?

478
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:08,569
Open her eyes.

479
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,249
You had it again.

480
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,720
She's scared of something.

481
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:28,422
But when the person
you're called to help

482
00:22:28,424 --> 00:22:30,591
doesn't want to be
helped, what do you do?

483
00:22:36,528 --> 00:22:38,818
Detective Stone. I need
a one-on-one with a C.I.

484
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,033
Patient Ezekiel Landon.

485
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:42,115
Didn't see you on the books,
Detective. Did you call ahead?

486
00:22:42,117 --> 00:22:44,217
An emergency came up.
Consider this calling.

487
00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:45,552
Not how this works.

488
00:22:45,554 --> 00:22:46,853
Dangerous guys in here.

489
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:48,421
I need a guard dedicated for the meet.

490
00:22:48,423 --> 00:22:50,457
- Not my rules.
- Great. Well, I've got lives at stake.

491
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:52,692
So if you wanna ring up my
boss, you go right ahead.

492
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:02,102
Yeah.

493
00:23:02,104 --> 00:23:03,807
I got a C.I.- visit request here.

494
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:05,438
Ezekiel Landon.

495
00:23:17,718 --> 00:23:20,420
Hey. What's up?

496
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:22,288
You find something new?

497
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,057
Only the gene mutation.

498
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,438
Or at least a mutation,
which could be watershed,

499
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,675
maybe even the key to what
happened to us on that plane.

500
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:31,898
It's like...

501
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,366
It's like the magic bullet.

502
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:36,668
Now I-I really need you to
take me to your guy, Ben,

503
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,438
because I need to test his
blood against my trials t...

504
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,840
I can't, uh...

505
00:23:40,842 --> 00:23:43,109
I can't do that.

506
00:23:43,111 --> 00:23:45,445
What's going on?

507
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:54,921
The Major has a mole
accessing your research.

508
00:23:57,658 --> 00:23:59,225
How do you know that?

509
00:23:59,227 --> 00:24:01,561
I just do, trust me.

510
00:24:01,563 --> 00:24:03,671
And if your discovery leaks to her...

511
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:04,862
Saanvi...

512
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,599
Yeah?

513
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:08,034
Okay.

514
00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:10,595
What if the Major already knows

515
00:24:10,597 --> 00:24:11,839
about the passenger's new Callings?

516
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:14,561
She... She came after Cal.

517
00:24:14,563 --> 00:24:18,545
- Imagine what she's...
- There are no new Callings.

518
00:24:18,547 --> 00:24:20,380
What?

519
00:24:20,382 --> 00:24:23,083
It was a fake,

520
00:24:23,085 --> 00:24:25,251
made up as bait to lure the Major.

521
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:30,683
Okay, I don't, um...

522
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:33,109
I don't understand.
Why would you lie to me?

523
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:34,497
Because you were safer not knowing.

524
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:36,863
You might've inadvertently
clued in the Major.

525
00:24:40,468 --> 00:24:44,337
All of this, there is no way
this is just you and Michaela.

526
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,641
You're working with someone.

527
00:24:53,915 --> 00:24:55,281
Vance.

528
00:24:55,283 --> 00:24:57,677
He survived the accident,
went into hiding.

529
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,552
- Michaela and I...
- Michaela and you what?!

530
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,738
I am part of that group, Ben,

531
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,191
and you didn't trust me?

532
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:07,727
No, it's not about trust. It
was for your own protection.

533
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:09,362
Okay, I just... I need you to leave.

534
00:25:09,364 --> 00:25:11,907
Did you think I wanted to
lie? I didn't want any of this.

535
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:14,267
Yeah, but you had a choice!

536
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:17,036
I didn't.

537
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:18,204
Go.

538
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,347
Saanvi, please be careful. This leak...

539
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:23,810
Go.

540
00:25:47,435 --> 00:25:49,068
How's he not a C.I.?

541
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,038
Detective just blew by here
claiming he's part of some case.

542
00:25:55,343 --> 00:25:56,509
Zeke.

543
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,143
Oh, my God. What have they done to you?

544
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:01,568
Zeke. Hey.

545
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,103
Hey, come on. Wake up. Wake up.

546
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:04,131
- Look at me, look at me.
- Michaela?

547
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:05,207
Oh, my God. Thank God.

548
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:06,729
Look, I don't have much time, okay?

549
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,712
But we got to get you out of here.
Cal and I, we had a Calling.

550
00:26:09,714 --> 00:26:11,270
You were on the airplane with us.

551
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:12,392
I know.

552
00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:13,686
I saw it, too.

553
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:16,362
Good.

554
00:26:16,364 --> 00:26:17,530
What did they do to you?

555
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:19,132
The Callings...

556
00:26:19,134 --> 00:26:22,569
I was shaking, and they
gave me drugs to stop it.

557
00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:24,704
That's why you couldn't see us.

558
00:26:25,706 --> 00:26:27,841
I screwed up.

559
00:26:27,843 --> 00:26:29,475
You were right.

560
00:26:29,477 --> 00:26:31,144
I'm not supposed to be here.

561
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:33,546
I'm supposed to be with you. I'm sorry.

562
00:26:33,548 --> 00:26:34,881
I am here now, okay?

563
00:26:34,883 --> 00:26:36,526
I know, but it's too late.

564
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,451
No, it's not. I am
getting you out of here.

565
00:26:38,453 --> 00:26:40,086
You never give up, do you?

566
00:26:40,655 --> 00:26:42,211
You can't be in here.

567
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:44,300
Tell them you need a lawyer.
Teresa Yin. It's on the back of that.

568
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,510
Tell them that you need a lawyer.

569
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:47,026
She's expecting your call!

570
00:26:52,426 --> 00:26:54,487
Do you have any idea
the damage you just caused?

571
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,284
I told you, she found the magic bullet.

572
00:26:56,286 --> 00:26:58,142
I couldn't risk it getting
into the wrong hands.

573
00:26:58,144 --> 00:26:59,713
You blew my cover,

574
00:26:59,715 --> 00:27:02,282
eviscerated our opportunity
to find the leak!

575
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:04,584
Look, Saanvi might be pissed,

576
00:27:04,586 --> 00:27:06,286
but your secret is safe.

577
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:08,055
- I trust her.
- Oh.

578
00:27:08,057 --> 00:27:10,123
Well, that's good to know
because now the only people

579
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:14,861
who know I'm alive are our
wives, Michaela, Saanvi.

580
00:27:14,863 --> 00:27:15,962
I'm sorry, Vance.

581
00:27:15,964 --> 00:27:18,065
We need to get in front of this.

582
00:27:19,434 --> 00:27:20,901
Maybe not.

583
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:22,569
Saanvi could still
help us find the leak.

584
00:27:22,571 --> 00:27:25,105
You said yourself
espionage is a long game.

585
00:27:25,107 --> 00:27:28,408
Our asset is compromised.

586
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,010
We have a very small window

587
00:27:30,012 --> 00:27:32,345
before this whole operation collapses.

588
00:27:54,002 --> 00:27:56,470
Now that we've had
a breakthrough, what do we do?

589
00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:58,772
Are we modifying our approach?

590
00:27:58,774 --> 00:28:01,341
You're always asking me questions.

591
00:28:01,343 --> 00:28:04,444
Um, 'cause I'm your lab assistant?

592
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:10,150
Not anymore.

593
00:28:10,152 --> 00:28:11,551
There was no breakthrough.

594
00:28:11,553 --> 00:28:15,122
It was a fluke, and we're
just tilting at windmills.

595
00:28:15,124 --> 00:28:18,692
I appreciate your help,
Troy, but I don't need you.

596
00:28:22,364 --> 00:28:24,831
This doesn't make any sense.

597
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,166
You...

598
00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:48,855
Ellen? It's Saanvi.

599
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:51,065
Uh, I've had a really awful day.

600
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:53,426
Is there any way you can squeeze me in?

601
00:29:04,406 --> 00:29:06,406
Hey! Hi.

602
00:29:06,408 --> 00:29:08,195
You, um... You weren't in class today.

603
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:09,276
I was worried. I thought maybe you...

604
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:11,144
Are you following me?

605
00:29:11,146 --> 00:29:13,113
No. No.

606
00:29:13,115 --> 00:29:15,282
I'm... I'm sorry.

607
00:29:15,284 --> 00:29:17,717
This must seem very bizarre. Uh...

608
00:29:19,388 --> 00:29:20,754
I'm worried about you.

609
00:29:20,756 --> 00:29:22,589
Call it intuition. I don't know.

610
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:24,925
I just... I have a bad feeling
that something's wrong,

611
00:29:24,927 --> 00:29:27,394
and if you're, um...

612
00:29:27,396 --> 00:29:29,596
if you're afraid or
you have a problem...

613
00:29:29,598 --> 00:29:34,034
My only problem is you
and your freak 828 boy.

614
00:29:34,036 --> 00:29:36,937
I know who your son
is. I watch the news.

615
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:38,905
I- I'm trying to help you.

616
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:39,973
Stay away.

617
00:29:39,975 --> 00:29:41,408
Stay away from my family.

618
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,311
Your son is an abomination.

619
00:29:44,313 --> 00:29:47,480
Oh, I get it! I get it now!

620
00:29:47,482 --> 00:29:49,275
I was supposed to open your eyes

621
00:29:49,277 --> 00:29:51,484
because you are a frightened,
small-minded woman

622
00:29:51,486 --> 00:29:54,187
who's afraid of anything
she doesn't understand.

623
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,060
I hope you lose that baby.

624
00:30:07,603 --> 00:30:10,804
The people versus Ezekiel Landon.

625
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:13,340
Thank you for finding
time on your docket

626
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:15,375
for this emergency hearing, Your Honor.

627
00:30:15,377 --> 00:30:18,044
Pursuant to Section 220.6,

628
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:21,047
my client moves to
withdraw his guilty plea.

629
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:24,451
Further, I've filed a motion
to dismiss all charges.

630
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:26,486
I'll grant the plea withdrawal.

631
00:30:26,488 --> 00:30:28,688
On what grounds do you move to dismiss?

632
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,891
New evidence calling into question

633
00:30:30,893 --> 00:30:32,359
the veracity of the investigation.

634
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:33,927
Your Honor, this is absurd.

635
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:36,663
Mr. Landon shot an NYPD detective.

636
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:38,698
Yes. Detective Stone.

637
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,166
I'd like to call her as a witness.

638
00:30:40,168 --> 00:30:42,569
Your Honor, this is a
waste of taxpayer dollars

639
00:30:42,571 --> 00:30:44,104
and the court's time.

640
00:30:44,106 --> 00:30:45,405
And yet the court awaits

641
00:30:45,407 --> 00:30:48,408
Detective Stone's
testimony with interest.

642
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,911
Your Honor, I call
Detective Michaela Stone

643
00:30:50,913 --> 00:30:52,178
to the stand.

644
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,553
Detective Stone, what do you know

645
00:31:00,555 --> 00:31:02,455
about the night you were shot?

646
00:31:02,457 --> 00:31:03,957
I know that it was an accident.

647
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:06,559
I know that Zeke Landon
is not a criminal.

648
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:08,828
He even tried to save my life.

649
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:16,416
I also know that Detective Vasquez

650
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:20,073
abused NYPD resources to
lift and run Zeke's prints.

651
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:22,108
He also had him followed.

652
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,110
He even broke into my
house without probable cause

653
00:31:25,112 --> 00:31:27,147
to confront Zeke.

654
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:28,448
None of this had to happen.

655
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,617
Objection... Lacks foundation.

656
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:32,321
The State demands
the courtroom be cleared

657
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,578
and this hearing postponed.

658
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,062
It was an accident.

659
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:39,021
I've informed Internal
Affairs, the arresting officer,

660
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:41,361
and my captain about this
miscarriage of justice.

661
00:31:41,363 --> 00:31:44,329
I am tired of being told to let this go.

662
00:31:44,331 --> 00:31:46,766
I'm not going to let this go.

663
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:49,202
I am the one that took that bullet.

664
00:31:49,204 --> 00:31:50,704
I am the victim.

665
00:31:50,706 --> 00:31:53,573
And I am telling you
that this man is innocent.

666
00:31:53,575 --> 00:31:57,310
The State requests a
sidebar, Your Honor.

667
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:05,352
Why can't I reach Saanvi?

668
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:06,786
Why do you think?

669
00:32:06,788 --> 00:32:08,708
You warned her she's being watched.

670
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,510
She's being careful,
probably ditched her phone.

671
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,287
She clearly wants nothing
to do with me or this.

672
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:15,145
Let's pray she doesn't
do anything stupid.

673
00:32:15,147 --> 00:32:17,530
I doubt Saanvi's done
anything stupid her whole life.

674
00:32:17,532 --> 00:32:19,099
Well, good,

675
00:32:19,101 --> 00:32:23,003
'cause right now her life
is exactly what's at stake.

676
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:29,476
Ben was the one person
I thought I could trust.

677
00:32:29,478 --> 00:32:32,445
Yet you're not shutting
down. You reached out to me,

678
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:35,148
rather than your usual
pattern of retreating.

679
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,884
That's substantive progress.

680
00:32:42,189 --> 00:32:46,893
You know how you encourage
me to look for the rose?

681
00:32:46,895 --> 00:32:48,962
And something that I'm grateful for?

682
00:32:48,964 --> 00:32:51,931
Yes, of course.

683
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:53,933
I'm grateful for you.

684
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:01,674
And also that I have my research.

685
00:33:03,644 --> 00:33:06,413
Speaking of, I think I made a discovery.

686
00:33:06,415 --> 00:33:09,004
I doubt I'll understand a word of it,

687
00:33:09,006 --> 00:33:11,351
but why don't you tell me?

688
00:33:11,353 --> 00:33:13,853
It's huge.

689
00:33:13,855 --> 00:33:15,777
It may even be the key to discovering

690
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:18,758
what happened to us on that plane.

691
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,430
It's in my fridge in the lab.

692
00:33:23,432 --> 00:33:26,066
My next client canceled.

693
00:33:26,068 --> 00:33:27,567
We have time.

694
00:33:29,336 --> 00:33:30,737
Okay.

695
00:33:33,724 --> 00:33:36,247
The State has decided
to reduce the charges

696
00:33:36,249 --> 00:33:39,151
to class A misdemeanor,
possession of a firearm.

697
00:33:39,153 --> 00:33:41,553
Pretty sweet offer, Counselor.

698
00:33:41,555 --> 00:33:43,455
How does your client plead?

699
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:46,533
Stand up and plead no contest.

700
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:50,729
No contest, Your Honor.

701
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:54,433
Very well, Mr. Landon. You're
sentenced to time served.

702
00:33:54,435 --> 00:33:56,658
Pending processing, you're free to go.

703
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:03,041
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

704
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,193
Guess I'm not the only one
who blew up their life.

705
00:34:17,124 --> 00:34:19,224
Hope it was worth it.

706
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:49,988
No one's ever done
anything like that for me.

707
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,523
You didn't just storm the castle...

708
00:34:51,525 --> 00:34:53,291
You burned it to the ground.

709
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:58,096
Yeah, well, you weren't
supposed to be inside.

710
00:35:15,015 --> 00:35:16,481
Now what?

711
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:20,986
How does a home-cooked meal sound?

712
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:24,756
You busted me outta jail.

713
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:27,325
Least I can do is cook for you.

714
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:30,262
Yeah, that's true.

715
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:33,165
In a surprising turn of events,

716
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:37,269
Flight 828 passenger and
NYPD detective Michaela Stone

717
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:40,372
took the stand today to
exonerate her alleged shooter,

718
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:41,606
Ezekiel Landon.

719
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:43,308
How 'bout you turn that crap off?

720
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,143
How 'bout some manners?

721
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:49,314
Can you turn that crap off, please?

722
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:50,816
Amen to that, brother.

723
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:53,418
828 wing nuts shouldn't be allowed

724
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,321
to carry the badge and gun.

725
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,390
Put those on my tab.

726
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:14,706
This could be a disaster.

727
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:16,708
- Well, let's hope not.
- Yeah, let's hope not.

728
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,611
I don't know who's
happier that Zeke's back,

729
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:21,813
you or that giddy little boy.

730
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:26,718
Cal seems to think
the plane Callings will stop.

731
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,689
You don't?

732
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:32,657
I think it's bigger than that.

733
00:36:37,498 --> 00:36:40,699
I wish I could protect
Cal from all of this.

734
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:42,767
It really hit home,

735
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:47,339
how much fear and hatred
there is out there.

736
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:49,174
That woman had so much venom.

737
00:36:50,577 --> 00:36:52,511
Maybe if she knew
what miracles you guys are,

738
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:53,845
she wouldn't be so scared.

739
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:55,814
You mean if she knew about the Callings?

740
00:36:55,816 --> 00:36:57,516
Well, if it were me,

741
00:36:57,518 --> 00:36:59,651
I'd share my gift with the world,

742
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:01,686
make it a better place.

743
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:09,761
Where did little Miss
Peace and Love come from?

744
00:37:09,763 --> 00:37:11,596
I don't know, but too
bad you can't sprinkle

745
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:13,532
some of that on the gargoyle lady.

746
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:19,871
The Calling told me to open her eyes,

747
00:37:19,873 --> 00:37:21,473
but I didn't.

748
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:26,378
Maybe it's not over, then.

749
00:37:29,783 --> 00:37:33,051
Who wishes to share their
acceptance of the miracle?

750
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:04,216
Um, I'm Olive.

751
00:38:04,218 --> 00:38:06,051
Hi, Olive.

752
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:15,260
My dad, my brother, and my
aunt were all 828 passengers.

753
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,219
Since they've returned,

754
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:26,771
I've been fighting to go back to normal.

755
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:31,209
I just... I didn't feel
like I belonged anymore.

756
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:34,980
But, being here...

757
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:38,583
I now realize that we... we all belong.

758
00:38:38,585 --> 00:38:42,187
All of us are special.

759
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:44,389
All of us.

760
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:48,860
I embrace the miracle,

761
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:53,231
and I-I really hope my family does, too.

762
00:38:53,233 --> 00:38:55,300
I believe.

763
00:38:55,302 --> 00:38:57,936
Blessed are the
children of the returned,

764
00:38:57,938 --> 00:38:59,971
for they will inherit the miracle.

765
00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:03,441
Blessed are the
children of the returned,

766
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:06,244
for they will inherit the miracle.

767
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:08,613
Blessed are the
children of the returned,

768
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:11,082
for they will inherit the miracle.

769
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:12,584
You were great today.

770
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:14,565
You kept the students
awake and off their phones.

771
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:16,187
I'm just glad they didn't boo me.

772
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:19,557
We want you to lead a seminar
on our next faculty retreat...

773
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:21,760
"Making Math Accessible".

774
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:22,794
Great.

775
00:39:22,796 --> 00:39:24,496
Ah, the wife.

776
00:39:24,498 --> 00:39:26,165
- Welcome aboard, Ben.
- Thank you.

777
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:29,468
I'll show to your new
office, Professor Stone.

778
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:47,118
What did you do?

779
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,887
I hired him.

780
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:51,990
"Welcome to my parlor",
said the spider to the fly.

781
00:40:14,214 --> 00:40:16,147
You were right.

782
00:40:16,149 --> 00:40:17,415
I found the leak.

783
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:26,224
When I found out I had a leak,

784
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:27,659
I had to see for myself, so...

785
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:29,794
You set up your own surveillance.

786
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:32,997
- See?
- I told you she could help.

787
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:34,332
What's he doing?

788
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:36,801
Siphoning samples of my
vials so I wouldn't notice.

789
00:40:36,803 --> 00:40:38,986
- You know this guy?
- Dr. Mathews.

790
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:40,939
But however he's involved,
he's not the leak.

791
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:42,107
How do you know?

792
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:44,509
I only told one person about that vial.

793
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,548
My psychiatrist, who
Mathews introduced me to...

794
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,850
Dr. Ellen Regier.

795
00:40:51,852 --> 00:40:54,922
I'm sorry, Saanvi. I really am.

796
00:40:54,924 --> 00:40:57,249
We never should've kept you in the dark.

797
00:40:57,251 --> 00:41:01,154
Kudos to your audacity, but
now the Major has your findings,

798
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:03,601
the ramifications of which I
can't even begin to describe.

799
00:41:03,603 --> 00:41:05,096
Those vials were fake.

800
00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:08,333
It'll take them weeks to figure it out.

801
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:10,101
You set up a trap?

802
00:41:11,412 --> 00:41:14,037
Oh, she is a much better
spy than you, Stone.

803
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,808
How is Dr. Regier
involved in all of this?

804
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,176
Do you have a description?

805
00:41:19,386 --> 00:41:23,779
Alright. Pretty much every
top-secret-security-cleared

806
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,084
female in the DoD.

807
00:41:26,086 --> 00:41:27,752
Recognize anyone?

808
00:41:30,222 --> 00:41:32,190
There.

809
00:41:32,192 --> 00:41:33,825
That's her.

810
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,026
You certain?

811

00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:46,604
30 years in black ops.

Now what?

820

Now we turn the tables.

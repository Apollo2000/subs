1
00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:01,884
<i>Previously on "Manifest"...</i>

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,552
Zeke, what is this?

3
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:05,487
Frostbite.
I may be freezing to death.

4
00:00:05,523 --> 00:00:07,522
Saanvi thinks she can help.
She may have a cure.

5
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:09,324
It was the first one
I ever drew,

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,928
and I actually never
figured out what it meant.

7
00:00:11,964 --> 00:00:13,695
It still kind of
creeps me out.

8
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:14,897
The best way
to destroy a hate group

9
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,032
is to blow it up
from the inside.

10
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:17,432
You've been undercover?

11
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:18,533
Why didn't you tell me?

12
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:19,769
Because I needed you
to believe

13
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:21,470
I was in so deep
that they'd believe.

14
00:00:21,506 --> 00:00:23,806
The minute we release this guy,
he's gonna call the cops.

15
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:25,908
Don't say a word.

16
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:27,309
My water just broke.

17
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:28,710
I've done this surgery
many times,

18
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:29,979
but the baby's heart rate
has been dropping.

19
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:31,748
We need to go now.

20
00:00:31,784 --> 00:00:33,582
I don't know how to thank you.
If you didn't get here, I...

21
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:35,317
It was actually something
of a miracle that I did.

22
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:37,352
I was kayaking earlier today
in the Harlem River.

23
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:38,988
Lost my balance,
and I flipped over.

24
00:00:39,024 --> 00:00:41,090
A total stranger
saved my life.

25
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:42,591
If you needed
any more proof

26
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:44,026
that the Callings are good,
this is it.

27
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:45,694
"False prophets will arise
from the dead

28
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,596
to perform
signs and wonders."

29
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:49,966
You keep assuming
we're on the side of good, Ben.

30
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:51,366
We are returned from the dead

31
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:53,736
to be agents
of the apocalypse.

32
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:05,081
Ben, you've gone off
the deep end.

33
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:07,049
- Just hear me out.
- What, that we're false prophets

34
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:08,517
coming back from the dead?

35
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:09,986
I thought you got off
this theory months ago

36
00:01:10,022 --> 00:01:12,420
when the Calling
saved Grace and the baby.

37
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:14,623
Yeah, but pretty much
every single night since then,

38
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:17,559
Cal's been terrorized
by these three looming shadows.

39
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:19,363
Still?

40
00:01:22,968 --> 00:01:25,902
You must really be
desperate for answers.

41
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:27,669
Science guy
looking in the Bible.

42
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:29,604
I just found this
in Revelation,

43
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,842
and it weirdly echoes
Adrian's apocalypse theory.

44
00:01:32,878 --> 00:01:35,111
"I saw three spirits coming out
of the mouth of the dragon,

45
00:01:35,147 --> 00:01:36,645
out of the mouth
of the beast,

46
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:38,915
out of the mouth
of the false prophet."

47
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:42,584
Okay, that's creepy,
but the Callings...

48
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,853
Think about the good, too.

49
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:45,487
Which I keep
reminding myself,

50
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,924
but, Mick, what Cal's seeing
is so dark,

51
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,558
I keep coming back
to Adrian.

52
00:01:49,594 --> 00:01:52,795
I mean, what if this is
all "signs and wonders"?

53
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:55,731
So, what, we're doing good
but for bad reasons?

54
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:58,901
To lull us into obedience for
some end-of-the-world scenario.

55
00:02:00,172 --> 00:02:02,104
It's
a really messed-up theory.

56
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:08,443
I'm sorry.
I should have asked.

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,179
How's Zeke?

58
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:12,647
It's hard to tell.

59
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:14,884
He never complains.

60
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,551
It's not fair, though.

61
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:17,987
He's at the hospital
every single day.

62
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:19,588
The treatment regimen
is relentless.

63
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:21,423
Saanvi thinks it's helping?

64
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:24,727
It's slowing the frostbite,
but, no, Ben, it's not a cure.

65
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:28,097
I am hoping
for a freaking miracle

66
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:31,968
'cause if not,
he's running out of time.

67
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:40,209
I can already tell
this is gonna be a tough one.

68
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:42,078
I woke up wanting to use
so bad it hurt.

69
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:45,915
Why today, do you think?

70
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:47,783
It's...

71
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,088
the anniversary
of my sister Chloe's death.

72
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,523
We all dealt with her death
in our own messed-up ways.

73
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,893
My dad bailed.

74
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:59,594
My mom withdrew.

75
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,065
And I-I-I turned to drugs
to numb the pain.

76
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,667
So, in a way, this is
also the anniversary

77
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:08,603
of your addiction.

78
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,073
Good news is,
you're in recovery now.

79
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:13,009
How's that going?

80
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:16,979
If I'm being honest,
working the steps

81
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:18,848
has been feeling
a little pointless lately.

82
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:20,582
Just take it
one day at a time.

83
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:23,188
That's the thing.
I may not have many days left.

84
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:28,157
Look, I don't want sympathy.
I mean, it is what it is.

85
00:03:28,193 --> 00:03:30,259
But it's hard to work
towards something

86
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:32,895
when you know you're dying.

87
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:37,066
It might be
about closure now.

88
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:41,103
Making peace
with others and yourself.

89
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:44,508
You've been so focused
on seeking forgiveness.

90
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:48,844
Who do <i>you</i> need
to forgive?

91
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,920
Okay, I still don't know who

92
00:03:57,956 --> 00:03:59,989
or what you are exactly,

93
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:03,525
other than a voice in my head.

94
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:05,861
But enough is enough.

95
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:08,130
Since the plane came back, you
have called on me relentlessly,

96
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,765
and I've listened.

97
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:13,102
I've literally done everything
that you wanted

98
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:15,771
because I believe that
what you're asking us to do

99
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:16,906
is for a purpose.

100
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:19,008
I mean, it has to be.

101
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:25,715
So why,
after all that I've done,

102
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:29,719
am I watching the man I love
freeze to death?

103
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:33,155
A good, kind man
who also listens to you,

104
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:38,861
who has worked so hard
to redeem himself.

105
00:04:38,897 --> 00:04:41,097
He doesn't deserve this.

106
00:04:44,302 --> 00:04:47,569
How am I supposed to know that
this is for some greater good

107
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:51,240
if you just let him die?

108
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:53,644
How am I supposed
to keep listening?

109
00:04:57,883 --> 00:04:59,715
I need to understand.

110
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:01,917
I don't want to lose faith.

111
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:03,953
Don't make me.

112
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:12,479

Hey! Hey!
Stop! Thief!

114
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:22,604
- Hey! Somebody stop him!
- NYPD! Stop!

115
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:26,708
Ohh!

116
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:27,977
Ow!

117
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:28,947
Get up.

118
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,283
Hands up.
Hands up.

119
00:05:32,784 --> 00:05:34,016
It's your unlucky day, kid.
I'm a cop.

120
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:35,317
No, no, p-please, ma'am.

121
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:37,319
It was just a candy bar.

122
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:39,255
It was the first time ever,
I swear.

123
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,956
I'm gonna be
in so much trouble.

124
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,391
You don't understand.
My mom's gonna kill me.

125
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:44,126
Well, you should have
thought about that be...

126
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:45,895
<i>Let him go.</i>

127
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:47,629
<i>Let him go.</i>

128
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:54,370
Look, kid,
don't be stupid, okay?

129
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:55,771
If I catch you
doing this again...

130
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:56,739
Okay.

131
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:57,740
Go.

132
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:11,954
What the hell is this?

133
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,156
It's what the kid stole.

134
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:16,361
No, it isn't.

135
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:19,962
<i>This</i> is.

136
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:22,298
20 boxes, maybe.
I was restocking.

137
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:25,101
I turned my back
for one second, and, bam.

138
00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:27,336
Bodega down the way
got hit a couple days ago.

139
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:28,437
Same thing.

140
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:29,905
Cold medicine.

141
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:31,006
Do you know
what they use it for?

142
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:32,643
To cook meth.

143
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:37,379
Can I run something
by you?

144
00:06:37,415 --> 00:06:38,749
Always.

145
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:47,756
I, um, caught a kid
stealing a candy bar,

146
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:51,427
and then I get a Calling
telling me to let him go.

147
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:53,462
S-So I did.

148
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:55,264
And...?

149
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,299
Turns out the candy bar
was just a decoy,

150
00:06:57,335 --> 00:07:00,269
and he had half a case of
cold medicine in his backpack.

151
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:02,371
So you think the candy-bar
kid's cooking meth?

152
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:04,039
I don't know.
The bodega owner said

153
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:06,108
a place down the street
got hit a few days ago.

154
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:08,310
So, yeah, it makes me think
it was the same kid.

155
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:12,081
Or he could be part
of a bigger operation.

156
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:14,316
Maybe that's why the Calling
told me to let him go,

157
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,852
so that we could catch
the bigger fish.

158
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:18,220
That's a terrible plan.

159
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:19,822
More helpful would have been
to bring him in

160
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:21,457
so we could interrogate him.

161
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:22,992
Mick, why does it feel like

162
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:24,426
you're always trying
to justify the Callings?

163
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:27,830
Because I gotta believe
they're good, Jared.

164
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:31,901
Well, I should probably
help you track this kid down.

165
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:34,069
Unless you want to let her in
on your, uh, gift.

166
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:35,971
- Hey.
- Hey.

167
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:38,274
I'm, uh, probably gonna
peel off with Vasquez today.

168
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,075
- Really?
- Yeah, I witnessed a crime.

169
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:41,377
He thinks
it could be related

170
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:42,912
to a bunch of robberies
he's tracking.

171
00:07:42,948 --> 00:07:44,180
Yeah, you sure
he's not just trying

172
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:45,781
to get back in your pants?

173
00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:47,950
Um, no,
<i>I</i> asked <i>him</i> to help.

174
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:50,152
Okay, alright, well,
if you're good, I'm good.

175
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:52,057
It'll give me a chance to
catch up on some paperwork.

176
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,491
Hey, Vasquez, this is
just a loaner, okay?

177
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:57,395
Yeah.

178
00:08:00,432 --> 00:08:02,531
Come on, Eden.

179
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,833
Give Daddy a little smile.

180
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:07,136
Pbht!

181
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:12,341
I think
your daddy's lost it.

182
00:08:13,878 --> 00:08:16,212
She doesn't perform
on command... yet.

183
00:08:16,248 --> 00:08:18,447
- Ohh.
- Come here, you little diva.

184
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,282
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

185
00:08:20,318 --> 00:08:22,017
Shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh,

186
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:24,453
shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh.

187
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:28,991
♪ Frosty winter into spring ♪

188
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:34,096
♪ Sunny summer into fall ♪

189
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:36,098
♪ I will love you
through it all ♪

190
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:38,567
She likes that one.
Where's it from?

191
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:40,569
You want to hear
something so sweet?

192
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,571
Cal was singing it to her.

193
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,240
Oh.

194
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:50,279
You saw something.

195
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:53,918
Yeah, it was...
some kind of train.

196
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:57,853
But the Calling,
it felt different.

197
00:08:57,889 --> 00:08:59,989
Different how?

198
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:02,861
Like I was gonna die.

199
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:11,117
You know what would go
really well with this drink?

200
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:12,619
Dim sum.

201
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:14,220
There's a killer place
around here.

202
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:15,421
Dim sum?

203
00:09:15,457 --> 00:09:16,589
Alright, bud,
I gotta get you home.

204
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,124
I got class tonight.

205
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,527
Fine, but we should all go
sometime, as a family.

206
00:09:20,563 --> 00:09:22,795
Wait.

207
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,264
You saying I'm family now?

208
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,766
Uh, yeah, kinda.

209
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:28,334
Plus, when you order
with a big group,

210
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,169
you can order
all different kinds.

211
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:32,171
Yeah, that's a good point.

212
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:47,420
You didn't just see
three dark shadows, did you?

213
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:48,888
No.

214
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:51,824
But I did see something.

215
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,626
It was, like, all these
little pieces of glass

216
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:56,563
that came together and formed
this huge bird with talons.

217
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,431
A phoenix, I think.

218
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:00,166
Which represents
life and rebirth.

219
00:10:00,202 --> 00:10:01,834
I looked it up.

220
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,337
Cal said
you were pretty spooked.

221
00:10:04,373 --> 00:10:05,738
It was weird.

222
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,373
I mean, the picture
was bright and cheerful,

223
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,342
but I felt so... sad.

224
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:12,245
- Huh.
- Hopeless, almost.

225
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:13,513
It was just different.

226
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:14,714
Hmm.

227
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,583
This bird with talons...

228
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:20,620
Could it have been a... a dragon
or some other mythical beast?

229
00:10:20,656 --> 00:10:22,722
I mean, it really looked
like a phoenix. Why?

230
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,324
Uh,
grasping at straws, maybe,

231
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,893
but your picture, my trains,

232
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:29,529
uh, Cal's shadows all...

233
00:10:29,565 --> 00:10:30,897
felt like doom and gloom.

234
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:32,632
Hopefully not
<i>our</i> doom and gloom.

235
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:35,435
We've been on a pretty good
streak since the baby was born.

236
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:37,437
True.

237
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:39,906
What if they're related
in some other way?

238
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:42,475
You said the phoenix looked
as though it were made up

239
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,444
of tiny little pieces
of glass.

240
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,312
Could it have been a mosaic?

241
00:10:46,348 --> 00:10:48,648
Yeah. I suppose.

242
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:51,651
Because some of the subway
stations have those big murals.

243
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:52,919
That could have been
the train I saw.

244
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:54,523
There's a bunch
of this stuff.

245
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,926
Any of those look familiar?

246
00:10:59,962 --> 00:11:01,661
Yeah, that's the one.

247
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:02,829
Let's see it.

248
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:06,766
It's downtown. Bowery.

249
00:11:06,802 --> 00:11:08,668
- We should check it out.
- Yeah.

250
00:11:09,972 --> 00:11:12,305
Baby, she's sleeping.

251
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:14,240
She's not gonna smile
any time soon.

252
00:11:15,844 --> 00:11:17,777
But don't forget we have
her four-month checkup later.

253
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:19,946
I'll be back
to pick you up.

254
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:22,448
I'm gonna do
a little more debridement

255
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:24,751
of the dead skin later, okay?

256
00:11:24,787 --> 00:11:25,752
Oh, joy.

257
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:27,420
I know it's painful.

258
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:29,956
We're trying to slow
the migration.

259
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:31,958
MRI will tell us if there's
been any deterioration

260
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:33,693
since your last scan.

261
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:37,697
I need to, uh, replace your
warm fluids with some cold dye.

262
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:38,898
Sorry.

263
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:40,900
You love torturing me,
don't you?

264
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:42,669
Not even a little.

265
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:46,239
What else
is going on with you?

266
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:47,640
At my meeting today,

267
00:11:47,676 --> 00:11:49,509
my sponsor said
I should be finding closure

268
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:52,478
so I'm ready to move on.

269
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:54,881
Kinda made me mad
'cause I'm not ready.

270
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,549
There's no reason
you should be.

271
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:57,985
It's not fair
what's happening to you.

272
00:11:58,021 --> 00:11:59,452
More painful
than the treatment

273
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:01,721
is how
it's affecting Michaela.

274
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:03,489
She really
is my soul mate.

275
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,025
I know how you feel.

276
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:07,927
I mean, it's not the same,
but, yeah.

277
00:12:07,963 --> 00:12:09,429
Of course. Alex.

278
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:11,764
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

279
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,333
Hey, at least
there is hope for you.

280
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:15,802
I have faith
in my retrovirus.

281
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:17,971
We just have to keep
the frostbite in check

282
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:20,373
until I fine-tune
the formula.

283
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:21,708
Wait, you're still
experimenting?

284
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:23,443
Of course.

285
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,311
I mean,
a little more carefully

286
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:27,014
since the little Alex fiasco,
but yeah.

287
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,415
Al-Zuras' journal
didn't warn you off?

288
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:31,884
It said the Callings were the
only way around the Death Date,

289
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,323
that everything else
was a path to disaster.

290
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:40,393
Medicine has come a long way
since bleeding and leeches.

291
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:42,695
There's so many illnesses
that were a death sentence

292
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:44,664
and now have a cure.
Why is this any different?

293
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,035
You really believe that?

294
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:52,438
Once I figure out how
to reverse the DNA anomaly,

295
00:12:52,474 --> 00:12:53,873
we can go back
to being ordinary.

296
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,641
No Callings,
no more Death Date.

297
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:56,676
I hope so.

298
00:12:56,712 --> 00:12:58,047
Yeah, me too.

299
00:13:08,557 --> 00:13:10,857
We're trying to track down
one of your riders.

300
00:13:10,893 --> 00:13:12,525
Happy to help
any way I can.

301
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:15,028
Got on at 156th and Hewitt
a little after 9:00.

302
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:16,429
You know what?

303
00:13:16,465 --> 00:13:17,764
Right on time.

304
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,732
Do you mind
if we talk to the driver?

305
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:23,569
Um, that would be Kory.

306
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:26,506
- I'll see if he's here.
- Thanks.

307
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:29,909
I had Diaz put together a map
of robberies similar to yours.

308
00:13:29,945 --> 00:13:31,477
It's all across
the boroughs.

309
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:34,014
If this is all the same
operation, then it's huge.

310
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,415
You're looking for one
of my riders?

311
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:38,518
Hey, yeah.
Uh, he's about 17,

312
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:41,121
brown hair, backpack,
got on a little after 9:00.

313
00:13:41,157 --> 00:13:43,123
A lot of kids get on my bus
around that time.

314
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,724
Guy was shoplifting,

315
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,560
probably got on last minute,
definitely winded.

316
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:49,096
Look, no disrespect,

317
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:52,431
but if I remembered
everyone got on my bus,

318
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,034
I'd quit and go
to Atlantic City.

319
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,601
Does your bus
have security cameras?

320
00:13:55,637 --> 00:13:56,636
We want to see the tapes.

321
00:13:56,672 --> 00:13:57,837
Sure.

322
00:13:57,873 --> 00:13:59,438
Just flash your badges
at Sonia.

323
00:13:59,474 --> 00:14:00,506
She'll get you
what you need.

324
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,078
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

325
00:14:03,512 --> 00:14:04,677
I guess your Calling's trying

326
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,379
to send us
on a wild-goose chase.

327
00:14:06,415 --> 00:14:07,747
There's always a reason,
Jared.

328
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:10,117
Look, you don't have to help
if you don't want.

329
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:11,553
Now I'm curious.

330
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:17,456
So, those shadows
Cal sees...

331
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:18,558
What about them?

332
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:19,659
What if they're
not supposed

333
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:21,661
to make us doubt
the Callings?

334
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:23,663
What if they're
another warning,

335
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:25,464
like the fire?

336
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,799
About what?

337
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:28,868
Something terrible
that's coming.

338
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:30,803
Sir.

339
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,441
Excuse me. Uh...

340
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:35,544
Here you go.

341
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:39,445
Thanks, kid.

342
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:41,514
You raised him well, Dad.

343
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,549
Come on.

344
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:51,024
The phoenix.

345
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,461
Over there.

346
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:57,130
So, what now?

347
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,532
I don't know.

348
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:01,703
Just keep our eyes open.

349
00:15:11,114 --> 00:15:12,445
You know
that gloomy feeling?

350
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:13,913
Yeah, I feel it, too.

351
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:16,149
Approaching
express train is not in service.

352
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:19,152
Please stand away
from the platform edge.

353
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:25,691
Look. Over there.

354
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:27,593
The guy from the stairs.

355
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:31,530
Express train is not in service.

356
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,599
Please stand away
from the platform.

357
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:36,636
No, no, no, no, no!
Stop!

358
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:46,015
What the hell?

359
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,628
Best thing about
being stuck in a hospital

360
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:54,296
is the guilt-free
junk food.

361
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:56,800
You always had
a sweet tooth.

362
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:59,401
Should've brought
something for you.

363
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:01,203
Ah, I'm just glad
you could come today, Mom.

364
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:03,472
Mm.
What happened?

365
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:06,408
You were doing so well,
taking care of yourself.

366
00:16:06,444 --> 00:16:08,344
I'm not using, Mom.

367
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,346
I promise.

368
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:14,516
Then why are you
so sick?

369
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:16,185
I told you.
I'm... I'm recovering

370
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:18,888
from burns and smoke inhalation
from that fire.

371
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:21,457
Yeah, I-I know.

372
00:16:21,493 --> 00:16:23,258
I'm sorry.

373
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:24,894
It's just that, um,

374
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,229
it's been a long time now.

375
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,431
You're all I've got.

376
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:30,667
So I worry.

377
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:32,669
You don't need
to apologize.

378
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:33,870
After all the times
I lied to you,

379
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:35,337
you have
a right to doubt me.

380
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:38,574
No, I just feel so lucky
to have my son back.

381
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,713
To see you happy
and in love.

382
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:46,883
I really like Michaela.

383
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,217
Me too.

384
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:49,421
Mm.

385
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:53,790
Well, I guess
I better get going

386
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:56,227
if I'm gonna make it
out there today.

387
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:02,231
I love you.

388
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:04,266
Mm.

389
00:17:04,302 --> 00:17:05,805
I love you so much.

390
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:10,305
I wish
you could come with me.

391
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:11,741
We'll go again
when I'm better.

392
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:13,609
Okay.

393
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:22,652
My sister loved
Jones Beach.

394
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:24,688
So we go out there every year
to remember her.

395
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:26,522
That's
a beautiful tradition.

396
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:28,725
Unfortunately, my IV
doesn't travel further

397
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:30,894
than the vending machine.

398
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,662
You still haven't told her

399
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:33,830
what's really going on,
have you?

400
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:35,431
Why torment her?

401
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:38,300
Thought I'd wait
till I was on death's door.

402
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:41,303
Which I might be, judging
by the look on your face.

403
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:43,441
How bad is it?

404
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:48,945
Yeah, the MRI results
aren't exactly what I'd hoped.

405
00:17:48,981 --> 00:17:52,347
There's some new damage
to your muscles.

406
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,416
So I'm still freezing
to death.

407
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:57,453
We are not gonna lose
this fight, okay?

408
00:17:57,489 --> 00:17:59,956
You mean too much
to all of us.

409
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:05,962
Hey,
you find something?

410
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:07,864
Yeah, I'm never sitting
on a bus again.

411
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,431
People are disgusting.

412
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:11,300
Thanks for the PSA.

413
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:12,669
Any leads
on the shoplifter?

414
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:14,003
Yeah, we have three kids

415
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,739
who match your description
of the runner.

416
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:19,475
Yeah, that's him.

417
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:21,046
Okay.

418
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:28,450
Alright.
He got off at Franklin High.

419
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:29,853
Alright, forward me
a screen shot.

420
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:32,454
I'll call the principal
and send it over for an ID.

421
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:39,062
So, how was your little
walk down memory lane?

422
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:41,097
It's good to be friends again.
Thank you for asking.

423
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:42,732
I don't have many friends
who would infiltrate

424
00:18:42,768 --> 00:18:44,000
a hate group for me.

425
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:46,602
No, he's a cop.
He's just doing his job.

426
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:48,972
Yeah, well, that maybe
explains the undercover part,

427
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:51,941
but that awful haircut...
That's true love.

428
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:53,777
Okay, let's just forward him
the screen shot.

429
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:55,346
Mm-hmm.

430
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:57,881
Ah. Hey.

431
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:59,883
- How's he doing?
- He's sleeping.

432
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,517
Just scrapes and bruises.
Nothing serious.

433
00:19:01,553 --> 00:19:03,686
He's lucky you two were
on the platform today.

434
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:04,754
Any ID?

435
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,823
No ID, no phone.

436
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:08,091
We put him in the database.

437
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:09,893
If someone misses him,
they show up.

438
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,426
Alright. Thank you.

439
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:12,564
Mm-hmm.

440
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:15,597
And you're sure
he's not a passenger?

441
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,066
I'm positive.

442
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:19,135
So, that's it?

443
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:20,970
We save his life
and have no idea who he is

444
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:22,538
or why the Callings
led us to him.

445
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:25,443
Maybe we'll get some answers
when he wakes up.

446
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:30,348
He was holding that matchbox
when he tried to end it all.

447
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:42,862
It's a music box.

448
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:56,405
- It's Grace's lullaby.
- What?

449
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:58,407
Grace was singing
this lullaby today.

450
00:19:58,443 --> 00:19:59,408
Where'd she learn it?

451
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:00,877
Cal.

452
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:04,047
So the lullaby's got to be
a Calling, too, right?

453
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,516
A subway, a phoenix mosaic,
and a lullaby.

454
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:08,918
That's a weird puzzle.

455
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:10,119
The song
was about the seasons.

456
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:11,921
I can't...
I can't recall the lyrics.

457
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:13,422
Maybe that's the key.

458
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,691
Cal knows them.
We should talk to him.

459
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,458
Yeah.

460
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,063
He seemed like a nice guy.

461
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,098
Sad he tried
to end his life.

462
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:24,133
Hey.

463
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:27,469
We gave him
a second chance.

464
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:29,041
Now we just need
to figure out why.

465
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:32,041
It was
just a candy bar.

466
00:20:32,077 --> 00:20:34,177
Right. Well, uh, that excuse
worked this morning

467
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:36,478
when you forgot to tell us about
the cold medicine you snatched.

468
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:37,680
Help me understand something,
Oscar.

469
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:38,948
Straight A's,

470
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:41,184
honor student,
and cooks meth?

471
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,719
Meth?

472
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:44,586
No, no, no.
I-I-I don't cook meth.

473
00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:47,023
I-I don't do drugs, alright?
I'm on the track team.

474
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:48,224
Okay, well,
it doesn't look like

475
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,591
you have
much of a cold, either.

476
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:50,793
So do you want
to help us out here?

477
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:52,095
Please,
you gotta believe me.

478
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:54,130
I had no idea
those were to make meth.

479
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,133
Mm-hmm. Then you work
for somebody that does.

480
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:58,500
- Hm.
- Come on, man.

481
00:20:58,536 --> 00:21:00,136
Don't make us bring you in
on this.

482
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:02,839
I don't know him.

483
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,073
Alright, it was a JoJo.

484
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:05,742
A what?

485
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:08,577
JoJo's Delivery Service?

486
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:10,213
Like a...
Like a dark Net TaskRabbit.

487
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:12,649
As if you were explaining it
to your mother...

488
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:15,550
So, you get a snap of what to
steal and where to drop it off,

489
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:16,853
and then they Venmo you.

490
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:18,655
Who are "they"?

491
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:21,658
Uh, I just know
the handle's Try3.

492
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:23,993
Okay, so, you took the bus
to the drop-off.

493
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:26,095
No, the bus <i>is</i> the drop-off.

494
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:30,233
Ah-ha-ha!

495
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:32,501
- Aha! Oh!
- Checkmate!

496
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:33,970
No mercy for a sick patient,
huh?

497
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:35,238
Don't say
I didn't warn you.

498
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:36,638
You should have seen
the tournaments

499
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:37,840
we had in the cancer ward.

500
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:39,208
Rematch?

501
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:40,810
I'm a glutton
for punishment.

502
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:41,878
Set up the board.

503
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:44,613
- Hey.
- Hey.

504
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:46,683
- How you doing?
- Getting my butt kicked.

505
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,885
Cal, I need you
to talk to TJ.

506
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:51,120
We think your lullaby
might be a Calling.

507
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:52,855
What lullaby?

508
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:55,258
You know,
the one you sing to Eden.

509
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:59,262
♪ Frosty winter
into spring ♪

510
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:03,565
♪ Sunny summer into fall ♪

511
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:07,873
♪ I will love you
through them all ♪

512
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:11,207
How do you know that?

513
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:13,743
My dad wrote that.

514
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,012
Was he a songwriter?

515
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:17,680
No.

516
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:21,217
He just... He would sing
me and my sister to sleep.

517
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:25,288
He had a little music box
he used to make up songs to.

518
00:22:25,324 --> 00:22:27,059
No one else would know them.

519
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:32,862
Zeke, when's the last time
you saw your dad?

520
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:35,031
He left a few months
after my sister died.

521
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,565
Haven't seen him since.

522
00:22:36,601 --> 00:22:39,568
He's dead for all I know.

523
00:22:39,604 --> 00:22:42,739
Actually...

524
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:44,777
I think
he might be downstairs.

525
00:22:49,983 --> 00:22:52,082
Told you the Callings
had a plan.

526
00:22:52,118 --> 00:22:53,817
"Let him go."

527
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:55,986
If I hadn't, then we wouldn't
be onto this bus drop-off

528
00:22:56,022 --> 00:22:57,287
or any of this.

529
00:22:57,323 --> 00:22:59,023
If the Callings
really wanted to help,

530
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:00,290
they'd lead us
directly to the lab.

531
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:02,126
Oh, where's the fun
in that?

532
00:23:02,162 --> 00:23:03,626
Fun's gonna be
an ice-cold beer

533
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:05,628
once we put
these criminals away.

534
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:08,899
Hey, so, we got
access to Try3's payment list,

535
00:23:08,935 --> 00:23:10,768
and it matches
most of the bodega thefts

536
00:23:10,804 --> 00:23:12,002
in the five boroughs.

537
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:13,137
They steal the items,

538
00:23:13,173 --> 00:23:14,838
drop them off on the bus,

539
00:23:14,874 --> 00:23:16,140
and then someone comes
and picks them up.

540
00:23:16,176 --> 00:23:17,674
And most of the payments

541
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,876
were made within
two hours of the theft.

542
00:23:18,912 --> 00:23:21,045
Never making
any direct contact.

543
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:23,613
So the kids
can't ID the dealers.

544
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:25,716
- It's crafty.
- Do we know who Try3 is?

545
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:27,851
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Jace Baylor.

546
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:29,787
History of violence,
stint upstate

547
00:23:29,823 --> 00:23:31,789
for possession
and sale of meth.

548
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:33,857
He was busted for buying
fertilizer in bulk.

549
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:36,927
Well, it looks like he found a
smarter way to get his supplies.

550
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:38,929
Didn't take him long. He was
released four months ago.

551
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:40,330
Just when
the robberies started.

552
00:23:40,366 --> 00:23:41,932
Might be tricky
to find him.

553
00:23:41,968 --> 00:23:43,333
He was evicted
from his last-known address

554
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:45,002
and hasn't checked in
with his parole officer.

555
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:47,037
I have a guy in narcotics
who owes me a favor.

556
00:23:47,073 --> 00:23:50,040
- I'll see what he knows.
- I'm gonna go check in on Zeke.

557
00:23:50,076 --> 00:23:51,742
I'll text you
if I get an address.

558
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:53,944
What are we waiting for?
Let's go find your dad.

559
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,279
I'm not sure that's
such a good idea, bud.

560
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:57,181
Don't you want
to see him?

561
00:23:57,217 --> 00:23:58,882
Let's just say I didn't get
as lucky as you

562
00:23:58,918 --> 00:24:00,384
in the dad department.

563
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,952
Hey, Calamander,

564
00:24:01,988 --> 00:24:04,788
what do you say you come
with me and your sister?

565
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:06,223
Get us checked in.
We'll wait for you.

566
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:08,926
Thank you.
Thanks, buddy.

567
00:24:08,962 --> 00:24:10,396
- Bye, guys.
- See you later.

568
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:13,730
There has to be a reason

569
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:15,165
the Calling
brought us to your father.

570
00:24:15,201 --> 00:24:17,668
Calling wasted your time.

571
00:24:17,704 --> 00:24:19,036
My dad made it very clear

572
00:24:19,072 --> 00:24:20,737
he wanted nothing to do
with me years ago.

573
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:22,873
I think he maybe changed.

574
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:25,242
I get the feeling
he's got a lot of regrets.

575
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:26,877
Good.

576
00:24:26,913 --> 00:24:28,114
He should.

577
00:24:31,151 --> 00:24:34,318
You're angry. I get it.

578
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:37,721
But
he's your dad.

579
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:39,022
Does he not get
a second chance?

580
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:40,457
He's not like you, Ben.

581
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:42,092
Your kid gets hurt,
you pick him up,

582
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:43,460
you tell him
it's gonna be okay.

583
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:46,897
My dad dumped all the blame
on me and bailed.

584
00:24:46,933 --> 00:24:50,167
After your sister died?

585
00:24:50,203 --> 00:24:52,272
There's no excuse
for that.

586
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,273
But...

587
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:58,809
as someone that has
a brand-new baby girl,

588
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:01,278
I can't imagine
what I would do

589
00:25:01,314 --> 00:25:04,281
if something happened
to her.

590
00:25:04,317 --> 00:25:06,083
You know, grief can make us
do crazy things.

591
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,285
You don't have to tell me
about grief.

592
00:25:08,321 --> 00:25:09,987
I fell apart.

593
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:11,288
Where was he?

594
00:25:11,324 --> 00:25:12,422
He moved on.

595
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:14,758
No note. Nothing.

596
00:25:14,794 --> 00:25:16,026
I never saw him again.

597
00:25:16,062 --> 00:25:18,195
And he's a broken man
because of it.

598
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:22,332
Zeke, he was about
to take his own life.

599
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:30,407
That's not
my responsibility.

600
00:25:30,443 --> 00:25:34,878
What if
this is your chance

601
00:25:34,914 --> 00:25:37,214
to let go of all
of that hurt and anger?

602
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,784
I'm not gonna spend the little
time I have left on that man.

603
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,119
But you're not doing this
for <i>him.</i>

604
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:43,256
You're doing this for <i>you.</i>

605
00:25:47,026 --> 00:25:51,295
Maybe it's time
that you forgive

606
00:25:51,331 --> 00:25:53,330
so you can find
some closure.

607
00:26:11,451 --> 00:26:13,219
You're...

608
00:26:15,955 --> 00:26:18,488
You and your dad
were at the subway.

609
00:26:18,524 --> 00:26:22,226
Not my dad,
but, uh, yeah.

610
00:26:22,262 --> 00:26:24,861
How you feeling?

611
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:26,496
You shouldn't
have saved me.

612
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:29,002
- Don't say that.
- It's the truth.

613
00:26:31,437 --> 00:26:35,539
There was a mural
of a phoenix in the subway.

614
00:26:35,575 --> 00:26:38,308
Does that mean anything
to you?

615
00:26:38,344 --> 00:26:42,012
It's a symbol
of rebirth and renewal.

616
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,814
Maybe you got a chance
to try again.

617
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,549
What makes
you think I deserve one?

618
00:26:45,585 --> 00:26:48,185
- Everyone does.
- What is it to you, anyway?

619
00:26:48,221 --> 00:26:50,354
A lot, actually.

620
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,991
My mother killed herself.

621
00:26:55,128 --> 00:26:58,965
And I would do anything to
be able to see her again.

622
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:02,502
I'm sorry.

623
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:08,205
I'm sure someone feels
the same way about you.

624
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:10,474
Don't you have a family?

625
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,143
They've forgotten about me
by now.

626
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:14,578
I doubt that.

627
00:27:14,614 --> 00:27:16,046
How do you know
they're not out there

628
00:27:16,082 --> 00:27:17,314
looking for you right now?

629
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,251
'Cause what I did
was unforgivable.

630
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:24,490
I abandoned
them when they needed me.

631
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,100
Hey, Dad.

632
00:27:37,136 --> 00:27:38,602
Zeke?

633
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:12,202
I can't believe it.

634
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:13,270
<i>I</i> can.

635
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:14,538
Zeke needed this.

636
00:28:46,205 --> 00:28:47,971
Just what the doctor ordered.

637
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:49,306
- Hey!
- Hey.

638
00:28:49,342 --> 00:28:51,074
I didn't expect to see you
up and around so soon.

639
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,377
Mm.
Mm. Mm.

640
00:28:53,413 --> 00:28:55,112
Are treatments
getting easier?

641
00:28:55,148 --> 00:28:56,647
No, I just had to...

642
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:02,052
My dad's downstairs.

643
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:03,353
How is that possible?

644
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:04,588
I thought
you guys lost touch.

645
00:29:04,624 --> 00:29:06,323
A Calling.

646
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,725
I don't know how or why,

647
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:10,627
but it... it led
your brother and TJ to him.

648
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:11,995
They brought him here.

649
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:13,063
Wow.

650
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:14,598
Yeah.

651
00:29:14,634 --> 00:29:17,735
How...
How was it seeing him?

652
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:21,739
I've carried
so much anger and hurt.

653
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:25,743
But just now
he seemed small.

654
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:27,477
Just a sad old man.

655
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:30,080
Are you gonna
see him again?

656
00:29:30,116 --> 00:29:32,717
We're gonna take a train
out to Chloe's beach.

657
00:29:32,753 --> 00:29:34,451
Give us a chance
to at least talk.

658
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:36,253
Wait. Right now?

659
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:38,455
What... What about
your treatment?

660
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:41,057
I'm done.

661
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:42,325
I'm stopping the treatment.

662
00:29:42,361 --> 00:29:43,994
Uh, what do you mean,
you're done?

663
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,195
If you don't keep going,
then...

664
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:47,264
Michaela.

665
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,735
I've been staying alive,
but I haven't been living.

666
00:29:50,771 --> 00:29:53,069
I don't want to spend
my last days hooked up to tubes,

667
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:55,605
getting my skin scraped off,
trapped inside this place.

668
00:29:55,641 --> 00:29:59,109
I want to spend it with you,
in your arms.

669
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:00,377
Yeah, but I don't understand.

670
00:30:00,413 --> 00:30:01,779
You... You went
and saw your dad,

671
00:30:01,815 --> 00:30:03,547
and now you're just gonna
give up?

672
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:06,049
No, no, it just...

673
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:09,286
gave me some clarity.

674
00:30:09,322 --> 00:30:10,587
Believe me,
the last thing I want to do

675
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:12,055
is cause you pain.

676
00:30:12,091 --> 00:30:13,256
It's why I've been
fighting so hard.

677
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:14,692
We're gonna find you
a cure, Zeke.

678
00:30:14,728 --> 00:30:17,263
And I hope to God
I'm there to take it.

679
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:22,667
But right now, I need to live
every day like it's my last.

680
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,239
Hey. I know.

681
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:29,473
I'm lucky.

682
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:30,741
I've... I've been able

683
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:33,510
to make peace
with everyone I needed to.

684
00:30:33,546 --> 00:30:36,781
I feel closure.

685
00:30:36,817 --> 00:30:38,217
I'm ready.

686
00:30:41,654 --> 00:30:44,421
I just need <i>you</i> to be.

687
00:30:44,457 --> 00:30:46,389
Let me go.

688
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,499
Oh, great.

689
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:13,102
Tim, my badge isn't working.
Can you let me in?

690
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:14,669
I'm sorry, Dr. Bahl,

691
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:15,971
but I'm afraid we have
to ask you to leave.

692
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,772
What?
Is this some kind of drill?

693
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:18,874
Your hospital privileges

694
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,142
have been revoked.

695
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:23,045
That's, uh...

696
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,946
That's not possible.

697
00:31:24,982 --> 00:31:27,116
My research is, uh, in there.
How am I supposed to do my job?

698
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,783
Please, if you'll come
with us...

699
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:30,119
Hey.
Hey, you don't understand.

700
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:31,553
People's lives
are at stake here.

701
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:32,954
Please, Dr. Bahl.

702
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,490
Tim,
who authorized this?

703
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,492
Who authorized this?!

704
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,128
You've been awfully quiet.

705
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:40,629
Are you okay?

706
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,464
Yeah. You sure
this is the right place?

707
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,932
Yeah.

708
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,002
My boy in narcotics says
Jace has been crashing here

709
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:47,936
with a brother.

710
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,738
You hungry?

711
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,074
Got you a pastrami and rye
from that hole-in-the-wall place

712
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,744
we used to love to go to.

713
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,082
What is this?

714
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,251
- A sandwich.
- Thank you.

715
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:06,521
Um,
it's my favorite sandwich.

716
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:09,191
And you've gotten on this case
with me, and...

717
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,696
You asked for help.

718
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,865
Look, J, I...

719
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:20,236
I'm beyond grateful
for the risks

720
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,975
that you took to protect me
and for saving Zeke's life.

721
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:29,711
But I'm with him now, and...

722
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:30,848
I love him.

723
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,152
Mick,
you're way off base here.

724
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:37,519
<i>Am</i> I?

725
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,689
I know you're with Zeke.

726
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,693
And I'm happy for you.

727
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:47,929
Maybe that's an overstatement,
but I've accepted it.

728
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:49,165
And, yeah, you're right.

729
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:50,765
I did want to work this case
with you,

730
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:54,303
but not 'cause I want
to get back with you.

731
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:58,174
It's 'cause I miss
having you in my life.

732
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:02,610
I can handle
not being with you anymore.

733
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:06,715
I can't handle
not having you as a friend.

734
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,550
Me too.

735
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,052
I mean, who knows?

736
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,125
Maybe after all this,
Zeke and I will be friends.

737
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,926
What?

738
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,328
He hates me, doesn't he?

739
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,263
Of course he does.

740
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,933
No.

741
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:29,938
It's just that he might not
be around for much longer.

742
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,773
What do you mean?

743
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,642
He's not being treated
for burns, Jared.

744
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:36,811
He's dying.

745
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:38,347
Being back has a cost,

746
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:42,051
and, uh, however long
we were gone is...

747
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:44,822
That's how long
we have left to live.

748
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:48,124
Wait, you have this, too?

749
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,092
Yeah.

750
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,793
The Callings
made that pretty clear.

751
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,362
How... How can you
even be sure that...

752
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,031
We are, Jared.
It happened to Griffin.

753
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:56,698
It's happening to Zeke.

754
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,100
How is this
even possible, Mick?

755
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,069
How is <i>any</i> of this
possible, Jared?!

756
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:02,104
How is it possible that...

757
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,641
...Zeke's telling me
to let him go?

758
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,843
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
So the Calling was about Zeke?

759
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,612
I don't know.
I don't... I don't...

760
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,981
I don't know. I'm...

761
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,151
more confused
than I've ever been.

762
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:17,253
I'm just...

763
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:20,356
praying that we m-make this
meth-ring bust

764
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,224
so that I know that that's
what the Callings meant.

765
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,360
Mick, I...

766
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,628
Hey. Hold on. Look.

767
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,067
- That's the bus driver.
- He's the courier.

768
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:32,870
He's making a drop
is my guess.

769
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,772
1-29. 85 in progress
at 272 Barnell.

770
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:39,008
Requesting backup.

771
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:41,410
We got to get in there
before he bails.

772
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,988
Gas company!
You have a leak!

773
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,895
Clear!

774
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:10,272
Police! Don't move!

775
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,749
Police! Hands where I can
see them! Down on the ground!

776
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,485
Down on the ground!
Get over.

777
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,354
Over here right now! Pole.

778
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,956
You don't want to do this.

779
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:04,193
Jace, shut up. Yeah,
I know exactly who you are.

780
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:06,462
In fact, I came especially
to see you.

781
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:10,366
Ah. Well, now we've been
introduced, you best walk away.

782
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,767
<i>Let him go.</i>

783
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:15,404
You know there'll be hell to
pay, don't you, pretty lady?

784
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,339
The pain I'll bring
down on you,

785
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,308
a holy vengeance like nothing
you've ever seen before.

786
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,211
Shut up. You threatening me is only
gonna make it worse for you, okay?

787
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,778
This is bigger
than both of us.

788
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,481
<i>Let him go.</i>

789
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,517
<i>Let him go! Let him go!</i>

790
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,286
No!

791
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:32,121
Jace Baylor, you are
under arrest for possession

792
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:33,821
of an illegal substance
with intent to sell.

793
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:35,324
You have the right
to remain silent.

794
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,992
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

795
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,730
in a court of law. Do you
understand these rights?

796
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:47,236
Scoop of chocolate
on the bottom,

797
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:50,172
mint on top, with...

798
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,075
sprinkles.

799
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,348
I mean, I know a nursing mother
needs her calcium.

800
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,017
But sprinkles?
What is the occasion?

801
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,786
Second chances.

802
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,189
You know, today reminded me
that I haven't...

803
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,958
exactly been making
the most of mine.

804
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,394
So, starting now...

805
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,966
watch out.

806
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,901
Well, I like the sound of that.

807
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,836
But what have you done
with my husband?

808
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,208
I've just been trying so hard
to make sense of everything,

809
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,909
and I've gotten nowhere.

810
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,379
Meanwhile,
the Callings keep...

811
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,947
keep doing
these amazing things.

812
00:37:32,983 --> 00:37:35,487
Yeah, they do.
So now what?

813
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:40,089
Do what the Callings have
wanted us to do all along...

814
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:42,057
just listen.

815
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,392
Follow and listen.

816
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,860
That's where we're gonna
find our answers.

817
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,932
So...

818
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,934
does that mean no more
late nights in the garage?

819
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,570
Yeah, I better lock it up

820
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,938
before my skeptical mind
rebels.

821
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,477
We're gonna
get you back, then.

822
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,045
Are you kidding?

823
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:04,513
Come on.

824
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:09,151
I am not missing another
milestone with my kids.

825
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:11,320
- Hi!
- Hi!

826
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:12,554
Hi!

827
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:16,261
Hey, baby girl.

828
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:20,362
There's your smile.

829
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,132
That's my girl.

830
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:25,067
Hey.

831
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:36,211
So, uh, this thing
Zeke has...

832
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,580
a-and you.

833
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:39,981
There's no cure?

834
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,883
Not for lack of trying.

835
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,888
Something else wrong?

836
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,595
At the bust, I got a Calling
that told me to "let him go."

837
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:53,961
And I didn't.

838
00:38:53,997 --> 00:38:55,897
Why would it ask you
something like that?

839
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,166
Who knows.

840
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,900
Maybe it's talking
about Zeke again.

841
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,603
But I'm gonna lose my mind.

842
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,472
Please don't.
That'd be terrible timing

843
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,307
now that we're
finally friends again.

844
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,345
So what happens now?

845
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:12,314
I don't know.

846
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,384
I've never defied
a Calling before.

847
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,319
I think you made
the right choice.

848
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,504
Hey.

849
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,139
I wasn't expecting
you'd be home yet.

850
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,177
Mm-hmm.

851
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:42,010
Ooh. You're freezing.

852
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,681
It was cold at the beach.

853
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,281
How'd it go
with your dad?

854
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:49,418
It was tough,
but we muddled through.

855
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:53,655
I don't know... I don't know
what... what comes of it, but...

856
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:56,428
maybe now neither of us
will die with regrets.

857
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,531
Mick, the puppy-dog eyes
are not changing my mind.

858
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,269
I know.

859
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:09,571
But I don't have to agree
with you or the Callings

860
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:10,972
or any of it.

861
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,545
I didn't expect you to.

862
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:20,249
Pretty much my entire life has
been about regret and sadness.

863
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:23,585
But I don't want
to end it like that.

864
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:26,688
I want to go out
on my terms...

865
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,091
with the love of my life,

866
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:31,660
making one more memory
I can take with me.

867
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:38,434
What are you doing?

868
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,440
Will you marry me,
Michaela?

869
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,511
Yes. Yes, I will.

870
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,721
I love you so much.

871
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,760
I love you, too.

872
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,295
There we go.

873
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,464
Did Zeke and his dad
make up yet?

874
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,332
They're working on it.

875
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:12,201
And how about you, bud?

876
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:14,536
Have you seen any of those
scary shadows lately?

877
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,773
No. Why do you think?

878
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,609
I don't know.

879
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,811
But I bet we're gonna
figure it out.

880
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:26,448
As your wise grandma
always said...

881
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,687
all things work together
for good.

882
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,555
Sleep tight.

883
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:40,365
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

884
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:49,638

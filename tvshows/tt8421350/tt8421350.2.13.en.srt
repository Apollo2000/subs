1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,623
Previously on "Manifest"...

2
00:00:01,625 --> 00:00:03,555
Zeke, I will never give up on you

3
00:00:03,557 --> 00:00:05,457
for as long as we both shall live.

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:08,059
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

5
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:11,429
- Police!
- Don't move!

6
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:13,865
We found over $1 million worth of meth

7
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:15,400
- in your place, Jace.
- I'm just thinking about

8
00:00:15,402 --> 00:00:17,936
the best way to hurt you the most.

9
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:19,938
The Major... she had me fired,

10
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,473
and I need to know
why she's after me now.

11
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:24,209
The Major found a breakthrough
with your research.

12
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:26,044
I think it's time for me
to make you disappear.

13
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:27,746
I am not hiding from her.

14
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:29,881
I am coming after her.

15
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,323
Auntie Mick! Help!

16
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:39,791
You have two choices...

17
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:42,260
you get us back our stash
or you bury your nephew!

18
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:43,461
Don't you dare touch him!

19
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:44,929
I warned you.

20
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:46,397
Now you're gonna pay.

21
00:00:50,103 --> 00:00:51,703
- Where is my son?
- I don't know,

22
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:53,338
- but we will get him back, Grace.
- But why take Cal?

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,140
What does he have to do with anything?

24
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:57,909
I think they're getting back at me.

25
00:00:57,911 --> 00:01:00,078
- What does that even mean?
- I arrested these dealers.

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,668
They want their meth back.
But it's more than that.

27
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,048
The main guy... he was taunting me.

28
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,083
It's like he knew that I had
this Calling to let him go.

29
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:06,818
- Why didn't you?!
- I don't know, okay?

30
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,919
I screwed up.

31
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:09,788
- But I will fix this.
- How?

32
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,956
I'm gonna give them what they want.

33
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,924
I'll get the meth back from
the evidence locker room

34
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:14,159
by 8:00 a.m. They will call...

35
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:16,461
8:00?! How are you gonna do that?

36
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:18,129
- What did the precinct say?
- I haven't...

37
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:19,697
I haven't called them.

38
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:21,666
- Are you kidding me?
- There isn't enough time,

39
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:24,335
and if I bring in any more cops,
they said they will kill Cal.

40
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:26,838
Oh, my God.

41
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,541
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

42
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:31,776
Grace, I swear to you, I will fix this.

43
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:33,511
Do not...

44
00:01:33,513 --> 00:01:36,681
Do not swear anything to
me, 'cause you don't know.

45
00:01:39,486 --> 00:01:41,186
The Calling... the plane exploding...

46
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:42,320
it was about Cal.

47
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:43,521
None of that matters.

48
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:46,858
Michaela, get me my son back.

49
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:52,530
You should be with your family.

50
00:01:52,532 --> 00:01:53,665
I'm okay.

51
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,533
You're not okay.

52
00:01:56,636 --> 00:01:58,736
Your death date is tomorrow,

53
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:02,173
and all of this stuff is just...

54
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:05,376
Hey. They're gonna find him.

55
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:09,848
I got to go to the precinct.

56
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,250
Be here when I get back, okay?

57
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:14,052
I promise.

58
00:02:46,453 --> 00:02:48,253
She goes to a midtown office building

59
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:49,854
every morning for a few hours.

60
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:51,589
Then she takes a ferry downtown,

61
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:53,625
spends the afternoon
in a windowless building

62
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:55,293
at Church and Thomas.

63
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:57,862
This is all within the last two weeks.

64
00:02:57,864 --> 00:03:00,064
It's only a matter of
time before we identify

65
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:03,201
one of her scientists and
find out what she's learned.

66
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:04,302
Time is something we don't have.

67
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:06,104
We have to do something now.

68
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:07,939
You said you wanted to see
her for yourself, right?

69
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:09,741
Well, there she is.

70
00:03:09,743 --> 00:03:11,976
But moving on the Major is no simple op.

71
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:13,912
We go too fast, it's more
than just your friend

72
00:03:13,914 --> 00:03:15,713
who's gonna end up dead.

73
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:16,948
Okay. So, now what?

74
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,549
My guys and I are gonna stay on her.

75
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:21,452
You need to sit tight
and hope for a miracle.

76
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:25,657
I prefer science over miracles.

77
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:27,392
I don't think that's an
option we have right now.

78
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:28,626
Come on.

79
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:34,666
That's a lot of meth. You
sure you need the whole thing?

80
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:37,135
Yeah. I sent in a
tainted sample to the lab.

81
00:03:37,137 --> 00:03:38,670
Now they got to retest the whole batch,

82
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:40,838
and, you know, Captain's pissed.

83
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,807
I need your signature.

84
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:49,580
What are you trying to pull?

85
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:51,849
System says Jared
Vasquez, lead detective.

86
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:53,851
You're on leave.

87
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:55,286
Does it look like I'm on leave?

88
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:00,491
Detective Vasquez, please.

89
00:04:11,838 --> 00:04:14,806
You know anything about a
methamphetamine lab test?

90
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:16,174
Stone's not authorized.

91
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:18,343
Says here she left to get married.

92
00:04:21,013 --> 00:04:23,014
What, and this is her honeymoon?

93
00:04:24,616 --> 00:04:26,017
I need an authorized signature

94
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:27,952
before I can release any evidence.

95
00:04:44,537 --> 00:04:46,671
Thank you.

96
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:50,675
Sorry. It was not
supposed to go that way.

97
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:52,410
Yeah, I didn't think it
was. What are we up to?

98
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:54,078
No, don't worry about it.
Just go back to your desk.

99
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,376
Don't get involved.

100
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,249
Mick, I just signed out an industrial-size
box of methamphetamine.

101
00:04:58,251 --> 00:04:59,884
I'd say I'm involved.

102
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:02,387
Hey. Hey.

103
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:03,755
What are you up to?

104
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:07,492
- Cal's been kidnapped.
- What?

105
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:09,360
I'm trading the meth to get him back.

106
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:10,862
You don't know that, okay?

107
00:05:10,864 --> 00:05:13,037
- Hey, wait.
- Jared, you know as well as I do

108
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,333
that the only way to get him home safe

109
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:16,034
is to pay the ransom.

110
00:05:16,036 --> 00:05:17,368
This is it.

111
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:22,607
Let's get him home.

112
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:33,051
Ellen.

113
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:37,955
Or is it Katherine?

114
00:05:37,957 --> 00:05:41,025
Major General Katherine Fitz?

115
00:05:41,027 --> 00:05:43,628
Saanvi.

116
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,731
To what do I owe this surprise?

117
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:48,132
You have something I want.

118
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:01,583
Do you have our product?

119
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:03,385
Yeah. Let me talk to Cal.

120
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm assuming you weren't stupid enough

121
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:07,389
to tell any of your
friends at the department.

122
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:09,925
No. Let me talk to Cal. I
need to make sure he's okay.

123
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:15,664
Remember when I promised
you hellfire and fury?

124
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,399
Jace, please don't...

125
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:19,301
Please don't hurt him.

126
00:06:19,303 --> 00:06:22,337
If I don't get back what's
mine, I'm not gonna hurt him.

127
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:23,838
I'm gonna kill him.

128
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:29,477
And what exactly is it you want?

129
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:30,912
You've had a breakthrough.

130
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:32,347
It's why you pulled my medical license,

131
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:34,115
had me shut down.

132
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:37,519
Sounds like you've gotten some
help from beyond the grave.

133
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:39,754
So Vance lived.

134
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:42,023
Surprise, surprise.

135
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:44,926
He has eyes on us right now.

136
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:46,695
Still not much of a liar.

137
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,738
No, he doesn't.

138
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,798
You're freelancing.

139
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,033
People are gonna die.

140
00:06:52,035 --> 00:06:54,336
I need to find a cure.
You stole my work?

141
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:56,338
Your country thanks you
for your contribution

142
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,539
to its defense.

143
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:02,444
What if I have more to offer?

144
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:05,280
If you tell me how to get
rid of the genetic mutation,

145
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:07,215
I can give you a
complete medical profile

146
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:09,150
on a man with an identical mutation

147
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:10,518
who wasn't on Flight 828.

148
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,554
You mean Zeke Landon?

149
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:17,792
You don't think I have you
and the Stone family monitored?

150
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:21,029
It was a beautiful wedding, by the way.

151
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:22,130
You're right.

152
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:24,733
Zeke Landon was crucial.

153
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,635
Without his exonic sequences,

154
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:29,004
I never would have found
what I was looking for.

155
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:32,507
Unfortunately for you,
that means that you have...

156
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:33,908
nothing to offer.

157
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,312
I have more than enough
proof to go public.

158
00:07:37,314 --> 00:07:39,014
Careful, Saanvi.

159
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:42,550
Those are the kinds of
threats that get people killed.

160
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:45,920
You really think you're
ready to play at that level?

161
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:51,259
Ohh.

162
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:53,161
This is my stop.

163
00:07:53,163 --> 00:07:55,096
It was nice to see you.

164
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:09,711
I need you to get me a lab.

165
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:12,047
So, we're supposed to
leave a duffel bag of meth

166
00:08:12,049 --> 00:08:14,249
under a bench and, what...

167
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:16,384
- hope for the best?
- They'll show us Cal's okay,

168
00:08:16,386 --> 00:08:17,886
and once they confirm what they've got,

169
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:19,754
- they'll release him.
- And what if they don't?

170
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:21,222
What if they just
take the drugs and run?

171
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:23,191
They don't want Cal.

172
00:08:23,193 --> 00:08:25,193
Are you actually on board with this?

173
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:29,698
Okay, look, no cop's
ever supposed to say this

174
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,766
to a family of a hostage.

175
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:33,268
As dangerous as this is,

176
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,237
involving the NYPD
can make matters worse.

177
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,707
They're trying to make an arrest.

178
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:39,974
Things can go sideways.

179
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:43,611
Well, we don't want to risk that.

180
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:45,480
- No, we don't.
- Exactly.

181
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:47,882
Look, all that matters here
is that we get Cal back safely.

182
00:08:47,884 --> 00:08:51,619
So, with that being said,
Mick's plan is the way to go.

183
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:53,488
It's what I would do if it was my son.

184
00:08:55,324 --> 00:08:58,126
Jared will be there out of
sight if anything does go wrong.

185
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:04,265
Hey. It's just me.

186
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:06,234
I came in the back in
case anyone's watching.

187
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:08,096
I thought maybe you guys
could use this comms gear

188
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:09,437
I borrowed from ESU.

189
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:10,572
Y-You told her?

190
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:12,407
She's your partner.

191
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:14,442
So much for no cops.

192
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:17,679
Hey. Today we're family.

193
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:19,614
Okay. What happens next?

194
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:23,485
They want to make the
exchange outside the Intrepid.

195
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:29,691
I'll take the meth to the
plaza near the main entrance.

196
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:34,696
Ben will be at the overpass,
waiting for them to show up.

197
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:37,699
Once they do, I'll put
the bag under the bench.

198
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:40,268
They'll recognize Drea
and me, so we'll stay out of sight...

199
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,803
make sure everything goes off okay.

200
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:52,847
Where the hell are they?

201
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:53,882
Ben, they'll be here.

202
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,483
I got eyes on you both.

203
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:03,858
Okay. Here we go.

204
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,161
Two guys, far side of
the bridge, with Cal.

205
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:10,465
I see him.

206
00:10:17,073 --> 00:10:18,506
He's okay.

207
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,982
Yeah. I got eyes on her.

208
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:32,420
I've made contact.

209
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:34,355
Good, Mick. Nice and easy, alright?

210
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:36,191
Go on. Head out.

211
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:44,566
Excuse me! Young lady!

212
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:47,402
Excuse me! You left your bag!

213
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:49,070
Uh...

214
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:51,406
Thank you.

215
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:54,375
Look, I'm a cop, okay? I
need you to just walk away.

216
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:58,513
Really? I can get one of those
for 10 bucks down on Canal.

217
00:10:58,515 --> 00:11:01,216
Excuse me! Officer!

218
00:11:01,218 --> 00:11:02,517
Mick, what's going on?

219
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,551
Good Samaritan.

220
00:11:03,553 --> 00:11:05,220
Damn it, lady.

221
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:06,955
This lady's saying she's a cop.

222
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,590
She left a bag under the bench.

223
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:10,225
Alright, thanks.

224
00:11:10,227 --> 00:11:12,927
I did that on purpose.
I can explain, okay?

225
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:15,559
Lady, cop or not, you can't
just leave your bag unattended.

226
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:17,528
I am a detective at the 129th.

227
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,769
This is taking too
long. I got to get Cal!

228
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:24,618
Ben, Mick's taking
care of it. Hang in tight.

229
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,541
You're about to blow an
undercover operation right now.

230
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:28,042
I'll see what my sergeant says.

231
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:29,410
We're being played.

232
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:33,581
Cal!

233
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,416
We got to head down there.

234
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:38,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

235
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:40,121
- Hey!
- Cal!

236
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:41,155
What the hell?!

237
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:42,957
- Cal!
- Hey! Watch it!

238
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:47,228
Cal!!

239
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,163
Cal!

240
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,882
Somebody want to explain to
me how a duffel bag of meth

241
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,617
that's supposed to be
in the evidence locker

242
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,419
was a part of a failed
hostage exchange?!

243
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,854
- Captain...
- I've got Midtown North making noise

244
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,923
that we didn't give them a
heads-up on an undercover op,

245
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,291
and the chief wants to know what's up

246
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,126
with our evidentiary chain of custody!

247
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,430
- They took my nephew.
- And you should have come to me.

248
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,933
Haven't I convinced you of that,
after all we've been through?

249
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,068
Cap, she couldn't. There was a
ticking clock on the exchange.

250
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,937
And we have procedures, damn it!

251
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,472
And as long as you
work in this precinct,

252
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,907
you will follow them!

253
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:26,277
If you think that I give a damn

254
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,078
about anything other
than saving my nephew...

255
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,246
You're quitting the force?

256
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,281
Yeah, if I have to.

257
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,949
I'm bringing Cal back.

258
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:34,385
Stone.

259
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,822
Resignation not accepted.

260
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,458
From here on out...

261
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,060
we do things my way.

262
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,064
I told you it was stupid to
do it in public like that!

263
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,389
This is on you!

264
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:50,100
You're the one who
wanted to take a hostage.

265
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,125
Now we're stuck with him.

266
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:52,382
And how the hell else are we supposed

267
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:53,838
to get back our supply, huh?!

268
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,906
This isn't about the
supply, and you know it.

269
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,675
You just wanted revenge.

270
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,577
We should just ditch the
kid and head for Canada.

271
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,512
The kid's the only leverage we have!

272
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:08,085
Hey.

273
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:11,188
You must be cold, huh?

274
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,024
It's... It's okay. I'm...

275
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,627
I-I'm not gonna hurt you.

276
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,797
I know you're not, but...

277
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,132
he wants to kill me.

278
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:27,104
Uh, no. He...

279
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:31,809
My... My brother's just... angry.

280
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,445
I'm not scared, but...

281
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,280
my sister must be.

282
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:40,184
You... You have a sister?

283
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,886
Two, actually.

284
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:45,689
Eden's just a baby, and Olive's my twin.

285
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,858
She worries about me.

286
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,461
I just wish I could send her a message,

287
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,663
just to say everything's alright.

288
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,044
He was wearing jeans

289
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,914
and a red bubble coat... bright red.

290
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,815
This is a disaster.

291
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:29,333
Ben, I'm...

292
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,402
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:39,610
What more do you want from
me? I'm already dying inside.

294
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:45,716
We're supposed to follow the Callings.

295
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,118
That's...

296
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,188
That's all you had to do.

297
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,756
Then these bastards would have died

298
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,358
in that meth-lab explosion,
like they were supposed to,

299
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,441
- and Cal would be home safe.
- Yeah, maybe he would,

300
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:58,500
- but now we have to...
- No, not maybe.

301
00:14:58,502 --> 00:15:00,969
I told you all other
paths lead to disaster.

302
00:15:00,971 --> 00:15:04,239
You... You didn't listen.

303
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:08,276
Listen to what, Ben... let him go?

304
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:11,346
I am sick to my stomach,
but it didn't make sense.

305
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:12,914
You didn't want it to make sense!

306
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,684
How could I, Ben?!
That is a voice in my head,

307
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:17,752
telling me to let Zeke die

308
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:20,188
or to let three scumbag drug dealers go.

309
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,990
That's not a voice I want to listen to.

310
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:23,525
We don't have a choice!

311
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:29,865
If we have zero control over what we do,

312
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:32,367
then what was the point of us
coming back in the first place?

313
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:37,472
This.

314
00:15:37,474 --> 00:15:38,630
This.

315
00:15:38,632 --> 00:15:39,654
This.

316
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:40,978
This, this.

317
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,713
This, this, this is the point!

318
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:47,182
All of this was dumped in my
lap and yours. We were chosen.

319
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:48,808
I don't know how, I don't know why,

320
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,019
but I do know the only way
for any of us to survive

321
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:52,687
is to do what the Callings want,

322
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:56,458
and I am scared to death
because you didn't...

323
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,536
that it's too late.

324
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:58,660
But we almost got him.

325
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:00,495
But we didn't!

326
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:20,749
What is this place?

327
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:23,018
Somewhere that doesn't exist.

328
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,487
I also got into your lab at the hospital

329
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:28,256
and gathered up what research I could.

330
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:31,159
Just because I'm dead doesn't
mean I don't have connections.

331
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,661
- Thank you. That's...
- What were you thinking,

332
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:33,958
going to see the Major on your own?

333
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,263
I told you to hang back.

334
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:36,831
You went and announced we were watching?

335
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,568
I'm sorry. I don't have
time to play the long game.

336
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,570
She knows you're alive, by the way.

337
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,706
Well, that's terrific.

338
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,409
Saanvi, now is not the time to go rogue!

339
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:50,178
Look, Zeke is gonna die
if I don't find a cure.

340
00:16:51,714 --> 00:16:54,716
What did she say that made
you think you need a lab?

341
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:57,352
That Zeke's exons were
where she made the discovery.

342
00:16:57,354 --> 00:16:58,753
I need to run an analysis to see

343
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:00,522
if I can find a stable solution.

344
00:17:00,524 --> 00:17:02,357
I just need to load Zeke's sequence data

345
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,558
into the simulator.

346
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:07,529
What?

347
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:09,898
It's gonna take longer than I thought.

348
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
Well, look at the bright side.

349
00:17:11,902 --> 00:17:13,368
You may have a cure in a week.

350
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,871
That's six days too late to save Zeke.

351
00:17:41,131 --> 00:17:42,464
Zeke. Zeke.

352
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:45,900
I saw him... Cal.

353
00:17:45,902 --> 00:17:47,002
Where is he?

354
00:17:47,004 --> 00:17:48,903
Somewhere in the wilderness...

355
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:50,639
where I die.

356
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:52,073
Zeke, you are not dying, okay?

357
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:54,242
No one is dying today.

358
00:17:55,578 --> 00:17:56,978
Here you go.

359
00:17:58,414 --> 00:17:59,514
Thanks.

360
00:18:02,985 --> 00:18:04,986
_

361
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:06,488
What is it?

362
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,456
I think it's from Cal.

363
00:18:10,526 --> 00:18:11,693
Who's Doug?

364
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:15,463
Oh, my God.

365
00:18:15,465 --> 00:18:17,699
Oh, my God. I think I know where Cal is.

366
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:26,350
"It's OK. I'm not scared.

367
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:27,852
Tell Mom and Doug I love them".

368
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:29,220
Mom and Doug?

369
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:30,755
Doug, as in the Dugout,

370
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:33,505
that sketchy diner with
the happy-face pancakes.

371
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:35,560
In the Catskills, from years ago?

372
00:18:35,562 --> 00:18:36,894
- By the ski mountain.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

373
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:39,058
Cal and I were obsessed over that place,

374
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,060
so we named it "Doug".

375
00:18:41,062 --> 00:18:43,262
We used to joke about
who loves Doug the most.

376
00:18:43,264 --> 00:18:45,264
The Dugout, outside Liberty.

377
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:50,102
That photo... zoom in.

378
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:55,875
Those power lines... I
saw them in my Calling.

379
00:18:55,877 --> 00:18:58,411
Same configuration, same kind of tower.

380
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:00,379
That's got to be where he
is. We got to get up there.

381
00:19:00,381 --> 00:19:01,614
No. We got to tell the cops.

382
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:02,838
Ben, if we involve the state police,

383
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,730
they're gonna bring in
a TAC team, helicopter...

384
00:19:04,732 --> 00:19:06,621
- Again with this?
- Mick, we tried it your way.

385
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,575
It didn't work. It still can.

386
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:11,044
I saw Cal. He's there.

387
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:15,482
You don't have to trust
me, but trust the Callings.

388
00:19:15,484 --> 00:19:17,750
Hey. So, the text was sent from an app.

389
00:19:17,752 --> 00:19:19,252
Tech can't trace it.

390
00:19:22,723 --> 00:19:23,923
What?

391
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:28,928
Guys, I'm on your team.

392
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:32,899
Alright.

393
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:34,467
We need you to run interference.

394
00:19:36,671 --> 00:19:38,671
They need you in the kitchen.

395
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:45,191
Thanks.

396
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:46,259
Thanks.

397
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:49,529
Hey.

398
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:50,964
The only way we're gonna save Cal

399
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:52,565
is if we do this together.

400
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:53,934
That's how we got this far,

401
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:55,576
and that's how we're
gonna bring him home.

402
00:19:58,835 --> 00:20:00,102
Hey. What's going on?

403
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:02,237
- I'm coming, too.
- No, Zeke.

404
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:04,339
If your body temperature
drops too low, you will die.

405
00:20:04,341 --> 00:20:05,841
I told him. He won't listen.

406
00:20:05,843 --> 00:20:06,942
Saanvi's still working on a cure.

407
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:08,577
She needs you here, close by.

408
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:10,212
No. I got the Calling.

409
00:20:10,214 --> 00:20:11,780
I'm supposed to help.

410
00:20:11,782 --> 00:20:13,682
If today's the day I die,

411
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:16,084
I'm not going to my grave
knowing Cal was in trouble

412
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:18,019
but I just stayed home,
trying to save myself.

413
00:20:23,693 --> 00:20:24,760
Come on.

414
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:29,097
Jared.

415
00:20:30,836 --> 00:20:33,337
When I'm gone...

416
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:35,506
I'm glad you'll be here...

417
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:36,841
for her.

418
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,352
Stay warm, okay?

419
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:54,031
And we continue
to track the ongoing manhunt

420
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:57,234
for three escaped suspects in
a narcotics-trafficking ring

421
00:20:57,236 --> 00:20:59,002
now believed to have abducted a boy

422
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:02,373
from his family's residence
in Hollis Hills, Queens.

423
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,974
The search for Cal Stone,

424
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:07,211
one of Montego Air 828's
returned passengers,

425
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:08,612
has expanded statewide,

426
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:10,614
and an Amber Alert has been issued.

427
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:12,216
We're screwed!

428
00:21:12,218 --> 00:21:14,385
A-A-An Amber Alert?

429
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:16,286
That means every single
person with a phone

430
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:17,721
is gonna be looking for us.

431
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:18,956
People swipe those away to get back

432
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,754
to their porn and their Snapchat.

433
00:21:20,756 --> 00:21:23,580
But statewide means we'll never
be able to cross the border.

434
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,649
- Real good plan!
- Shut up.

435
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:29,032
Where the hell did
this kid get a blanket?

436
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:30,931
I-I-I thought he might be cold.

437
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:32,522
You don't get to think.

438
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:33,713
Hey!

439
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:40,118
Don't make me use this.

440
00:21:42,354 --> 00:21:44,822
Now is not the time to go soft.

441
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:09,811
No one in the diner has seen Cal.

442
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:11,346
They probably just drove by.

443
00:22:13,216 --> 00:22:14,839
Do you see the power lines up ahead?

444
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:17,175
Yeah. They jut up into the woods,

445
00:22:17,177 --> 00:22:20,034
and they splinter off in
two different directions.

446
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:21,389
Kidnappers are gonna be looking

447
00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:23,024
for a secluded place to hide out.

448
00:22:23,026 --> 00:22:24,726
They're gonna want to stay
away from the ski areas

449
00:22:24,728 --> 00:22:26,495
and probably stick to
something with less traffic.

450
00:22:26,497 --> 00:22:28,597
All the skiing is to the left.

451
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,066
I-It has to be on the right.

452
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:32,167
Okay.

453
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:37,839
Afternoon, everybody.

454
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:39,107
Any updates?

455
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,709
Nothing yet, Captain.

456
00:22:45,939 --> 00:22:47,629
Oh, hey, Captain.
Can I get you something?

457
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:49,820
No, you can't get me something.
Where are Stone and Vasquez?

458
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:51,462
Vasquez is in here.
I can get him for you.

459
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:57,058
What's happening in here?

460
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,260
Where are the others?

461
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,021
Vasquez?

462
00:23:02,023 --> 00:23:04,079
Mikami?

463
00:23:04,081 --> 00:23:06,071
One of you is gonna open
your mouth this second,

464
00:23:06,073 --> 00:23:07,428
or someone is getting suspended.

465
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,030
They're heading upstate.

466
00:23:11,883 --> 00:23:14,785
It's where we think Cal is being held.

467
00:23:16,755 --> 00:23:18,455
I'm calling state patrol.

468
00:23:18,457 --> 00:23:20,424
Hopefully, they can create a perimeter

469
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:21,792
before it's too late.

470
00:23:21,794 --> 00:23:24,294
W... Uh, t-too late to what, e-exactly?

471
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:26,497
Intercept the kidnappers,
overwhelm them,

472
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:27,554
negotiate with them.

473
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:29,679
We have established procedures, tactics.

474
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:32,505
Can you just hold on...
just stop for one second?

475
00:23:32,507 --> 00:23:34,630
These tactics sound
like the kind of thing

476
00:23:34,632 --> 00:23:36,555
that could endanger a hostage.

477
00:23:36,557 --> 00:23:39,725
We're professionals, ma'am.
You need to let us do our job.

478
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,326
Captain, with all due
respect, this is my son.

479
00:23:45,328 --> 00:23:48,752
If you do anything to jeopardize
him coming home to me safely,

480
00:23:48,754 --> 00:23:51,678
I swear to God, you'll wish
you didn't wake up this morning.

481
00:23:58,016 --> 00:23:59,382
Don't look at me.

482
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:06,590
Michaela thinks she can save him.

483
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:08,425
I trust her.

484
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:19,369
You're lucky I'm a mother.

485
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:21,972
I can keep them offline for now.

486
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:25,142
You two start up there and
get local PD on standby.

487
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:43,434
Didn't Olive say there
were cabins off this road?

488
00:24:43,436 --> 00:24:44,635
I don't have any signal.

489
00:24:44,637 --> 00:24:46,604
Did we miss a turn-off somewhere?

490
00:24:46,606 --> 00:24:47,671
Keep driving.

491
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:49,139
It's a dead end.

492
00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:54,879
Do you know where we're going?

493
00:24:54,881 --> 00:24:56,714
Farther.

494
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:05,493
Mick, look... trailhead.

495
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:09,296
Looks like we're on foot from here.

496
00:25:11,234 --> 00:25:12,545
I'm coming.

497
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:14,669
No, Zeke. It's below freezing out there.

498
00:25:16,505 --> 00:25:18,239
You won't make it.

499
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:25,112
Can you give us a sec?

500
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:37,692
It's warm in here, okay?

501
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:46,357
Can you hold on till I get back?

502
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,658
In case I don't...

503
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,026
You're not gonna die.

504
00:25:49,028 --> 00:25:51,762
Michaela... it's okay.

505
00:25:51,764 --> 00:25:53,664
This isn't how it's supposed to happen.

506
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:54,932
This is wrong.

507
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:59,470
I got everything I ever wanted in life.

508
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:04,041
And more than I deserved.

509
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:34,232
I got to get Cal.

510
00:26:34,234 --> 00:26:35,433
I know.

511
00:26:37,151 --> 00:26:40,843
When you do, tell him I loved him.

512
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,622
Again? Really?

513
00:27:12,557 --> 00:27:14,357
No. We're not done.

514
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:16,826
Little girl, it's time
you open your eyes

515
00:27:16,828 --> 00:27:18,895
to how things work in the real world.

516
00:27:18,897 --> 00:27:22,098
My job is to protect this country.

517
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,366
You are...

518
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:26,536
an insect on the bottom of my shoe.

519
00:27:26,538 --> 00:27:28,713
I already said I had zero interest

520
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:30,040
in helping you save your...

521
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:35,812
... your friend.

522
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:38,315
Why would my response be
any different now that...

523
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:42,486
Are you having trouble breathing?

524
00:27:42,488 --> 00:27:43,887
It's early stage anaphylaxis.

525
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,423
Not so early.

526
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,161
You have 90 seconds to
tell me how to save Zeke,

527
00:27:51,163 --> 00:27:53,930
or it will be too late to save yourself.

528
00:27:53,932 --> 00:27:56,900
Now Zeke isn't the only one
who has an expiration date.

529
00:27:56,902 --> 00:27:57,968
You have one.

530
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,936
Fine. Give me the shot.

531
00:27:59,938 --> 00:28:01,238
Tell me how to save Zeke.

532
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,840
You're not a killer, Saanvi.

533
00:28:03,842 --> 00:28:05,909
I need the cure.

534
00:28:05,911 --> 00:28:08,111
This is not who you are!

535
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,617
Or maybe it is.

536
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:20,076
Tell me how to save Zeke.
How do I save the passengers?

537
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:21,567
There is no cure.

538
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:25,484
What's the point of a powerful mutation

539
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:30,283
if you can't replicate and weaponize it?

540
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:32,052
You were gonna infect people?

541
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:33,319
Help me.

542
00:28:35,557 --> 00:28:37,957
It's too...

543
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:40,293
It's too late.

544
00:28:40,295 --> 00:28:42,729
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

545
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:45,165
I'm sorry. This isn't what I wanted.

546
00:29:05,738 --> 00:29:06,860
Zeke!

547
00:29:47,735 --> 00:29:50,070
I mean, how far have we gone?

548
00:29:50,072 --> 00:29:52,839
I can't even see if we're still
on course with the power lines.

549
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:54,574
I think we are.

550
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:06,853
Lights out.

551
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:08,822
Son of a...

552
00:30:08,824 --> 00:30:10,357
What the hell?

553
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,025
Someone's coming.

554
00:30:15,831 --> 00:30:17,145
Out the back... now.

555
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:19,437
What about the kid? What about the kid?

556
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:21,296
Slit his throat.

557
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:23,554
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Nobody's slitting anything.

558
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:25,012
You don't call the shots!

559
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:26,403
I didn't sign up for murder one!

560
00:30:26,405 --> 00:30:28,451
We take him or we leave him!

561
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,209
We take him and he slows us down!

562
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:32,779
We leave him and he tells
the cops what we're driving!

563
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,605
Have you lost your mind?!

564
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:54,930
He's just a kid!

565
00:30:54,932 --> 00:30:56,054
- So what?
- Go.

566
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,178
We're all in this together,

567
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,703
so either you're in or you're out.

568
00:30:58,705 --> 00:31:00,073
- Which is it?
- I'm out!

569
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:02,142
You're out of control.

570
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,312
I'm done arguing!

571
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:07,414
Cut that little...

572
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:08,983
Where is he?!

573
00:31:26,226 --> 00:31:28,427
They must have seen us coming.

574
00:31:57,814 --> 00:31:58,890
Cal!

575
00:32:04,098 --> 00:32:06,264
Cal!

576
00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:07,399
Zeke!

577
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:15,025
Jace! Let him go!

578
00:32:15,027 --> 00:32:16,126
Drop your weapon!

579
00:32:18,096 --> 00:32:19,630
What did I tell you?!

580
00:32:19,632 --> 00:32:20,798
What did I say?!

581
00:32:30,543 --> 00:32:31,975
No!!

582
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:38,716
Zeke! No!

583
00:32:38,718 --> 00:32:40,784
Zeke! No!

584
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,557
Cal!

585
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,858
Cal!

586
00:33:02,808 --> 00:33:03,974
Cal!

587
00:33:03,976 --> 00:33:06,143
Cal!!

588
00:33:08,848 --> 00:33:11,315
Cal!

589
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,246
Zeke!

590
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,324
Zeke!!

591
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:29,566
Zeke! Zeke!!

592
00:33:39,527 --> 00:33:40,716
Zeke!

593
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,741
Zeke!

594
00:33:42,743 --> 00:33:44,599
Zeke!

595
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:45,767
Zeke!!

596
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,476
Zeke!

597
00:33:48,478 --> 00:33:49,877
Zeke!

598
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:51,679
Zeke!

599
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:53,314
Zeke!!

600
00:33:55,984 --> 00:33:58,152
Zeke!

601
00:34:01,557 --> 00:34:02,857
Zeke.

602
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:04,125
Okay.

603
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,227
I got you. I got you.

604
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:13,567
No!

605
00:34:13,569 --> 00:34:15,403
No! He can't die!

606
00:34:15,405 --> 00:34:16,794
Zeke!

607
00:34:16,796 --> 00:34:17,872
Zeke!

608
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:20,875
Zeke!

609
00:34:40,196 --> 00:34:41,996
Shh. Shh.

610
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:06,828
I'm sorry.

611
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,997
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

612
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:11,266
Hey, come on. Don't say that.

613
00:35:11,268 --> 00:35:13,635
It was his time. You know that.

614
00:35:13,637 --> 00:35:15,337
He chose to spend it saving Cal.

615
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:18,306
Cal should have never been here, Ben.

616
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:20,308
All he wanted to do was
die peacefully in my arms,

617
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,511
and I couldn't... I couldn't listen.

618
00:35:22,513 --> 00:35:24,613
I couldn't let go of him.

619
00:35:46,837 --> 00:35:47,902
Zeke!

620
00:35:47,904 --> 00:35:49,404
Zeke!

621
00:35:49,406 --> 00:35:50,438
Hi!

622
00:35:51,507 --> 00:35:52,841
Hey.

623
00:35:52,843 --> 00:35:54,976
I'm still alive, right?

624
00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:56,945
Yeah.

625
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,179
Cal's safe!

626
00:35:58,181 --> 00:35:59,948
We're all okay!

627
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,016
We're okay.

628
00:36:02,018 --> 00:36:03,485
Zeke?

629
00:36:05,655 --> 00:36:07,789
Thank you.

630
00:36:55,718 --> 00:36:57,107
Thank you.

631
00:37:13,466 --> 00:37:15,668
I killed her.

632
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,655
What do we do?

633
00:37:19,657 --> 00:37:20,923
What do we do?

634
00:37:20,925 --> 00:37:23,426
What do we do?

635
00:37:23,428 --> 00:37:25,061
What do we do?

636
00:37:25,063 --> 00:37:26,662
What do we do?

637
00:37:48,052 --> 00:37:50,786
Hey. Um...

638
00:37:50,788 --> 00:37:52,354
Zeke's crashed on the couch,

639
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:54,123
so it might be easier
if we stay the night.

640
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,624
Yeah, of course.

641
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:57,126
Here.

642
00:37:59,596 --> 00:38:01,030
Listen.

643
00:38:01,032 --> 00:38:03,065
- I said a lot of things.
- So did I.

644
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:05,634
Obviously, you would never
do anything to hurt Cal.

645
00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:07,069
You were as scared as I was,

646
00:38:07,071 --> 00:38:09,972
and you didn't need me turning on you.

647
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:12,007
For the record, we both turned on me.

648
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,912
I was sure that I'd made the
biggest mistake of my life.

649
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:18,647
This was meant to happen, Mick,

650
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:20,316
so we could see for ourselves.

651
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:23,144
Zeke following the Calling, saving Cal,

652
00:38:23,146 --> 00:38:27,010
that's... that's how
he beat the death date.

653
00:38:27,012 --> 00:38:29,545
So... what does that mean for us, then,

654
00:38:29,547 --> 00:38:31,280
for... for the rest of the 828ers?

655
00:38:31,282 --> 00:38:34,150
I mean, are we all gonna go
through some hell like this

656
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:36,819
in order to survive our death date?

657
00:38:36,821 --> 00:38:37,854
I don't know.

658
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,128
You know, when I saw the glow...

659
00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:50,533
... it was like I was seeing a miracle.

660
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:54,593
Maybe you were.

661
00:38:54,595 --> 00:38:57,129
Maybe we both were.

662
00:38:58,865 --> 00:39:00,532
Man, you've come around.

663
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,937
So, then, what does that make us?

664
00:39:06,807 --> 00:39:09,875
I don't know. I just feel like a... guy.

665
00:39:09,877 --> 00:39:12,010
A very lucky...

666
00:39:12,012 --> 00:39:14,813
very confused guy.

667
00:39:16,182 --> 00:39:17,683
Does that mean you're finally given up

668
00:39:17,685 --> 00:39:19,551
on Adrian's doomsday theory

669
00:39:19,553 --> 00:39:22,855
that we're all reborn
agents of the Apocalypse?

670
00:39:24,224 --> 00:39:25,991
I suppose I have.

671
00:39:25,993 --> 00:39:28,026
Although, for a minute,
it certainly felt like

672
00:39:28,028 --> 00:39:30,295
your meth heads were exactly that.

673
00:39:33,402 --> 00:39:36,594
Good riddance to those sons of bitches.

674
00:39:36,596 --> 00:39:38,185
Good riddance.

675
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:43,904
- Where are we?
- Nowhere.

676
00:39:43,906 --> 00:39:45,729
We've been down there for hours,

677
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:47,286
searched every inch of this lake.

678
00:39:47,288 --> 00:39:48,944
There are no bodies.

679
00:39:48,946 --> 00:39:52,071
Okay, That's not possible. No
one's come out of that lake.

680
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:53,996
I mean, they have to be in there.

681
00:39:53,998 --> 00:39:56,021
Don't know what to tell you.

682
00:39:56,023 --> 00:39:57,823
They're not.

683
00:41:06,472 --> 00:41:08,494

684
00:41:08,496 --> 00:41:11,095

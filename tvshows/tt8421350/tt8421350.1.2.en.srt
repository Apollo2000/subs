1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,700
Previously on "Manifest"...

2
00:00:03,701 --> 00:00:06,790
<i>Terribly sorry, folks.
That was not on the radar.</i>

3
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:10,480
You've all been missing,
presumed dead, for 5 1/2 years.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,880
- Who is she?
- Lourdes.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,100
That makes sense. She always
told me how lucky I was.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,960
I'm not ruling out that just
maybe he came back to be saved

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,120
and I came back to save him.

8
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:21,960
Earlier today, I heard
a voice in my head.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,580
Keep it to yourself.

10
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:25,830
What do you think, the government
just sent us home and forgot about us?

11
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:27,770
It's as if the plane never left the sky.

12
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,290
Do I have to say out loud
that that's impossible?

13
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,010
Why you and me? What makes two
head cases like us so special?

14
00:00:33,012 --> 00:00:34,880
What's the probability
it's just you and me?

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,180
Just four days

16
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,800
after its bewildering
reappearance,

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,720
Montego Air Flight 828
is no more.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,260
Thankfully,
no one was injured in the incident.

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,600
The aeroplane,
which first mystified the world

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,970
after it disappeared
in April 2013...

21
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,600
The plane
exploded shortly after midnight

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,890
here on the tarmac
at Stewart Airport.

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,600
Cause unknown.

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,430
Sources close
to the investigation

25
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,680
say a group
of the plane's passengers

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,550
were spotted
on surveillance camera.

27
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,260
There's more hot spots.
Can you see them?

28
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,180
Yes, sir.
Knock those down.

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,140
You don't understand.
My son is in jail.

30
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,220
I've been trying to find him
for three days.

31
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,050
They say I have to call him now,
this minute.

32
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,510
He doesn't even know I'm alive.

33
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,510
17.

34
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,680
What'd you tell him?

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
That I don't know anything.

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,600
Good. You don't.

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,930
We want to stay
far off their radar.

38
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,350
But aren't you seeing things,

39
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,430
hearing things in your head?

40
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,640
They think it's my fault.
They always blame the pilot.

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,510
Look, pal.
I don't know how else to say it.

42
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,760
I had an urge to see the plane,
I showed up, kaboom.

43
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,350
How exactly did 20 people
have the same... urge?

44
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,890
I sell sporting goods.
The hell you asking me for?

45
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,010
Hi. I'm Saanvi Bahl. You're Cal's family?
Ben Stone.

46
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,260
This is my sister, Michaela.
How do you know Cal?

47
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,140
I'm a doctor.
I do cancer research.

48
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,050
Cal's new treatment
came from work I was doing

49
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,930
before the plane disappeared.

50
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,890
You were on the flight?

51
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,350
I know.
It's some coincidence...

52
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,430
If any of this
can be a coincidence.

53
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,100
18.

54
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,140
Sir, what is our status here?
Are we under arrest?

55
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,100
No, you're merely detained.

56
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,680
Actually, we're not.

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,760
I'm NYPD.
I know how this works.

58
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,050
We've told you
everything that we know,

59
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,800
so if we're not under arrest,
then you need to let us go.

60
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,850
And radar signal established.

61
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,970
Ladies and gentlemen,

62
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,140
if you've given your statements,
you're free to go.

63
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,640
However, the events
surrounding Flight 828

64
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,140
are a matter
of national security.

65
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,180
You're instructed to observe
a strict media blackout.

66
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,140
Discuss this matter with no one.

67
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,800
Not reporters,
not your families... no one.

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,600
You could've played the cop card
eight hours ago.

69
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,390
Oh, you're... you're welcome.

70
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,850
I want eyes on all of them.

71
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,220

72
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,600
Drop me at the precinct?

73
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,140
Yeah, after we
swing by the house.

74
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,470
Grace must be worried to death.

75
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,600
I'll take the train, papa bear.

76
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,430
Hey, not a word to anyone.
'Cause NSA guy said so?

77
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,180
No, because it's safer that way.
We're obviously scapegoats here.

78
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,100
And until we figure out what happened
to us, I don't trust anyone.

79
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,100
- What did it feel like?
- Sir, sir.

80
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,010
You were on that plane.
- My friend. My friend.

81
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,800
My friend, are you also police
like the woman?

82
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,680
Uh, uh, no. Perhaps
you can help anyway.

83
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,350
What can you tell us
about what happened?

84
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,220
Sir, please, please. Please.
Help me.

85
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,350
Please, sir, I need your help.

86
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,260
- I'm sorry.
- Do you have any comment so far?

87
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,550
Just me.

88
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,260
What happened?

89
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,350
You were at the airport
when the plane exploded?

90
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,390
We went back to get our luggage.
It was a big misunderstanding.

91
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,260
We're okay.

92
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,680
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,720
I... I'm a little
self-conscious.

94
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,010
We were supposed to grow old
and flabby together.

95
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,930
Well, for the record,
you look amazing.

96
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,510
Brought your favorite.

97
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,930
Orlando's.

98
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,850
My God.

99
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,350
That smell.

100
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,970
I had completely forgotten.

101
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,470
Well, I kind of dropped the ball

102
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,180
on my weekly
blueberry-scone run.

103
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,890
By my calculation,
I owe you 291 of these,

104
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,430
give or take.

105
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,220
Thank you.

106
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,720
I can't find my toothbrush.

107
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,350
Uh, hey, bud.

108
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,930
Mine had Batman on it.
You know what?

109
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,350
I got you a whole pack
of cool ones.

110
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,470
Come on.

111
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,010
Religious leaders
and scientists alike

112
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,760
grapple with the mystery
of Montego Air Flight 828.

113
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,510
Coffee? Really?

114
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,680
So that's what
16-year-olds are doing.

115
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,510
It's mostly milk and sugar.

116
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,930
Hey, so, I've been thinking.

117
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,050
Maybe after school,
we could hang out a bit,

118
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,890
you know, catch up.

119
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,350
I want to hear about,
you know, everything.

120
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,100
I have practice,

121
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,800
and I fell pretty behind
in my homework last week.

122
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,100
Maybe tomorrow.

123
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,890
Great. Whenever.

124
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,640
What is that?

125
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,720
What?

126
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,970
That music.

127
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,470
You don't...
You don't hear that?

128
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,930
Maybe Alexa acting up
in the den.

129
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,850
Who's Alexa?

130
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,350
Sweetie, it fits.
It's just a narrower cut.

131
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,470
I think you look cool.

132
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,720
After treatment,
we'll go shopping, okay?

133
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,180
I just feel weird in this.

134
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,390
Come on. Let's see if
we can go drum up something

135
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,600
a little less weird-feeling.

136
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,140
Did you tell him yet?

137
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,050
I will. Soon.

138
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,010
Mom, this isn't cool.

139
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,100
He deserves to know.

140
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,430
I came by the house last night.

141
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,930
Grace said you'd gone out.

142
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,350
Hi.

143
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,350
Sorry, uh, Lourdes.
Hey.

144
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,600
Um, I got to catch up
with the boss.

145
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,430
I'll... I'll see you soon, okay?

146
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,970
Hey, Captain.

147
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,140
What happened to, uh,
taking some time for yourself?

148
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,550
I can either sit at home
staring at my ceiling

149
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,100
or I can get back to work.

150
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,970
So, here's how it is.

151
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,550
I want this to happen...

152
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,220
You've got that going for ya...

153
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,720
But I can't sign off until
you jump through the hoops...

154
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,010
The physical,
firearms re-cert, psych eval.

155
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,220
Since when is a psych eval
a hoop?

156
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,390
We're in uncharted waters here.

157
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,390
After all you've been through...

158
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,430
Is that all?
That's all.

159
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,050
A hollow shell
is all that remains

160
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,010
of Montego Air Flight 828.

161
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,680
While multiple
government agencies

162
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,850
survey the wreckage
and look for clues...

163
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,600
Do you have
any different-colored pens?

164
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,470
Uh, no, but we can get you
a whole bunch at the store...

165
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,300
Sketchpad like you had,
the works.

166
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,760
Okay.

167
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,890
Hey, guys.

168
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,220
Honey, this is,
uh, the doctor I told you about.

169
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,800
Nice to meet you.
Oh, hi, there.

170
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,760
You all being on the plane
together, it's miraculous.

171
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,890
Yeah, so my parents say.

172
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,350
They've been praying
at every meal.

173
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,050
But right now, I'm gonna focus
my energy on this guy.

174
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,970
You ready for round two, buddy?
Yep.

175
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,050
See you, bud.
Get 'em.

176
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,760
Later, Mom and Dad.

177
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,930
Need to take that?

178
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,300
No, it's just a work thing.

179
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,430
I'm catering this office party,

180
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,220
and the client's always checking in.

181
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,930
Of course.
I keep forgetting.

182
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,600
My wife, the entrepreneur.

183
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Ah, well.

184
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,760
Look, you must have
a ton to take care of,

185
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,390
so why don't I take a walk?
No, no, no.

186
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,300
You don't... I can make
some job-search calls,

187
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,800
and we can meet later back home.

188
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
I'll take tomorrow's shift.

189
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,970
I'll call you later.

190
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,390
Do you hear that?
Hear what?

191
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,260
You.

192
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,510
That melody.

193
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,050
That's been clanging in my head
all day.

194
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,260
I need help.
Please.

195
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,800
Please.

196
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,890
First it was the plane,
the vision.

197
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:02,140
Then this morning, the music
beating against my eardrums.

198
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,010
No voices?
You are hearing voices?

199
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,930
Eh, I'm not sure
what I'm hearing... or why.

200
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,350
For me, music is a higher power.

201
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,390
So this music we hear,
you and I together,

202
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,180
it's for a reason.

203
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,470
And that reason
has to be my son.

204
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,550
He's the one who needs help.

205
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,600
I was with you in Jamaica
to play with the philharmonic.

206
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,220
One night.

207
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,300
But I left a 13-year-old child
with my neighbor,

208
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,550
and I returned
to an 18-year-old man...

209
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,510
A man that is now behind bars.

210
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,350
Ah, I'm sorry.

211
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,350
What happened?

212
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,470
Police say it was robbery.

213
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,220
But that's impossible, you know,
'cause Adio's a good boy.

214
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,300
If I could just talk to him,

215
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,100
there'd be an explanation,
I know this.

216
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,600
Sounds like you need a lawyer.

217
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,890
Ineedto see my son.

218
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,550
The jail said
I need to be on a list,

219
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,550
but I'm a resident alien
and my visa's expired.

220
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,760
They say it could take a month,

221
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,930
but Adio don't have that long,
you know?

222
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,640
His trial's next week.

223
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,350
Please, please.

224
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,800
You know the police.

225
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,550
You're a father, yes?

226
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,300
Boy and a girl.

227
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,390
Adio's already been five years
without a father.

228
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:12,010
Can you imagine not being able
to save your own child?

229
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,050
I've been through your file.

230
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,850
Seems like your world
turned upside down

231
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,600
five monthsbefore you got on that plane.

232
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,640
My friend died.
We had a car accident.

233
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,050
You were the driver
and you'd been drinking?

234
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,390
That would weigh heavily
on anyone.

235
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,550
Well, there was an investigation,
and I was exonerated.

236
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,390
But still put on desk duty.
Yeah, I couldn't drive.

237
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,760
I wasn't ready.
I didn't want to.

238
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,800
Sorry. What... What exactly
is the point here?

239
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,850
I'm trying to help you process

240
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,640
the magnitude of changes
in your life

241
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,430
in the last five years.
Last four days.

242
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,760
That's my point...

243
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,260
To absorb so much change
in so little time.

244
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,600
You don't have to hide
your emotions.

245
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,550
I'm on your side. Due
respect, but you're not.

246
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,800
Look, I know the drill here.

247
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,680
I break down
and you mark me unfit for duty,

248
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,510
but I am okay.

249
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,760
So how about letting me get back

250
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,470
to the one thing
that I do have left... my job?

251
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,050
I'll need to see you again.

252
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,930
Hey.

253
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,100
You okay?

254
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,180
Yeah, bureaucracy.
What's up?

255
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,600
I need a favor.

256
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,550
Know anyone at Rikers?

257
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,600
15 minutes, break's over!

258
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,680
I didn't believe it.

259
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,970
Then I saw your face on TV.

260
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,010
Where were you?

261
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,140
I wish I knew.

262
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,260
Who did this to you?

263
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,720
Doesn't matter.

264
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,300
Whatever they told you,
I didn't do it.

265
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,640
Of course you didn't.

266
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,850
You always said
you have to be a good man.

267
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,680
I tried. I have.

268
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,050
School, no banging... all that.

269
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,510
I got a job at a jewelry store
on 47th Street.

270
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,930
Sometimes, I would close up.

271
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,300
One night a month ago,
I got jumped in the back room,

272
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,390
and when I came to,
everything was gone,

273
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,510
and they think
that I was a part of it.

274
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,430
Adio, what happened to your face

275
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,600
is not from a month ago.

276
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,350
Hmm?

277
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,220
I'm going to fight for you, son.

278
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,600
I'm going to fight for you.

279
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,550
Just up here.

280
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,720
It's the exact set you had.
It's just a different box.

281
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,600
It's not.
Mine had superhero minifigs.

282
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,390
This one doesn't.

283
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,760
Okay, we'll look at it
when we get home, all right?

284
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,930
Besides, you know, you can
mix three sets together, right?

285
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,260
He is risen.

286
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,300
He is not here.

287
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,550
He is risen.
Let go of him.

288
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,010
He is risen.

289
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,800
He is not here.

290
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,180
He is risen.

291
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,720
Everything left's
in the, uh, far case.

292
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,510
Actually, we're here about Adio.

293
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,100
We still doing this?

294
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,260
What happened
to the last detectives?

295
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,850
Uh, we're not the police.
This is Adio's father.

296
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,760
You got some nerve
walking in here.

297
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,640
He cleaned me out...
Entire inventory.

298
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,800
41 years up in smoke.

299
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,890
Some son you raised.

300
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,600
You...

301
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,890
Sorry.
My dad's actually a good guy.

302
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,720
And so is my son.

303
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,970
Look,
I don't know what to think.

304
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,470
I mean, we didn't even know
Adio was his name

305
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,390
until the cops said so.

306
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,350
Turned out,
he gave us a fake I.D.,

307
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,390
fake job references.

308
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,100
So when everything disappears,
no tripped alarm,

309
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,390
he's the only one here?

310
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,300
Tell me exactly what she said.

311
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,510
I wasn't focusing on the words.

312
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,510
I don't remember.
I... Just it was scary.

313
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,220
But he's fine?

314
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,100
As fine as can be expected
after chemo

315
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,640
and a crazy lady
praying in your face.

316
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,300
We will get past this soon
enough. I'm gonna figure it out.

317
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,470
I love
your problem-solving mind,

318
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,760
but I need to know
that Cal is going to be safe.

319
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,550
This'll die down.

320
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,850
We just need to be
extra vigilant until it does.

321
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,640
And what if it doesn't?
You've seen the news.

322
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,300
The whole world
is obsessing over us.

323
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,260
People can go online
and find out where we live.

324
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,140
We will be okay.

325
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,640
I mean, come on.

326
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,100
We got a cop
that lives in our house.

327
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,390
Trigger finger still works.

328
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,760
Yeah, what do you expect?

329
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,640
I had range time 10 days ago...

330
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,800
my time.

331
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,220
About this morning...

332
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,930
Lourdes...

333
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,390
I didn't mean to...

334
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,260
I just need time, okay?

335
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,470
Mick, if you held this
against me for the rest of my...

336
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,010
I told you I don't hold anything
against you.

337
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,550
Well, you could,
and I'd... I'd get it.

338
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,300
And please don't punish Lourdes.

339
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,430
I'm not punishing her, Jared,

340
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,300
but I saw her and you,

341
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,180
and I felt like puking
or fainting or both.

342
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,600
If you could just put yourself
in her shoes... Really?

343
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,350
Is that where you're gonna go?

344
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,510
Losing Evie was hard enough,
but then you?

345
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,100
Lourdes lost her best friend
when you disappeared.

346
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,800
She never replaced you.

347
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,640
And I couldn't replace you.

348
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,550
Now, at this point,
we have no evidence

349
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,890
of passenger or crew involvement
in the explosion.

350
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,800
But that said, we continue
to suspect some nexus between...

351
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,390
Director Vance, if I may.

352
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,390
The explosion is a bit
beside the point.

353
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,390
Where did that plane go
for 5 1/2 years?

354
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,350
Theories abound.

355
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,260
We could be talking about
a wormhole,

356
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,970
about some kind of
extraterrestrial encounter.

357
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,180
But more to the point,
are we in danger?

358
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,890
Was the plane targeted
by some kind of weapon?

359
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,260
Or isitthe weapon?

360
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,970
Do we even know
if those are the same people

361
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,970
that were on that plane in 2013?

362
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,140
We've tested comprehensive
samples of the passengers

363
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,350
and haven't detected
any anomalies.

364
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,510
This is national security
we're talking about.

365
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,510
They should be incarcerated

366
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,140
until we can determine
whether or not they're a threat.

367
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,640
Director Hughes, this is still America.
These people have rights.

368
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,430
I-I suspect
if anyone has answers,

369
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,550
it's someone on that plane,

370
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,760
most likely someone we found
standing 100 yards away

371
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,430
when it blew to bits,
which leaves 20 people.

372
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,050
Of course we were confused.

373
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,390
What, you cook now?

374
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,800
Just when I thought things
couldn't get any stranger.

375
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,550
Hey, thanks for the jail hookup.

376
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,760
How is Radd's son?

377
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,300
His face is bashed in.

378
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,300
It's not safe in there.

379
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,050
Yeah, well, if he gets convicted
and goes upstate,

380
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,300
the place he's at now is
gonna seem like a country club.

381
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,600
I so want this kid to be
innocent for his father's sake.

382
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,050
Hey, can you pull the file

383
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,970
and see if the cops or D.A.
cut some corners?

384
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,600
So it's the...
The police's fault?

385
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,890
I'm just spit-balling here.

386
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,300
Doesn't seem fair that
that flight

387
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,010
may have saved my kid's life
but threatened someone else's.

388
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,220
You heard something
like last time.

389
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,510
Not exactly.

390
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,600
But whatever that was,
whatever this is,

391
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,850
I've got to get
to the bottom of it.

392
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,680
No, Ben, not everything is
a puzzle that you have to solve.

393
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,930
It isn't about solving a puzzle.

394
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:23,140
This is understanding what
my life has become... ourlives.

395
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,760
If we can't answer that,

396
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,680
we're never gonna be able
to get back to normal.

397
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,800
Have you told Grace?

398
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,720
No.

399
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,470
She has enough going on.

400
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,890
These aren't the same.

401
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,260
Really?

402
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,050
Well, we can try
another store tomorrow.

403
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,930
All right, dinner's ready.
Olive!

404
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,760
Up high.

405
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
It smells incredible.

406
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,180
Hey, how about after dinner,

407
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,680
we go for
an old-school ice-cream run?

408
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,260
You still like ice cream, right?

409
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,470
I've got to study.

410
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,140
Soon.

411
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,970
Ah!

412
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,100
Ah, come here.

413
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,720
Come here.

414
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,300
You are supposed to be in bed!
Come here.

415
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,550
Grr!

416
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,930
Rawr!

417
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,470
My God, we're the parents
of a teenage girl.

418
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,260
Be thankful you missed puberty.

419
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Ouch.

420
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,140
How'd that happen?

421
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,600
Oh.
Scuba diving, actually.

422
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,640
Excuse me?

423
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,260
How many times
did I want us to try diving?

424
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,260
Well, I tried it.

425
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,180
Turns out, it leaves a mark.

426
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:35,550
Okay, well, you can teach me.

427
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,220
You know how hard this is.

428
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,010
It hasn't even been a week.

429
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,600
Of course I do.

430
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,100
I will.

431
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,510
Bye.

432
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,050
You too.

433
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,850
Do I know him?

434
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,100
Does Ben?

435
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,300
No.

436
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,350
Mick, nobody did
anything wrong here.

437
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,220
Not me, not Jared, not Lourdes.

438
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,970
Not me or Ben.

439
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,800
No, of course not.

440
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,930
I am going to tell him.

441
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,760
I just...

442
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,970
I need to figure out
what I'm gonna do.

443
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,100
Meaning...

444
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,550
who you're gonna be with?

445
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:54,680
Wow.

446
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,100
Grace, look,
I know that you guys

447
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,220
didn't have a perfect marriage,
but really?

448
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,760
He is your...
He is your husband.

449
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,470
I know.

450
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:05,010
And I love him.

451
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,140
God help me.

452
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,180
I didn't even remember
how much I loved him

453
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,100
until he came back.

454
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,300
But you have to understand
this is an impossible situation.

455
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,680
This is none of my business,

456
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,680
but you need to figure this out
before Ben does.

457
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,470
He's going through enough.

458
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,510
They said
it was the electrolytes,

459
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,260
but who knows
what was really in there?

460
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,970
Are you saying you think
the government drugged you?

461
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,430
I'm just trying to own my truth.

462
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,100
I don't know for sure
what happened,

463
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,510
but I'm beginning to think that

464
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,180
they didn't tell us everything
that was going on.

465
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,470
They gave us stuff
to eat and drink from a box...

466
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,800
I'll be right back.

467
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,220
What's up?

468
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,680
I, um...

469
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,140
God, this is gonna sound nuts.

470
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,970
But you did come back
to the plane, too,

471
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,350
so I'm guessing you're already
questioning your sanity.

472
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,010
I'm questioning a lot of things.

473
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,100
Have you been...

474
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,010
hearing music?

475
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,890
You mean, like, in my head?

476
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:22,430
I haven't heard any music,
but I've had a similar feeling

477
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,470
more than once
since we've been back.

478
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,220
Yeah, well, at least I know
I'm not going crazy.

479
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,760
Or at least
you're not the only one.

480
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,140
Hey, dude.
Family portrait?

481
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:42,100
Yep. Me with no cancer,
my mom and dad, my sister.

482
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,300
Who's that?

483
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,550
I don't know.

484
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,720
You ready?
Yep.

485
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,220
All right, let's go.

486
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,680
Police work checks out, Ben.

487
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,800
Adio was the only one on duty.

488
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,350
I mean, he said he was attacked,

489
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,720
but there's no signs
of forced entry

490
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,680
and other than
the ding on his head...

491
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,600
You think he's lying.

492
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,800
No, I don't know what to think,

493
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,970
but the kid had 12 grand
stashed in his apartment

494
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:42,760
and he's got a record.

495
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,350
I mean... Shoplifting,
jumping turnstiles?

496
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:47,640
This is minor stuff. Yeah, but it's
what a jury will look at and say,

497
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,260
"That kid's
heading the wrong direction."

498
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,680
There has to be more I can do.

499
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,680
I mean, why else would I have
been drawn in? Okay, science boy.

500
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,220
Mom was the one
who believed in miracles.

501
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,970
Forget miracles.

502
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,680
Every day Adio is in there,
his life is in danger.

503
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,300
Yeah, well, Mom would also say,

504
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,470
"God works
in mysterious ways."

505
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,930
You know, you can stop
goading me any time now.

506
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,350
I'm not convinced God
has anything to do with this.

507
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,350
You think God wanted Jared

508
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,350
to marry your best friend
instead of you?

509
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,180
That was a terrible thing
to say.

510
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,050
And yet kind of a fair question.

511
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,010
I'm one to talk.

512
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,760
Olive barely looks me
in the eye,

513
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,800
Grace is trying, but...

514
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,350
I still feel like a stranger
in my own home.

515
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,220
I did what I did to get by...
Fake I.D. so I can work,

516
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,510
shoplifted so I can...
So I can eat.

517
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,470
No, no, no, no.

518
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,260
None of this is your fault.

519
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,680
I left you alone.

520
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,180
So if you did something,

521
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,720
even out of desperation...

522
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,350
I didn't!

523
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:02,140
They beat on me just like
they beating on me in here.

524
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,550
Is there anything he could tell
us that might help confirm...

525
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,550
Look, I did like you taught me.
I kept my head down.

526
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,930
I worked my ass off
being a good man.

527
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,930
One more minute. Being a good man.
Tell them.

528
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,180
Just tell them.
Just tell them, Dad.

529
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,640
Please, please, tata.
Tell them that I'm good.

530
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,890
Please, sir. Tell them, please. Wait, wait.
Please. Just tell them.

531
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,220
Please, sir!
Give us more time!

532
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,930
Don't do this! Just...
Just give us another minute!

533
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,180
Happy birthday, Mick.
I miss you.

534
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,350
Um...

535
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,010
off-center.

536
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,720
Pissed.

537
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,100
Mostly sad.

538
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,890
And why is that?

539
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,470
Uh...

540
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,010
because I miss my mom.

541
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:44,760
'Cause you don't just stop
being in love with someone.

542
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,850
Um...

543
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,850
'cause my best friend
in the world,

544
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:54,180
the person I would normally
complain to instead of you

545
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,800
gets to love the person
that I can't.

546
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,010
Howisthat friendship?

547
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,350
Lourdes?

548
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:06,930
She sent beautiful messages
to a ghost for...

549
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,930
for five years,

550
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:12,430
and I come back, and I...

551
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,680
couldn't even hug her.

552
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,930
All of the people
that I would normally talk to...

553
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:23,430
Lourdes, Evie, my mom...

554
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,470
You feel alone.

555
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,300
And out comes
the disability form.

556
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,300
Get what you wanted?

557
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,050
You've accepted what's happened.

558
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,850
That's a good first step.

559
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:47,100
I'm recommending your
conditional reinstatement...

560
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,180
But I want to keep seeing you.

561
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:02,260
Hey, I heard the news.

562
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,640
Congratulations, Detective.

563
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,260
Oh, yeah,
it was a posthumous promotion.

564
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,050
I didn't earn it.

565
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,850
I can't even die
the way I'm supposed to.

566
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,720
Just take the win, would you?

567
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,470
And if anyone deserves to have
a break go in there direction...

568
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,300
Thanks.

569
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,640
I'll try not to make it
too awkward around here.

570
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,890
Hey.

571
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,300
How was your day? Good.

572
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,930
Hey, check it out...
Every comfy t-shirt

573
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,720
and cool LEGO set
on the planet Earth.

574
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,550
Thanks, Mom.

575
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,220
Whoa.

576
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,640
Is everything okay?

577
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,510
What's up, buddy?

578
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,140
I missmystuff...

579
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,100
My rock collection,
Art the Dragon.

580
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,100
Oh, Cal, listen...

581
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,050
it's okay to be sad.

582
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,220
I get sad sometimes, too.

583
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,510
I just want everything
back the way it was.

584
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,350
Aw, sweetie, I know, I know.

585
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,800
Dad, can we take that ride now?

586
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,220
After two years or so,

587
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,720
the house was exactly the same.

588
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,140
It was like this sad museum

589
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,140
and the shrink said
we needed to let go

590
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,050
and Mom was a wreck and I...

591
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,680
Honey, if you weren't a wreck
anymore after two years,

592
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,970
I'd say
that sounded pretty healthy.

593
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:25,970
Wasn't it.

594
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,430
I knew Cal wasn't dead.

595
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,100
You did?

596
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,890
I don't know if it was
some kind of twin thing,

597
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:38,100
but I could...
I could feel him... alive.

598
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,510
And the therapist,
the counselors at school, Mom,

599
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:46,140
everyone blew it off,
blewmeoff, but I knew.

600
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,510
Okay.

601
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,220
Does this connect
to why we're in

602
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,050
a pretty gross-smelling
storage facility on Long Island?

603
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,760
Mom listened
to the shrink, okay?

604
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,930
Sh-She packed all your
and Cal's stuff away in boxes,

605
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:01,260
left on the curb
for Salvation Army

606
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,890
and then went to work.

607
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,640
I called,
and I cancelled the pickup.

608
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,220
Well, if you've had his stuff
all this time,

609
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,600
why didn't you say something?

610
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,300
It's complicated.

611
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,390
Mom doesn't know
about any of this.

612
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:39,140
Olive, whose locker is this?

613
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,100
Olive.

614
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,970
Friend of Mom's, all right?

615
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,430
"Friend."

616
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,720
Dad.

617
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,470
Okay.
Come here.

618
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:56,220
You did the right thing.

619
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,600
Hey, are you... are you okay?

620
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,890
Stay here, okay?
Stay here.

621
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,350
Hello?

622
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:35,640
Y-Yeah, meet me in the back.

623
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,510
Yeah, uh, watches,
diamond rings, bracelets.

624
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,350
Fine. Yeah.

625
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,300
I'll take 10, but you got to
get this stuff out of state.

626
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,550
People are looking for it.
Whoa. How did you...

627
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,970
W... It's not what it looks like.

628
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,930
You robbed your own father
and blamed Adio.

629
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:58,390
You can take half of this.
Seriously. Come on.

630
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,390
I mean, that kid was going
nowhere. He was just a...

631
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:13,180
Still don't believe in miracles?

632
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:17,050
This is everything Adio was
accused of stealing and more.

633
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,180
How?

634
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,550
Don't want to talk about it.

635
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,890
Why? 'Cause then
you'd have to admit

636
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,260
something miraculous
is going on here?

637
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,050
Look, there's definitely
something going on,

638
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,300
but even if it isn't just
some series of coincidences,

639
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,430
which it could still be,
there has to be an explanation.

640
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,550
And God's not
good enough for you?

641
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,430
God's a catchall for things
people don't understand.

642
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,180
Any sufficiently
advanced technology

643
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,600
is indistinguishable from magic.

644
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,010
We just...
need more information.

645
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:43,220
Right. Technology.
Magic. Gotcha.

646
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,850
Guys, can we go?

647
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:01,050
Jeter retired.

648
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,720
We'll tell him next season.

649
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,430
Hey, take it easy, pal.

650
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,220
You don't have to
unpack it all tonight.

651
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,760
I just want to find... Art!

652
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,720
There he is.

653
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,850
What else we got here?

654
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,140
You know, you have your sister
to thank for this.

655
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,180
She saved it all for you.

656
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,550
Let's see.

657
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,890
What's that do?

658
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,470
You did this?

659
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:40,350
You made me feel crazy
for not letting go,

660
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:44,140
but I was right,
and I'm right this time.

661
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:49,350
Only this time, you'rethe one
who needs to let go.

662
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,390
Hi.

663
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:11,010
Sorry.
Is now a good time?

664
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,390
Sure.

665
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,760
Jared's at work.

666
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,180
Already knew that.

667
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,350
Want to come in?
No, that's okay.

668
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,760
I have to be somewhere.

669
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,600
I just wanted to, um...

670
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,890
I saw your posts online.

671
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,850
All of them.

672
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,850
Thank you.

673
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:41,140
You never stopped
being my best friend.

674
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,800
I hope
that doesn't have to change.

675
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,350
Let's play that one by ear,
okay?

676
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:51,260
Michaela, I never meant to...

677
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,760
If I'd known that you were...

678
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,470
What, that I was gonna
come back from the dead?

679
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,800
I'm the one who's out of place.

680
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,010
You're not.
This isn't on you.

681
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,800
It's okay, Lou.

682
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,220
You love him.

683
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,010
So do you.

684
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:13,640
But you're the one he married.

685
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,430
Of course I bless this.
How could I not?

686
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,510
Thank you.

687
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:26,390
I've... I've spent
all these years

688
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:29,890
trying not to feel like
a fraud, you know?

689
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,930
You were the one
he was supposed to marry.

690
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,010
No.

691
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,470
No, after everything
that happened...

692
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,390
The... the accident, Evie...
It was too intertwined.

693
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,180
There was...
There was too much pain.

694
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,350
I was gonna give the ring back.

695
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:50,850
Mick... I was coming
back to say no.

696
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,050
You're not a fraud.

697
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,300
Let it go.

698
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,010
Come here.

699
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,350
Yes, we did, people.

700
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:07,760
Welcome to New York,
where local time is 11:49 p.m.

701
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,930
On behalf of your flight crew,

702
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:13,140
we'd like to thank you all
for flying Montego Air.

703
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,300
Seriously?
No service?

704
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,930
Same.

705
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,010
I'm so sorry.

706
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,680
That wasn't Olive's secret
to tell.

707
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,390
I can't believe she would...

708
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:50,140
She did it for her brother.

709
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:57,300
Olive is an amazing young woman.

710
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,970
You've done an incredible job,

711
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:04,260
and I can't imagine
how hard that was.

712
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,300
And I don't...

713
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:15,510
It doesn't matter
where you found the strength

714
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,510
or with whom.

715
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,930
All I wanted for so long

716
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,100
was to have you and Cal back,

717
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,010
but it was a want
that hurt so much

718
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,390
that I had to let it go.

719
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,640
I know.

720
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,350
But I never had to.

721
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:48,510
I still love you so damn much,
it hurts.

722
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:55,550
And I know your love for me
is out of practice,

723
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,970
more like a memory...

724
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,890
but we have a second chance.

725
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,720
Please remember.

726
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,100
When they let us go,

727
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,600
they told us
we weren't supposed to talk,

728
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,550
but I know my rights.

729
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:28,470
And now that I've spoken up,
I think they're watching me.

730
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:32,680
I'm telling you, I think
the government is behind this.

731
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,640
I mean, if I'm
supposed to own my truth,

732
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,510
don't you think
they should, too?

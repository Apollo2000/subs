1
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:02,667
Previously on "Manifest"...

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,697
828 wing nuts shouldn't be allowed

3
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:06,205
to carry the badge and gun.

4
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:09,074
Adrian's making the rest of
the world scared to death of us.

5
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:11,604
The rest of the world
needs to open their eyes!

6
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:14,172
I was able to confirm
elimination of the 828 anomaly

7
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:15,274
in a Petri dish.

8
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:17,633
Now I need to test the
serum on a living specimen.

9
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:19,119
The Calling said "save the passengers".

10
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:20,544
To me, that means tracking them down

11
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:22,314
and finding out who
knows something we don't.

12
00:00:22,316 --> 00:00:23,893
The star represents hope.

13
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:26,062
The woman said it was
what her future held.

14
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:27,131
She gave it to Olive.

15
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,231
How is this possible?

16
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:29,966
I don't have anywhere else to go.

17
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:31,335
Michaela, this is Courtney.

18
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:33,003
His wife.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,074

20
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:45,014
Zeke?

21
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:46,182
Hey, man.

22
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:47,450
How you doing, man?

23
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:49,185
- Never better!
- Aah!

24
00:00:49,187 --> 00:00:50,386
Must be love.

25
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:52,489
Just might be.

26
00:00:52,491 --> 00:00:54,624
I got some new merchandise.

27
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:56,292
First two are on me.

28
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:05,034
I don't mean to scare you,

29
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:07,170
but I think there's a girl in my bed.

30
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:09,506
Uh-oh.

31
00:01:09,508 --> 00:01:12,699
I've heard they can be
very, very dangerous.

32
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:16,012
I hope you brought her
something to keep her happy.

33
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,083
Pink's my color.

34
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:31,494
Now, what are we gonna do today?

35
00:01:31,496 --> 00:01:34,497
You've already chosen pink.

36
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:36,698
P-I-N-K.

37
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,300
Okay, what number?

38
00:01:38,302 --> 00:01:39,401
You're crazy.

39
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:43,339
Um... three.

40
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:45,274
Okay.

41
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:50,312
It says we should get married.

42
00:01:57,688 --> 00:01:58,754
Ohh.

43
00:01:58,756 --> 00:02:00,422
I'm just kidding.

44
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:03,159
It says, "Go to the movies".

45
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:08,897
Unless...

46
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,368
Unless we should just get married.

47
00:02:15,673 --> 00:02:17,572
And we did. We got married.

48
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:20,142
'Cause that's how we were back then...

49
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:23,311
wild, impulsive...

50
00:02:23,313 --> 00:02:25,881
in love.

51
00:02:25,883 --> 00:02:29,718
But this guy and I, we
were also toxic together.

52
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,254
We fed each other's addictions.

53
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:36,759
But he finally found a
path out of all of that.

54
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:43,165
He's sober, dating a
police detective, happy.

55
00:02:44,702 --> 00:02:48,537
And he's trying to help
me find a path out, too.

56
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:56,101
You asked for it.

57
00:02:56,103 --> 00:02:57,679
This is "a few things"?

58
00:02:57,681 --> 00:03:00,348
Yeah, well, Grace has
been spending a lot of time

59
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,415
in the house lately.

60
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:02,684
Since the accident?

61
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:05,654
And apparently, waging
a holy war on clutter.

62
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:07,604
- Hmm.
- If this is too much, I can...

63
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:09,858
No, I could always use three whisks.

64
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,293
You are now a proud owner
of a slightly used air bed.

65
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:14,295
Actually, this is good.

66
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:16,230
It'll give Courtney a
nice break from the couch.

67
00:03:16,232 --> 00:03:19,161
Zeke just forget to
mention he had a wife?

68
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:21,220
No, to be clear, they
were high as kites,

69
00:03:21,222 --> 00:03:22,877
so they never actually
filed the paperwork.

70
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,969
They were never legally married,

71
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,609
and they broke up like a year
before he went into the woods.

72
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:28,444
Oh. Okay. That doesn't
make it weird at all

73
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:30,213
that she's been on
your couch for a week.

74
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:31,880
Look, Zeke dealt with
my drama with Jared.

75
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:34,249
He carried it all the way
to Rikers, so it's my turn.

76
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:36,742
I mean, part of his sobriety
is making amends with the past,

77
00:03:36,744 --> 00:03:37,966
so he's helping her.

78
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,334
It's fine.

79
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:41,424
It's awful.

80
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:43,459
Look, I'm trying to be supportive,

81
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:46,028
and she's actually really nice,
but I just want her gone.

82
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,597
Well, I got some good news for you.

83
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,833
There's a hole in the air bed.

84
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,803
Alright. Now you're even.

85
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,161
Yeah? Can I look?

86
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:02,229
Mm-hmm.

87
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:12,755
How you feel?

88
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:16,625
Like a new man.

89
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:19,528
You know, I feel like
an accessory to a crime.

90
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,586
Didn't you tell your dad we're
doing tarot-card research today?

91
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:23,099
And we will.

92
00:04:24,602 --> 00:04:27,044
You know, my mom used to
volunteer at a soup kitchen.

93
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:28,679
There was this Buddhist
Temple that had one in it.

94
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:31,048
Sometimes I'd go.

95
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,318
So, your mom was Buddhist?

96
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,087
She was a lot of things.

97
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:38,356
When I came back and she was gone,

98
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:41,925
I, uh, had my own mini
Buddhist memorial rite for her.

99
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:43,361
Did it help?

100
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:44,862
Kind of.

101
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:47,398
I could... feel her.

102
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,234
It's an honor to have you here.

103
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:51,736
Oh. Okay.

104
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:52,837
Where do we start?

105
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:54,205
- No.
- I...

106
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:56,040
No, no.

107
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:57,298
You have to go.

108
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,009
What? Why?

109
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:00,310
Your dad was very clear.

110
00:05:00,312 --> 00:05:02,713
'Cause you're a minor, I have to comply.

111
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:05,148
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,383
Okay.

113
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:11,779
If we're turning away the very people

114
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:13,491
who experienced the miracle firsthand,

115
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:16,259
how are we going to get the
rest of the world to believe?

116
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:19,096
There'll be another miracle, Isaiah.

117
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:21,231
An even bigger one.

118
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:22,666
I...

119
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:27,070
Grace? Good news.

120
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:29,540
Your whisks officially have a new home.

121
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:34,111
What is it?

122
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:38,348
Hi! This is Jane Hawley
of New York Life.

123
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,085
Our magazine is doing a cover
feature on your pregnancy.

124
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:43,387
The first 828 baby is a big story,

125
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:45,555
and we'd love to interview
you for the article.

126
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:47,891
Call us back...

127
00:05:47,893 --> 00:05:49,259
How did she find out?

128
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:50,494
So many people have seen us

129
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:52,029
coming and going from the hospital.

130
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:54,931
I guess... I guess we
can't hide it anymore.

131
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:56,356
I don't want anyone else to know.

132
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:57,535
I don't want the Xers to know.

133
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:58,936
I don't want the Believers to know.

134
00:05:58,937 --> 00:06:00,170
It's none of their business.

135
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:01,772
It's just two people having a baby.

136
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:03,008
There's no story here.

137
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:07,344
It's not like it's a plane
coming back from the past.

138
00:06:07,346 --> 00:06:08,678
Ben?

139
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:14,385
Great marriage pep talk. Thank you.

140
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:16,420
Michaela!

141
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:18,688
That was really sweet of you.

142
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,524
You must be drunk.

143
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:26,162
Saanvi! Saanvi!

144
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:28,531
Ben, please help! You have to help!

145
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:31,868
Wait! Wait, Saanvi!

146
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:41,378
Was that a Calling?

147
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,114
I think Saanvi's in trouble.

148
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:45,882
Is she still hiding out with Vance?

149
00:06:45,884 --> 00:06:47,183
No, not anymore.

150
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:48,992
Even the former director of the NSA

151
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:50,186
couldn't keep her from her research.

152
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:51,854
Go. I'll stay here with Cal.

153
00:06:51,856 --> 00:06:53,356
Just call me if you need anything.

154
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:54,424
Alright.

155
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:58,761
Hey, Captain.

156
00:06:58,763 --> 00:07:01,835
Did you, um, hear from
Internal Affairs about the leak?

157
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:05,234
Hey, Stone. You get any
proof there is a leak?

158
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:08,938
Someone tipped off the
Xers right before that bust.

159
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,507
I have a feeling someone...

160
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:13,009
Do I strike you as someone who's
interested in your feelings?

161
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:15,512
Stop pointing fingers
and go catch a bad guy.

162
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:16,579
Goodbye.

163
00:07:19,217 --> 00:07:21,283
Hey. Sorry about that.

164
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:23,887
I do have a lead on an
attempted burglary, though,

165
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:25,388
if you want to...

166
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:27,223
_

167
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:29,162
- Go. I got it.
- I'm sorry.

168
00:07:29,164 --> 00:07:30,697
I got this.

169
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,429
Whoa! What's up with the new do?

170
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:37,967
Where's she going without you?

171
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:41,070
Yeah. Good luck.

172
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:45,174
Saanvi? You in there?

173
00:07:45,176 --> 00:07:46,775
Come on, open up.

174
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,886
Saanvi!

175
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:58,454
- Saanvi!
- Hey.

176
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:01,124
- Is she in there?
- I think so. Her phone's in there.

177
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,791
Hey. Excuse me.

178
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:04,593
Can we get this door open, please?

179
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:12,301
- Get a doctor right now!
- Right away!

180
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:13,602
Saanvi.

181
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:26,779
Hey. Thanks.

182
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,547
You know, with the hours
Saanvi's been keeping,

183
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,982
she probably just
collapsed from exhaustion.

184
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:31,083
I'm not so sure.

185
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:34,219
I swiped this from
the floor next to her.

186
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:35,655
I've prepped myself,

187
00:08:35,657 --> 00:08:37,723
and I will begin Phase
One of Human Trials.

188
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,392
She was experimenting on herself?

189
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,327
Why would she do that?
That's so dangerous.

190
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:44,596
She blames herself for the
Major getting her research,

191
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:46,431
and now she feels she
has to... catch up.

192
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:48,333
Well, she can't catch up if she's dead.

193
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:49,902
Excuse me.

194
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,503
Dr. Bahl is going to be fine,

195
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:53,639
but she's very lucky you
found her when you did.

196
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:56,142
You'll be able to see
her in a few minutes.

197
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:57,242
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

198
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,783
I got to go. Can you
let me know how she is?

199
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:04,884
Yeah.

200
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:10,889
Okay, so, most versions of the Star Card

201
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:12,323
show a woman at a river.

202
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:14,325
This one has a peacock.

203
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:17,062
And a peacock is what helped
you figure out the Death Date.

204
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:18,696
- Yeah.
- So, why would the tarot reader

205
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:20,732
give you and your mom a
card in the first place?

206
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,290
Wouldn't that make the deck incomplete?

207
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,402
I supposed you would have to
ask the reader who gave it to us,

208
00:09:24,404 --> 00:09:26,245
but I don't know her name,

209
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:28,106
nor do I know the name of her business.

210
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:30,942
It was literally a
stand on the sidewalk.

211
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:33,945
We could go look for her.

212
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:35,580
Field trip.

213
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,917
Let's do it.

214
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:48,293
It's kinda hard to stay mad at you

215
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:50,595
since you may just have saved my life.

216
00:09:50,597 --> 00:09:52,397
Well...

217
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,466
then I'll be mad at you.

218
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:58,403
You were testing on yourself?

219
00:09:58,405 --> 00:10:00,496
Saanvi, you were the one that told me

220
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:01,942
that testing on people is unethical

221
00:10:01,944 --> 00:10:04,643
and it would never be considered
unless the patient is terminal.

222
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,922
We are terminal. That's
what I'm working on, Ben.

223
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:09,463
If there's a chance
to cure the Death Date,

224
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:10,948
I have to figure it out. That is on me.

225
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,686
And how are you gonna do that
if you're dead and buried?

226
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:17,121
You know what, Saanvi?
You've got to promise me

227
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:19,123
you're not gonna test on yourself again.

228
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,725
- I'll try, but...
- No. Promise me.

229
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:23,461
Saanvi, if we hadn't had that Calling,

230
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:25,062
if you hadn't asked me to help you, I...

231
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:29,400
Wait. In the Calling, I
wasn't asking you to help me.

232
00:10:29,402 --> 00:10:31,302
You didn't see the boy?

233
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:33,070
Hey, are you okay?

234
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:37,975
Hey, can you hear me?
Where are your parents?

235
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:39,677
Help.

236
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,245
Help.

237
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:44,081
Saanvi! Saanvi!

238
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,849
Help! Help! You have to help, Ben!

239
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:47,718
No, no. Saanvi! Wait!

240
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,456
That must have been

241
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,192
right as I was passing
out from the hypoxia.

242
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:56,427
Which explains why you
faded away in the Calling.

243
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:58,728
I-I did see the kid but
only for a few seconds

244
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,232
after you... disappeared.

245
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:05,235
But Cal was the youngest kid on 828.

246
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:06,403
We both saw him.

247
00:11:06,405 --> 00:11:09,773
Okay, so it was 14C.
That was Finn Nowak.

248
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:12,276
- Wall Street guy.
- We need to talk to Finn.

249
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:14,144
That little boy desperately
needs our help.

250
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:15,579
We have to find him.

251
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:18,282
You are a patient here
who's not been discharged.

252
00:11:18,284 --> 00:11:20,817
- I go talk to Finn.
- Well, keep me in the loop.

253
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:22,352
Hey.

254
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:24,321
You memorized the seating chart?

255
00:11:24,323 --> 00:11:26,990
Are you surprised?

256
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:28,825
No, I'm impressed.

257
00:11:33,998 --> 00:11:36,032
I-I... It was over there.

258
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:39,469
It was under a black tent. But...

259
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:41,271
I don't know. It's been three years.

260
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:42,338
I can't remember.

261
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,207
Yeah, tell me about it.

262
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,675
I came here last year with a classmate.

263
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:47,377
She's 25 now.

264
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:49,546
Was she your girlfriend?

265
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:53,883
I don't really have too many
friends, much less girlfriends.

266
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:55,458
Not that I wouldn't want a girlfriend.

267
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,952
And, you know, it's, uh...

268
00:11:56,954 --> 00:11:58,677
It'd be different if I, you
know, met the right person.

269
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,789
- No. Yeah.
- Yeah.

270
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,124
Exactly. You just...

271
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:04,460
You just haven't met
the right person yet.

272
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:07,463
I mean, I haven't not met that person.

273
00:12:11,502 --> 00:12:13,636
It's just not too many
people know what it's like

274
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:15,138
to be an 828er.

275
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,107
Yeah. I bet. It's complicated.

276
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:19,942
Yeah.

277
00:12:19,944 --> 00:12:21,510
Just a bit.

278
00:12:24,115 --> 00:12:25,281
Is that it?

279
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:29,185
Not even close, but let's
just see if she knows anything.

280
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:30,853
Great.

281
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:34,489
Vision of being back on the plane?

282
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:37,425
No. No, I haven't had
anything like that.

283
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:41,329
So, you wouldn't know why
we saw a kid in your seat?

284
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:44,599
Probably 5 or 6, dark hair, dark eyes.

285
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:45,700
No idea.

286
00:12:45,702 --> 00:12:47,836
I don't have a wife, no kids, so...

287
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:51,606
Definitely didn't bring one to Jamaica.

288
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:54,109
I was there for a bachelor party.

289
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:55,544
The funny thing is,

290
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:57,946
I wasn't even supposed
to be on that plane.

291
00:12:57,948 --> 00:13:02,117
Yeah, me neither.
Last-minute voucher grab.

292
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:03,485
What's your story?

293
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:06,454
We went to this beach
party the night before,

294
00:13:06,456 --> 00:13:10,859
and I met this amazing woman, Orlena.

295
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:12,994
Smart, funny. New Yorker.

296
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:16,265
We just connected.

297
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:18,099
Next morning, she was gone.

298
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:20,769
I went looking for her,
and I missed my plane.

299
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:23,605
- I ended up on 828.
- That one little decision.

300
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:26,375
Screwed up pretty much everything.

301
00:13:26,377 --> 00:13:27,776
Yeah.

302
00:13:29,946 --> 00:13:31,446
That's him.

303
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:34,283
That's the kid who was
on the plane in your seat.

304
00:13:34,285 --> 00:13:36,117
That's impossible.

305
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:39,954
That's a childhood photo...

306
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:41,490
of me.

307
00:13:54,104 --> 00:13:57,105
Zeke! Who did this?

308
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:59,808
Same people who did that to Courtney.

309
00:14:03,113 --> 00:14:05,180
What the hell happened?

310
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:13,650
Hi. Excuse me.

311
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,316
Um, do you know about
a tarot-card reader

312
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:18,218
here about three years ago?

313
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,587
Sorry, I don't do missing persons.

314
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,723
Okay, then can you tell us about this?

315
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:29,830
It's a Star Card from the Major Arcana.

316
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:32,533
Corresponding to
Aquarius and Air Elements.

317
00:14:32,535 --> 00:14:34,902
Okay, uh, but can you tell us

318
00:14:34,904 --> 00:14:36,837
the deck where that card came from?

319
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,575
Yeah. I know this deck.

320
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:43,377
Uh...

321
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,547
It's called the Alzeraz deck, I think.

322
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:47,714
Stunning artwork.

323
00:14:47,716 --> 00:14:49,483
Alzeraz. Okay, that's something.

324
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:52,819
- Okay, there's nothing on Amazon or eBay.
- Oh, no, no, no.

325
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:55,456
This deck has been out
of print for decades.

326
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,826
I do know a few places in New York

327
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:01,995
that sell rare and out-of-print things,

328
00:15:01,997 --> 00:15:04,265
if you have some time to dig around.

329
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:13,674
So, this has something to
do with Finn's childhood?

330
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:16,243
Young Finn shows up in a
Calling and asks for help?

331
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:17,445
No, that can't be right.

332
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:20,714
Let me, um, see his photo again.

333
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:22,249
Here.

334
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:23,884
Maybe it's not the same kid.

335
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:26,386
Just a strong family resemblance.

336
00:15:26,388 --> 00:15:28,689
He said he didn't have any kids.

337
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,031
Unless...

338
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,990
Finn said he had a one-night stand

339
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:36,313
the night before he left Jamaica.

340
00:15:36,888 --> 00:15:39,312
And the kid would be 5,
which seems about the same age

341
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,400
as the kid that we saw in the Calling.

342
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:42,502
What do you know about
the one-night stand?

343
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:44,690
Oh, not much. He remembered her name.

344
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:47,908
It was, um, Orlena from New York.

345
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,345
And we also know a due date...
40 weeks after April 7, 2013.

346
00:15:52,347 --> 00:15:53,731
If we try to find all the...

347
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:54,949
There were only three Orlenas

348
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:57,184
that gave birth that year in New York...

349
00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:59,019
two in the spring and...

350
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:04,324
Orlena Prager that gave birth
to a baby boy November 30, 2013.

351
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:05,426
Named him Theo.

352
00:16:08,397 --> 00:16:10,097
Surprised?

353
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:12,499
Impressed.

354
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:15,623
So, what does Theo need from us?

355
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,891
I don't know. Let's go talk to Orlena.

356
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:22,709
I'm sorry.

357
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:24,711
I didn't come here just to get sober.

358
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:26,380
I came here because I thought Lucas

359
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:27,847
wouldn't be able to find me.

360
00:16:27,849 --> 00:16:29,049
Who's Lucas?

361
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:30,417
He's a dealer.

362
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:31,818
I owe him money.

363
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,855
I thought I could pay
it back little by little.

364
00:16:34,857 --> 00:16:35,989
How much?

365
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,491
$20,000.

366
00:16:38,493 --> 00:16:39,760
Jesus, Court!

367
00:16:39,762 --> 00:16:40,861
I know.

368
00:16:40,863 --> 00:16:42,996
I didn't think he'd be
able to find me here,

369
00:16:42,998 --> 00:16:44,431
but his guys followed me.

370
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:47,434
They were just passing along a message.

371
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:49,169
Which was what?

372
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:50,671
That I work for Lucas now.

373
00:16:50,673 --> 00:16:52,839
No way. Absolutely not.

374
00:16:52,841 --> 00:16:53,907
Really?

375
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:56,043
Do you have an extra
20K just lying around?

376
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:57,177
Because I don't.

377
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:58,779
I'm stuck.

378
00:16:58,781 --> 00:17:01,848
If I don't go work for Lucas,
he's gonna have me killed.

379
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:07,253
Hey. Are you sure you're okay?

380
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:08,555
Yeah.

381
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:09,923
I should have come without you.

382
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:11,410
We both had the Callings.

383
00:17:11,412 --> 00:17:14,060
We're supposed to do it together.

384
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:16,896
I hope we're right about this.

385
00:17:23,438 --> 00:17:25,605
Hi. I'm Saanvi Bahl.

386
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:28,407
- This is Ben Stone.
- Hi.

387
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:31,377
We wanted to talk to
you about your son Theo.

388
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:35,114
We're hoping we can help in some way.

389
00:17:35,116 --> 00:17:36,549
In what way?

390
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:38,350
We're not exactly sure.

391
00:17:38,352 --> 00:17:40,419
Do you remember Finn Nowak?

392
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:42,054
Come on, kids. Grab some groceries.

393
00:17:42,056 --> 00:17:43,488
You should go.

394
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,491
Let's see who brings the
bag with the special treat.

395
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:50,171
Please, I-I have nothing to say.

396
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:52,863
Mrs. Prager, we know that you had a son

397
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:54,654
less than a year after
you took a trip to Jamaica.

398
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,968
Those are my three children.

399
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,526
And that man is my husband of 10
years, and he's their father.

400
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:03,108
And he's a good father. Please, just go.

401
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:06,745
Now what do we do?

402
00:18:06,747 --> 00:18:10,849
I don't know, but the
husband's not Theo's father.

403
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:13,718
Still, I don't get the
Calling. Theo looks fine.

404
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,888
I saw terror in that
child's eyes on the plane.

405
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,989
We have to help him.

406
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:28,733
Okay, this is something.

407
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,670
- Tell me what you got.
- It's not Alzeraz.

408
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:36,475
It's the "Al-Zuras Deck",
created by Yusuv Al-Zuras,

409
00:18:36,477 --> 00:18:40,178
a 16th-century Egyptian
scholar and artist.

410
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,913
Yusuv Al-Zuras.

411
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:44,815
Scholar, traveled around Europe.

412
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:49,253
Whoa.

413
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:50,988
What?

414
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,266
Uh, according to legend, he
was lost at sea for 10 years

415
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:57,028
and mysteriously returned.

416
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,930
Really?

417
00:18:58,932 --> 00:19:01,699
That sounds... familiar.

418
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:05,870
Yeah. "Upon returning,
he claimed he could"...

419
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,505
What?

420
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:11,508
What is it?

421
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,044
"Upon returning, he claimed

422
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:15,546
he could hear the voice
of God in his head".

423
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:19,149
Does this mean it's happened before?

424
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:22,258
I don't know.

425
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,050
Okay, it doesn't say when he died,

426
00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:26,857
but I'm assuming it's 10
years after he returned?

427
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:29,507
Which means the Calling
led us to Al-Zuras

428
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,051
to show that the Death Date was real.

429
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:34,879
Okay, well, we have no
idea when this guy died.

430
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:39,502
For... For all we know, he could
have lived another 30 years.

431
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:42,398
Hey, maybe the Calling
led us to this guy

432
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,875
because he survived the Death Date.

433
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:46,109
Yeah.

434
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:48,445
You know what you need?

435
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:50,847
A tarot reading.

436
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,919
Oh.

437
00:19:55,921 --> 00:20:00,890
This... See the man in the jeggings?

438
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:02,191
It's Emo Drake.

439
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:08,520
And he's doing a slow
jam with a mandolin.

440
00:20:08,522 --> 00:20:10,363
And if I'm reading the cards right,

441
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:12,401
they say it's your
favorite kind of music.

442
00:20:12,403 --> 00:20:14,103
Yeah, but it is...

443
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:15,872
- Mm.
- ... not.

444
00:20:15,874 --> 00:20:19,042
And I'm pretty sure that's a lute.

445
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,546
Uh, now, you see this card.

446
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:26,238
This is a glowing path,

447
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,848
illuminating the way to true love.

448
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,557
Yeah, that just looks so much
like a volcano and some lava.

449
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,792
But whatever you say.

450
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:39,862
What about the third card?

451
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:47,437
The heart and the crown?

452
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:49,172
It's a strawberry.

453
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:52,972
And that is a fancy pie pan.

454
00:20:52,974 --> 00:20:54,379
Mm-hmm.

455
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:56,174
Which means you're gonna have

456
00:20:56,176 --> 00:20:59,246
a very fancy strawberry
pie in your future.

457
00:20:59,248 --> 00:21:03,541
You, sir, have a bright, shining,

458
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:07,589
and, uh, very lucky future.

459
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:09,391
Yeah.

460
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,826
You're right.

461
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:13,328
I am lucky.

462
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:19,000
Thanks.

463
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:22,384
I don't get you.

464
00:21:22,386 --> 00:21:26,355
How many women would let
their boyfriend's junkie ex

465
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:28,610
stay with them?

466
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:32,114
I'm a big believer in second chances.

467
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:33,848
Zeke said that,

468
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:36,603
that you were the biggest
part of his recovery.

469
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:39,451
No, no, Zeke wanted to
get sober on his own.

470
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:41,589
- It had nothing to do with me.
- I don't know.

471
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:45,168
I've seen Zeke try to
get clean plenty of times.

472
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,728
We'd swear we were gonna stop using,

473
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,564
but he always had a backup plan.

474
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:53,894
He'd stash a couple
pills in a sock drawer,

475
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:58,506
the barrel of his razor, dryer sheets.

476
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:02,910
But with you, he seems
pretty determined.

477
00:22:02,912 --> 00:22:09,016
We all have a limited time on Earth.

478
00:22:09,018 --> 00:22:12,887
And I think that he's just
trying to live an honest life.

479
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:18,590
Is it okay if I take a shower?

480
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:21,524
I need to get the feeling
of their hands off me.

481
00:22:21,526 --> 00:22:23,264
Of course. Yeah.

482
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:25,512
Okay, cool, man.

483
00:22:25,514 --> 00:22:26,788
Yeah, yeah. No, I'll see you.

484
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,701
Okay, I'll be there soon. Alright. Bye.

485
00:22:28,703 --> 00:22:29,976
Who was that?

486
00:22:29,978 --> 00:22:32,503
Lucas. I'm going to deal with this.

487
00:22:32,505 --> 00:22:33,859
Zeke, no.

488
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:36,429
Part of making amends is
not endangering yourself.

489
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:38,779
How do you know she's not just
gonna buy from someone else?

490
00:22:38,781 --> 00:22:40,260
I don't.

491
00:22:40,262 --> 00:22:42,318
But I do know I turned
my back on my sister

492
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,517
when she needed me the most.

493
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,087
I won't do that again.

494
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:59,765
I'm coming with you.

495
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:01,922
I'm the one who needs
to make amends, not you.

496
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:04,605
- I'm keeping you out of this.
- It's not up to you.

497
00:23:04,607 --> 00:23:07,363
We're supposed to do this together.

498
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:08,620
You had a Calling.

499
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:09,810
Snowflakes.

500
00:23:09,812 --> 00:23:12,546
Just like right before we found you.

501
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:14,048
Old-school.

502
00:23:15,384 --> 00:23:18,185
Lucas is a really scary guy, Mick.

503
00:23:18,187 --> 00:23:19,920
Yeah, and I'm a cop.

504
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:28,902
Once Lucas takes the
money and we get the pills,

505
00:23:28,904 --> 00:23:30,237
I'll signal you, okay?

506
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:31,972
You sure you don't want to requisition

507
00:23:31,974 --> 00:23:33,677
some high-tech gear from one room over?

508
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,736
I mean, this is basically
a Dixie cup on a string.

509
00:23:35,738 --> 00:23:37,978
I still think there's a leak.
I don't want to risk it.

510
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,647
Alright. Got it.

511
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:44,517
Dixie cups it is.

512
00:23:46,355 --> 00:23:48,021
I have a son.

513
00:23:48,023 --> 00:23:50,557
A son.

514
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,659
I just...

515
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:54,661
I've missed five birthdays.

516
00:23:54,663 --> 00:23:55,796
It's not your fault.

517
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:57,864
I have to make it up to him.

518
00:23:57,866 --> 00:24:00,467
No, I want to. I'm his father.

519
00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:05,405
Actually, when you
met Orlena, she was...

520
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:07,607
she was married.

521
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:10,643
I never would have...

522
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:12,769
That wasn't your fault,
either. You didn't know.

523
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:16,291
And the guy has no idea
that Theo isn't his?

524
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:17,484
It seems that way.

525
00:24:17,486 --> 00:24:20,854
Orlena was pretty clear that her husband

526
00:24:20,856 --> 00:24:23,389
is a very involved, very loving father.

527
00:24:25,427 --> 00:24:27,761
But I can insist on visits, right?

528
00:24:27,763 --> 00:24:29,529
Legally, yes.

529
00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:34,467
But you'd be risking
blowing up a happy family.

530
00:24:34,469 --> 00:24:37,036
I don't want to do that.

531
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:39,839
But I should get to meet Theo.

532
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:42,207
Just once.

533
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:45,545
Do you think you can make that happen?

534
00:24:45,547 --> 00:24:47,012
Are you sure?

535
00:24:47,014 --> 00:24:51,083
Because as a father, I have to say...

536
00:24:51,085 --> 00:24:54,186
I think it'd be harder to
walk away than you think.

537
00:24:57,425 --> 00:24:58,658
Okay, we'll try.

538
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,093
I mean, we have to try.

539
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:03,066
The Callings were clear.
Theo needs our help.

540
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,535
And maybe that means
he needs your help, too.

541
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:10,291
Hey, Zeke! it's been forever!

542
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:11,703
So, where you been hiding?

543
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:13,739
Uh, in a cave.

544
00:25:13,741 --> 00:25:15,852
I believe it.

545
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:18,009
Well, the parties haven't
been the same without you.

546
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:19,678
I'm sorry. Where are my manners?

547
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,979
- I'm Lucas.
- Ella.

548
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:22,714
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

549
00:25:22,716 --> 00:25:24,450
Sit down, Ella.

550
00:25:26,053 --> 00:25:28,687
♪ Pour it down his throat ♪

551
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:30,589
So, you spoke to Courtney.

552
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:34,025
Yeah. She says she's in
bad with you right now.

553
00:25:34,027 --> 00:25:37,563
- Are you surprised?
- No.

554
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:41,316
I'll buy at over market value,
sell half, give you a cut,

555
00:25:41,318 --> 00:25:43,341
repay Courtney's debt within a week.

556
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:48,506
That girl still has got you
under her spell, doesn't she?

557
00:25:48,508 --> 00:25:49,874
♪ ... and an inhaler ♪

558
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:52,156
- No offense.
- None taken.

559
00:25:52,158 --> 00:25:54,483
Those two were crazy.

560
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:56,474
I mean, Court was off the hook.

561
00:25:56,476 --> 00:25:58,750
That girl liked to party.

562
00:25:58,752 --> 00:26:00,485
What about you, Ella?

563
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:02,554
You like to party?

564
00:26:02,556 --> 00:26:04,856
Well, I'm not just
here for the '90s decor.

565
00:26:04,858 --> 00:26:07,058
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

566
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,928
See, I know Zeke, and I trust him.

567
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,564
But I don't know you.

568
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:16,734
So, let's consider this...

569
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:18,836
sort of a trust exercise.

570
00:26:24,143 --> 00:26:26,310
What are you talking about?

571
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:29,880
She's gonna need to shoot
up before anything goes down.

572
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:34,351
♪ Ain't gonna wait for tomorrow ♪

573
00:26:34,353 --> 00:26:37,321
♪ You know you never should ♪

574
00:26:38,825 --> 00:26:41,992
Do you think any of this has
to do with the Death Date?

575
00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:43,730
Why would you say that?

576
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:45,005
I don't know.

577
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:46,770
'Cause it's better than thinking

578
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,466
the Callings are just toying with us.

579
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:51,802
I think we're supposed
to just help Theo.

580
00:26:51,804 --> 00:26:53,470
How's this help him?

581
00:26:53,472 --> 00:26:56,873
I mean, Finn sees him once, then what?

582
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,342
I don't know.

583
00:26:59,845 --> 00:27:01,345
Hey.

584
00:27:01,347 --> 00:27:03,347
Is she here?

585
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:11,288
My God, you look exactly the same.

586
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:14,608
It's just this one meeting, right?

587
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,328
Then I'll leave, if
that's what Theo needs.

588
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,394
It is.

589
00:27:18,396 --> 00:27:21,364
Theo. Theo, come here for a sec.

590
00:27:22,868 --> 00:27:24,635
I want you to meet some friends.

591
00:27:24,637 --> 00:27:28,472
This is Ben and Saanvi,
and this is Finn.

592
00:27:28,474 --> 00:27:30,474
- Hi.
- Hi.

593
00:27:30,476 --> 00:27:34,044
It's so nice to meet you.

594
00:27:34,046 --> 00:27:35,979
I like your rock.

595
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:39,015
It's not a rock. It's a very still frog.

596
00:27:39,017 --> 00:27:42,185
It's very still.

597
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:44,488
Can I tell you a secret?

598
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,555
Sure.

599
00:27:45,557 --> 00:27:47,805
It's actually a rock.

600
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:50,663
Can we go in there to
see the dinosaurs, please?

601
00:27:50,665 --> 00:27:51,962
Yes, we can. In a minute.

602
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:53,863
- Okay.
- Bye.

603
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:00,971
Has Theo always had dark eyes?

604
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,639
No yellow circles?

605
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:05,608
Nope. He has my eyes.

606
00:28:06,312 --> 00:28:08,145
Hey, you okay, chiquito?

607
00:28:08,147 --> 00:28:09,446
I'm fine.

608
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:13,621
He's... He's been tired lately.

609
00:28:13,623 --> 00:28:15,635
- We should go.
- Wait. Already?

610
00:28:15,637 --> 00:28:17,988
But... I barely...

611
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:22,318
Look, maybe I could just
be his friend, you know?

612
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,853
Send some gifts or something, money?

613
00:28:24,855 --> 00:28:26,730
I don't need anything,
and neither does Theo.

614
00:28:26,732 --> 00:28:29,132
Hey, guys. You ready to go, huh?

615
00:28:29,134 --> 00:28:31,468
Did you fall too hard?

616
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,236
Did you fall pretty hard?

617
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:34,801
Theo's having motor issues.

618
00:28:34,803 --> 00:28:36,489
And in the Callings,
his eyes were different.

619
00:28:36,491 --> 00:28:37,877
They had distinctive yellow rings,

620
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:40,009
which is a sign of liver disease.

621
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:42,078
And you don't get that
until you're crashing.

622
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,548
That's what the Calling
wanted us to figure out.

623
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:48,081
Has he seemed disoriented lately?

624
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,809
Has he fallen asleep at odd times?

625
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,003
- How'd you know that?
- Orlena, listen to me.

626
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:54,323
I am a doctor, and we need
to get Theo to a hospital.

627
00:28:56,327 --> 00:28:57,359
Now.

628
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,923
She's not a needle girl.

629
00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:07,915
Too uptight. Pills only.

630
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:09,338
But I'm happy to take it.

631
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:15,878
Are you kidding me?

632
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,681
I'm too uptight?

633
00:29:18,683 --> 00:29:21,050
Courtney wasn't too uptight, right?

634
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:22,971
Courtney, who apparently
still has you under her spell?

635
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:25,025
Look, I told you we
should've gone to Colorado.

636
00:29:25,027 --> 00:29:26,683
- This guy sucks.
- What did you say to me?

637
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:27,763
Alright, back off.

638
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,658
This guy and I have been
through a lot together.

639
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,940
Plus his prices are way better.

640
00:29:30,942 --> 00:29:32,282
No, we're paying over market value

641
00:29:32,284 --> 00:29:33,813
'cause your ex is a junkie!

642
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,197
At least she was fun to be around!

643
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:37,300
Whoa!

644
00:29:37,302 --> 00:29:38,467
Okay.

645
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:41,237
Duncan.

646
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:43,755
Let's finish this transaction,

647
00:29:43,757 --> 00:29:46,724
then you two can take
your drama and go away.

648
00:29:54,154 --> 00:29:55,444
I know you.

649
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:57,780
No, I don't think so.

650
00:29:58,556 --> 00:30:01,023
Nah, y-you're an 828er.

651
00:30:03,027 --> 00:30:04,393
And you're a cop.

652
00:30:12,034 --> 00:30:15,168
You know, I gotta say,
Zeke, I'm disappointed.

653
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,800
And I hope you know this means
I'm revoking your VIP status.

654
00:30:18,802 --> 00:30:19,963
It's okay.

655
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:22,222
I don't like hanging out with
with guys who beat up women.

656
00:30:22,224 --> 00:30:25,182
I don't beat up women.

657
00:30:25,184 --> 00:30:27,217
I get my guys to do that.

658
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:33,123
But in this case, I might
make an exception.

659
00:30:37,362 --> 00:30:38,795
Hey!

660
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:43,834
NYPD. Weapons down.

661
00:30:47,961 --> 00:30:49,216
You're a dead man.

662
00:30:49,218 --> 00:30:50,684
Yeah. I already know that.

663
00:30:50,686 --> 00:30:51,752
Come on.

664
00:30:53,907 --> 00:30:56,064
Dr. Bahl, heard you had an amazing catch

665
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:57,598
with this pediatric liver case.

666
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,834
He's not out of the woods
yet. He needs a transplant.

667
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:02,904
We are still waiting to see
if his parents are a match.

668
00:31:02,906 --> 00:31:04,576
Well, it's rare that this disorder

669
00:31:04,578 --> 00:31:06,373
shows up in someone his age.

670
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,742
He's lucky you caught it.

671
00:31:07,744 --> 00:31:10,078
Saanvi?

672
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,412
How'd it go?

673
00:31:11,414 --> 00:31:13,181
I'm not a match.

674
00:31:13,183 --> 00:31:17,218
They said they'd put him on a
list, but that could take weeks.

675
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,888
Then they started talking
about his odds, and I...

676
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,886
We need to ask Finn.

677
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:25,788
Okay, he has as much of a
chance of matching as you did.

678
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,124
I know. I will.

679
00:31:28,126 --> 00:31:32,028
I just can't imagine
how, after the way...

680
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,997
Actually, you might not have to.

681
00:31:44,275 --> 00:31:47,109
They say I'm a perfect match.

682
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:50,946
And you'll... ?

683
00:31:50,948 --> 00:31:53,909
I told you I wanted to
give something to my son.

684
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,117
Now I can.

685
00:31:58,335 --> 00:31:59,991
Part of my liver.

686
00:31:59,993 --> 00:32:02,526
I didn't need the whole thing anyway.

687
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,396
Don't worry.

688
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:08,699
It'll be an anonymous donation.

689
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:11,168
You don't have to change
your life or Theo's.

690
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,470
No.

691
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,172
You're saving his life.

692
00:32:15,174 --> 00:32:17,575
You deserve to be part of it.

693
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:27,017
Thank you for convincing him.

694
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:28,786
I didn't need to.

695
00:32:28,788 --> 00:32:31,155
Finn agreed right away.

696
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,157
He's a good guy.

697
00:32:36,295 --> 00:32:39,530
Nice shot. I got winner.

698
00:32:39,532 --> 00:32:43,325
Eh... I don't know.

699
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:45,561
I've done a little digging.

700
00:32:49,742 --> 00:32:52,709
What are you talking about?

701
00:32:52,711 --> 00:32:57,648
Turns out you were engaged to an 828er.

702
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,683
Michaela Stone?

703
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:02,080
I'm onto you.

704
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:03,938
Don't come back here.

705
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,074
Stay away from Tamara, too.

706
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:21,588
Alright. You want to know about me?

707
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:24,891
How I ended up here?

708
00:33:24,893 --> 00:33:26,560
I'm happy to share.

709
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:30,512
You're right.

710
00:33:31,615 --> 00:33:34,449
I do know Michaela Stone.

711
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:38,520
And, yeah, yeah,
we were gonna get married.

712
00:33:38,522 --> 00:33:40,655
Then she went to Jamaica.

713
00:33:40,657 --> 00:33:43,725
I swear to God she died on that plane.

714
00:33:43,727 --> 00:33:47,261
Because 5 and a half years
later, whoever came back,

715
00:33:47,263 --> 00:33:52,433
hell, whatever came back,
see, that wasn't her.

716
00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:55,790
This person destroyed my marriage,

717
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:58,426
and then she threw me
under the bus in open court

718
00:33:58,428 --> 00:34:01,552
to protect some drug
addict she barely knows.

719
00:34:01,554 --> 00:34:06,758
Which destroyed everything
that I have worked for.

720
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,427
Yeah, Billy, you want
to know why I'm here?

721
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:13,898
It's because Michaela
Stone destroyed my life.

722
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,700
My entire life.

723
00:34:24,794 --> 00:34:27,628
Well, then let's get another round.

724
00:34:43,863 --> 00:34:45,963
This changes everything.

725
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:49,921
I mean, the possibility that
all of this has happened before,

726
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:51,401
it's...

727
00:34:51,403 --> 00:34:53,470
it's huge.

728
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:58,908
I am so impressed that you and
TJ managed to track it all down.

729
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,845
So...

730
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,145
TJ just said he figured
something else out

731
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,386
about the tarot, so...

732
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:12,521
can I go meet him?

733
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:17,869
Dad, if you're worried that
I'm gonna go to the church

734
00:35:17,871 --> 00:35:22,545
and poison my
impressionable mind, I'm not.

735
00:35:22,547 --> 00:35:24,303
Okay?

736
00:35:24,305 --> 00:35:27,040
Please understand me.

737
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:29,541
You know us. Other people don't.

738
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:33,846
They listen to Adrian calling us
immortals, that we're miracles,

739
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:37,082
but what they hear is we're not human.

740
00:35:37,084 --> 00:35:39,418
And that's incredibly
dangerous for all of us.

741
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,256
I know, okay? You've
made that very clear.

742
00:35:44,258 --> 00:35:46,291
Can I go now?

743
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:53,899
Yes.

744
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:57,378
Don't worry.

745
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,736
You can track my phone.

746
00:35:59,738 --> 00:36:02,941
Oh, I am. And I'm tracking his, too.

747
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:04,843
You're the worst.

748
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:05,944
Love you.

749
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:12,550
Courtney?

750
00:36:15,722 --> 00:36:17,712
- She's gone.
- How do you know?

751
00:36:17,714 --> 00:36:18,924
'Cause that's what Courtney does...

752
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,626
upends your life and then disappears.

753
00:36:20,628 --> 00:36:23,828
Except maybe it's okay
because it looks like

754
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:27,592
she decided to "move into sober house".

755
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:30,194
Do you think she actually went?

756
00:36:30,196 --> 00:36:32,364
It's up to her.

757
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:35,032
But I've made my amends.

758
00:36:35,034 --> 00:36:37,702
I can't live her life for her.

759
00:36:37,704 --> 00:36:39,637
I can only live mine.

760
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:44,275
And I really like this life.

761
00:36:58,691 --> 00:37:00,992
I was thinking maybe...

762
00:37:00,994 --> 00:37:03,494
maybe we should do the story.

763
00:37:03,496 --> 00:37:09,161
Grace, I thought we agreed to
keep the pregnancy to ourselves?

764
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:10,962
I mean, if the Xers found out, it...

765
00:37:10,964 --> 00:37:13,631
That's what I've been thinking about.

766
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:16,834
But then you told me about Orlena.

767
00:37:16,836 --> 00:37:19,371
What does she have to do with this?

768
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:25,548
For five years, she convinced
people that her son Theo

769
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,080
was her husband's and not a passenger's.

770
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:31,049
And so that got me thinking
maybe we could convince people

771
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:34,785
that our baby girl is not an 828 baby.

772
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:39,257
I-I'm sorry. W-What are you saying?

773
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:41,492
We could...

774
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:44,028
We could tell people she's Danny's.

775
00:37:46,899 --> 00:37:50,601
- What?
- I'm sure Danny would go along with it.

776
00:37:52,094 --> 00:37:55,362
Two different Callings have warned us

777
00:37:55,364 --> 00:37:58,532
that the baby might be in danger.

778
00:37:58,534 --> 00:38:00,300
I'm scared.

779
00:38:00,302 --> 00:38:02,936
I am, too.

780
00:38:02,938 --> 00:38:05,572
I'm terrified.

781
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,836
It was just an idea. I'm sorry.

782
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:09,843
I will protect our baby.

783
00:38:09,845 --> 00:38:11,678
We both will.

784
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,247
Together.

785
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,587
There you are.

786
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,023
Are you okay?

787
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:25,526
You were right.

788
00:38:25,528 --> 00:38:27,461
The tarot.

789
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:31,231
What are you talking about?

790
00:38:31,233 --> 00:38:33,099
The illuminated path.

791
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,604
Just like the card said.

792
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:43,343
It's glowing lava.

793
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:46,589
Well, they're LEDs.

794
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:50,084
The tarot was a little concerned
about burning down Central Park.

795
00:38:50,086 --> 00:38:52,843
But as it turns out,
just like Emo Drake here,

796
00:38:52,845 --> 00:38:55,932
I, too, am kind of a
fan of mandolin music.

797
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:57,100
Oh?

798
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:59,569
Are you sure that's not a lute?

799
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:01,371
I'm not.

800
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:04,674
But, look, the final card.

801
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:14,684
It's a fancy strawberry pie.

802
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,219
The tarot could have been
a little bit more specific

803
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,956
on the difference between
baking soda and powder.

804
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,624
But it's what we got.

805
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:28,989
Well... it's perfect.

806
00:39:56,485 --> 00:39:58,377
Theoretically, the genetic anomaly

807
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:01,970
could transfer to Finn's son
by way of the organ transplant,

808
00:40:01,972 --> 00:40:04,124
meaning we may have just saved this kid

809
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:05,892
and cursed him at the same time.

810
00:40:09,232 --> 00:40:12,333
Ben, if you find this,
I know I promised,

811
00:40:12,335 --> 00:40:14,901
but I also know that
there was no other way.

812
00:40:14,903 --> 00:40:16,270
I have to test on myself.

813
00:40:16,272 --> 00:40:18,572
I have to save the passengers.

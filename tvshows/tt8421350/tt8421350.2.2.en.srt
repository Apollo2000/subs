1
00:00:02,907 --> 00:00:04,930
Previously on "Manifest"...

2
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:06,655
Save the passengers.

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,779
I'm pregnant.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,647
I just thought this would
be something special

5
00:00:09,648 --> 00:00:10,705
to bring us all together

6
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:12,876
when everything else is so scary.

7
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:15,044
NSA, drop your weapon!

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:19,783
Somebody help me!

9
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:21,518
You're Dr. Saanvi Bahl, right?

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,109
- I'm sorry. And you are... ?
- Troy Davis.

11
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,767
Oncology lab tech.

12
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:26,756
I have an appointment...
with a therapist.

13
00:00:26,757 --> 00:00:29,391
Michaela and I, we're
meant to be together.

14
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:32,862
Back off!

15
00:00:32,863 --> 00:00:34,729
Where's Zeke?

16
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,064
NYPD's looking for him.

17
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:38,625
I'm here to ask you
to call off the hunt.

18
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:40,327
- It was an accident.
- You got shot,

19
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:41,751
and your new boyfriend ran off.

20
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:43,379
The Callings said you
guys are gonna die!

21
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,870
You need to be with Michaela.

22
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:46,859
She doesn't have much
time. And neither do you.

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,340
He's never gonna know
about his Death Date.

24
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:49,431
He's innocent.

25
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:50,722
We have to make it possible
for him to come home.

26
00:00:50,723 --> 00:00:52,013
I didn't mean to hurt you, and I did.

27
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:53,771
What happens the next
time I get a Calling?

28
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:55,996
This is what I need to
do... own up to my actions.

29
00:00:55,997 --> 00:00:57,554
Zeke turned himself in.

30
00:00:57,555 --> 00:01:00,213
He knows he's guilty.

31
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:03,215
You're not the only one who
can come back from the dead.

32

33
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,662
We got to clear the airway.
Let's get him onto an I.V.

34
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,130
Please step back, ma'am.

35
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:28,270
Excuse me, is that... Is
that Vance? How bad is it?

36
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:30,739
Can you just tell me
how bad it is, please?

37
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:43,894
You okay, sir?

38
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,531
My arm hurts like hell, but I'll live,

39
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:49,065
thanks to you pulling me out of there.

40
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,467
Sir, we need to get you to a hospital.

41
00:01:50,468 --> 00:01:53,633
No, people inside our own government

42
00:01:53,634 --> 00:01:54,935
were willing to kill me.

43
00:01:54,936 --> 00:01:56,159
If I'm gonna take them down,

44
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,984
I want them to think they succeeded.

45
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:01,358
You know the drill.

46
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,284
The world needs to think I'm dead.

47
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:05,608
Well, I was convinced.

48
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:07,400
The whole world was.

49
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:09,025
You would have loved your funeral...

50
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:10,416
- Bobby.
- Hmm.

51
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:13,575
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't
tell the truth to you...

52
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:15,248
well, both of you,

53
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:17,478
but no one knows except my guys,

54
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,114
my wife, and now the two of you.

55
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:22,216
You want to bring her
up to speed, or should I?

56
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:23,784
Well, I wasn't planning to see you

57
00:02:23,785 --> 00:02:26,354
until I knew who the Major
was, but your bloodhound brother

58
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,922
accelerated our little reunion.

59
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:29,957
Yeah, well, that's our Ben for you.

60
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:33,961
So far, I've identified a-a
black ops financial pipeline

61
00:02:33,962 --> 00:02:38,793
that appears to be funding
a shadow 828 investigation.

62
00:02:38,794 --> 00:02:40,895
Suffice it to say, I've
been following the money.

63
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:43,356
And in the past week,
that money has doubled.

64
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:45,366
Why? What's the Major planning?

65
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,042
Well, that's why I asked you here.

66
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:48,977
I was hoping one of you could tell me.

67
00:02:48,978 --> 00:02:53,511
A budget spike like that had
to be the response to something.

68
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:55,680
Did anything significant happen

69
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:57,315
to the 828 passengers this week?

70
00:02:57,316 --> 00:02:59,050
Hmm, not that we know of.

71
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:01,286
You want me to do some poking around?

72
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:02,987
Stone, the last time you poked around,

73
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:04,455
you ended up in the back of a van

74
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:05,580
with a hood over your head.

75
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:08,639
Right. Yeah. I'll leave
the espionage to you.

76
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,984
But I have been connecting with more

77
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:11,175
and more passengers every day.

78
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:14,144
In fact, I've got a meeting
in an hour with an 828er.

79
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,283
He's a freshman at Astoria.

80
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:18,808
He called me twice yesterday.

81
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:20,797
Seems like he's got
something to tell me.

82
00:03:20,798 --> 00:03:21,938
Good.

83
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:24,288
'Cause after all this is
over, I can stop being dead,

84
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:27,644
and I would really like you all to live.

85
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:29,212
And maybe we can get to the bottom

86
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:32,582
of where the hell you all
went for 5 and a half years.

87
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,648
- TJ.
- Hey.

88
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:52,816
Hey.

89
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:53,850
Thanks for meeting me on campus.

90
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:55,218
No problem.

91
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:57,538
I'd forgotten how quiet a campus gets

92
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,219
between sessions.

93
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,843
I used to be a professor.

94
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:03,126
You don't teach anymore?

95
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:04,895
No, I'm trying,

96
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:07,831
but with all the
attention and suspicion,

97
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:09,690
the opportunities
just haven't been there.

98
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:10,814
Yeah.

99
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:15,378
828 changed my life a lot.

100
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,313
Me too.

101
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:19,649
It changed everything for me.

102
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,717
I used to love it here.

103
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:23,085
Did well in my classes,

104
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:25,488
joined the cross country
team, the Latin club.

105
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:27,957
I was in it.

106
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,560
And my mom was proud...

107
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,029
which made me proud.

108
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,963
And then you went to Jamaica.

109
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:41,304
You know, this was probably a mistake.

110
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:42,885
I'm sorry that I bothered you.

111
00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:45,020
TJ.

112
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:47,723
Listen, you asked me here for a reason.

113
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:58,866
Is it because you're seeing things?

114
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:02,206
Hearing things, maybe?

115
00:05:02,207 --> 00:05:04,442
Both.

116
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:07,144
And they've gotten...

117
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:08,846
Hey, it's okay. You can
talk to me about this.

118
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:11,681
I-I get them, too. A lot of us do.

119
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:14,783
"Callings".

120
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:17,384
Sometimes they can be pretty terrifying.

121
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,472
Like seeing your own death?

122
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:24,574
Yeah.

123
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,509
Yeah, like that.

124
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,877
This morning, I had a vision

125
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:30,413
of being inside my own grave.

126
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,882
You think it's a Death Date Calling?

127
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:34,417
You still thinking

128
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,051
about the "save the passengers" Calling?

129
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,940
Yeah, me too.

130
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:41,609
It felt like the plane was crashing.

131
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,473
So maybe it's showing
us how we're gonna die?

132
00:05:45,474 --> 00:05:47,742
Um...

133
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:50,278
Well, your dad seems
to think that it's about

134
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,680
saving the passengers
before the Death Date.

135
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,985
It felt more urgent
than that, didn't it?

136
00:05:56,986 --> 00:05:59,220
I know. We have to talk to Zeke.

137
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:01,756
He was on the plane in our Calling,

138
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:03,692
even though he wasn't in real life.

139
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:05,538
- That means something.
- Yeah, I know.

140
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:07,162
Well, once he's out on
bail, we can talk to him.

141
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:10,589
- He had the same Calling, so...
- He didn't.

142
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,646
How do you know that?

143
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:14,311
In the Calling, he
couldn't hear us or see us,

144
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:16,046
and neither could anyone else.

145
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:17,337
We have to save him,

146
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:19,199
just like we have to save
the rest of the passengers.

147
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,523
Okay, I'm gonna try again

148
00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:23,787
to talk to him, alright?

149
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:25,122
Okay.

150
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:27,257
I'm gonna miss having you
live with us, Auntie Mick.

151
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:29,460
Well, I'm gonna miss
stealing your waffles, buddy,

152
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:31,862
but I got to go back to my apartment.

153
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:33,197
It's time.

154
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:45,755
Are you sure about this?

155
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:49,259
Once we know, we can't un-know.

156
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,530
It's gonna be okay, no matter what.

157
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,502
Paternity, right? Yeah.

158
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:02,872
So, we just need to get
a single vial of blood

159
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:04,374
and then I'll swab your cheek

160
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,865
and we'll send them both to the lab

161
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:08,424
and we should have results
back within one to two days.

162
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:09,648
Great.

163
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:12,517
- Are you afraid of needles?
- No.

164
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:18,265
Stop.

165
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:19,422
Who... ?

166
00:07:19,423 --> 00:07:21,247
You okay?

167
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:22,953
Um, uh...

168
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:25,578
Stop.

169
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,669
Grace?

170
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,694
Stop!

171
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,486
- Grace!
- I'm... I'm sorry, we have to go!

172
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:32,711
Wait, you... you... you...
you can't... you can't just...

173
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:33,778
We have to go.

174
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:35,591
Honey.

175
00:07:35,592 --> 00:07:38,750
Honey, are you okay? What just happened?

176
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,888
I just h-heard my own voice,

177
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:44,895
over and over,

178
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:47,831
telling me to stop.

179
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:49,632
Oh, my God.

180
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:54,203
You just had a Calling.

181
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,267

182
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,618
I don't understand.

183
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,587
How could I have a Calling?

184
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,955
It doesn't make any sense.

185
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,857
I wasn't... I wasn't on the plane.

186
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:15,600
But I was.

187
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:17,501
That still doesn't explain...

188
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:24,341
Oh, my God.

189
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:27,746
The pregnancy.

190
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:29,780
It's the only thing that makes sense.

191
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:34,058
So...

192
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:37,328
that would mean...

193
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:39,697
it's your baby.

194
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:41,265
It sure seems that way.

195
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:47,933
God, Ben, it's your baby.

196
00:08:55,893 --> 00:08:57,785
Come on.

197
00:08:57,786 --> 00:08:59,486
Let's get you home.

198
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:02,659
Come on.

199
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:09,485
That inmate is refusing visitors.

200
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:11,737
Ezekiel Landon?

201
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:12,871
Can you try again?

202
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:14,833
That inmate's refusing visitors.

203
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,091
Uh, does this help?

204
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:18,060
Sure, assuming the ADA sent you,

205
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:20,652
advised the inmate's lawyer,
and you have a case number.

206
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:22,035
No, I'm not officially on the case,

207
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:23,126
but I'm an interested party.

208
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:25,051
I'm a friend of his. You...

209
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:26,165
Next.

210
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,234
Thank you. Have a good day.

211
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,241
Wycoff and Holland, look
into the automobile theft

212
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,809
- at Clark Towing.
- I got it.

213
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,945
And, Raines, your warrants came through

214
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:41,848
on the 15th Avenue bust.

215
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:45,151
And of course, welcome, Detective Stone,

216
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,819
back from medical leave.

217
00:09:52,912 --> 00:09:55,682
Okay, let's get to it.

218
00:09:55,683 --> 00:09:56,916
Detective Stone. Hi.

219
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:58,107
- Hi.
- Drea Mikami.

220
00:09:58,108 --> 00:09:59,932
I just want to say it's
such an honor to meet you.

221
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,190
- Oh.
- Your conviction record

222
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:02,889
is almost too good to be true.

223
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,124
I was wondering, maybe,

224
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,458
if you had a second, we could sit down,

225
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:06,926
and I could pick your
brain about how you...

226
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:08,935
Um, Mikami, do you mind?

227
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:10,303
Uh, kind of. Yeah.

228
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:12,305
Detective Stone, I see
you've met your new partner,

229
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:13,940
Detective Mikami.

230
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:16,707
- Um...
- Hold on.

231
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,686
- Captain. Captain.
- Wow, this is... This is great.

232
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:21,913
- Yeah, give... one sec.
- Uh, Captain?

233
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,715
Detective Stone and I...
we used to be partners.

234
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:25,416
Yeah, and that
partnership triggered a lot

235
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,951
of internal investigations

236
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:28,820
and unwanted attention from One PP.

237
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:29,947
So now I'm in charge,

238
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:32,349
and Detective Stone has a new partner.

239
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,384
Don't start sleeping with this one.

240
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,313
Hey.

241
00:10:38,314 --> 00:10:40,182
You know this is not gonna work.

242
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:42,684
You need me to have your back here.

243
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:45,320
You know what? Actually, I think
I just need you to let this go.

244
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:47,222
Maybe it's for the best. Clean break.

245
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:54,663
Definitely need this nap.

246
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:57,399
I forgot how exhausting
it is to make a new human.

247
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,868
Well, I am a big fan of your work.

248
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,537
We should still confirm.

249
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:03,305
I'll go see Saanvi as soon as I'm up.

250
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,424
Hmm.

251
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:08,734
It's that kid TJ,

252
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,225
the one that had the Death Date Calling.

253
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:13,484
I was supposed to meet
him again tomorrow, but...

254
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:14,976
Yeah. Go.

255
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:16,467
Alright.

256
00:11:21,878 --> 00:11:23,745
TJ?

257
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:24,946
TJ?!

258
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:27,249
Ben?

259
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,640
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't want to call the police.

260
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:31,498
Alright, what is it? What happened?

261
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:33,199
It wasn't me I saw in the grave.

262
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,267
- What?
- It wasn't me.

263
00:11:37,537 --> 00:11:40,205
Oh, my God.

264
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:44,961
Oh my God, TJ, what happened?

265
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:45,985
I have no idea.

266
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:47,309
I was trying to follow the Calling,

267
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,711
to see if I could make
any more sense of it

268
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:49,912
after we talked this morning.

269
00:11:49,913 --> 00:11:52,047
A-And it brought you here?

270
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:54,883
And I just started digging.

271
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:57,151
God. What do I do?

272
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:02,324
Apparently, the Calling

273
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:04,059
only trusts you to take my blood.

274
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,562
This changes everything
I thought I knew.

275
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:09,865
Scientifically speaking,
Callings have now been

276
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:13,035
transferred genetically
through the baby.

277
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:17,141
So, if it is Ben's baby...

278
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:21,776
will the Death Date also transfer?

279
00:12:24,146 --> 00:12:27,449
We have no proof of that...

280
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,916
okay?

281
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:37,426
Detective Vasquez, 129th.

282
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:38,494
Catch me up.

283
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:41,663
You are looking at
late teens, early 20s.

284
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:43,032
Rigor is abating,

285
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:46,935
suggesting that she's been
dead at least 36 hours.

286
00:12:46,936 --> 00:12:50,239
Blunt force trauma and suffocation.

287
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,809
We found a student
key card in her pocket.

288
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,780
Campus security is going
to run it for an I.D.

289
00:12:57,781 --> 00:12:59,615
Thank you.

290
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:01,116
You're campus security, right?

291
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:03,238
I want to know every time
and place that key card

292
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:04,420
was used this week.

293
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:06,154
Copy.

294
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,479
Jared, I called 911.

295
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,688
How'd you get put on this?

296
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,346
Oh, I saw your name
as a reporting witness.

297
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:15,330
I thought I should
just come check it out.

298
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:17,566
Uh, this is TJ.

299
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,701
He was on 828, and he...

300
00:13:19,702 --> 00:13:22,071
found the body.

301
00:13:22,072 --> 00:13:25,140
Oh. How, exactly?

302
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:26,508
It's okay.

303
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,377
He'll understand.

304
00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:31,364
Well, I was walking, and,

305
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:33,248
I don't know, I just had a feeling.

306
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:36,151
So I started digging, and I found her.

307
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:39,621
I know how crazy that must sound.

308
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:41,290
Can I talk to you for a minute?

309
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:49,077
So, he's saying that a Calling

310
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,100
he had led him here,
and you believe him?

311
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:53,235
Yeah, how else could he
have found the girl's body?

312
00:13:53,236 --> 00:13:55,104
He could have found her
by putting her there.

313
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:57,688
Come on, Jared. You think he killed her?

314
00:13:57,689 --> 00:13:59,095
Look, I don't think anything, Ben.

315
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:00,809
I'm gathering the facts, okay?

316
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,743
That's my job.

317
00:14:11,156 --> 00:14:12,981
You're a better cop than a criminal.

318
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,105
Sorry, what?

319
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:15,897
You swiped that file off Vasquez's desk.

320
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,689
- Is that his court docket?
- Yep.

321
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,159
Are you and Vasquez
in some kind of detente

322
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,217
I need to know about?

323
00:14:22,218 --> 00:14:24,431
Uh, need to? No.

324
00:14:24,432 --> 00:14:26,700
- Got it.
- _

325
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:28,301
My last partner retired.

326
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:31,237
Aviera. Good guy, but super old-school.

327
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:34,307
How did Aviera feel about
being paired with a rich kid?

328
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:35,578
Where'd that come from?

329
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,113
That watch is three months' salary,

330
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:38,514
you say things like "detente",

331
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:40,812
and you have a photo on
your desk of a horse...

332
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:41,970
English saddle, not Western.

333
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:43,461
So, yeah, you're moneybags.

334
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:44,718
Okay, not me, exactly,

335
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,743
but my mom kind of
killed it on Wall Street.

336
00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:48,735
I'm guessing this isn't
quite the trajectory

337
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:49,962
she had in mind for you.

338
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:51,264
Being a cop?

339
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,266
No. But I love it.

340
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,657
And I want to learn from the best.

341
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:56,947
So maybe lesson one is why you
read arraignments so carefully?

342
00:14:56,948 --> 00:14:59,072
Lesson one is this.

343
00:14:59,073 --> 00:15:01,274
What is the foundation
of any good partnership?

344
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,508
- Trust.
- Great.

345
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:04,243
So, you can trust me not to tell anyone

346
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:05,411
about your Upper Eastside past.

347
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:08,281
Tribeca. Deal. What do I do?

348
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,149
Cover for me while I
deal with something.

349
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,284
Go. I'll return the contraband.

350
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,495
Oh, whoa.

351
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:25,097
Hey.

352
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:26,732
These are some serious books.

353
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:28,078
Yeah. SAT prep.

354
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,237
I'm starting to realize
exactly how much I don't know.

355
00:15:31,238 --> 00:15:33,472
Not all answers can be found in books.

356
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:35,206
Here. Hang on to this.

357
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,580
I love your jacket, by the way.

358
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:43,049
Olive?

359
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,185
Who was that?

360
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:48,754
I don't know.

361
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:51,023
Oh, no, honey.

362
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:52,391
We can't be talking to Believers.

363
00:15:52,392 --> 00:15:53,983
No, mom, she's super nice.

364
00:15:53,984 --> 00:15:55,628
- I dropped my book.
- Sweetie, we have to be really careful.

365
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:57,597
If they find out there's an 828 baby...

366
00:15:57,598 --> 00:15:59,598
If it is an 828 baby.

367
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:05,071
- It is.
- Wait. Wait.

368
00:16:05,072 --> 00:16:07,006
So, i-it is dad's baby?

369
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,621
- You took the paternity test.
- Yeah.

370
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:12,489
I mean, not exactly,
but, yeah, it's dad's.

371
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:15,314
Wait, what?

372
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:18,350
I'm... How do you know, then?

373
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:22,576
Um...

374
00:16:22,577 --> 00:16:24,101
I had a Calling.

375
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:26,692
What? Wait? How... How is that even... ?

376
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:27,760
I-I don't know.

377
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:30,429
Something to do with the pregnancy.

378
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,566
Sweetie, this is... this is great news.

379
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:36,568
We can all be one family,
just like we'd hoped.

380
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:40,973
Not really.

381
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:44,275
Now I'm the only one.

382
00:16:50,683 --> 00:16:53,119
Olive.

383
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,020
All rise.

384
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:09,147
Ezekiel Landon, you are charged

385
00:17:09,148 --> 00:17:10,333
with one count of reckless
endangerment of human life...

386
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:12,246
- Where's his lawyer?
- I have no idea.

387
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:14,586
He won't talk to me.

388
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:16,021
Yeah, me, neither.

389
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:17,655
I can't lose him again.

390
00:17:17,656 --> 00:17:19,724
What if I can't afford the bail?

391
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:21,059
We're gonna get the money.

392
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,695
One count of assault
in the first degree.

393
00:17:23,696 --> 00:17:26,231
And you wish to defend yourself?

394
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:28,665
I do. Can I make a statement?

395
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,934
Go ahead.

396
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:33,770
Your Honor, I've made a
lot of mistakes in my life,

397
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:37,841
and I've hurt people,
good, decent people

398
00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:41,645
whose only flaw was believing in me.

399
00:17:41,646 --> 00:17:45,515
I hurt my little sister, my parents,

400
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:48,418
and I hurt someone...

401
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:49,885
someone I never wanted to hurt.

402
00:17:54,683 --> 00:17:56,909
I don't want to spend the time

403
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,378
I have left fighting these charges

404
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:00,412
and dragging out the pain
for those I care about.

405
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,607
What are you doing? Stop.

406
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:03,009
As to the count of assault
in the first degree,

407
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,310
I plead guilty.

408
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:05,945
Zeke, stop! No, you can fight this!

409
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:08,014
- Your Honor, it was an accident.
- Order in the court!

410
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:09,882
Zeke, you can fight
this! It was an accident!

411
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:11,307
No! Zeke! No, no, no, Zeke!

412
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:13,065
As to the count of illegal
possession of a firearm...

413
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:14,648
- Zeke, stop!
- ... I plead guilty.

414
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:16,006
What are you doing? You can fight this.

415
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:17,130
- Ma'am, please.
- As to the count of fleeing

416
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:18,182
- the scene of a crime, I plead guilty.
- It was an accident.

417
00:18:18,183 --> 00:18:19,427
Your Honor, it was an accident.

418
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:20,518
None... None of it
was supposed to happen!

419
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:23,344
As to the count of reckless
endangerment of human life...

420
00:18:28,031 --> 00:18:29,798
... I plead guilty.

421
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:37,432
- Hey.
- Hey.

422
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,823
- How are you holding up?
- Yeah, I've been better.

423
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:44,494
I just can't believe
Zeke pled guilty to...

424
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:46,029
How's Grace?

425
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,330
Taking it easy.

426
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:50,637
She's still thrown by the
whole getting a Calling thing.

427
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:51,838
I can't wrap my head around that.

428
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,006
it doesn't make any sense.

429
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,287
I feel like we say that a lot.

430
00:18:54,288 --> 00:18:56,857
It's true.

431
00:18:56,858 --> 00:19:00,060
- Is that him?
- Mm-hmm.

432
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:03,021
Hi, I'm, uh, Michaela. You must be TJ.

433
00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:05,294
Hi. I hear Detective Vasquez

434
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:06,585
brought you in for a follow-up.

435
00:19:06,586 --> 00:19:08,193
Though he's kept us waiting long enough.

436
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:09,528
It's fine.

437
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:10,896
TJ's a glutton for punishment.

438
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:13,431
He's a cross-country
runner who studies Latin.

439
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:15,101
Ooh!

440
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:18,070
My office, Detective.

441
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:19,305
What's that about?

442
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:21,537
Um, probably my unscheduled appearance

443
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:23,709
at Zeke's arraignment.

444
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,913
You don't have to wait with me.

445
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:28,424
Yeah.

446
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:29,949
If you're here, I'm here.

447
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,810
The question is... do you want to stay?

448
00:19:34,811 --> 00:19:37,312
I want to see it through.

449
00:19:37,313 --> 00:19:39,748
I mean, there's got to be a reason

450
00:19:39,749 --> 00:19:41,617
why I got this Calling, right?

451
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:44,443
Why it was sent to me and
not you or your sister?

452
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:45,570
Yeah, maybe.

453
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:49,163
We still haven't figured
out exactly how it works.

454
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:50,753
Well, at least you have each other.

455
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:51,853
Hmm.

456
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,025
Just like me with my mom.

457
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:57,627
She was cool.

458
00:19:57,628 --> 00:20:00,062
More like a best friend, you know?

459
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:02,592
If your best friend constantly
makes you eat salmon

460
00:20:02,593 --> 00:20:05,301
and listen to Madonna.

461
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:08,137
Sounds like you guys were close.

462
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:09,838
Yeah.

463
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:13,776
What happened to her?

464
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:20,852
When the plane went missing, um,

465
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:26,221
she must have felt like she didn't
have anything left to live for.

466
00:20:28,457 --> 00:20:31,459
And she OD'd on sleeping
pills a month later.

467
00:20:34,964 --> 00:20:38,533
Oh, TJ, I'm so sorry.

468
00:20:42,204 --> 00:20:44,173
My mom died when we were gone, too.

469
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,617
While I was gone, the
school emptied my dorm room,

470
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:57,252
and my mom's landlord tossed her stuff.

471
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:02,425
So I don't have anything.

472
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:04,592
Not even a photo of her.

473
00:21:14,037 --> 00:21:17,139
Hi, excuse me. I need
access to a DNA Sequencer.

474
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,407
Dr. Bahl!

475
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:20,309
Troy Davis, remember?

476
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,942
- I tightened up the beard a little.
- Yes. Hi. Right.

477
00:21:22,943 --> 00:21:24,166
How are you doing? You know what?

478
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:26,048
I think I left my I.D. in my office.

479
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:27,316
Don't worry. I can vouch.

480
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:29,385
Y-You need a DNA Sequencer.

481
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:31,053
What do you need it for?

482
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:32,321
Anything interesting?

483
00:21:32,322 --> 00:21:33,422
I would love to help.

484
00:21:33,423 --> 00:21:37,193
Oh, it's just a theory
that I'm working up.

485
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:40,329
Is it about that blood marker?

486
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,733
From your pediatric patient?

487
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:45,767
I'll just put down "research".

488
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:50,879
And by the way, I would love to help.

489
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,141
Yeah, you mentioned that.

490
00:21:52,142 --> 00:21:54,067
Just, uh, have the machine delivered,

491
00:21:54,068 --> 00:21:56,278
and we can play the rest by ear.

492
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:58,313
Thank you.

I didn't realize I needed permission

504
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:23,906
to attend an arraignment.

505
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:24,997
Captain Riojas was...

506
00:22:24,998 --> 00:22:27,610
Let me tell you how
it works in my precinct.

507
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:29,178
We have rules.

508
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:31,447
And making a scene at your
own assailant's hearing

509
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:32,681
violated several of them.

510
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:33,983
He's not my assailant.

511
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,352
Not an assailant, not your boyfriend.

512
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:38,354
You keep correcting me, and we just met.

513
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:39,955
He shot a cop.

514
00:22:39,956 --> 00:22:41,424
That's confirmed by Detective Vasquez,

515
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:43,292
who witnessed it, and
by the defendant himself,

516
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:44,383
who pled guilty.

517
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:45,528
Right, but it's not that simple.

518
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:46,762
It's exactly that simple.

519
00:22:46,763 --> 00:22:48,330
It's a nice, simple, closed case.

520
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:50,900
The only one who's trying to
make it difficult here is you.

521
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:52,058
He didn't mean to.

522
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:54,503
Well, he sure as hell meant
to plead guilty, Detective.

523
00:22:54,504 --> 00:22:56,172
So drop it.

524
00:23:08,785 --> 00:23:10,197
Mick.

525
00:23:10,198 --> 00:23:13,022
You want to tell me why you've
been making that kid wait all day?

526
00:23:13,023 --> 00:23:15,009
Oh, you're referring to the
kid who swears he doesn't know

527
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,042
anything about a homicide victim
he just happened to dig up?

528
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:19,443
No, he doesn't, Jared. Ben told you.

529
00:23:19,444 --> 00:23:21,497
He... He had a Calling.

530
00:23:21,498 --> 00:23:22,696
TJ never met her.

531
00:23:22,697 --> 00:23:24,897
His fingerprints are all
over the victim's room.

532
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:30,005
- His prints were in her room?
- _

533
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:32,808
Okay, no, there's
an explanation for this.

534
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,275
Just because he was on that plane

535
00:23:34,276 --> 00:23:36,473
- does not mean he's not a murderer.
- Jared, you're doing it again,

536
00:23:36,474 --> 00:23:37,908
where you're looking
for the worst in people.

537
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:39,977
No, I'm looking for the evidence.

538
00:23:39,978 --> 00:23:41,812
He knew exactly where the body was.

539
00:23:41,813 --> 00:23:43,647
Okay, his fingerprints
were found all over a room

540
00:23:43,648 --> 00:23:45,048
of a victim he swore he never met.

541
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,249
You know the drill.

542
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,441
Mick, you know I got to do this.

543
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:50,200
No, actually, you...
Jared, come on, stop.

544
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:53,023
- Oh, my God.
- Finally.

545
00:23:53,024 --> 00:23:54,971
- Stand up and turn around, please.
- What?

546
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:56,808
- Stand up and turn around.
- Jared, what's going on?

547
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:58,185
You have the right to remain silent...

548
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,043
- Come on, Jared. What the hell?
- You said he'd understand!

549
00:24:00,044 --> 00:24:01,467
Listen to me, Ben. I didn't do it.

550
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:02,691
Please. I didn't do it. Please!

551
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,267
- Jared, he's innocent! Jared!
- Ben!

552
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:05,869
- Mick, you've got...
- I didn't do it!

553
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,171
Please, listen to me!
Do something, please!

554
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:09,739
Ben! Ben!

555
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:14,544
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

556
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,126
You feel that?

557
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:34,698
What the hell you talking about?

558
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,278
Get him out of here.

559
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,513
No, stop!

560
00:24:49,514 --> 00:24:51,213
Please let go! No!

561
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,982
Jared's still interrogating TJ.

562
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:02,950
It could take hours.

563
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:05,520
- Well, I'm not leaving.
- Okay.

564
00:25:05,521 --> 00:25:07,889
I told TJ I was here
for him, and I meant it.

565
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,781
Now, can we discuss what happened?

566
00:25:09,782 --> 00:25:12,107
I've never seen anyone shake
like that during a Calling.

567
00:25:12,108 --> 00:25:14,476
I know. It... It felt like turbulence,

568
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:16,544
like the plane Calling Cal and I had.

569
00:25:16,545 --> 00:25:18,079
When he told you to save the passengers?

570
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,347
Yeah.

571
00:25:22,985 --> 00:25:25,520
It happened right when TJ was arrested.

572
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:27,622
He's a passenger.
It's telling you to save him.

573
00:25:27,623 --> 00:25:30,258
He's clearly innocent.

574
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:31,943
No, actually.

575
00:25:31,944 --> 00:25:33,428
- Not clearly.
- What?

576
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:35,363
Look, TJ told us that
he'd never met her,

577
00:25:35,364 --> 00:25:37,665
but his prints were all over her room.

578
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:39,466
Ben, I've gone over and over the file.

579
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,639
Her name was Frannie.
She was an art student.

580
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,641
Well, he didn't do it.

581
00:25:46,642 --> 00:25:48,109
That's not what the evidence says.

582
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,711
Well, find new evidence!

583
00:25:49,712 --> 00:25:51,379
Ben. You're too close to this, okay?

584
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,148
Oh, and you weren't close to the guy

585
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:54,339
who shot you and ran off?

586
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,251
Don't bring Zeke into this.
You know he's innocent.

587
00:25:56,252 --> 00:25:58,019
So is TJ!

588
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,689
Ben, you've known him for one day, okay?

589
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,291
You are way too trusting, and I...

590
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:06,161
and I love that about you, but...

591
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:07,762
it's a weakness, okay?

592
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:09,998
TJ tells you a sob story, and...

593
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:11,566
He is a passenger.

594
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:13,034
And you know what? You're right.

595
00:26:13,035 --> 00:26:14,092
I do trust him.

596
00:26:14,093 --> 00:26:15,778
Because right now
passengers are pretty much

597
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:19,373
the only people I can trust.
So, please, dig deeper.

598
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,245
Okay.

599
00:26:24,246 --> 00:26:25,914
But if I find more proof

600
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:28,683
that... that he murdered this girl,

601
00:26:28,684 --> 00:26:29,884
then it's my job to make sure

602
00:26:29,885 --> 00:26:31,953
he never sees the light of day.

603
00:26:42,397 --> 00:26:45,099
Can you take me to see Auntie Mick?

604
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,434
At the police station?

605
00:26:49,571 --> 00:26:52,006
Cal, what... what's up?

606
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:53,441
I need to talk to her.

607
00:26:53,442 --> 00:26:56,978
There's... There's something
we're supposed to do together.

608
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:58,213
It's important.

609
00:26:58,214 --> 00:26:59,581
Well, then, you're in luck

610
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:02,026
because your older-and
oh-so-wiser twin sister

611
00:27:02,027 --> 00:27:04,285
just happens to be sitting
right in front of you,

612
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:06,187
ready to listen.

613
00:27:06,188 --> 00:27:07,622
That's okay.

614
00:27:07,623 --> 00:27:10,959
But if mom or dad call,
tell them I need help.

615
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,027
Cal.

616
00:27:13,028 --> 00:27:15,163
I-I can help.

617
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:17,428
At least let me try.

618
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:18,619
What is it?

619
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,688
It's about a Calling.
You wouldn't understand.

620
00:27:24,372 --> 00:27:26,674
Okay.

621
00:27:26,675 --> 00:27:28,776
- It's just that...
- No, no, no.

622
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:30,278
I get it.

623
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:22,597
Having fun with your new toy?

624
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:24,513
Yeah, I'm just getting set up.

625
00:28:24,514 --> 00:28:26,872
I can show you how I set up
my test runs on this baby.

626
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:28,741
It's a little different
from other Sequencers.

627
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:30,042
I'm just running some test results

628
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:31,149
before I even get started.

629
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,441
Maybe we could get a coffee or something

630
00:28:33,442 --> 00:28:34,632
while you're waiting.

631
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:37,116
I figure we're overdue, anyway.

632
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:38,651
I suspect we may have more in common

633
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:40,519
than just being keen researchers.

634
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,045
Might be fun to find out.

635
00:28:42,046 --> 00:28:43,269
I'm sorry, what?

636
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,493
Just rambling.

637
00:28:44,494 --> 00:28:45,617
♪ I'm a ramblin' man ♪

638
00:28:45,618 --> 00:28:48,510
Okay, so, I have to go.

639
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:49,628
Which means you have to go.

640
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:52,498
Right. Okay.

641
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:54,198
After you.

642
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,375
I already told the other cops.

643
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:04,810
I don't know him.

644
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:07,435
Frannie and I have been sorority
sisters for three years,

645
00:29:07,436 --> 00:29:09,248
and I've never seen that guy before.

646
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,039
Do you know why Frannie stayed on campus

647
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,551
in between sessions?

648
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:14,787
She's a Visual Arts major.

649
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:16,345
She was almost done getting ready

650
00:29:16,346 --> 00:29:20,148
for her first solo show
at the campus gallery.

651
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,960
It's supposed to open this weekend.

652
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,715
- Is this Latin?
- I think so, yeah. Why?

653
00:29:33,716 --> 00:29:34,840
Maybe that's the crossover.

654
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:36,041
Maybe they were both in Latin.

655
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,443
Those notes aren't Frannie's.

656
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:38,877
She didn't take Latin.

657
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:40,946
Why does she have someone
else's stuff in her room?

658
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,881
She had a ton of other
people's junk around.

659
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:45,017
She pulled it out of
the trash for her art.

660
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:47,252
She made collages out of found objects.

661
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:48,687
These must've been the discards

662
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:50,089
that didn't make it into the show.

663
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,693
Cross country, Latin... This...

664
00:29:52,694 --> 00:29:56,220
This is TJ's stuff. He
was telling the truth.

665
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:57,763
He was never in this
room, but his stuff was...

666
00:29:57,764 --> 00:30:00,065
his old stuff from before 828.

667
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:15,380
Michaela, you okay?

668
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:18,083
Yeah, um... Sorry.

669
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:19,318
Just...

670
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,954
Weird. That's Frannie's key card.

671
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:23,188
She must have dropped it

672
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:24,790
when she was sorting through stuff.

673
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:26,792
Frannie had her key card
on her when she died.

674
00:30:26,793 --> 00:30:28,961
Must've been a replacement.

675
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:31,563
Campus security records
didn't have any reports

676
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:32,765
of her card being lost.

677
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:34,233
Or them issuing a replacement.

678
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:37,136
You think they'd keep track of that.

679
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:40,037
If you needed to get a new
card, where would you go?

680
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,010
Someone looks happy.

681
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,678
It's just a good day.

682
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,681
How nice! Personal or professional?

683
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:50,716
Work.

684
00:30:50,717 --> 00:30:52,785
Have you met me?

685
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:55,420
Though I think this lab
tech just asked me out today.

686
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:57,489
He came by my office
claiming to be checking in

687
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,657
on the Sequencer, but...

688
00:30:58,658 --> 00:31:00,492
I'm sorry. Checking in on the what?

689
00:31:00,493 --> 00:31:02,127
It's a DNA Sequencer.

690
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:04,863
Oh, got it.

691
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,899
I had a new realization
about the Callings...

692
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,001
that they might be
transferable, genetically,

693
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:12,037
so I needed a new machine
to look at the DNA sequencing

694
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:15,808
so I can isolate the... I'm sorry.

695
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:17,409
Sorry, this is so boring.

696
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,944
If you're excited about something,

697
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:22,848
then I am happy to listen.

698
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:25,517
It is really exciting.

699
00:31:25,518 --> 00:31:26,885
Actually, you know,

700
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,806
Troy could be helpful
with the sequencing

701
00:31:28,807 --> 00:31:31,557
because the calibration
needs to be so precise.

702
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:34,949
As long as I don't let
him see any of my research.

703
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,950
_

704
00:31:46,576 --> 00:31:49,412
Hey, I don't want to do the SATs,

705
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:52,915
and I really don't need the lecture.

706
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:54,616
Come here, love.

707
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:07,297
I know how it felt when
we were the only two people

708
00:32:07,298 --> 00:32:09,132
not having the Callings.

709
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:12,302
And I can only imagine
how you must be feeling now

710
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:14,004
that I've had a Calling.

711
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:23,346
Honey, we will always be a family.

712
00:32:23,347 --> 00:32:26,583
Nothing can come between us.

713
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:28,517
Not even the Callings.

714
00:32:30,253 --> 00:32:31,922
Mom, do you think I'm resentful

715
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:35,592
because everyone else gets
the Callings and I don't?

716
00:32:35,593 --> 00:32:38,360
- You're not?
- Mom, I'm not resentful.

717
00:32:40,296 --> 00:32:42,588
I'm terrified.

718
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:46,102
Because the Callings gave
Cal and dad the Death Date.

719
00:32:46,103 --> 00:32:49,105
How do you know that you and
the baby don't have it, too?

720
00:32:49,106 --> 00:32:52,742
And in five years, you'll all be gone.

721
00:32:52,743 --> 00:32:55,311
And I'll be the only one left.

722
00:32:58,448 --> 00:33:01,017
I had thought that maybe the baby...

723
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:02,452
I really don't see why

724
00:33:02,453 --> 00:33:04,955
I'm cramming all of this SAT stuff

725
00:33:04,956 --> 00:33:08,658
just to be standing there
alone at my college graduation

726
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:10,994
wishing that all of you were alive.

727
00:33:15,566 --> 00:33:18,401
Honey, I'm sure we'll be at...

728
00:33:18,402 --> 00:33:20,736
Mom, you're not sure about anything!

729
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:25,474
And you are lying if you say you are!

730
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:33,797
Hi, there.

731
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:36,119
Detectives Mikami and Stone, NYPD.

732
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,687
Just wondering if we
could, uh, talk to you

733
00:33:37,688 --> 00:33:38,822
about Frannie King?

734
00:33:38,823 --> 00:33:40,624
Yeah, of course. Whataya need?

735
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:42,392
The card that she had
on her was a replacement.

736
00:33:42,393 --> 00:33:44,160
Just want to know when it was issued.

737
00:33:44,161 --> 00:33:45,362
Hmm.

738
00:33:45,363 --> 00:33:48,798
There's no entry in the log.

739
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,501
Do you know who was on
shift the night before last?

740
00:33:51,502 --> 00:33:52,902
That'll be Wilkins.

741
00:33:54,305 --> 00:33:55,972
Wilkins.

742
00:34:01,545 --> 00:34:02,912
What's going on?

743
00:34:02,913 --> 00:34:05,448
Uh, that student who
died... Frannie King.

744
00:34:05,449 --> 00:34:07,083
She come in for a key replacement?

745
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:08,251
No.

746
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:09,342
You sure?

747
00:34:09,343 --> 00:34:10,754
'Cause even if it's not in the log,

748
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:12,122
the key card machine's a computer,

749
00:34:12,123 --> 00:34:13,490
so it records every output.

750
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:15,391
We just got to download it.

751
00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:22,365
You know, a girl did
run in here for a card.

752
00:34:22,366 --> 00:34:24,768
She was in a hurry to
get back to her room.

753
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:26,069
I guess I forgot to log it.

754
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,170
Why was she in a hurry?

755
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:28,938
No idea. She didn't talk much.

756
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:30,403
She just took the card

757
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:32,108
and headed towards the west gate.

758
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:33,510
Not towards her sorority?

759
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:35,311
I don't know if she was in a sorority.

760
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:36,780
I just saw her leave, and that was it.

761
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:38,581
Sorry, so, you noticed
that she was in a hurry

762
00:34:38,582 --> 00:34:40,483
and where she was going, but you...

763
00:34:40,484 --> 00:34:42,285
you didn't notice
the giant sorority letters

764
00:34:42,286 --> 00:34:43,653
on her sweatshirt?

765
00:34:43,654 --> 00:34:45,288
That's kind of selective
in your observations.

766
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:48,958
Sorry, but that's all I remember.

767
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:50,560
I need to get going.

768
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:52,710
Yeah, one more quick question, actually.

769
00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:54,930
When did you get the shiny new boots?

770
00:34:56,066 --> 00:34:59,766
It's really hard to get blood
out of leather, isn't it?

771
00:35:03,474 --> 00:35:04,774
You have the right to remain silent.

772
00:35:04,775 --> 00:35:06,457
Anything you say can and will be

773
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:07,807
used against you in a court of law.

774
00:35:07,808 --> 00:35:10,089
I assume you're gonna clue
me in as to what just happened.

775
00:35:10,815 --> 00:35:12,581
That's lesson number two.

776
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:17,986
Ben. It's over.

777
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:23,103
They found the perp's
boots in a Dumpster

778
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:25,462
outside of his house
covered in Frannie's DNA.

779
00:35:25,463 --> 00:35:28,131
I should have been able
to help her, though.

780
00:35:28,132 --> 00:35:29,999
- It's my fault.
- No, no.

781
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,968
She was dead before you
ever got the Calling.

782
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:33,937
TJ, you couldn't have saved her.

783
00:35:33,938 --> 00:35:35,772
Why would the Calling want
me to find a dead body?

784
00:35:35,773 --> 00:35:37,774
Without you, Frannie's body
may never have been found.

785
00:35:37,775 --> 00:35:39,576
At least now her family
can get some closure.

786
00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:41,377
Yeah, the guard left his previous jobs

787
00:35:41,378 --> 00:35:43,138
under suspicion of
harassment and stalking.

788
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:44,796
I mean, he was likely a serial predator.

789
00:35:44,797 --> 00:35:47,417
You saved whoever would
have been his next victim

790
00:35:47,418 --> 00:35:48,518
or victims.

791
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,719
But why me?

792
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,422
Why did I get this Calling?

793
00:35:52,423 --> 00:35:54,124
I think we may know.

794
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,793
Come on. I'll show you.

795
00:35:56,794 --> 00:35:57,927
Thank you.

796
00:35:57,928 --> 00:36:00,063
Come on.

797
00:36:00,064 --> 00:36:01,764
Give me a second.

798
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:08,338
Thank you.

799
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:12,442
And I'm sorry I pushed too hard before.

800
00:36:12,443 --> 00:36:14,544
It's another one of my weaknesses.

801
00:36:14,545 --> 00:36:17,914
No, no. The, uh... The only
thing that I'm mad at

802
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:20,483
is the fact that you were right.

803
00:36:20,484 --> 00:36:23,352
So, I'm sorry, too.

804
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:33,596
Congratulations on an
amazing solve, Stone.

805
00:36:33,597 --> 00:36:35,165
I've been looking back at your cases,

806
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:38,268
and you've had a lot of
solves from anonymous tips.

807
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:39,769
A lot.

808
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:44,240
So many, in fact, an ADA
might start asking questions.

809
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:47,343
You see, I like a paper trail.

810
00:36:47,344 --> 00:36:48,745
I like a long paper trail.

811
00:36:48,746 --> 00:36:51,881
It means that my cops
are doing their jobs.

812
00:36:51,882 --> 00:36:54,951
So, tell me, detective,
how'd you solve this one,

813
00:36:54,952 --> 00:36:57,086
in two hours, no less?

814
00:36:57,087 --> 00:36:58,787
Anonymous tip.

815
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:03,293
It's your case, Vasquez.

816
00:37:03,294 --> 00:37:04,928
You buy that?

817
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:05,962
I do.

818
00:37:05,963 --> 00:37:07,897
Really?

819
00:37:07,898 --> 00:37:10,500
Because I don't buy it for a second.

820
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:12,877
Going forward, I don't want you two

821
00:37:12,878 --> 00:37:14,804
anywhere near the same cases.

822
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,694
The school held onto
your stuff for years

823
00:37:24,695 --> 00:37:26,382
before they threw it out.

824
00:37:26,383 --> 00:37:30,419
But when they did, it was found again...

825
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,858
... by Frannie.

826
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:38,261
That's why the Calling
led you to find her.

827
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:39,929
'Cause she found you.

828
00:37:58,182 --> 00:38:01,885
I can stay if you want me to.

829
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:03,353
No.

830
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:05,254
No, I just, uh...

831
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,491
I don't know how to thank you.

832
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:16,165
Hey.

833
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,866
Go see your mom.

834
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,139
Ben Stone?

835
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,407
Suzanne?

836
00:38:24,408 --> 00:38:26,202
You're kidding me. How long has it been?

837
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,644
Well, for you or for me?

838
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:30,406
What are you doing here?

839
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:33,182
- I'm a dean. Well, can you believe it?
- Yeah, I can.

840
00:38:33,183 --> 00:38:34,884
You were the smartest
student in Number Theory.

841
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:37,887
Well, my group study partner
was a real inspiration.

842
00:38:37,888 --> 00:38:39,289
What about you?

843
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,957
Besides shattering the laws of physics,

844
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:42,321
what have you been up to?

845
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:44,913
Actually, dean, I'm on
a job hunt, so if you...

846
00:38:44,914 --> 00:38:47,363
Ben. Sent me your CV... today.

847
00:38:47,364 --> 00:38:49,188
My e-mail's on the department's website.

848
00:38:49,189 --> 00:38:50,889
Okay. Will do.

849
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:00,377
Hey! Uh, you're the...

850
00:39:00,378 --> 00:39:03,279
Yeah, the girl with the
two tons of SAT books.

851
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,782
No, you were so much
more than just that.

852
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:08,038
You were the girl in the killer jacket.

853
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,229
Thank you.

854
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,453
I'm Maxine Taylor.

855
00:39:10,454 --> 00:39:12,611
Olive. Olive Stone.

856
00:39:12,612 --> 00:39:14,424
Wait. "Stone", as in...

857
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:17,827
Yes, but, you know, I don't
really want everyone to...

858
00:39:17,828 --> 00:39:19,629
Yeah, no worries! Come in.

859
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,897
Adrian's about to speak.

860
00:39:20,898 --> 00:39:23,466
And you have to tell me where you shop.

861
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:25,869
Deal, if you tell me where
you got your hair done.

862
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,466
Oh, this is all DIY.

863
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:28,724
I can hook you up.

864
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:43,156
I don't suppose you know anything

865
00:39:43,157 --> 00:39:45,455
about DNA Sequencers.

866
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:49,025
I assume you're talking about
the one Saanvi's been using.

867
00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:50,326
She made a new discovery

868
00:39:50,327 --> 00:39:52,462
about a genetic change to the 828ers,

869
00:39:52,463 --> 00:39:55,165
but she's been doing
the tests in her labs

870
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:57,066
to keep it all under wraps.
How would you know about that?

871
00:39:57,067 --> 00:39:59,002
Because it's clearly not under wraps.

872
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:00,970
I've been tracking the accounts.

873
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:03,338
Looks like the Major just ordered one.

874
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,647
How the hell does the Major
know about Saanvi's discovery?

875
00:40:32,136 --> 00:40:34,504
Shots fired. Officer down.

876
00:40:34,505 --> 00:40:35,771
Hold on, Michaela.

877
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:39,342
I'm so sorry.

878
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:40,643
Run.

879
00:40:40,644 --> 00:40:42,712
Run.

880
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:52,321
"Dear Zeke..."

881
00:40:55,759 --> 00:40:59,496
"I don't know how to say
this, other than I need you".

882
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:03,633
It's happening again!

883
00:41:03,634 --> 00:41:05,702
Just hang on. Just hang on.

884
00:41:05,703 --> 00:41:09,004
Zeke! Zeke! Zeke, please!

885
00:41:14,377 --> 00:41:16,078
Zeke, can you hear me?

886
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,765
Hey!

887
00:41:18,766 --> 00:41:20,456
Can you hear me?

888
00:41:28,192 --> 00:41:30,693
- Zeke, I'm right here, okay?
- Michaela.

889
00:41:30,694 --> 00:41:31,995
Hey, hey, hey, I'm right here.

890
00:41:31,996 --> 00:41:34,564
I'm right here.

891
00:41:34,565 --> 00:41:36,165
Michaela.

892
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:39,235
Zeke, I'm right here. Zeke!

893
00:41:39,236 --> 00:41:40,737
Cal?

894
00:41:40,738 --> 00:41:43,339
Is that you? Michaela?

895
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,108
It's not working. Let's double the dose.

896
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:47,944
No, please. I need...

897
00:41:47,945 --> 00:41:50,380
No, the Calling.

898
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:51,848
No!

899
00:41:59,657 --> 00:42:01,591
I'm sorry.

899
00:42:02,305 --> 00:43:02,734

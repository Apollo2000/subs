<i>Previously, on</i>
"Manifest"...

2
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,264
Detective Stone,
what do you know

3
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:07,446
about the night you were shot?

4
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:08,887
I know that
it was an accident.

5
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,456
I also know
that Detective Vasquez

6
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:12,762
broke into my house
without probable cause

7
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,639
to confront Zeke Landon.

8
00:00:15,257 --> 00:00:17,272
No one's ever done
anything like that for me.

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,241
My dad, my brother, and my aunt
were all 828 passengers.

10
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:23,345
Being here...

11
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:26,874
I now realize that we...
We all belong.

12
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:28,889
Never mind.
I got this.

13
00:00:29,074 --> 00:00:31,343
Evie, no, you don't.

14
00:00:31,676 --> 00:00:32,843
Can you hear me?

15
00:00:34,683 --> 00:00:37,585
How could you come here?
Get out of this house.

16
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:39,355
You were right.
I found the leak.

17
00:00:39,443 --> 00:00:41,077
I only told one person
about that vial.

18
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:42,445
My psychiatrist.

19
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:43,570
There.

20
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:45,241
She's not informing
the Major.

21
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:46,445
She is the Major.

22
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:48,413
Now we turn the tables.

00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,630
Thanks.

26
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:02,578
"Old Yeller's" decent.
Cute dog.

27
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,437
Spoiler alert... bummer ending.

28
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:06,093
But if you want
a really cool adventure,

29
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:07,851
check out
"A Wrinkle in Time."

30
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:12,937
Olive, we're next.

31
00:01:18,116 --> 00:01:19,843
There you are.

32
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,054
Your dad and brother
got on Flight 828.

33
00:01:22,273 --> 00:01:23,686
It lands a few hours after ours.

34
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:25,438
Are you sure you don't want
to go with Cal?

35
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:27,078
No, I like us having
mom/daughter time.

36
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,726
Oh, me, too.

37
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:32,429
<i>Final call
for JFK passengers</i>

38
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:34,810
<i>willing to take a later flight.</i>

39
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:39,085
<i>Final call for JFK passengers
willing to take a later flight.</i>

40
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,333
Actually, Mom, will you be upset
if I do go with them?

41
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:46,570
What happened
to mom/daughter time?

42
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:48,621
Next weekend.
Mani-pedis?

43
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:50,571
Okay, go.

44
00:01:55,664 --> 00:01:57,327
The book's really good so far.

45
00:01:57,415 --> 00:01:59,695
Yeah, if you like that,
then you'll love Homer.

46
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:02,669
I don't read Latin.
I'm 101/2.

47
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:04,833
What's up, Ten-and-a-Half?
I'm TJ.

48
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:07,294
Miracles.

49
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:09,177
All the world's religions

50
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:13,255
have been based
on apocryphal miracles.

51
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:16,544
Resurrection, reincarnation...

52
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:20,607
All rumors and myths
that trace back millennia.

53
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,798
Until Flight 828 returned.

54
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:29,341
That 191 miracle returnees
reappeared on Earth

55
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:33,107
makes an undeniable case
for miracles tomorrow.

56
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:36,732
Believe in the miracle
of Flight 828.

57
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,081
Believe in the passengers,
who, after escaping death,

58
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:43,634
will now walk among you
for decades to come.

59
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,912
After a month of testing,

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,713
I was able to confirm
elimination of the 828 anomaly

61
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:20,374
in a petri dish.

62
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:22,130
Now I need to move on
to phase two...

63
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:24,576
Test the viability and toxicity
of the serum

64
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:26,164
on a living specimen.

65
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:29,805
Alright, Hero.
Let's do this.

66
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,287
I got to go, but if you
survive this, little buddy,

67
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,588
we might have a chance
of beating the Death Date.

68
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:42,828
Fingers crossed and lips sealed.

69
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:55,528

70
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,076
I wish I was there
walking you down the aisle,

71
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:04,873
seeing your radiant smile

72
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:09,356
and wearing what I am sure
is a killer dress.

73
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:13,498
Prettiest bride there ever was.

74
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:14,943
No doubt.

75
00:04:18,878 --> 00:04:21,248
I need you to know
that I never...

76
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:25,289
I never stopped trying, Olive.

77
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:28,029
What I would've given
to have been there.

78
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:29,951
What are you doing?
Uh...

79
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:33,581
Delete it.

80
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,662
Grace.
Ben, delete it.

81
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,208
You're not giving up.

82
00:04:37,636 --> 00:04:38,904
I won't let you.

83
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:42,951
I'm not giving up.
I never will.

84
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,583
But, Grace, I haven't found
a new clue in over a month.

85
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,179
There hasn't been another
Plane Calling in all that time,

86
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:49,975
and I still haven't come across
one other passenger

87
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:51,818
even aware of the Death Date.

88
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,708
You have five years.

89
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:56,299
Why are you torturing yourself
like this?

90
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:00,489
Peace of mind.

91
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:06,937
I believe in you.

92
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:09,109
You will find a way.

93
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:22,066
Evie is so excited.

94
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:26,419
Her outfit, shoes, handbag...
It's all blush pink.

95
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,013
Had it dyed to match.

96
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:29,184
Have you seen it?

97
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:31,107
I have, yeah.

98
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:34,821
It warms our hearts each time
you walk in the door.

99
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:36,351
That makes three of us.

100
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,642
Thank you.

101
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,998
So, who are you taking to prom?

102
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:43,896
Um, I don't actually
have a date.

103
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:45,227
Really?

104
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:47,325
There isn't a boy
you're interested in?

105
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:53,162
You know what?
There is, actually.

106
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:54,646
Mm.

107
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:55,755
He's new.

108
00:05:55,843 --> 00:05:57,765
He's kind of a loner type,

109
00:05:57,906 --> 00:05:59,576
but he's got
a really good heart.

110
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:01,487
Mm. Good heart
goes a long way.

111
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:02,951
Yeah.

112
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:06,220
We haven't talked that much
in the past month.

113
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:08,498
To be honest, I don't even
really know him that well,

114
00:06:08,586 --> 00:06:13,096
but there's something about him
that's drawn me towards him.

115
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:18,607
The last guy that I dated,
it didn't go so well.

116
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,130
We, um, kind of broke
each other's hearts,

117
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:26,998
and I'm scared of opening myself
back up and then lose him,

118
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:31,916
because I don't... I don't know
how long he's gonna be around.

119
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:34,998
You're a strong girl.

120
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:37,009
I see it in your eyes.

121
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:40,767
And loving someone is
the bravest thing you can do.

122
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:46,404
So let go and be happy,
even if it's for a little while.

123
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:49,873
I promise it'll be worth it.

124
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:59,162
W- What's your name again, dear?

125
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:04,228
It's Michaela.
I go to school with Evie.

126
00:07:04,316 --> 00:07:06,149
Nice to meet you, Michaela.

127
00:07:06,237 --> 00:07:08,060
Very nice to meet you, too.

128
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:16,326
Isaiah, you're taking lead

129
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:17,749
on the soup kitchen
in Corona tonight.

130
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:20,943
Got it. Uh, I've got new flyers
ready for distribution, too.

131
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:22,708
Olive.

132
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:25,740
Can I speak to you?

133
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:28,193
Privately?

134
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:31,958
What you said at your sermon
today, "decades to come"?

135
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:35,123
Have you heard about
the Death Date?

136
00:07:36,282 --> 00:07:37,492
Enlighten me.

137
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:43,177
Olive, whatever it is,
it's okay.

138
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:45,529
It's not.

139
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:49,459
My dad, Cal, my Aunt Mick,

140
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:52,607
they all had these Callings
showing that they're gonna die

141
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:56,458
51/2 years after 828 returned.

142
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:59,029
They know the exact date.

143
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:02,255
June 2, 2024.

144
00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:09,162
And I'm sorry to drop
this bomb on you,

145
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,003
but my dad's been working
like crazy

146
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,674
trying to find a way around it.

147
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,396
He's afraid.

148
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:18,294
We choose which path we follow.

149
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:22,849
Fear begets fear,
and miracles beget miracles.

150
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:24,826
We were saved before.

151
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:27,837
We'll be saved again.
If we believe.

152
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:35,505
Hey, Professor Stone.
Busy?

153
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:37,498
"Professor Stone."

154
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:39,576
That never gets old.

155
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:42,490
Just grading papers.
What can I do you for, TJ?

156
00:08:42,632 --> 00:08:44,466
I had another Calling.

157
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:48,244
What do you know about a bug,
a bird, a fish, and a tiger?

158
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,965
Coincidence you've been eating
here so much during my shifts?

159
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,022
Coincidence you've been working
so much during my meals?

160
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,130
Just ask me out
for dinner already.

161
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:07,536
I would, honestly.

162
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:10,078
I just got out of something.

163
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,357
Two somethings, actually.

164
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,419
Not really ready
for another something.

165
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:16,494
Then maybe we just skip
the dinner.

166
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:20,513
Hey, leave the poor bastard
alone and get me another beer.

167
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:22,607
Saved by the brother.

168
00:09:22,904 --> 00:09:24,734
Coming up, Billy boy.

169
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,263
<i>Bring him back.</i>

170
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:47,437
<i>Bring who back?</i>

171
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:48,701
<i>Bring him back.</i>

172
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,723
<i>Bring him back.</i>

173
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:19,851
<i>Bring him back.</i>

174
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,708
Zeke.

175
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:26,406
What are you doing here?

176
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:29,786
I think... I-I think
I'm supposed to bring...

177
00:10:29,874 --> 00:10:32,174
Bring him back?
Yeah. Me, too.

178
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:35,631
Um...

179
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:37,884
What, you thought the Calling
was telling you to bring me back?

180
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,333
I don't know.

181
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:43,164
I mean, do you see anyone here
who looks like they need help?

182
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,639
Not yet.

183
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:48,100
But I'm glad we're
doing this together.

184
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:50,655
I called you.
Couple times.

185
00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:53,108
Yeah, sorry.
I've just been overwhelmed.

186
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,311
With what? Work?
Is it me?

187
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:57,920
Why haven't I seen you lately?

188
00:10:58,008 --> 00:10:59,420
<i>Everybody down!</i>

189
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:02,687
<i>Everybody get down!
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!</i>

190
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:04,201
<i>Get down!</i>

191
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:07,686
<i>Everybody down
on the floor now!</i>

192
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,443
I'm off duty.

193
00:11:09,726 --> 00:11:11,194
I don't have my gun.

194
00:11:11,282 --> 00:11:13,873
Get down!
On the ground!

195
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:15,899
The Calling brought us here
for this?

196
00:11:15,987 --> 00:11:17,350
<i>Get down!</i>

197
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:21,257
Down! Get down!

198
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,990
Okay, everybody stay down.

199
00:11:24,514 --> 00:11:25,660
Stay down.

200
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:27,200
You!

201
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:29,330
Yeah, you, you, move.

202
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:30,801
Move to the back.

203
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:32,239
Come on.
Everybody move.

204
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:33,335
Move!

205
00:11:33,423 --> 00:11:34,633
Come on.

206
00:11:37,912 --> 00:11:40,219
Okay, phones.
Phones.

207
00:11:40,507 --> 00:11:42,680
Give me your phones.
Put your phone in there.

208
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:44,426
We got to calm this guy down.

209
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:46,374
Easier said than done.
He's a total amateur.

210
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:47,560
- <i>Out of the way.</i>
- How can you tell?

211
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:50,192
- <i>Out of the way. Move.</i>
- He's got no body armor, no backup.

212
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,343
He hasn't taken out
a single camera.

213
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:55,300
Most of the time these guys are
in and out, three minutes max.

214
00:11:55,546 --> 00:11:57,137
So he doesn't know
what he's doing.

215
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:59,028
<i>- No phones?</i>
- That's a good thing, right?

216
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:01,755
No, it means he's unpredictable,
dangerous.

217
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:03,910
Yeah, but if he's not a pro,

218
00:12:04,397 --> 00:12:06,591
maybe we can figure out a way
to take him down.

219
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,870
- Please, please.
- Stay down.

220
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:09,200
Nobody needs to get hurt.

221
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:11,139
No, get down. No.

222
00:12:11,227 --> 00:12:12,687
No talking.

223
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,218
Hey.
Y...

224
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:19,526
I can tell that you haven't
done this before.

225
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,010
I s... I said no talking.

226
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:23,050
You don't want anyone
to get hurt, right?

227
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,112
How about we get him some money
out of the drawers?

228
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:28,369
No, I don't care about money.

229
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,604
I need to get into the vault.

230
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:32,285
The vault is locked.

231
00:12:32,394 --> 00:12:33,924
It shuts down automatically

232
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:35,557
whenever the silent alarm
is triggered.

233
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:37,550
Buddy, you're better off just
getting money from the register.

234
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:39,901
You're not listening to me!

235
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:42,650
I don't care about money.

236
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:45,077
I need to get into the vault.

237
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:47,407
Zeke!

238
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,304
You were on 828.

239
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:05,264
So was I.

240
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:10,546
My research has stalled out.

241
00:13:11,593 --> 00:13:14,794
There's a geneticist in Sweden
that might be able to help,

242
00:13:14,882 --> 00:13:16,637
but if he can't,

243
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:19,480
I think I might have to give up
working on the anomaly.

244
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:21,444
Bang. You're dead.

245
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:23,301
Come on.
That was a good one.

246
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:25,005
Stop fidgeting
with your necklace.

247
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:26,301
It's a dead giveaway.

248
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,880
The Major is a seasoned
intelligence officer.

249
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:30,988
Busy up your hands.
Eat an apple or something.

250
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,171
I don't understand
how lying about needing help

251
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,997
from some made-up
Swedish geneticist

252
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:37,028
gets us anywhere.

253
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,676
When the Major hears
a foreign scientist

254
00:13:38,772 --> 00:13:40,225
might prove useful to her,

255
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:42,723
I'm betting it'll activate her
to reach out to her superiors.

256
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:44,481
Why?
Isn't exposing her enough?

257
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:45,380
She's a shadow.

258
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:46,950
We expose her, she disappears,

259
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:48,950
another black op opens up
in her place.

260
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:52,372
But if we can identify someone
who'll be hurt by this scandal,

261
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,850
then we can go to the press,
break this wide open.

262
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:59,399
You and Ben really think
that this is a good idea?

263
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:02,107
You know,
you can ask him yourself.

264
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,050
This isn't junior high.
Start talking already.

265
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:10,262
It's been weeks.

266
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,614
He lied to me.

267
00:14:11,702 --> 00:14:15,497
Ben only lied to you
because I made him lie to you.

268
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:17,366
Let's just focus on
what I should be doing.

269
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:19,809
Good. You still holding up
appearances at the hospital?

270
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:22,051
Yes, leaving placebo samples
at my lab,

271
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:25,380
which so-called Dr. Matthews
is still siphoning.

272
00:14:25,468 --> 00:14:26,747
Good.
I know you're anxious

273
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:28,840
to get back to your
real 828 research,

274
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:31,341
but I need you
to hold off completely

275
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:33,180
until we shut down the Major.

276
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:35,772
- We're close.
- And we can't risk anything.

277
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,272
I know.

278
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:41,940
These are the images
I saw,

279
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,947
along with "2012,"
which I assume is the year.

280
00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:49,041
I don't even know
what we're looking for.

281
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,567
Olive.

282
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:53,684
Hey, I was on my way
to SAT prep.

283
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:55,356
Just wanted to stop by
and say hi.

284
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:57,309
And borrow 20 bucks.

285
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,179
Well, I was gonna ask for $10,
but $20's good.

286
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:02,786
I'm TJ.

287
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:04,718
TJ was on Flight 828.

288
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:06,176
Y- You might remember him.

289
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:07,677
He was at the airport
in Jamaica.

290
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:11,843
You look... familiar.

291
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:14,693
Next.

292
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:17,247
Hey, any seats left
on that later flight?

293
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:18,730
I was hoping to get
one of those vouchers,

294
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,022
take my mom to San Francisco
next summer.

295
00:15:21,763 --> 00:15:23,304
One seat left.

296
00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:24,723
Nice. I'll take it.

297
00:15:24,811 --> 00:15:27,132
Unless, of course,
Ten-and-a-Half here wants it.

298
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,038
It's okay.
You can have it.

299
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:31,537
Keep reading, Ten-and-a-Half.

300
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:37,725
Sorry, you don't ring a bell.

301
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,089
So what are you guys
working on?

302
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:43,762
TJ had a Calling, and I'm trying
to help him figure it out.

303
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,223
Even though she wasn't with us,

304
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,630
she has an uncanny knack
for this stuff.

305
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:51,085
So why are you guys researching
the Gramercy Club?

306
00:15:52,263 --> 00:15:53,434
The animals.

307
00:15:53,522 --> 00:15:55,930
That's the logo
for the Gramercy Club.

308
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:59,639
Oh, I mean, where have you guys
been the past five years?

309
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:02,085
Alright, it's this cool,

310
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:04,101
members-only athletic club
in the city.

311
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:06,392
Some of the rich kids
at my school belong to it.

312
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,290
Fancy restaurants, bars,
a bunch of courts and pools.

313
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:13,610
I never scored an invite myself.

314
00:16:13,987 --> 00:16:15,070
Let's go.

315
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:16,780
Maybe there's
something big there.

316
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:18,200
Uh, wait a minute.

317
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:21,837
I would love my 20 bucks now,
thank you.

318
00:16:23,377 --> 00:16:25,290
- Love you.
- Love you.

319
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:27,369
See ya.

320
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:31,736
Yeah, see ya.

321
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:35,961
I was on the plane, too.

322
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:37,639
My name's Michaela.

323
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:39,740
I'm Logan.

324
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:41,404
Logan, look, I understand, okay?

325
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:42,640
Coming back was hard
for all of us.

326
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:44,795
I felt confused and isolated.

327
00:16:44,883 --> 00:16:47,980
Nobody understood what...
I can't believe you were on 828.

328
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:50,320
Why the hell are we
at the same bank together?

329
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:52,820
We're trying to figure that out.

330
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:54,530
You're another one of us?

331
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:55,820
It's complicated.

332
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,660
Logan, can I... um, can...

333
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:03,067
D- Do you see visions
or hear voices?

334
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:04,709
Because I do, too.

335
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:07,297
That's how
I wound up here today.

336
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,028
Damn it!

337
00:17:15,379 --> 00:17:16,690
You hit the alarm!

338
00:17:16,778 --> 00:17:18,128
Look, I'm NYPD, okay?
I can help you...

339
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:19,720
You're a cop?!

340
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:21,220
Take it easy.

341
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:23,784
Put the gun down,
and you may be able

342
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:25,417
to get out of this
with little jail time.

343
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:27,088
I don't care about jail time.

344
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:29,360
I'm trying to save my life.

345
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:31,440
How's robbing a bank
gonna save your life?

346
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:33,625
I saw a vision of my future.

347
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:37,372
My tombstone.

348
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:40,479
And not just once.
I see it over and over again.

349
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:42,040
It's...

350
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:44,200
It's real.

351
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:50,129
If I don't get what I need
from that box, I'm gonna die.

352
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:56,272
He had the Death Date Calling.

353
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:07,247
No other passenger has any clue
about the Death Date.

354
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:09,222
That has to be
why we're here.

355
00:18:09,482 --> 00:18:12,395
Maybe we don't try and stop him.
Maybe we help him.

356
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:14,216
- What are you talking about?
- I mean, he seems to think

357
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,818
that whatever's in that vault
is gonna save him.

358
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:17,934
So maybe it'll save us, too.

359
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:20,338
You really think he has
some miracle answer

360
00:18:20,426 --> 00:18:22,317
for the Death Date?
Why?

361
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:25,168
Because, Zeke, you only have
eight months left to live.

362
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:28,154
If there's even a slim chance of
saving you, I'm gonna take it.

363
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:30,165
Go back.
Get on your knees.

364
00:18:30,722 --> 00:18:31,765
I don't get it.

365
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:33,686
You're willing to risk
everything for me now,

366
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:35,516
but when I try to see you,
you blow me off.

367
00:18:35,603 --> 00:18:37,716
Am I just another person to save
and check off your list?

368
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:39,254
No, of course not.

369
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:46,106
<i>Answer the phone!</i>

370
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,512
No. No! No phones.

371
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,606
Logan, it's just the cops
outside, okay?

372
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,028
They're worried about
these hostages.

373
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:53,817
They just want to talk to you.

374
00:18:55,623 --> 00:18:57,036
I don't want to talk to them.

375
00:18:57,123 --> 00:18:58,184
Then let me.

376
00:18:58,713 --> 00:19:00,260
Logan, you're not the only one

377
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,626
who's had
the Death Date Calling.

378
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:03,126
You got to start trusting me.

379
00:19:03,213 --> 00:19:04,325
Wait. Calling?

380
00:19:04,413 --> 00:19:06,236
You mean the vision
of my tombstone?

381
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:09,124
My nephew had a vision
just like it.

382
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:16,989
Ah, you st... you stop that.

383
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:18,896
You are trying
to manipulate me.

384
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:20,646
Get back on the ground now!

385
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:22,976
Hey, man, believe her or not,

386
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:24,816
but someone needs to calm
those cops down outside

387
00:19:24,903 --> 00:19:26,322
if you ever want
to get in that box.

388
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:35,906
If... If you try anything...

389
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:38,326
No, look, we'll make a deal.

390
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:41,051
We release the hostages, and
they'll open the vault for you.

391
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:43,129
We can do that, can't we?

392
00:19:45,673 --> 00:19:48,131
If you're worried about losing
bodies and losing leverage,

393
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:49,231
I'll stay, too.

394
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:50,451
Zeke, no.

395
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:52,348
No chance
I'm leaving you behind.

396
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:56,381
Logan, stop.

397
00:19:56,468 --> 00:19:57,468
Please.

398
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:02,273
Answer it.

399
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:14,533
This is
Detective Michaela Stone.

400
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:21,225
I filled out the profile,
even uploaded a picture.

401
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:23,285
I think I am finally ready

402
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:25,022
to dive into
the online-dating world.

403
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,194
Good for you.

404
00:20:26,282 --> 00:20:29,115
I'm glad to see you so excited
about the future.

405
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:31,699
I'd be more excited
about my future

406
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:33,420
if I can get some help
with my work.

407
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:35,121
Oh?

408
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:38,100
Remember the genetic research
I'd been working on?

409
00:20:39,214 --> 00:20:40,694
Vaguely.

410
00:20:41,602 --> 00:20:43,015
Well, I've hit a roadblock.

411
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:45,092
But I heard that there's
a geneticist in Sweden

412
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,485
having success
with experimental studies

413
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:48,736
in the same arena, so...

414
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:50,776
And you think they can help?

415
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:52,656
It's the most promising
lead I've had

416
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:54,420
since I've started all this.

417
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,387
Time's up.

418
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,436
That went by really fast.

419
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:06,165
Guess I'll have to wait
till next time to hear more.

420
00:21:06,503 --> 00:21:07,811
Sounds good.

421
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:13,287
<i>Hands up.
One at a time.</i>

422
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,748
<i>Stay calm...</i>

423
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,264
Everyone's out
except for the three of us.

424
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,686
I have the situation
under control.

425
00:21:19,774 --> 00:21:21,357
What's taking so long?

426
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,226
You said they were gonna
open this thing.

427
00:21:23,313 --> 00:21:26,146
Accessing the vault remotely
takes time.

428
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:28,280
There are many layers of...
Enough!

429
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:42,994
Come on.

430
00:21:43,484 --> 00:21:44,694
Come on, come on.
Come on.

431
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:47,639
No, we just need to be patient.

432
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,462
We're not gonna wait out here
for the situation to get worse.

433
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,592
You're on a short leash,
Detective.

434
00:21:56,186 --> 00:21:58,264
Detective Jared Vasquez, NYPD.

435
00:21:58,352 --> 00:21:59,716
What's the situation inside?

436
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:01,676
Got things under control here,
Detective.

437
00:22:01,763 --> 00:22:03,921
Look, I heard over the scanner
one of our own's trapped inside.

438
00:22:04,008 --> 00:22:05,201
Michaela Stone.

439
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:06,946
Your colleague seems to think
she has it all figured out

440
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:08,777
because the gunman
was on Flight 828 with her.

441
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:10,487
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

442
00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:12,146
The gunman's a passenger?

443
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:13,313
Logan Strickland.

444
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:15,074
And if Detective Stone
isn't careful,

445
00:22:15,162 --> 00:22:17,452
her comfort with him
is gonna get her hurt.

446
00:22:27,253 --> 00:22:28,586
Guess we're in the right place.

447
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:30,876
Now we just need to figure out
why we're here.

448
00:22:37,698 --> 00:22:38,953
Hold up.

449
00:22:40,914 --> 00:22:42,516
This is how you saw it, right,

450
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,516
the crest with the year
right below?

451
00:22:45,546 --> 00:22:48,125
Does it feel this big every time
you chase down a Calling?

452
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:50,272
Every time.

453
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:52,427
I'll go find the 2012 champions.

454
00:22:52,514 --> 00:22:53,594
Alright.

455
00:22:56,632 --> 00:22:58,367
- Hey.
- Hey!

456
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,733
What do you know
about Logan Strickland?

457
00:23:00,953 --> 00:23:02,225
Uh, not much.

458
00:23:02,313 --> 00:23:03,446
Uh, he was on Flight 828,

459
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:06,352
but I haven't been able
to track him down. Why?

460
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,233
He's holding up a bank
right now, but Mick's inside.

461
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,500
Wait. What?

462
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:13,031
I- Is she o-okay?
Has anyone talked to her?

463
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,872
She's holding her own.
She keeps talking ESU back.

464
00:23:16,203 --> 00:23:17,823
I'm worried she's in
over her head in there.

465
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,363
Alright, I'm on my way.
Uh, text me the address.

466
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,426
TJ, I need to go.

467
00:23:22,513 --> 00:23:23,466
What should I do?

468
00:23:23,553 --> 00:23:24,806
Find the 2012 champions,

469
00:23:24,893 --> 00:23:26,743
- track them down, and I'll call you later.
- Well, I found them.

470
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,813
The winners were Frank
and Logan Strickland.

471
00:23:36,403 --> 00:23:38,566
Oh, my God.
Logan Strickland.

472
00:23:38,653 --> 00:23:40,106
He's holding up a bank
right now.

473
00:23:40,194 --> 00:23:41,582
Michaela's inside.

474
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:43,575
That's why we're here.

475
00:23:43,663 --> 00:23:44,996
The Calling wouldn't
bring us all this way

476
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,456
just to look at a photo.

477
00:24:01,247 --> 00:24:03,077
Frank Strickland?

478
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,964
All the way back.
In the corner.

479
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:09,505
Corner.

480
00:24:09,692 --> 00:24:12,067
Open Frank Strickland's
safety deposit box.

481
00:24:13,473 --> 00:24:14,983
Who's Frank Strickland?

482
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:18,615
After everything
she's done for you,

483
00:24:18,702 --> 00:24:20,372
you don't think
you owe her an answer?

484
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:25,074
He's my brother.

485
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:27,915
If he's your brother, then why
did you just hold up a bank?

486
00:24:28,262 --> 00:24:29,585
Why didn't you just talk to him?

487
00:24:29,672 --> 00:24:31,457
You don't think that
I tried?

488
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,223
He wouldn't listen.

489
00:24:33,426 --> 00:24:35,791
He thinks that everyone
who returned on 828,

490
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:37,675
that they're not really them.

491
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,244
What do you mean?

492
00:24:39,332 --> 00:24:40,845
He doesn't believe
I'm me.

493
00:24:40,996 --> 00:24:42,528
I don't exist.

494
00:24:43,308 --> 00:24:47,594
And everything that belonged
to me, that was my birthright,

495
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:51,605
everything that our dad,
may he rest in peace,

496
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:56,574
was saving for me,
Frank took it all.

497
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,611
I was terrified,
but he didn't care.

498
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:06,973
I'm his brother,
but he didn't care.

499
00:25:08,587 --> 00:25:10,965
I found
Mr. Strickland's box.

500
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:18,295
Open it.

501
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:19,965
I- I-I can't.

502
00:25:20,293 --> 00:25:23,805
I only have my key.
I need the owner's key, too.

503
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,673
Are you kidding me?

504
00:25:25,762 --> 00:25:26,805
Oh, boy.

505
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:28,931
You...

506
00:25:30,392 --> 00:25:32,975
You don't have some kind
of a master key?!

507
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:35,213
What... What...
What if the owner dies?

508
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:36,695
Then what?!
I need the second key.

509
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:37,855
The hell you do!

510
00:25:37,942 --> 00:25:38,987
Logan, Logan, put the gun down.

511
00:25:39,074 --> 00:25:40,365
No! No!

512
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:42,612
This is not the way
this is supposed to happen!

513
00:25:44,288 --> 00:25:45,291
Stop!

514
00:25:46,082 --> 00:25:47,582
Aah!

515
00:25:51,252 --> 00:25:52,995
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

516
00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:55,672
Let me take him outside,
get him to the EMTs.

517
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:58,920
I'll come right back.
You'll still have your hostage.

518
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,005
How do I know
you're not gonna leave?

519
00:26:02,623 --> 00:26:04,333
Because she's still here.

520
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:06,628
Here. Put this.

521
00:26:08,932 --> 00:26:10,811
Okay. Okay.

522
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:13,024
Okay, alright.
I got to tie it on.

523
00:26:13,112 --> 00:26:14,902
Here, let me loosen your tie.

524
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,048
My name is Ben Stone.
I was on Flight 828.

525
00:26:20,152 --> 00:26:22,293
I need to talk to you
about your brother Logan.

526
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:26,235
He's holding up a bank
in Seaside right at this moment.

527
00:26:26,322 --> 00:26:28,395
That's not possible.
My brother's dead.

528
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:29,955
He died on that plane.

529
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:33,245
You know that's not true.
That plane returned.

530
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:35,448
We were both on that flight,
Frank.

531
00:26:36,866 --> 00:26:38,415
Then I guess you're dead, too.

532
00:26:38,502 --> 00:26:39,875
Frank, please.

533
00:26:39,962 --> 00:26:41,592
Logan is holding
my sister hostage.

534
00:26:41,686 --> 00:26:42,903
I need you to talk him down.

535
00:26:42,991 --> 00:26:43,910
My brother's gone.

536
00:26:43,998 --> 00:26:45,385
Stop saying the 828 passengers
are dead.

537
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:46,425
We're standing right here.

538
00:26:46,512 --> 00:26:47,965
How can you really be you?

539
00:26:48,295 --> 00:26:49,582
Logan didn't age.

540
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,145
He had these crazy visions,
heard voices,

541
00:26:52,232 --> 00:26:55,565
constantly saying
that he was gonna die again.

542
00:26:55,834 --> 00:26:57,225
He thought he was gonna die?

543
00:26:57,373 --> 00:26:59,315
He said he kept seeing
his own tombstone.

544
00:26:59,402 --> 00:27:00,793
He was obsessed with it.

545
00:27:00,881 --> 00:27:02,020
He had a Death Date Calling.

546
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:03,445
What?
It's real.

547
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:05,246
Frank, the passengers
are gonna die.

548
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:06,575
You're just as insane as he is.

549
00:27:06,662 --> 00:27:08,115
No, no, no.
Wait a minute.

550
00:27:08,202 --> 00:27:09,995
I wish it wasn't true,
but it is.

551
00:27:10,082 --> 00:27:11,217
I've seen it.

552
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:13,268
So has my sister and my son.

553
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:17,159
We are going to die
on June 2, 2024.

554
00:27:17,332 --> 00:27:18,577
What?

555
00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:22,293
TJ, I-I didn't mean for you
to find out like this.

556
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:23,925
- I promise. But I'm working on a solution.
- I got to go.

557
00:27:24,012 --> 00:27:25,175
TJ.

558
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:28,265
Did you say June 2, 2024?

559
00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:30,265
As in 6224?

560
00:27:30,428 --> 00:27:33,435
Yeah. Does that
mean something to you?

561
00:27:33,663 --> 00:27:34,855
Logan's vision.

562
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,514
I think I know why
he's holding up that bank.

563
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:40,275
He wants the key
to my safety deposit box.

564
00:27:48,372 --> 00:27:49,871
- Good news.
- What's going on?

565
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,764
We picked this up
from the Major's office

566
00:27:51,852 --> 00:27:53,295
just after your session.

567
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,455
<i>There's been a development.</i>

568
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,545
We're a go, immediately.

569
00:27:58,632 --> 00:28:00,808
Sent from
a classified comm line.

570
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,059
She bought the lie.

571
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,715
A meet-up would be
the next step.

572
00:28:03,802 --> 00:28:04,885
We'll be there.

573
00:28:04,972 --> 00:28:06,346
In which case, we got them?

574
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,267
We just might have.

575
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:21,910
Mick!
Mick, put your hands up!

576
00:28:21,998 --> 00:28:24,022
Don't shoot!
He's wounded!

577
00:28:24,178 --> 00:28:26,028
Whoa, whoa. Stand down.
That's not the gunman.

578
00:28:26,116 --> 00:28:27,365
Stand down.

579
00:28:27,514 --> 00:28:29,356
I'm gonna leave him here
and go back inside.

580
00:28:29,444 --> 00:28:31,535
You are not going back inside.

581
00:28:31,772 --> 00:28:33,811
Then I guess you're gonna
have to shoot me.

582
00:28:40,139 --> 00:28:42,585
Jared! Jared!

583
00:28:43,295 --> 00:28:45,021
This is the gunman's brother.
He's got the key.

584
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:46,942
No, get these civilians
out of here.

585
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,505
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

586
00:28:48,592 --> 00:28:50,345
We can end this peacefully
right now.

587
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:53,014
Just let him see his brother.
Let Frank give him the key.

588
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:58,233
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

589
00:28:58,321 --> 00:28:59,184
Never get it open.

590
00:28:59,272 --> 00:29:00,515
I have to.

591
00:29:00,602 --> 00:29:03,021
There's no other way.
Come on.

592
00:29:04,487 --> 00:29:06,110
Logan.

593
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,907
I'll contact ESU,
see if we can buy more time.

594
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,535
Don't come in here!

595
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:19,238
Stay out there!

596
00:29:19,348 --> 00:29:20,681
Logan, it's me.

597
00:29:27,704 --> 00:29:29,220
For God's sake, Logan.

598
00:29:29,337 --> 00:29:30,465
None of this would've happened

599
00:29:30,552 --> 00:29:32,055
if you had just
given me the key.

600
00:29:32,142 --> 00:29:34,715
But a gun?
Hostages?

601
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,975
How could you?
How could you?!

602
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,895
You abandoned me.

603
00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:43,489
My own brother told me
that I wasn't a human being.

604
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,735
I didn't understand.

605
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:50,742
Come on, Logan.
Please, give me the gun.

606
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:55,961
Come...

607
00:29:58,937 --> 00:30:00,150
Come on.

608
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:10,528
Let them finish.

609
00:30:14,473 --> 00:30:16,473
It's me, Frank.

610
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:19,749
It's me.

611
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:24,265
And I don't want to die.

612
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:14,562
I haven't held this in 10 years.

613
00:31:18,984 --> 00:31:19,984
Give it to me.

614
00:31:20,882 --> 00:31:22,192
I don't understand.
Just take it.

615
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,046
No, Dad passed it on to you.
You have to pass it on to me.

616
00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:29,140
Please.

617
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:34,830
Is this part
of the magic cure-all?

618
00:31:34,918 --> 00:31:36,296
I don't know.

619
00:31:42,062 --> 00:31:45,069
It's yours.
It was always yours.

620
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:04,614
"Bring him back."

621
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:06,724
It wasn't about Logan.
It was about his brother.

622
00:32:06,812 --> 00:32:08,522
At least with whatever time
he does have left,

623
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:10,164
he won't be alone.

624
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,830
Plenty of company at Rikers.

625
00:32:14,444 --> 00:32:16,206
Could you?
Just for a second?

626
00:32:16,294 --> 00:32:17,753
Yeah, uncuff him.

627
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,629
Everyone in
my grandfather's platoon died

628
00:32:24,717 --> 00:32:26,644
when they stormed Normandy.

629
00:32:27,342 --> 00:32:28,804
Everyone but him.

630
00:32:29,506 --> 00:32:33,585
This compass caught the bullet
that was meant to end his life.

631
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,286
He gave it to my dad.

632
00:32:35,374 --> 00:32:37,545
Saved him from
a pulmonary embolism.

633
00:32:37,704 --> 00:32:39,327
Now it's mine.

634
00:32:39,592 --> 00:32:41,382
It'll save me, too.

635
00:32:43,617 --> 00:32:45,957
I can't exactly take it
where I'm going.

636
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:51,291
I'd like you to hold on to it
for me while I'm away.

637
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,256
Maybe it'll help save
all the other passengers, too.

638
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:20,656
My portion of the Death Date
Calling was a peacock.

639
00:33:20,743 --> 00:33:22,116
It was the first step

640
00:33:22,203 --> 00:33:24,786
in understanding
we were going to die.

641
00:33:24,874 --> 00:33:26,319
Well, maybe this is
the first step

642
00:33:26,407 --> 00:33:28,157
in figuring out how we survive.

643
00:33:29,753 --> 00:33:32,166
I can't believe the Calling
brought you here.

644
00:33:32,253 --> 00:33:33,772
The Calling led me to Frank.

645
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:35,548
Jared brought me here.

646
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:40,606
Safety deposit box.

647
00:33:40,694 --> 00:33:42,154
6224.

648
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,147
We're gonna do this, Mick.

649
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:50,788
I don't know how,
but we're gonna crack it.

650
00:33:51,376 --> 00:33:52,836
Together.

651
00:33:53,936 --> 00:33:55,913
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

652
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:09,768
Give us a sec.

653
00:34:15,143 --> 00:34:16,286
Thank you.

654
00:34:16,374 --> 00:34:18,377
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah, you did.

655
00:34:18,843 --> 00:34:21,028
You vouched for me.
You called Ben.

656
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:24,605
You didn't have to.
You probably shouldn't have.

657
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:26,130
But...

658
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:28,915
you had my back.

659
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:46,006
Let's go get that looked at.

660
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:04,180
That was literally
the longest class of all time.

661
00:35:07,169 --> 00:35:08,828
Hi.

662
00:35:09,802 --> 00:35:11,320
Hey.

663
00:35:12,156 --> 00:35:14,641
So, your dad just chases down
these Callings,

664
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:17,273
always believing
he can solve them somehow?

665
00:35:18,643 --> 00:35:20,692
It's like you've
known him forever.

666
00:35:21,357 --> 00:35:23,983
You think he can solve the one
about the passengers dying?

667
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,981
Wait.

668
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:30,834
My dad told you
about the Death Date?

669
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:36,106
Any thoughts on how
we can stop it, SAT girl?

670
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,224
Maybe we could use the tesseract
to move through space and time.

671
00:35:47,086 --> 00:35:48,756
"A Wrinkle in Time."

672
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:53,841
That was you.

673
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,259
So you do remember me.

674
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,669
My dad's a great guy,

675
00:36:00,168 --> 00:36:03,997
but... he gets obsessed,

676
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:07,200
like he did
with my brother's cancer,

677
00:36:07,644 --> 00:36:09,857
like he's doing
with the Callings.

678
00:36:10,484 --> 00:36:14,647
He just always needs a solution,
an answer.

679
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,926
I guess that's why
he's a math guy.

680
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:21,724
Yeah, but...

681
00:36:22,782 --> 00:36:26,669
this constant need
to be in control of everything,

682
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,286
that comes from a place of fear.

683
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:33,466
We need to approach
this supposed Death Date

684
00:36:33,553 --> 00:36:35,146
from a place of hope.

685
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:38,489
How can we possibly do that?

686
00:36:39,462 --> 00:36:40,962
Let me show you.

687
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:58,245
Yo, Saanvi,
even though I'm no longer

688
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:02,546
on your proverbial payroll,
I thought some dinner might...

689
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:03,989
What the...

690
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,548
Hey.

691
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,392
Hey.

692
00:37:53,256 --> 00:37:54,970
I'm glad Mick is okay.

693
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:57,879
I'm glad you were there
with her.

694
00:38:01,143 --> 00:38:02,564
You were right.

695
00:38:03,205 --> 00:38:05,259
I am gonna fight like hell

696
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:08,220
to make sure we're all
at Olive's wedding.

697
00:38:09,478 --> 00:38:12,970
Good answer, because
I'm counting on a dance

698
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:15,150
with the father of the bride.

699
00:38:52,127 --> 00:38:54,247
Afraid you missed last call.

700
00:38:56,048 --> 00:38:57,845
You got plans?

701
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,353
What do you have in mind?

702
00:39:01,533 --> 00:39:03,619
How about we go
not have that dinner?

703
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:17,408
You okay?

704
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:19,853
I mean, apart from
this head wound.

705
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:22,244
Why?

706
00:39:22,332 --> 00:39:24,832
Why are you always trying
to save me?

707
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,356
Because, Zeke,
you're a good man.

708
00:39:29,486 --> 00:39:31,494
Whether you believe it or not.

709
00:39:31,644 --> 00:39:34,353
You'll come around.
I know that.

710
00:39:35,372 --> 00:39:37,204
All I've got is eight months.

711
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,907
Don't say that.

712
00:39:39,073 --> 00:39:40,884
This compass,
it could be a clue,

713
00:39:40,972 --> 00:39:43,158
and we will find a way
to really save you.

714
00:39:44,453 --> 00:39:46,173
But you already have.

715
00:39:55,634 --> 00:39:58,119
"A good heart
goes a long way."

716
00:39:58,933 --> 00:40:00,408

It's empty, sir.

736
00:41:19,053 --> 00:41:21,071
See what nearby cameras
picked up.

737
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:33,266
Sometimes covering up a tell
is the tell.

738
00:41:33,415 --> 00:41:35,186
This isn't on you.

739
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:36,626
We were David.

740
00:41:36,975 --> 00:41:39,478
She was Goliath.

741
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,446
She took my work.

742
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:43,406
She took everything.

743
00:41:44,453 --> 00:41:46,461
It... It was just
dummy test work.

744
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:48,406
I had to keep up my research,

745
00:41:48,575 --> 00:41:51,070
so I created a secret lab
at home.

746
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,296
Well, you fooled me.

747
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:58,070
Vance, I think I figured out
how to control the 828 anomaly,

748
00:41:58,158 --> 00:42:00,899
how to isolate it, eliminate it,
and replicate it,

749
00:42:00,993 --> 00:42:02,883
and now
the Major knows it all.

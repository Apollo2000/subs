1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,505
Previously on "Manifest"...

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,620
Oh, no, no.

3
00:00:05,622 --> 00:00:07,689
We are very much
treating this fire as a crime.

4
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:09,488
Detective Stone's
firsthand account indicates

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,135
this might have been arson committed by

6
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:13,395
a disgruntled member of
the Church of the Believers.

7
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:15,063
Did they find the church leader yet,

8
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:17,332
- Adrian Shannon?
- Still at large.

9
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:20,402
You know you have like-minded
friends at the NYPD.

10
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:22,404
If Michaela Stone goes on the offensive,

11
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:23,738
your friends will have your back.

12
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,407
What happened to nonviolence?

13
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:27,642
Michaela Stone is a threat.

14
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:29,844
I had nothing to do with the fire.

15
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:31,913
You had motive and opportunity.

16
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:33,848
No, it's a smokescreen,
and you're falling for it.

17
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,818
- Jared Vasquez is an Xer.
- Michaela.

18
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,087
Michaela Stone, you're
under arrest for arson,

19
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:40,855
conspiracy to commit
arson, and homicide.

20
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:42,691
You are never gonna
live this down, Jared!

21
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:44,259
You have to keep your mouth shut.

22
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:46,161
I just saved your life.

23
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:53,101
Can I get some headphones?

24
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:54,836
Here you go, sweetheart.

25
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:56,738
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in

26
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,407
the final boarding process
for Montego Air Flight 828...

27
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:01,509
- Headset, anyone?
- I'll take one. Thanks.

28
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:05,113
... nonstop service to
New York. Welcome aboard.

29
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:08,216
Amen, amen.

30
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:10,619
I always say a little
prayer before a flight.

31
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:12,754
Brings me peace of mind.

32
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:15,957
My dad was a preacher,
so we prayed all the time.

33
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,627
Stayed up at night praying
God would make me worthy.

34
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:21,896
You are worthy in God's eyes.

35
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:24,699
Not my dad's. He made that very clear,

36
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:27,969
so I finally got up off my
knees and walked away.

37
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:30,605
And I'm still gonna pray for you.

38
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:32,741
Yeah, well, don't worry about me.

39
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:37,145
They need to worry about Adrian.

40
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:38,905
I mean, the NYPD should
be trying to find him

41
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:40,596
instead of trying to pin the fire on me.

42
00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:41,983
I'm still trying to get you out.

43
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:44,052
Need anything? Water?

44
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:45,487
No.

45
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:49,090
- Zeke.
- You okay?

46
00:01:49,092 --> 00:01:51,760
Yeah, I'm fine.

47
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:53,328
I can't believe Jared arrested you.

48
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,829
He knows you didn't do it.

49
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,831
There's something else going on here.

50
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,001
- What?
- I don't know exactly, but...

51
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:02,570
Jared said something. He
said he was saving my life.

52
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:04,506
I don't care what he said.

53
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:06,574
His actions have made it
pretty clear that he's an Xer.

54
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:10,011
He's probably just covering his ass.

55
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:11,513
Why do you still trust this guy?

56
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:13,815
I don't know. After
everything that's happened,

57
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:15,150
I shouldn't, but...

58
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:17,152
But you always see the best in everyone?

59
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:27,195
Zeke, when are Saanvi's
treatments gonna start working?

60
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:30,031
Visit's over. He needs to go.

61
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:32,467
Ben and I are getting a lawyer
and getting you out of here.

62
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:34,769
Hurry.

63
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:36,137
Jared, talk to me, please.

64
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:39,174
What is going on?

65
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:40,842
Just keep your mouth shut.

66
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:54,489
Well, that's a relief.
Bye. Excuse me, ma'am.

67
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,891
I don't think you
should be lifting that.

68
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,693
She wants bacon.

69
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:02,163
And she strongly suggests
you do not get in our way.

70
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:05,366
Only 29 weeks old and
already running the place.

71
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:06,801
I love it!

72
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:08,036
Who was that on the phone?

73
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:11,339
Uh, Teresa Yin, the
attorney who got Zeke out.

74
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:12,741
She's taking on Michaela's case.

75
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:14,642
I'm headed there now.

76
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:16,711
It's crazy to me that anyone would think

77
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:18,580
that Mick was involved in that arson.

78
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:21,216
The only thing the police need
to focus on is finding Adrian.

79
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:23,518
But wasn't it Isaiah who set the fire?

80
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,320
I thought you said
Adrian looked shocked?

81
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:27,188
He could've conned us.

82
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,225
At the very least, Adrian
created a murderer.

83
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:32,260
So horrible.

84
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:36,064
Who would plan something so...

85
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:42,871
Help.

86
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:44,005
Help.

87
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:47,175
Help me!

88
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:53,615
"Help me"?

89
00:03:53,617 --> 00:03:56,417
I just had a Calling.

90
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:57,852
Thanks for the smoothie.

91
00:03:57,854 --> 00:03:59,721
Well, that's what older sisters are for.

92
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:01,790
Well, technically, I'm older.

93
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,458
I was born before you.

94
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,560
Okay, a minute and a half before.

95
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:07,695
Eh, it still counts.

96
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:10,698
How are we gonna explain that to a baby?

97
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,034
Twins separated by five years?

98
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:14,636
The plane disappearing and coming back.

99
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:15,770
The Callings?

100
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:18,873
Voices, visions...

101
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,608
We should make the baby a guidebook,

102
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,279
sort of like a "welcome to
our weird family" road map

103
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,748
with pictures and captions,

104
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,283
and then when she gets old enough,

105
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:29,818
we can read it to her.
What do you think?

106
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,920
Work with my older-younger sister

107
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:35,323
to make something for my
younger-younger sister.

108
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:37,058
I'm in.

109
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,227
And that is why we need a guidebook.

110
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:41,963
Let's go get some supplies.

111
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:43,832
- What's going on?
- Her lawyer's here.

112
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:45,466
She's getting out.

113
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:49,208
But this isn't over.

114
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:57,912
I've got this covered.

115
00:04:57,914 --> 00:04:59,514
Simon told me to handle it.

116
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,983
I'm gonna offer to give her a ride.

117
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:04,485
We'll find ourselves
in a rough neighborhood.

118
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:05,820
And she doesn't find her way out.

119
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:07,155
That plan's not gonna work anymore

120
00:05:07,157 --> 00:05:09,023
'cause she's leaving with her lawyer.

121
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:11,125
- No, that's correct, ma'am.
- Don't worry.

122
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:13,595
I know exactly how to
deal with Michaela Stone.

123
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:15,530
- Ma'am, calm down.
- Okay.

124
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,365
But I'm telling Simon
this was your call.

125
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:19,200
Good. 'Cause it is.

126
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,873
Any of these?

127
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,208
No. It... It was kind of like this one,

128
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,843
but the shoreline was rockier.

129
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:31,980
Alright, "New York,
river, bridge, rocks"?

130
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:35,683
There was a minaret or something
like that on the opposite side.

131
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:38,620
Did you hear anything?

132
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:40,288
A train whistle, I think.

133
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:45,627
That's it.

134
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:46,728
High Bridge.

135
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,463
That's where I was.

136
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:51,032
Crosses the Harlem River.

137
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:58,740
I can't get over how
real the Callings feel.

138
00:05:58,742 --> 00:06:02,210
This is exactly what I saw.

139
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:06,180
I don't hear any cries for help, though.

140
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:08,917
So, we wait?

141
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:14,055
It's Michaela.

142
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:15,089
She's out.

143
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:16,724
Oh, thank God.

144
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:21,429
Ben?

145
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:23,531
Someone's watching us.

146
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:28,536
No, no, no! Wait!

147
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:30,405
Stop!

148
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:35,109
Adrian.

149
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:38,436
Where the hell have you
been, you son of a bitch?

150
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:39,771
The whole world's been looking for you.

151
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:41,239
I don't want to be found, okay?

152
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:43,857
You're a suspect in
a murder investigation.

153
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:45,125
That's not gonna happen.

154
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:47,094
Adrian? Oh, my God.

155
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:48,629
We're taking him straight
to the police station.

156
00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:51,131
Wait. This can't be a coincidence.

157
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:53,601
What are you doing here, of all places?

158
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:55,369
A Calling.

159
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:57,104
Tried to ignore it, but it got louder.

160
00:06:57,106 --> 00:06:59,306
Finally gave in. Walked all
the way here from Queens,

161
00:06:59,308 --> 00:07:01,875
dodging cop cars and traffic
cams the whole way.

162
00:07:01,877 --> 00:07:04,011
We can't turn him in.

163
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:05,679
Are you kidding? The
Calling helped us find him,

164
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:08,148
and he's got to be held accountable.

165
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,484
Ben, why would the
Calling bring us together

166
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:14,221
all the way out here only for
us to bring him all the way back?

00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:51,085
I got the photos to glue in.

188
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:52,486
And I dug up some stickers

189
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:54,321
that I think could help tell the story.

190
00:08:54,323 --> 00:08:57,925
So, now how are we
gonna explain Callings

191
00:08:57,927 --> 00:09:00,427
to the baby?

192
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:02,262
What if we just show one?

193
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:03,597
Your drawings.

194
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:07,434
Yes, that's... that's perfect.

195
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:10,838
Um, let's find a happier one.

196
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,439
Yeah, not a lot of those.

197
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:16,510
True, but they've led
to so many happy endings.

198
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:18,746
You found Zeke with this drawing.

199
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:22,249
And, um, this one,

200
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:24,752
you helped save those
people under the warehouse.

201
00:09:24,754 --> 00:09:27,020
I guess there were
a lot of happy endings.

202
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,291
What's this one?

203
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:33,527
It was the first one I ever drew,

204
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:37,131
and I actually never
figured out what it meant.

205
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39,433
It still kind of creeps me out.

206
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:46,006
Okay. Well, let's just
go with this one, then.

207
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:49,143
And we could add a picture
of Zeke now with Auntie Mick

208
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:51,278
just to show how
great it all turned out.

209
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,894
Can you please tell me what's going on?

210
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:08,328
My mind is about to explode.

211
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,997
This your first time back here?

212
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,064
Yeah. You?

213
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:15,235
While you were... gone...

214
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:17,404
I came here a lot.

215
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:20,707
Whenever I wanted to
talk to you, I'd come here...

216
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:23,477
when I wanted your blessing
to start seeing Lourdes,

217
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:26,180
when your mom died,
when the plane came back.

218
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:28,348
I mean, I even came here when
you took me down in court.

219
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,884
Jared, I have to tell you
how sorry I am about that.

220
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:33,587
And, that time, it didn't
make me feel better.

221
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:35,823
In fact, it made me feel worse.

222
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:38,091
So I walked into a bar

223
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:41,862
and ended up clicking
with the bartender.

224
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:44,498
And then I realized I was
in the belly of the beast.

225
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,099
The Xers.

226
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:52,206
So you joined them because of me.

227
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,740
I did.

228
00:10:53,742 --> 00:10:55,209
Because the best way
to destroy a hate group

229
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:56,877
is to blow it up from the inside.

230
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:04,184
- Oh, my God.
- You said you'd never feel safe

231
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:06,019
- with them out there.
- You've been undercover?

232
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:07,120
Why didn't you tell me?

233
00:11:07,122 --> 00:11:08,388
Because I needed you to believe

234
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,724
I was in so deep that they'd believe.

235
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:14,561
It took a lot to gain their trust, Mick.

236
00:11:14,563 --> 00:11:15,863
The blown police raid.

237
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:18,198
You were right. I tipped them off.

238
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,267
I turned you in to I.A. for that.

239
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:23,070
You can't help being a good cop.

240
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:26,373
You know what the thing
that killed me the most was?

241
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,375
That you bought it.

242
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:30,077
Yeah.

243
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,312
You were convincing.

244
00:11:32,314 --> 00:11:34,581
Guess you can't help
being a good cop, either.

245
00:11:39,788 --> 00:11:41,755
The bartender, she's one of them?

246
00:11:41,757 --> 00:11:46,093
No, but she loves her brother,
and he is one of the worst.

247
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:48,228
You really care for her?

248
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,297
Yeah, I do.

249
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:53,834
I, um, have to tell you something.

250
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:56,603
I bugged her bar.

251
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:58,305
And I have to tell you something.

252
00:11:58,307 --> 00:11:59,940
I know.

253
00:12:02,144 --> 00:12:04,077
Okay.

254
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,513
I'm all in. I want to help.

255
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:09,016
In the Calling, I heard
a voice yelling for help.

256
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:10,851
Same.

257
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:12,152
I tried to ignore it,

258
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:14,187
but, my God, the
Callings are manipulative.

259
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:15,989
Says the cult leader.

260
00:12:15,991 --> 00:12:17,457
I created a religion.

261
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,259
Well, your religion led
one of your followers

262
00:12:19,261 --> 00:12:20,460
to murder people in a fire...

263
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:22,195
That wasn't my fault!

264
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:23,964
The Calling was
responsible for that fire.

265
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:25,299
What?

266
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:26,967
How exactly?

267
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:28,802
I got a vision of a burned-out airplane

268
00:12:28,804 --> 00:12:31,772
with dead passengers everywhere,
and it freaked me out.

269
00:12:31,774 --> 00:12:33,473
So I went to my right-hand, Isaiah,

270
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:36,476
told him what I had seen, right
down to the champagne glasses,

271
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:38,478
and then he made it all come true.

272
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,847
No, this is on you.
You created a monster

273
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:43,317
by making Isaiah think
we're all immortal.

274
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:45,052
The Calling was warning you to stop.

275
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:46,820
You don't know that!

276
00:12:46,822 --> 00:12:49,323
You follow the Callings blindly.

277
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:50,986
Have you even considered the possibility

278
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:54,227
that they create more bad than good?

279
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:55,662
No, I refuse to believe that.

280
00:12:55,664 --> 00:12:58,665
The Callings have saved so many people.

281
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,567
"Signs and wonders".

282
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:02,235
Sorry, what?

283
00:13:02,237 --> 00:13:03,904
Where do these Callings come from?

284
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:05,339
Do you ever ask yourself?

285
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:06,907
Only every day.

286
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:11,144
Grace is right. You're
here for a reason.

287
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:12,403
Maybe the Calling is trying

288
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:13,747
- to restore your faith.
- Ben?

289
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:16,216
Wish I could believe that.

290
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:18,652
My water just broke.

291
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:20,921
It's too early. Come on.

292
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:24,358
What am I supposed to do now?

293
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,259
I don't give a damn what you do, Adrian.

294
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:28,662
I've got to get my wife to the hospital.

295
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:34,973
Can someone please tell
us what's happening?

296
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:36,308
Where's Dr. Elbaz?

297
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,247
Away. She wasn't expecting this delivery

298
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:39,678
for another two months.

299
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,947
Grace has some internal bleeding.

300
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:45,117
It sometimes happens when
there's been a prior trauma.

301
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:46,185
The car accident.

302
00:13:46,187 --> 00:13:47,352
Is the baby okay?

303
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:48,520
She's stable right now,

304
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:50,355
but your blood pressure is dropping.

305
00:13:50,357 --> 00:13:52,291
- What's the solution?
- Normally, delivery.

306
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:53,692
Great, so let's deliver.

307
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:55,627
29 weeks is early, but
she'd make it, right?

308
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:56,995
Unfortunately, we can't.

309
00:13:56,997 --> 00:13:59,531
You have a condition
called placenta percreta.

310
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:02,334
The placenta has invaded
the surrounding tissue.

311
00:14:02,336 --> 00:14:03,669
That's what has ruptured,

312
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:05,637
making this a much more complicated

313
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,206
and more dangerous surgery.

314
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,540
You'd be risking your life.

315
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:10,175
There are a handful of specialists

316
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:11,877
who are qualified to perform this.

317
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,178
We're trying to locate them now.

318
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,713
Okay, how long will that take?

319
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:15,948
We have calls out.

320
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,182
There's someone here in town,

321
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:18,383
but he isn't responding.

322
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:19,618
We found someone in Boston.

323
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,320
She can be here in five hours.

324
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:25,057
Can the baby hold on that long?

325
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:26,692
We hope so.

326
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:44,810
There she is.

327
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:46,378
It's about time, Stone.

328
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,679
You can hide behind your lawyer

329
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:49,414
to avoid questions about the crime,

330
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,251
but you're damn well gonna
answer questions about your job.

331
00:14:52,253 --> 00:14:53,986
My office, now!

332
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:55,654
You, too, Vasquez.

333
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:01,193
And I want to make sure
you're both comfortable,

334
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:03,929
'cause you're gonna be
spending a lot of time with me.

335
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:10,335
Welcome to the team, Stone.

336
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:15,073
Who the hell are you?

337
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:16,675
What do you want from us?

338
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:23,248
Help!

339
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,784
Help! Help!

340
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:29,021
Aah!

341
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,127
Help!

342
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:38,564
Help! Help me!

343
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:44,636
Help me!

344
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,949
It took me a while to figure out

345
00:15:56,951 --> 00:16:00,485
exactly who was at the top
of the Xer's food chain.

346
00:16:00,487 --> 00:16:01,787
Simon White.

347
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:03,655
Professor at Astoria.

348
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:04,723
I've met him before.

349
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:06,091
He's in Ben's department.

350
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:07,659
He's a classic hate-group figurehead.

351
00:16:07,661 --> 00:16:09,294
He uses academic credentials

352
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:12,164
to gain all sorts of followers
in fringe online forums,

353
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,667
meantime tapping uneducated
recruits to start violence.

354
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:17,769
While keeping his nose clean.

355
00:16:17,771 --> 00:16:19,338
That's what makes him so dangerous.

356
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,274
He's convinced himself
that 828ers are terrorists

357
00:16:22,276 --> 00:16:26,345
controlled by evil voices
you all hear in your heads.

358
00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:28,013
Whatever gave him that idea?

359
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:31,283
Wild conclusions based
on his own digging around.

360
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:37,356
Oh, my God. These are Ben's boards.

361
00:16:37,358 --> 00:16:40,092
His place is to release damning
information about you all,

362
00:16:40,094 --> 00:16:42,694
get other people worked up.

363
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:44,930
Incite them to attack passengers.

364
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:47,499
Problem is, I can't
anything to stick in court.

365
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:49,434
Even when he gave the
green light to kill you,

366
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:51,670
he still didn't say enough
to incriminate himself.

367
00:16:51,672 --> 00:16:53,705
This guy's careful.

368
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:55,774
So you guys don't have anything on him?

369
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:58,176
We could pick him up
on lesser charges...

370
00:16:58,178 --> 00:17:00,208
conspiracy to illegally obtain
your confidential records...

371
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,313
That gives you mail fraud.

372
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:03,115
- Sneaking into Ben's garage?
- That's a slap on the wrist,

373
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:04,883
- and you'd have to blow your cover.
- And I'd have to blow my cover.

374
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:07,152
Is this what it's like
when you two get along?

375
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:09,821
Yeah, afraid so.

376
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:11,957
Okay, then. Then let's
put our heads together

377
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,126
and figure out a way to
nail Simon to the wall.

378
00:17:16,397 --> 00:17:17,863
Tamara wants me to come by the bar.

379
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:19,031
Go.

380
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:20,832
Check in with us in an hour.

381
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:22,567
Have to keep up appearances.

382
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,636
Speaking of keeping up appearances.

383
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:26,728
And you find that paperwork,

384
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,374
and you don't come back until you do!

385
00:17:31,545 --> 00:17:35,247
See? I can be fun.

386
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:36,748
Oh, my God.

387
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,383
I swallowed a lot of water.

388
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:42,387
You're a miracle.

389
00:17:42,389 --> 00:17:44,723
I'm not. I promise you.

390
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:47,592
Let's get you to a hospital.

391
00:17:47,594 --> 00:17:49,928
Look how grumpy you looked here.

392
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,164
I had been enjoying
life as an only child

393
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,332
for an amazing 90 seconds

394
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:57,769
until you came along
and stole my thunder.

395
00:17:57,771 --> 00:18:02,074
Well, I was an only
child for 5 and a half years,

396
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:04,242
and I prefer having a sibling.

397
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:06,178
Siblings.

398
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,679
Yeah. Me, too.

399
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:13,218
- TJ?
- Dad.

400
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:18,390
Hey, Dad. We're just...

401
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,764
Oh, no.

402
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:28,533
Oh, no.

403
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:31,770
Okay. We'll be right there.

404
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:35,373
It's Mom.

405
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,975
They're on their way.

406
00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:38,310
You want me to call Mick?

407
00:18:38,312 --> 00:18:40,445
Not yet.

408
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:44,082
I just need it to be
the four of us together.

409
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:47,319
We're gonna figure it out, okay?

410
00:18:47,321 --> 00:18:48,754
We're going home together.

411
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,160
- What does that mean?
- It's the blood-pressure monitor.

412
00:18:55,162 --> 00:18:56,928
Let me go grab the doctor.

413
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:03,769
I want the surgery.

414
00:19:03,771 --> 00:19:07,005
I don't care who does
it or what happens to me.

415
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:08,673
I just want my baby safe.

416
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:10,342
Grace, you could die. You heard him.

417
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:12,677
- He... The doctor said...
- I'll take that risk.

418
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:15,313
The minute our baby is in danger,

419
00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:17,582
we have to get her out.

420
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:19,818
We have to save her.

421
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,488
It's our job as parents

422
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,658
to take care of our kids...

423
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,094
no matter what.

424
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:32,297
Promise me.

425
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:38,003
Uh...

426
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:41,039
Uh, okay.

427
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,774
Grace? Grace.

428
00:19:42,776 --> 00:19:45,110
Grace? What's happening?!

429
00:19:45,112 --> 00:19:46,978
Excuse me.

430
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,848
Baby's crashing.

431
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,117
Your wife can survive this
with a few transfusions,

432
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:54,452
but I don't think your baby will.

433
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:56,555
- She... She wants the surgery.
- I don't advise that.

434
00:19:56,557 --> 00:19:58,323
I have never done this surgery before.

435
00:19:58,325 --> 00:20:00,392
I understand that.
Can you save the baby?

436
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:02,894
Yes. But your wife could die.

437
00:20:02,896 --> 00:20:04,329
Save the baby.

438
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:05,797
It's what Grace wants.

439
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,966
Just wait till my kids get here.

440
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:09,067
Okay.

441
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:11,036
We'll prep her.

442
00:20:18,044 --> 00:20:19,578
Hey.

443
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,513
- Tamara, what's going on?
- It's Billy.

444
00:20:21,515 --> 00:20:22,848
What he do?

445
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,917
He's really gone too far this time.

446
00:20:29,422 --> 00:20:31,056
Look who I found.

447
00:20:44,301 --> 00:20:45,800
Hey. Gimme your phone.

448
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:47,835
- What?
- Gimme your damn phone.

449
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:54,709
- Yo, Billy, man, what the hell?!
- He had you in his contacts!

450
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,344
I think he's been tracking you.

451
00:20:56,346 --> 00:20:58,913
This is the guy

452
00:20:58,915 --> 00:21:02,417
your ex-fiancée threw you
under the bus for, right?

453
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:04,740
- Yeah, how'd you find him?
- When your ex got off scot-free,

454
00:21:04,742 --> 00:21:06,888
the three of us were
gonna welcome her home,

455
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,524
but then this guy showed up instead.

456
00:21:09,526 --> 00:21:11,893
So we roughed him up a
little to send her a message,

457
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,562
and we figured that you might
want to take a crack at him.

458
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,833
Hey, and guess what else we figured out.

459
00:21:18,835 --> 00:21:21,836
His face is all over Ben Stone's wall.

460
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,744
You did good.

461
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:33,014
Come on.

462
00:21:33,016 --> 00:21:35,283
What? What, where we going?

463
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:38,353
Just shut up and follow me.

464
00:21:38,355 --> 00:21:40,188
It's weird that Jared
hasn't checked in yet.

465
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,024
He had 60 minutes. It's been... 64?

466
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:45,546
Exactly. To Jared, 60
minutes is 60 minutes,

467
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:48,051
unless he can't step away.

468
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:49,171
So what do you want to do?

469
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:50,598
'Cause I'm not about to blow his cover.

470
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,704
Wait, no, no. H-He doesn't
have to check in with us.

471
00:21:52,706 --> 00:21:54,573
We can check in with him.

472
00:21:54,575 --> 00:21:56,141
I bugged that bar, remember?

473
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:58,210
Yeah, but that doesn't
mean that we should listen

474
00:21:58,212 --> 00:22:00,712
to anything that he...

475
00:22:00,714 --> 00:22:02,981
You know you have trust issues.

476
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:04,549
Yeah, I've been told.

477
00:22:06,854 --> 00:22:09,721
Well, you need to hurry
before Billy does something stupid.

478
00:22:09,723 --> 00:22:11,857
I'm scared to death.

479
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:13,558
Hey, listen to me.

480
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,327
I got this, okay?

481
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:17,596
Just take off.

482
00:22:17,598 --> 00:22:21,099
Seriously, go.

483
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:22,701
Okay.

484
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:30,208
Hey, why you dragging me back out here?

485
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,711
Uh, I need a drink. So do you.

486
00:22:32,713 --> 00:22:34,079
That was a big move,

487
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:35,547
you bringing this guy
back here like that.

488
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:38,550
Eh, he's not as tough as he looks.

489
00:22:42,456 --> 00:22:44,689
Zeke. His name's Zeke.

490
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:45,790
They have Zeke.

491
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:47,359
We have to move in now.

492
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:51,263
Let's just take a
moment and think, okay?

493
00:22:56,703 --> 00:22:58,770
Wait. Sorry, hold on.

494
00:23:01,975 --> 00:23:03,385
This song. That's our song.

495
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:04,442
He knows we're listening right now.

496
00:23:04,444 --> 00:23:06,144
Alright, listen to me carefully.

497
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:07,612
- You got to trust me on this.
- ♪ Saying "I love you" ♪

498
00:23:07,614 --> 00:23:09,147
He wants us to hold off.

499
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:10,615
What's with the music? You want to...

500
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:11,883
You want to slow-dance with me?

501
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:14,719
It's just a little white noise.

502
00:23:14,721 --> 00:23:17,923
Billy, I'm not sure I trust your guys.

503
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:19,658
Look, man, this is a serious situation.

504
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,259
We need to bring Simon in on this now.

505
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:22,994
Why would we do that?
He's gonna be pissed at me

506
00:23:22,996 --> 00:23:24,996
- for "going rogue".
- Nah, man. Think about it.

507
00:23:24,998 --> 00:23:27,232
I mean, this guy is up on Ben's wall?

508
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:28,800
That's got to mean something.

509
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:30,769
Simon will know exactly
how to handle the situation.

510
00:23:30,771 --> 00:23:33,939
Eh... I don't know.

511
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:37,309
Look, you bringing Zeke
into the back room...

514
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:44,082
Even if he wasn't tied up,
we got him three on one...

515
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:46,585
four on one now, and Jarecki's packing.

516
00:23:49,122 --> 00:23:51,022
So are you.

517
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:52,824
I only wish I would've
made that move myself.

518
00:23:52,826 --> 00:23:54,492
You're proactive.

519
00:23:54,494 --> 00:23:58,463
Simon's gonna finally
realize how valuable you are.

520
00:23:58,465 --> 00:24:00,599
Okay. I'm just gonna say

521
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:02,601
that we have a major development,

522
00:24:02,603 --> 00:24:04,769
and he should get his ass over here.

523
00:24:06,773 --> 00:24:08,707
Damn it if you two
aren't Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

524
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:10,342
We can tap in to the feed from a phone.

525
00:24:10,344 --> 00:24:13,612
I'll get a team.

- Oh, my God. Mom.
- Mom!

531
00:24:34,368 --> 00:24:36,401
The baby's heart rate is dropping.

532
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:38,403
The surgeon's still three hours away.

533
00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:41,906
If you want me to do the
surgery, we need to do it now.

534
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:45,710
I understand. Let's do it.

535
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:52,984
You're gonna be okay.

536
00:24:54,988 --> 00:24:56,821
You have to be okay.

Please.

538
00:25:09,536 --> 00:25:10,735
Stop.

539
00:25:10,737 --> 00:25:12,404
Stop, stop. I'm changing my mind.

540
00:25:12,406 --> 00:25:13,838
We're not doing the surgery.

541
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,373
Grace said we have
to take care of the kids,

542
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,509
and that's what I'm gonna
do. No surgery. Just...

543
00:25:17,511 --> 00:25:19,210
give her the transfusions.

544
00:25:19,212 --> 00:25:21,246
Just save my wife.

545
00:25:25,285 --> 00:25:27,585
Everything will turn out well.

546
00:25:27,587 --> 00:25:31,456
Laboratory, dial 5-1-2, 5-1-2.

547
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:33,091
Oh. Are you family?

548
00:25:33,093 --> 00:25:34,359
No. Sorry, I should just leave.

549
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:35,860
No. He can stay.

550
00:25:35,862 --> 00:25:37,629
This man saved my life.

551
00:25:37,631 --> 00:25:39,531
- Oh, I don't know if I really saved your...
- No, I know.

552
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:42,200
If you hadn't come out
of nowhere, I'd be dead.

553
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:44,369
Wow. Well, you are very much alive.

554
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:45,637
Labs check out.

555
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:47,572
X-rays show no water in the lungs.

556
00:25:47,574 --> 00:25:49,274
You're good to go.

557
00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:54,245
Guess you'll need these back.

558
00:25:54,247 --> 00:25:56,314
You really have been
a miracle. Thank you.

559
00:25:56,316 --> 00:25:57,723
- Excuse me.
- You know, if...

560
00:25:57,725 --> 00:25:59,217
if there's any way I can help you out.

561
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:00,385
- Oh, no, thanks.
- Excuse me?

562
00:26:00,387 --> 00:26:03,321
Stop!

563
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:06,124
Oh, my God. I can't
believe I just found you.

564
00:26:12,598 --> 00:26:15,400
I hope this is important.
We have a busy afternoon.

565
00:26:15,402 --> 00:26:18,403
Yeah, sorry for the 911, but
you're gonna want to see this.

566
00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:27,445
Hey, Simon. Look who we found.

567
00:26:27,447 --> 00:26:30,148
It's Zeke from Ben Stone's wall.

568
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,584
I know who it is.

569
00:26:32,586 --> 00:26:34,619
What is he doing here?

570
00:26:34,621 --> 00:26:35,820
We thought you'd be impressed.

571
00:26:35,822 --> 00:26:38,423
This is not the plan.

572
00:26:40,694 --> 00:26:43,428
Well, we got him now.
Should we just let him go?

573
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,865
The minute we release this
guy, he's gonna call the cops,

574
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:48,333
and then we'll all be implicated.

575
00:26:48,335 --> 00:26:51,002
It's puts everything
I've planned at risk!

576
00:26:51,004 --> 00:26:53,338
So don't release him.

577
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,939
Get rid of him.

578
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:56,040
And blame Michaela Stone.

579
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:58,176
He's the guy who shot her, right?

580
00:26:58,178 --> 00:26:59,778
It'll look like revenge.

581
00:27:03,283 --> 00:27:05,116
Is Mom gonna be okay?

582
00:27:05,118 --> 00:27:06,217
Yeah, buddy.

583
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:07,519
She needs a blood transfusion,

584
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:10,155
but she's gonna come through this.

585
00:27:10,157 --> 00:27:12,891
Hey, guys, you mind waiting outside?

586
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:23,468
The transfusion has started.

587
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,970
We should see an improvement
in your wife soon.

588
00:27:25,972 --> 00:27:29,407
But the fetal heart rate is dropping.

589
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:30,842
I'm so sorry.

590
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:35,880
Can I have a minute?

591
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:49,894
I need you to know

592
00:27:49,896 --> 00:27:52,831
I'm doing this for Cal and Olive.

593
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,432
They can't lose you.

594
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:00,171
Neither can I.

595
00:28:00,173 --> 00:28:03,107
I love you too damn much.

596
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:05,743
Or maybe I don't love
you enough, not enough

597
00:28:05,745 --> 00:28:09,948
to put what you'd want
ahead of what I want.

598
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,683
Because I want you, Grace.

599
00:28:15,755 --> 00:28:19,858
And I know you'd give your
life to protect this baby.

600
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,862
But you're not here, so...

601
00:28:23,864 --> 00:28:27,232
I need you to please...

602
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:29,300
please forgive me.

603
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:39,544
You sweet...

604
00:28:39,546 --> 00:28:42,647
sweet baby girl.

605
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:44,582
I'm so sorry.

606
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:46,217
I'm stacking the deck against you,

607
00:28:46,219 --> 00:28:47,986
and you're not even born yet.

608
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:54,492
I know the odds are slim, but...

609
00:28:58,498 --> 00:29:00,598
... I have faith.

610
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,803
I have faith you're
gonna make it somehow.

611
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:09,107
I just... I just do.

612
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:12,911
And if you do make it,

613
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:14,646
you'll be the luckiest
baby girl in the world,

614
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:16,748
because you have the world's...

615
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:21,953
... world's best mom.

616
00:29:21,955 --> 00:29:23,488
I need to do this.

617
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,357
I'm sorry.

618
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,792
I need you to fight.

619
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:36,701
I found him. He was downstairs.

620
00:29:36,703 --> 00:29:38,469
- What do you mean?
- This is the specialist

621
00:29:38,471 --> 00:29:40,705
I told you about. We couldn't reach him.

622
00:29:40,707 --> 00:29:42,941
- Oh, my God.
- This is the patient?

623
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:45,276
- Grace, is it?
- Uh, yes.

624
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:48,146
Uh, they said you could
save my wife and my baby?

625
00:29:48,148 --> 00:29:50,114
I've done this surgery many times,

626
00:29:50,116 --> 00:29:51,683
but the baby's heart
rate has been dropping.

627
00:29:51,685 --> 00:29:52,717
We need to go now.

628
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:54,319
Yeah, yeah, okay.

629
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:01,292
You can't come, sir.

630
00:30:01,294 --> 00:30:03,828
Uh, what... what can I do?

631
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,830
You can pray.

632
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:17,178
Imagine how the world
would feel about 828ers

633
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,182
if one of them just stone-cold
assassinated her boyfriend.

634
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,985
They'd lose every ounce of sympathy.

635
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:25,420
Then we release all

636
00:30:25,422 --> 00:30:28,923
the incriminating intel we've gathered.

637
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:31,152
It would have a much bigger impact.

638
00:30:31,154 --> 00:30:33,354
You can plant something,
some piece of evidence

639
00:30:33,356 --> 00:30:36,191
that points to Michaela
or her brother or both?

640
00:30:36,193 --> 00:30:38,393
Yeah. I can.

641
00:30:38,395 --> 00:30:39,767
Good.

642
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:41,369
Let's do this.

643
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:45,406
Simon? You good with that?

644
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:47,542
Yes.

645
00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:49,911
Just make sure you keep this clean

646
00:30:49,913 --> 00:30:51,536
and keep us out of it.

647
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:53,438
Not a problem. You two can roll.

648
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,007
He got them. He got both of them.

649
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:56,842
Going in. They've got a
hostage and at least two guns.

650
00:30:56,844 --> 00:30:58,510
Could be a powder keg.

651
00:31:07,314 --> 00:31:08,737
Don't say a word.

652
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:25,634
This man has destroyed my life.

653
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:28,664
It's gonna feel so good to
put a bullet in his head.

654
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:31,813
If anyone does this, it's me.

655
00:31:31,815 --> 00:31:33,415
Give me the gun.

656
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:44,760
Any last words?

657
00:31:44,762 --> 00:31:47,763
I told Mick she couldn't trust you.

658
00:31:47,765 --> 00:31:49,998
Guess you never know who you can trust.

659
00:31:52,392 --> 00:31:53,915
What are you doing?

660
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:56,341
My job, dirtbag. Get over there.

661
00:31:56,343 --> 00:31:57,965
Unh-unh! Don't even think about it.

662
00:31:57,967 --> 00:32:00,324
Put the gun down, slowly.

663
00:32:00,326 --> 00:32:02,582
Now!

664
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:04,340
Hands up.

665
00:32:04,342 --> 00:32:06,639
Hands up!

666
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:08,865
You are gonna regret this.

667
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:16,671
- Drop it!
- Get off me, man.

668
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:18,529
Get off me!

669
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,895
You okay?

670
00:32:25,897 --> 00:32:28,287
Yeah.

671
00:32:35,782 --> 00:32:38,150
All things work together for good.

672
00:32:38,152 --> 00:32:39,785
It's gonna be okay.

673
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:06,963
- Tamara, listen.
- Don't.

674
00:33:06,965 --> 00:33:09,366
Just don't.

675
00:33:09,368 --> 00:33:12,636
This whole time, you were
using me to get to Billy?

676
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:14,871
No. No, I swear it's not like that.

677
00:33:14,873 --> 00:33:16,473
Like hell it's not.

678
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:20,076
I hope it was worth it.

679
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,247
If I was good at compliments,

680
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:31,949
I'd probably say you're
one of the best cops

681
00:33:31,951 --> 00:33:34,852
I've ever worked with.

682
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:37,355
But I'm not, so, instead,

683
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:40,691
I left something on your
desk back at the precinct.

684
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:58,333
You okay?

685
00:33:58,335 --> 00:34:00,068
Thanks to you.

686
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,970
You saved me.

687
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:05,908
You, uh, seem to be doing
a lot of that lately.

688
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,243
I don't know how you kept
your cool through all that.

689
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:11,046
Well, I may not be
hearing voices in my head,

690
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:15,131
but I've learned a thing or
two in my years on the job.

691
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,833
Glad it still counts for something.

692
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:18,768
It counts for a lot.

693
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,403
Hey, folks, I'm
gonna need you to stay back.

694
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:22,939
Active crime scene. Stay back.

695
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,512
Both of those ladies are prizefighters.

696
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,381
Mom is recovering, and she'll be able

697
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,016
to have visitors in just a bit.

698
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,273
- Thank God.
- Thank you.

699
00:34:49,275 --> 00:34:50,441
What about our baby sister?

700
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:51,642
Yeah, can we see her?

701
00:34:51,644 --> 00:34:52,866
She's in the NICU.

702
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:55,892
She'll be in an incubator
for a bit, like any 29-weeker,

703
00:34:55,894 --> 00:35:00,031
but you should know she's doing fine.

704
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:02,663
I-I don't know how to thank
you. If you didn't get here, I...

705
00:35:02,665 --> 00:35:04,855
It was actually something
of a miracle that I did.

706
00:35:04,857 --> 00:35:07,181
I was kayaking earlier
today in the Harlem River.

707
00:35:07,183 --> 00:35:09,005
Lost my balance, and I flipped over.

708
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:11,644
Wait. Harlem River?

709
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:14,747
Yeah, and a total stranger
happened to be standing

710
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:17,441
under the High Bridge
at that exact moment.

711
00:35:17,443 --> 00:35:20,845
He jumped in, saved my life,

712
00:35:20,847 --> 00:35:22,613
and brought me here for good measure.

713
00:35:22,615 --> 00:35:25,483
This man who saved you, do
you know where he is now?

714
00:35:25,485 --> 00:35:28,075
I asked him to wait in the
lobby, offered him some money.

715
00:35:28,077 --> 00:35:29,466
He may still be there.

716
00:35:29,468 --> 00:35:32,726
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

717
00:35:32,728 --> 00:35:34,350
Come here.

718
00:35:48,502 --> 00:35:51,370
Are they out of surgery?

719
00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:53,839
You did it. You completed a Calling.

720
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:56,508
And the man you saved was the one person

721
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,578
that could save both of them.
They're gonna be okay.

722
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,046
Now, if you needed any more proof

723
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:03,449
that the Callings are good, this is it.

724
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:06,042
You sure about that?

725
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:09,279
What put your wife and baby
in danger in the first place?

726
00:36:09,281 --> 00:36:10,513
Grace's water broke.

727
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:11,748
Why? Why did it break?

728
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,550
We don't know exactly.

729
00:36:13,552 --> 00:36:15,318
I do.

730
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,088
I saw her fall near the river. Ask her.

731
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,656
The only reason she was on those rocks

732
00:36:19,658 --> 00:36:21,391
was because the Calling
told you to go there.

733
00:36:21,393 --> 00:36:24,327
Why would the Callings do that?
Set up dangers just to trick us

734
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:25,862
into thinking we're saving the world?

735
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:28,946
It's what the Callings
have been doing all along...

736
00:36:28,948 --> 00:36:30,781
manipulating us, teaching us to trust

737
00:36:30,783 --> 00:36:32,850
so we will eventually blindly obey,

738
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:34,785
not caring whether
we're doing good or evil.

739
00:36:34,787 --> 00:36:38,557
Evil? We're helping people!

740
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:39,658
"Signs and wonders".

741
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,193
Why do you keep saying that?

742
00:36:41,195 --> 00:36:43,195
Matthew 24:24.

743
00:36:43,197 --> 00:36:44,530
My dad used to quote it.

744
00:36:44,532 --> 00:36:45,998
"False prophets will arise from the dead

745
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,633
to perform signs and wonders".

746
00:36:47,635 --> 00:36:49,057
We're not false prophets.

747
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:51,422
You keep assuming we're
on the side of good, Ben,

748
00:36:51,424 --> 00:36:54,425
but I know now we are
returned from the dead

749
00:36:54,427 --> 00:36:58,641
to be agents of the apocalypse.

750
00:36:58,643 --> 00:37:01,745
You're deluded.

751
00:37:01,747 --> 00:37:04,013
"I see", said the blind man.

752
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:23,199
Yeah, it's in here somewhere.

753
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:24,834
What's going on?

754
00:37:24,836 --> 00:37:28,271
Just trying to find my ID.

755
00:37:28,273 --> 00:37:30,340
That's what we're worried about.

756
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:14,824
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

757
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,059
She's fine.

758
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,662
She's perfect.

759
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:59,854
_

760
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:20,940
_

761
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,137
- Hey.
- Hey.

762
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:33,505
I brought you takeout.

763
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:36,508
Uh, thanks, but you
know I can cook, right?

764
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,976
Yeah, I've had your cooking.

765
00:39:37,978 --> 00:39:39,210
That's why I brought you takeout.

766
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:40,545
Tough crowd.

767
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:44,215
I also brought you this,

768
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:47,586
which you can share with me.

769
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:49,641
It's been a minute, right?

770
00:39:49,643 --> 00:39:51,777
Yeah.

771
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:53,412
I'm okay, though.

772
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,419
Here's to Eden, the newest
member of the Stone family.

773
00:40:00,421 --> 00:40:03,155
She is small, but she is mighty.

774
00:40:03,157 --> 00:40:04,790
Mm.

775
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,067
What is it?

776
00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:14,920
I had to make a
decision in the hospital.

777
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,524
Grace or the baby.

778
00:40:23,264 --> 00:40:27,492
Ben, no one should ever
have to make that decision.

779
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:31,791
Well, I did. And I knew that
Grace wanted to protect the baby

780
00:40:31,793 --> 00:40:36,398
at all costs, and I chose the opposite.

781
00:40:39,922 --> 00:40:43,120
I don't know how I would
have lived with that.

782
00:40:43,122 --> 00:40:44,678
You don't have to.

783
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,035
They are both fine.

784
00:40:46,037 --> 00:40:48,127
You can go on being the best father

785
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:50,853
that I have ever, ever seen.

786
00:40:50,855 --> 00:40:52,378
The Calling, it came through.

787
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,671
It saved them both.

788
00:40:55,673 --> 00:40:57,420
I wish Adrian saw it that way.

789
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:58,854
What do you mean?

790
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:02,681
He's convinced the Callings
are manipulating us,

791
00:41:02,683 --> 00:41:04,940
all for some dark purpose.

792
00:41:04,942 --> 00:41:07,632
He thinks we're agents
of the apocalypse.

793
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:09,424
What? You believe him?

794
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:11,082
Not after today.

795
00:41:13,443 --> 00:41:15,032
I'm with you.

796
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,616
All good things.

797
00:41:19,618 --> 00:41:21,174
All good things.

798
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,171
Kiddos are in bed?

799
00:41:27,173 --> 00:41:30,330
Yeah, safe and sound.

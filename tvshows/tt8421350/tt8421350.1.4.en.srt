1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:01,415
Previously on "Manifest"...

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,247
Seriously?
No service?

3
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:05,321
Same.

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,523
I just wanted to say
I'm so sorry for everything.

5
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:09,841
You don't have to apologize

6
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:11,866
for something that happened to you.

7
00:00:11,938 --> 00:00:14,024
I went to Evie's house,
and I saw her parents.

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,341
It wasn't your fault.

9
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,681
The department did an investigation,
and they cleared you.

10
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:19,764
You can't put yourself
through that again.

11
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:20,977
You deserve better.

12
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,368
You think God wanted Jared to marry

13
00:00:22,393 --> 00:00:23,530
your best friend instead of you?

14
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:25,488
Where did that plane go
for 5 1/2 years?

15
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:27,390
I suspect if anyone has answers,

16
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:28,784
it's someone on that plane.

17
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:30,872
I still feel like a stranger
in my own home.

18
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,063
You don't know that man.

19
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:33,385
You've never met him.

20
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:35,555
And you will never have to

21
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,817
because you came home.

22
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:39,866
I need to know what
Michaela Stone's doing,

23
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:41,757
where she's going, who she's seeing.

24
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:43,180
Regular reports.

25
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,021
These are all the bodies that
have been registered

26
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:47,436
in the Long Island morgue
in the last 48 hours.

27
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:49,342
There is no Kelly Taylor.

28
00:00:49,446 --> 00:00:51,411
She's not in the system.

29
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:54,116
That's why the feds stepped in.
They wanted Kelly's body.

30
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,195
Where is she?

31
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:01,987
Rest in peace, Kelly Taylor.

32
00:01:02,243 --> 00:01:05,646
Cut surveillance on her home and
the commercial space she owned.

33
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,515
Keep looking for connections
among the other 19

34
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,798
that were there
when the plane exploded.

35
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,961
Excuse me.
How soon are we landing?

36
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:24,352
I'll get back to you in a moment.

37
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:26,138
- Okay.
- Thank you.

38
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:30,326
Everything all right, Captain?

39
00:01:31,785 --> 00:01:34,086
I'm gonna need you to
keep the passengers calm.

40
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:35,762
Apparently, we've been diverted

41
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:37,887
and law-enforcement will be
meeting us on the tarmac.

42
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,157
Oh.

43
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,217
Why?

44
00:01:40,242 --> 00:01:41,408
I have no idea.

45
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:42,849
I just know it's putting an extra hour

46
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:44,106
between me and my beauty sleep.

47
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:53,066
We'll be landing soon.

48
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:38,470
Geez!

49
00:02:41,963 --> 00:02:44,363
Hey, Saanvi, ready to go?

50
00:02:48,196 --> 00:02:50,263
Do you know if Dr. Feldman
still works here?

51
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,590
He was a neurologist.

52
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,070
He's the head of the department...

53
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:54,287
still here.

54
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:56,706
Oh. You know what?
You go ahead without me.

55
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:58,373
I think I'm gonna go say hi to him.

56
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:00,093
- Okay.
- Okay.

57
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,618
I cannot believe what I'm seeing.

58
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:13,007
You made breakfast?

59
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:14,845
Well, I made something out of eggs.

60
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,102
We'll see how it goes.

61
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:17,798
I'm sure it's delicious.

62
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:19,608
You're up early.

63
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:21,244
What, are you scrapbooking?

64
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,031
You know me.

65
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,861
Pack rat.

66
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,548
Oh, by the way, your dad called.

67
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,423
Apparently, Cal is begging to stay up

68
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:29,928
at the lake with him an extra day.

69
00:03:30,048 --> 00:03:31,484
Next treatment's not till the weekend.

70
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:34,645
How many times did Cal want to
go up there but was too sick?

71
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:36,700
I'm fine with that if you are.

72
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:40,166
Well... means we'll have
the house to ourselves

73
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:41,386
while Olive's at school.

74
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,914
I am definitely fine with that.

75
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:49,034
Hey, you look... ready to face the day.

76
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,685
Caffeination.

77
00:03:52,113 --> 00:03:54,712
Oh, I like your... overalls.

78
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:55,974
Romper.

79
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:57,149
What's the difference?

80
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,887
Romper, got it.

81
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,870
So, what are you doing after school?

82
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:03,442
Grandpa's giving me driving lessons.

83
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:05,213
Actually, we need to reschedule that.

84
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,140
Grandpa's gonna stay at
the lake with Cal an extra day.

85
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,264
- Seriously?
- I could do it.

86
00:04:09,397 --> 00:04:11,041
I-I need Grandpa's car.

87
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:12,760
That's the one I've been practicing on.

88
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,433
Now you can practice on ours.

89
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,275
It'll be good, right?

90
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,325
Never mind.

91
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,998
It's fine.

92
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:25,970
What did I do?

93
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,640
Absolutely nothing.

94
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:29,554
Olive just has a hard time with change,

95
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:31,408
and she's had a lot of it lately.

96
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,445
Like suddenly having a dad
back in the picture,

97
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,385
and one who doesn't know
what a romper is.

98
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,438
You are doing fine.

99
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,038
Just give it time.

100
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:40,686
You'll learn to speak Olive.

101
00:04:41,242 --> 00:04:43,309
Is it mostly this?

102
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:46,772
Yeah, it's... it's mostly that.

103
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:52,738
Bagels in the break room.

104
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,110
Is that garlic?
Don't tell Harrington.

105
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:56,827
I'm not gonna be stuck in a car
with his stinky breath

106
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:58,220
for six hours.

107
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:04,593
Okay, people, listen up.

108
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:07,661
We are still running support
on the ATF op.

109
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:09,515
We've heard from their undercover.

110
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:11,272
The gun buy is going down tonight.

111
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:13,945
This is ATF's deal, so we're on standby

112
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,663
until they make the call,
then we do the bust,

113
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,892
and ATF takes all the credit.

114
00:05:19,213 --> 00:05:20,879
Now, Sheller, you're with Yan.

115
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,030
Wilson, you're with Larner.

116
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,854
And Stone, you're gonna be
with Vasquez today.

117
00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:26,031
All right, let's be safe out there.

118
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:28,049
Hey, what happened to Harrington?

119
00:05:28,122 --> 00:05:29,815
Oh, pipe burst at his house.

120
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:31,697
Vasquez, you're NYPD lead on this.

121
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:33,303
Sir.

122
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,632
- You all good?
- Mm.

123
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:38,390
Never better.

124
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:39,748
This is your patient?

125
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:41,511
Mm-hmm. She showed
an unusual blood marker,

126
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:44,337
but now she's having visions,

127
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:47,125
and apparently very realistic ones.

128
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:50,840
Well, there's activation in this area,

129
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:52,364
the insular cortex.

130
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,456
Consistent with someone
experiencing hallucinations.

131
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:56,449
And what would cause those

132
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:58,242
- activations?
- It's hard to say.

133
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:00,434
It's not a well-understood area
of the brain.

134
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:02,497
But...

135
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:06,959
look at this homeless patient
in Room 810.

136
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:09,547
He was brought in after
accosting people on the street.

137
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,298
Agitated, delusional, initial
diagnosis of schizophrenia.

138
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:15,688
Here you can see he has similar
brain activity,

139
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:18,818
except the red indicates
it's much more pronounced.

140
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,208
So, my, uh, patient is in early
stages of schizophrenia?

141
00:06:23,297 --> 00:06:25,864
I'd need to observe behavior
to make a diagnosis.

142
00:06:25,973 --> 00:06:27,907
I strongly suggest you have
your patient see me

143
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,031
for a consultation soon.

144
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,696
I'll see if I can convince her.

145
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:32,350
Thank you.

146
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,530
It was Bethany!
Bethany!

147
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:48,774
The flight attendant!

148
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:50,340
Bethany, Bethany!

149
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:51,833
The flight...

150
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:21,367
What is it?
Are you okay?

151
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:23,869
Not according to my brain scan.

152
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:26,001
- Did you find something?
- No.

153
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,843
I saw something.

154
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:29,815
Okay.

155
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:31,742
Something that wasn't there.

156
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,676
The neurologist called it
a hallucination,

157
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:35,943
but I think it was a signal
of some kind.

158
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:38,660
Like how we all saw the plane?

159
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,002
Sort of.

160
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,807
But that was a flash
of an image, and this was...

161
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:45,534
this was real.

162
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:47,843
I mean, obviously it wasn't. It just...

163
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:50,035
I sound like I'm going crazy.

164
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,716
I'm the one person you don't
have to say that to.

165
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:55,203
- What did you see?
- A woman.

166
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:56,898
She was all gray like a statue,

167
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:58,718
and she left these wet footprints.

168
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:00,488
The footprints led me to the psych ward

169
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,571
and then to a patient who
grabbed me and said,

170
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:03,807
"It was Bethany."

171
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,796
- Bethany?
- The flight attendant.

172
00:08:05,912 --> 00:08:07,867
- Bethany was what?
- I don't know.

173
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:09,421
I mean, this guy was on anti-psychotics

174
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:10,679
and he was out of his mind.

175
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:13,020
And yet Bethany would've had
access to the cockpit,

176
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:15,268
the flight plan, the captain.

177
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:17,259
Maybe she knows
how the plane disappeared.

178
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:18,705
Maybe she had something to do with it.

179
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:20,671
Well, we definitely
need to talk to her.

180
00:08:20,696 --> 00:08:24,444
I just have no idea where she is.

181
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,863
it's not like we exchanged
numbers when Vance had us...

182
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:33,869
But apparently you did.

183
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,596
Yeah, I started a database

184
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:37,293
with information about every passenger.

185
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:39,598
Wanted to see if there was
some pattern,

186
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:40,921
something we're missing.

187
00:08:41,128 --> 00:08:42,838
I have to be able to frame
what happened to us

188
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:45,275
in a way I understand or I'll go crazy.

189
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:47,702
I'm the one person you don't
have to say that to.

190
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:54,052
Hey, love, what's up?

191
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:56,446
Can you, uh, um, come home?

192
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,585
I need to talk to you.

193
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,349
Here comes the merchandise.

194
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,082
Something is blocking our
audio signal from the inside,

195
00:09:06,107 --> 00:09:07,296
so we don't have ears.

196
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:09,989
But our U.C. checked in
by phone, so all is well.

197
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,323
Copy that, ATF.

198
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:13,641
NYPD sits tight
till you give the signal.

199
00:09:13,714 --> 00:09:14,876
Don't hold your breath.

200
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,897
Buyer's not due until after dark.

201
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:22,124
That's what, six or seven hours?

202
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:25,130
Mm, the non-stop adrenaline
of being a detective.

203
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:28,340
Loads of excitement in store for us.

204
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,393
We're gonna have to get lunch, snacks.

205
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:35,781
Maybe even a coffee at some point.

206
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,517
What are we doing for lunch?

207
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:41,825
Mm, there's a burger spot
a couple blocks away.

208
00:09:41,892 --> 00:09:43,388
Eh.

209
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:45,034
I know you like Italian.

210
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:49,840
Of course.

211
00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:51,645
All right, Italian it is.

212
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:53,358
What's nearby?

213
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:55,791
Terraci's.

214
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,604
We used to love that place.

215
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:01,979
You used to always get
the oyster linguini.

216
00:10:02,004 --> 00:10:03,909
Oh, it was the best.

217
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,902
What was it I always got?

218
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:08,544
The Chianti.

219
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:14,478
They were famous for something, though.

220
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:17,044
Yeah, the tiramisu.

221
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,033
We just never seemed to make it
to dessert.

222
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:33,898
I could use a coffee.

223
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,111
I'll go get it.

224
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,932
J...

225
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:52,072
Hey, you okay?

226
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:56,014
What is it?
What's wrong?

227
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:59,238
I think I have to sell
the catering kitchen.

228
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:02,283
What are you talking about?

229
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:05,782
We need the money, and maybe
I can get a rental kitchen,

230
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:07,813
- scale back on the staff.
- Whoa, whoa.

231
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:11,109
I'm gonna get something soon.

232
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,678
I talked to the new head
of the math department at SUNY,

233
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:15,590
and there may be a faculty
position in the spring,

234
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:16,875
and in the meantime,

235
00:11:16,935 --> 00:11:18,789
I'm looking at possible
guest lecture gigs.

236
00:11:18,814 --> 00:11:20,274
We're gonna be fine.

237
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:22,287
No, we're not.

238
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:25,745
Ben... I'm so sorry.

239
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,027
This is...
It's a lot bigger than that.

240
00:11:29,618 --> 00:11:32,797
I shut down when you disappeared.

241
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:35,100
But the rest of the world kept moving

242
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,381
and the bills kept rolling in,

243
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:40,004
and I almost lost our house.

244
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:44,025
And then the insurance money came in.

245
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,418
They paid out the death benefit,
and now they want it back.

246
00:11:58,303 --> 00:11:59,816
It's half a million dollars.

247
00:12:00,156 --> 00:12:01,622
How much do we have left?

248
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,327
There's nothing left.

249
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:09,910
I'm so sorry, Ben.
I-I paid off the mortgage.

250
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:11,609
And then with Cal's old
medical bills and...

251
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:13,373
- Hey.
- ...and the property taxes

252
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:14,428
- Hey, hey, hey,
- and the car...

253
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:15,503
hey, hey, hey.

254
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:17,008
It's okay.

255
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:19,509
We'll... use the equity in
the house to pay back the...

256
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:20,701
No, there isn't any!

257
00:12:20,754 --> 00:12:23,466
I took out a HELOC
to start my business.

258
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:26,336
I don't see any way out of this.

259
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:27,527
Grace.

260
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,916
I'm back.

261
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:32,486
And you are everything to me...
everything.

262
00:12:33,015 --> 00:12:34,936
You've had to do it all for so long.

263
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,024
We're gonna figure it out.

264
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,759
We're gonna figure this out.

265
00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:45,064
When I'm famous,
I'm gonna have to look this good

266
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:46,967
every single day.

267
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:48,930
It's gonna be exhausting.

268
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:50,326
Easy solve.

269
00:12:50,388 --> 00:12:51,553
Don't be famous.

270
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:54,095
- She's famous.
- Really? For what?

271
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:56,465
For absolutely nothing I've done.

272
00:12:56,518 --> 00:12:58,934
Come on, you have the most epic
life of anyone I know.

273
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,363
Stuff happens to me, not because of me.

274
00:13:02,423 --> 00:13:05,407
Her father and her brother
were on that magic plane.

275
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:07,338
Whoa.

276
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:09,645
That must be crazy.

277
00:13:09,953 --> 00:13:11,747
It is, yeah.

278
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:14,564
I mean, it's great, of course.

279
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:17,079
- Excuse me, I'm ready.
- Hang on.

280
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:18,892
I have to help a girl out.

281
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:23,508
Oh, my God, I just died everywhere.

282
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:25,261
Do you see you?

283
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:27,195
Yeah.

284
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,407
For real, you have to have this.

285
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:32,595
Excuse me.

286
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:34,478
How much is everything?

287
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:36,003
It's $120.

288
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,091
I'll have to think about it.

289
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:39,323
Cool.

290
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:41,090
I'm here, famous girl.

291
00:13:41,463 --> 00:13:43,133
I thought you got allowance on Mondays.

292
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:45,208
Yeah, I used to.

293
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:48,788
I don't know if things have
changed or my mom just forgot,

294
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:51,471
and it seems a little petty to ask.

295
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:55,023
Well, I'm guessing this Olive
could ask.

296
00:13:56,277 --> 00:13:58,270
'Cause she's in control.

297
00:14:02,502 --> 00:14:04,199
I think we should go.

298
00:14:05,492 --> 00:14:06,702
All right.

299
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,079
Excuse me.

300
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,148
You're gonna need to come with me.

301
00:14:27,055 --> 00:14:28,825
I miss anything?

302
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:32,828
Text from Harrington...

303
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,817
thanking you for tickets to the game.

304
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:39,011
Yeah, so much for a burst pipe.

305
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:42,638
- Yeah, I, uh...
- You what?

306
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:48,013
I'm worried.

307
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,581
I-I need to make sure that
everything's okay with you.

308
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:54,742
So you engineered us being alone
together in a car for six hours?

309
00:14:55,086 --> 00:14:56,913
Why not just ask me at the precinct?

310
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,355
I've been asking you
ever since you've been back.

311
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:00,869
But you won't give me
a straight answer.

312
00:15:00,893 --> 00:15:03,009
It's complicated, Jared!
And it's painful,

313
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:05,413
but it is my problem that I need
to deal with alone.

314
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,666
I just want to help you.

315
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:08,957
But you won't trust me enough
to tell me

316
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,633
what the hell's going on with you.

317
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:12,181
Michaela.

318
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:14,819
Save him.

319
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:16,206
Save him!

320
00:15:16,288 --> 00:15:18,023
Save him.

321
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:20,570
Save him.

322
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,342
The undercover...
his comms went out, right?

323
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,073
Yeah, but ATF's not worried.

324
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:26,286
No, they don't know
what's going on in there.

325
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,251
- I think he might be in trouble.
- What are you talking about?

326
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:29,796
- We need to go in.
- Are you crazy?

327
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:32,124
ATF is calling this.
It's their operation.

328
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:33,216
The... The buyers aren't even...

329
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,740
Jared, you need to trust me, okay?

330
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:35,930
We need to save him.

331
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:37,488
How can you possibly know that?

332
00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:38,982
I just know!

333
00:15:47,475 --> 00:15:48,997
This is NYPD.
We're going in.

334
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:51,105
All units, we're going in now.

335
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:55,090
NYPD!
Everybody down!

336
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:56,613
Down on the floor!

337
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:01,443
ATF. Drop it.

338
00:16:08,056 --> 00:16:09,818
What the hell just happened here?

339
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,221
You're okay?

340
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:13,001
Okay?
No, I'm not okay.

341
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,315
My cover's blown.

342
00:16:14,387 --> 00:16:15,757
The whole operation is botched.

343
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,660
You were supposed to wait
for my signal.

344
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,054
So, who made the call?

345
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:24,728
I did.

346
00:16:46,454 --> 00:16:47,592
You.

347
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:49,307
Row 8.

348
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,542
Laptop girl.

349
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:52,133
I just met a very disturbed man

350
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:55,279
who said that you did something
on the plane.

351
00:16:56,086 --> 00:16:57,423
What does he know?

352
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:59,082
You found him?

353
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:00,985
Who's this?

354
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:03,256
Emotionally disturbed person
arrested three days ago,

355
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:04,647
then shipped off to a psych ward.

356
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:07,606
He's not on the manifest for 828.
Why do I care?

357
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:09,452
NYPD ran his prints,
but couldn't I.D. him,

358
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:11,216
but once his prints were in the system,

359
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,231
it triggered a match in our database.

360
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:15,577
H-His fingerprints were found
on the airplane?

361
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:17,212
Inside the cargo hatch door.

362
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,808
We did an amino test.

363
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:20,947
They were fresh when the plane landed.

364
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:23,493
There was a stowaway on 828.

365
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:27,135
Thomas.

366
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,852
Something's gone wrong, hasn't it?

367
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:35,447
They're diverting the plane,

368
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,371
and police will be there when we land.

369
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:39,389
They'll know I'm not
a real flight attendant.

370
00:17:39,612 --> 00:17:40,925
They're going to arrest me.

371
00:17:41,004 --> 00:17:42,487
- What if you get arrested, too?
- Shh, shh, shh.

372
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:43,794
Stay calm.

373
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,829
Think about Leo, okay?

374
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:48,531
He'll be waiting for you in the city.

375
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:51,535
- Okay.
- Excuse me. Stewardess?

376
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:53,589
Oh, thank you, sir.

377
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:59,577
We're going to an airport
in the middle of nowhere.

378
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:03,914
Less security around
the perimeter, which is good.

379
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,683
I'm gonna need you to go in here.

380
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:09,171
This leads to the cargo hold.

381
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:14,057
Once we touch down and come to a stop,

382
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:18,161
I want you to climb out onto
the landing gear and jump down.

383
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:20,082
And then what?

384
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:23,767
And then you run.

385
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,939
There was a stowaway on our plane?

386
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:30,774
His name is Thomas.

387
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,710
He's my cousin Leo's boyfriend.

388
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:36,213
But why did you smuggle him out?

389
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,335
You have any idea

390
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,418
how dangerous being gay
in Jamaica can be?

391
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,587
When their friend was beaten to death,

392
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,495
Leo and Thomas posted a video

393
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,558
calling out the local police
for not investigating

394
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,521
and became targets themselves.

395
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:52,041
They couldn't get plane tickets?

396
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:56,139
My cousin had one, but Thomas
couldn't get a passport in time,

397
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,881
and his life was in danger.

398
00:18:58,248 --> 00:18:59,903
I had to help.

399
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:03,907
Leo and Thomas were in love,
and Leo is family.

400
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:05,942
He never made it to the U.S.

401
00:19:06,184 --> 00:19:09,124
Disappeared a few years
after we went missing.

402
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,891
You did the best you could.

403
00:19:11,313 --> 00:19:12,506
The rest of us were together

404
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:15,532
when they told us five years had
passed in the blink of an eye.

405
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:18,889
Imagine what it was like
for Thomas to find out.

406
00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:22,323
All alone, in a strange country.

407
00:19:22,414 --> 00:19:25,014
Well, we have to figure out
a way to help him.

408
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:31,608
Half a million dollars.

409
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,366
Did you find anything?

410
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,318
I did.

411
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:41,672
But that's only because
my smart wife...

412
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:44,207
made so many smart moves.

413
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,406
We can take out a small
business loan, invest it,

414
00:20:46,431 --> 00:20:48,595
and use the interest we earn to
pay back the insurance money

415
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,232
as slowly as we like.

416
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:52,582
Wait, don't we have to pay it
all back at once?

417
00:20:52,678 --> 00:20:54,217
They'd like us to think we do.

418
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:56,743
But they didn't exactly have
a Flight 828 clause

419
00:20:56,768 --> 00:20:57,856
in our insurance policy,

420
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,715
so they're forced to take
whatever we offer...

421
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:03,860
as long as we pay it back
in good faith.

422
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,228
Mmm.

423
00:21:05,303 --> 00:21:07,136
This should go on your menu.

424
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,399
You're amazing.

425
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,391
I sat here a few hours
and ran some numbers.

426
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,772
But you?

427
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:18,996
You spent five years building
a business from scratch

428
00:21:19,021 --> 00:21:21,544
and making really hard decisions
to keep our house,

429
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:23,682
hold our family together.

430
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:25,388
You're amazing.

431
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:28,556
Mm.

432
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:34,291
You like the math I did, huh?

433
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,107
That was some really sexy math.

434
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:41,233
That might be the first time
those two words

435
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,391
have ever been said together.

436
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:48,815
Very. Sexy. Math.

437
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:57,247
Mm.

438
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,407
No, no, no, no, no, no.

439
00:21:58,472 --> 00:21:59,880
Oh, I got to get that.

440
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:01,297
I think your dad is the only one

441
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:02,963
who leaves me voicemails anymore,

442
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,675
and since he's with Cal...

443
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:06,582
- Come on.
- Hi, Mom...

444
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:10,443
Probably just wants to talk
about his new fishing lure.

445
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:12,142
Come upstairs.

446
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,130
Or right here.
I don't care.

447
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:15,832
It's Olive.

448
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,167
Ah.

449
00:22:17,244 --> 00:22:18,905
She wants me to pick her up
at Bluemercury.

450
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,319
She sounds upset.

451
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,742
I'll do it.

452
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:26,943
Really? You sure?

453
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:28,889
I need to work on my Olive speak.

454
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:31,892
Perfect opportunity.

455
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:33,741
Good point.

456
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:37,678
And later, let's get back to
that sexy math stuff.

457
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:40,878
Oh, 100%.

458
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:52,281
You know, you're not gonna stonewall

459
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:53,624
your way out of this.

460
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:59,059
All of that went out the window.

461
00:23:03,955 --> 00:23:07,384
- Hey.
- I just botched a huge operation.

462
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:09,961
- What happened?
- I had a vision.

463
00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:11,077
There...
There was this woman.

464
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:14,372
She was gray like stone,
and she had these wings.

465
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:18,854
And she told me to "save him,"
but she was wrong.

466
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:20,337
He...
He didn't need saving.

467
00:23:20,386 --> 00:23:21,605
Wait.

468
00:23:21,687 --> 00:23:23,367
A gray woman?

469
00:23:24,015 --> 00:23:25,548
Saanvi may have had the same vision.

470
00:23:25,644 --> 00:23:27,188
She did?

471
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:28,589
I hope everything's okay for her,

472
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:32,616
because it really
screwed things up here.

473
00:23:32,685 --> 00:23:34,943
Jared could lose his job.

474
00:23:36,044 --> 00:23:37,599
I have to come clean and tell
them what really happened.

475
00:23:37,623 --> 00:23:38,783
Are you kidding me?!

476
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:40,670
We come clean now, we could
legitimately end up

477
00:23:40,695 --> 00:23:42,111
in some government psych facility

478
00:23:42,136 --> 00:23:43,197
for the rest of our lives.

479
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:44,527
Then I need to at least tell Jared,

480
00:23:44,552 --> 00:23:47,913
because it's just not fair to
let him take the fall for this.

481
00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:50,492
No, Mick, we've been lying to the NSA.

482
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,188
If we start telling
the people we care about

483
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:55,373
what's happening to us,
we'll force them to lie, too.

484
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:57,285
Call Saanvi.

485
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,843
She can help you make sense of this.

486
00:23:58,868 --> 00:24:00,868
She's working on some theories.

487
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,090
You have to just accept
the consequences with Jared.

488
00:24:05,184 --> 00:24:06,657
Mick.

489
00:24:06,757 --> 00:24:09,194
You cannot tell him what's going on.

490
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:13,166
Hi, Dr. Feldman.

491
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:15,358
Quick question about
the patient in Room 810.

492
00:24:15,461 --> 00:24:18,086
I'd love to have a consult
with him before he's discharged,

493
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:20,881
- and I was wondering if...
- He's not getting discharged.

494
00:24:20,984 --> 00:24:22,972
No one showed up to claim
him, so he's being moved

495
00:24:22,997 --> 00:24:24,851
to a state-run facility in a few hours.

496
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:26,615
Oh, okay.

497
00:24:26,905 --> 00:24:28,037
Thank you.

498
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,806
How'd it go?

499
00:24:29,892 --> 00:24:31,840
We've got a big problem.

500
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:35,659
What can I help you find today?

501
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:37,481
Oh, just my daughter.

502
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:40,282
Brown hair, adorable,
answers to the name Olive.

503
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:41,804
Olive Stone?

504
00:24:42,037 --> 00:24:43,097
Yeah.

505
00:24:43,168 --> 00:24:45,311
I'm afraid we caught her shoplifting.

506
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:49,172
Oh.
Where is she?

507
00:24:49,213 --> 00:24:50,546
In the back.

508
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:52,738
But I thought her dad was already here.

509
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:55,067
There they are.

510
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:04,453
Dad, what are you doing?

511
00:25:09,915 --> 00:25:12,788
Hi. Uh, I'm Danny.

512
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:15,554
- Grace's...
- I know.

513
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:18,284
Sorry.
Uh, Olive called me.

514
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,717
She didn't really know what to...

515
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:21,691
Thanks.
I can take her from here.

516
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:23,998
Okay.

517
00:25:24,863 --> 00:25:26,190
I'll just...

518
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,481
- Bye, Olive.
- Thanks.

519
00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:54,040
Looks great.

520
00:25:54,104 --> 00:25:55,637
It's actually really well balanced.

521
00:25:55,739 --> 00:25:57,816
- Look.
- So, what do you think?

522
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,253
Should we take it for a test flight?

523
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:00,352
Okay.

524
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:03,264
This is beta test one.

525
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:04,479
- Ready?
- Ready.

526
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:05,780
Okay.

527
00:26:05,882 --> 00:26:07,670
- Launch!
- Hey!

528
00:26:07,758 --> 00:26:10,197
No, no, no, no, no! No!

529
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:13,588
I can't believe he just did that!

530
00:26:13,718 --> 00:26:15,287
Oh, he didn't mean to, sweetie.

531
00:26:15,337 --> 00:26:17,037
It's never gonna fly now.

532
00:26:17,147 --> 00:26:19,415
- Come here, let me show you something.
- It's ruined.

533
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:21,542
No, it's never gonna fly.

534
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:28,868
But it will float.

535
00:26:29,553 --> 00:26:30,619
See?

536
00:26:30,644 --> 00:26:33,378
You didn't even realize you made
the world's coolest boat.

537
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,876
Thank you, Daddy.

538
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:37,178
You always make everything better.

539
00:26:52,295 --> 00:26:54,877
Hey.
What happened?

540
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:56,839
ATF is pissed.

541
00:26:56,928 --> 00:26:58,827
They're starting a full investigation.

542
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:00,756
Meantime, I'm suspended.

543
00:27:00,942 --> 00:27:02,671
I need to tell them this was my fault.

544
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:04,533
- I am the one who...
- How is that gonna help anything?

545
00:27:04,695 --> 00:27:06,628
I'm the one that made the call.

546
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:14,459
You don't have to take the fall
to protect me, Jared.

547
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:16,051
Yes, I do.

548
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:17,412
Okay? I can't help it.

549
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:19,515
That is the last thing that I want.

550
00:27:19,623 --> 00:27:21,963
Then tell me what's really going on.

551
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,093
You saw something.

552
00:27:25,137 --> 00:27:26,301
Or heard something.

553
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:27,726
I saw it on your face.

554
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:29,241
What was it?

555
00:27:31,555 --> 00:27:33,655
I heard a gunshot,
so I thought that maybe...

556
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,680
I was right there.
There was no gunshot.

557
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,628
I know there's more to the story
here, just like I know

558
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:39,560
there's more to the story
about those kidnapped girls

559
00:27:39,695 --> 00:27:41,968
and the lady who killed
that passenger from the plane.

560
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:44,543
If you don't want to talk to me,
I get it.

561
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,613
But you got to talk to someone.

562
00:27:47,544 --> 00:27:49,242
You need help.

563
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,463
Actually, ye-yeah, there might
be somebody I know.

564
00:27:55,505 --> 00:27:57,846
Ben said she might be able to help.

565
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:00,274
Then go.

566
00:28:06,837 --> 00:28:08,436
Grace?

567
00:28:10,674 --> 00:28:12,504
Hey, hold on.

568
00:28:13,376 --> 00:28:17,712
Honey, is this something
you've done before?

569
00:28:19,188 --> 00:28:20,572
No.

570
00:28:21,094 --> 00:28:22,149
Never, okay?

571
00:28:22,174 --> 00:28:23,494
I swear.

572
00:28:24,855 --> 00:28:27,764
Did I ever tell you
about the boomerang?

573
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:33,008
The what?

574
00:28:33,281 --> 00:28:35,961
When I was 15, I stole a boomerang.

575
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,734
It was a really cool boomerang.

576
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:54,526
Why'd you do it?

577
00:28:56,914 --> 00:28:58,537
I don't know.

578
00:29:01,315 --> 00:29:05,059
I just think I felt like
everything in my life

579
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:07,035
was out of whack.

580
00:29:09,699 --> 00:29:13,705
And at the time,
it just seemed like a way

581
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:17,415
to take the reins of something,
anything, you know?

582
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,776
What did Grammy do?

583
00:29:21,872 --> 00:29:24,222
Not enough, actually.

584
00:29:25,476 --> 00:29:28,858
I remember thinking if she
yelled at me or grounded me

585
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:31,119
for a month,
at least I could be mad at her,

586
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,728
put some of my guilt
someplace else, but...

587
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:39,211
she just looked at me and said...

588
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:42,761
"Everybody deserves one free pass."

589
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,381
I don't deserve a free pass.

590
00:29:51,544 --> 00:29:53,855
Do you plan on stealing again?

591
00:29:53,944 --> 00:29:55,302
No.

592
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:57,455
Never.

593
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,834
So take the free pass.

594
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:08,717
Dad, I'm sorry.

595
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:13,370
I'm so sorry that I called Danny
instead of you.

596
00:30:13,423 --> 00:30:14,689
I just...
I didn't want you to...

597
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:15,848
I know, I know.

598
00:30:15,905 --> 00:30:17,204
No, you don't.

599
00:30:20,136 --> 00:30:23,278
Because you don't know
what a total screw up I am.

600
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:26,067
And Danny knows I'm a mess,

601
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:30,231
but you still see me as this
sweet 10-year-old little girl,

602
00:30:30,256 --> 00:30:32,009
and I'm not.

603
00:30:32,322 --> 00:30:35,039
I'm so not her anymore.

604
00:30:37,408 --> 00:30:38,889
No.

605
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:44,576
No, in some ways,
you're this whole new person.

606
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,389
And you know what?

607
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,967
I really love this whole new person.

608
00:30:55,237 --> 00:31:00,842
And sometimes I might not be
great at communicating with her,

609
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:03,055
but I want her to know...

610
00:31:04,468 --> 00:31:06,463
whenever she needs help,

611
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:09,797
she can always call me, no matter what.

612
00:31:11,428 --> 00:31:12,789
Okay?

613
00:31:14,898 --> 00:31:16,638
Okay.

614
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:18,953
Thank you.

615
00:31:23,777 --> 00:31:27,874
Could we keep this whole thing
just between us?

616
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:33,057
I've been such a pain
in the ass to Mom,

617
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:36,225
and she's been through a lot.

618
00:31:36,378 --> 00:31:40,877
And she will never,
never understand this.

619
00:31:41,204 --> 00:31:42,659
Please.

620
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:44,616
Okay.

621
00:31:45,221 --> 00:31:46,840
It'll be our secret.

622
00:31:47,884 --> 00:31:49,300
Okay.

623
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:51,829
Thank you, Dad.

624
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,335
But if you ever steal anything
ever again,

625
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,155
there'll be hell to pay.

626
00:31:57,514 --> 00:32:00,068
Even if it's a really cool boomerang?

627
00:32:02,678 --> 00:32:04,845
I think we both know
there's no such thing.

628
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:13,181
I still think this is a bad idea.

629
00:32:13,283 --> 00:32:15,055
It's the only way Thomas
is gonna get out of here.

630
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,613
- Mm-hmm.
- We're gonna get caught.

631
00:32:16,747 --> 00:32:19,290
Someone's bound to recognize
a couple of 828ers

632
00:32:19,315 --> 00:32:21,478
just traipsing around here together.

633
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:22,973
These nurses work long shifts.

634
00:32:22,998 --> 00:32:24,158
Let's just hope we find someone

635
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:25,426
who doesn't spend all their free time

636
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:27,195
watching the 24-hour news channel.

637
00:32:27,244 --> 00:32:28,438
May I help you?

638
00:32:28,512 --> 00:32:30,745
Uh, discharge orders
for a psych patient.

639
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:32,652
And you're the mother?

640
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:33,859
Mm-hmm.

641
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:35,612
Little surprised the doctor
released him.

642
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,145
He's on a lot of Haldol.

643
00:32:37,284 --> 00:32:38,737
- Maybe I should double check.
- Uh, well,

644
00:32:38,762 --> 00:32:40,927
his mom here is a
physician's assistant.

645
00:32:40,981 --> 00:32:42,101
Guess the doctor thought that

646
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,824
he'd be better off with
family in this case.

647
00:32:43,865 --> 00:32:45,793
But, I mean, if you disagree...

648
00:32:50,437 --> 00:32:52,200
Oh.
Room 810.

649
00:32:52,288 --> 00:32:54,340
- All security...
- What's going on?

650
00:32:54,365 --> 00:32:55,519
We're on lockdown.

651
00:32:55,544 --> 00:32:57,510
A patient tripped the alarm
trying to get out.

652
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:01,229
Get him back into his room.

653
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:03,037
He's gone.

654
00:33:03,062 --> 00:33:04,752
Thomas!

655
00:33:05,835 --> 00:33:07,268
Do you see those?

656
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:08,775
What?

657
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:10,677
We have to go.
Come on.

658
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Attention, all staff and personnel,

659
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:14,675
this is not a drill.

660
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,500
Please follow standard
lockdown protocol.

661
00:33:18,448 --> 00:33:19,946
Search the room.

662
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,107
Attention, all staff and personnel...

663
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:25,319
Want to see the doctor in charge
of the John Doe who escaped.

664
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:27,321
He's actually not a John Doe anymore.

665
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:28,430
His mother showed up.

666
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:29,688
What?

667
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,158
Where is she?

668
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,161
She was just here.

669
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:47,012
Michaela?
What are you doing here?

670
00:33:47,037 --> 00:33:48,172
I came here to talk to you.

671
00:33:48,197 --> 00:33:49,544
I think that we might've seen
the same...

672
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,413
- You can talk later.
- Okay, look, we really need your help.

673
00:33:51,437 --> 00:33:53,070
We got to go.

674
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:07,231
So, Thomas would be the
perfect guinea pig for Vance.

675
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:10,024
No identity, no family.

676
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,620
In Vance's mind, Thomas doesn't exist.

677
00:34:11,651 --> 00:34:13,194
Yeah, well, Vance is wrong, okay?

678
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,268
We have to find Thomas before he does.

679
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:16,774
Do you have any idea where he'd go?

680
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:19,203
All our plans changed
once the plane was rerouted.

681
00:34:19,305 --> 00:34:21,387
I gave him my phone,
but it was useless.

682
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:23,694
Did he know anyone else in the city?

683
00:34:23,783 --> 00:34:24,996
No one.

684
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:28,024
He and my cousin planned to meet
up and start a whole new life.

685
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:29,236
Well, how did they plan to connect

686
00:34:29,261 --> 00:34:30,901
once they got to New York?

687
00:34:31,123 --> 00:34:33,137
I never even asked.

688
00:34:33,885 --> 00:34:35,734
God, I wish I had.

689
00:34:36,315 --> 00:34:37,748
We need to look for wet footprints.

690
00:34:37,835 --> 00:34:40,361
- What are you talking about?
- It's how I found Thomas.

691
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,182
I saw a woman. I...

692
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:44,101
The gray woman with wings?

693
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:46,662
No, she didn't have wings.

694
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,281
She left wet footprints.

695
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,619
That's what led me to Thomas.

696
00:34:49,644 --> 00:34:51,811
So, we're seeing the same gray woman,

697
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:54,465
but I'm seeing an angel and
you're seeing wet footprints?

698
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,466
Like she had been standing in water.

699
00:34:58,818 --> 00:35:00,968
No, it just doesn't make sense.

700
00:35:01,173 --> 00:35:03,830
- The Angel of the Waters.
- Who?

701
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:06,250
The statue at the top
of Bethesda Fountain.

702
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:08,743
She has wings and water at her feet.

703
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:11,245
And she's a big part
of "Angels in America,"

704
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,322
Leo's favorite play.

705
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:15,150
So you think that's where he went?

706
00:35:15,216 --> 00:35:17,016
Thomas may not know New York,

707
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:19,220
but he sure as hell knows Tony Kushner.

708
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:23,290
The angel told me to save him.

709
00:35:23,364 --> 00:35:24,997
She meant Thomas.

710
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:33,267
Hey, you're back.

711
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:34,701
Yep.

712
00:35:36,278 --> 00:35:38,005
Everything good?

713
00:35:38,608 --> 00:35:40,388
Good. Fine.

714
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:42,777
How's Olive?

715
00:35:42,926 --> 00:35:44,774
Hanging out in her room.

716
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:47,088
Were you seriously not gonna tell me

717
00:35:47,113 --> 00:35:49,466
about our daughter shoplifting?

718
00:35:49,786 --> 00:35:51,630
You don't think that's something
that I would want to know?

719
00:35:51,654 --> 00:35:53,265
Olive asked me not to.

720
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:55,205
I'm trying to gain her trust back.

721
00:35:55,268 --> 00:35:56,801
She's 15 and in trouble.

722
00:35:56,826 --> 00:35:58,259
Of course she asked you not to.

723
00:35:58,294 --> 00:35:59,611
Yeah, I...

724
00:36:01,264 --> 00:36:03,264
Wait, how'd you find out?

725
00:36:05,635 --> 00:36:07,186
That's not the point, Ben.

726
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:09,131
Danny.
You talked to Danny.

727
00:36:09,424 --> 00:36:10,556
I thought you ended it with him.

728
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:12,010
I did.

729
00:36:12,575 --> 00:36:14,611
He only called me to tell me
what happened with Olive.

730
00:36:14,636 --> 00:36:15,968
He felt awful.

731
00:36:15,993 --> 00:36:18,395
Ben, you can't keep secrets
from me about my own daughter!

732
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,085
Our daughter.

733
00:36:21,184 --> 00:36:23,069
Of course that's what I meant.

734
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:25,850
I want you to be half
of this parenting team.

735
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:28,257
I cannot do it alone,
but neither can you.

736
00:36:28,324 --> 00:36:31,677
Trust me, you have no idea what
we've been through with her.

737
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,157
"We"?
Meaning you and Danny?

738
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:34,395
Ben, you weren't here.

739
00:36:34,437 --> 00:36:35,739
I am now!

740
00:36:35,764 --> 00:36:38,465
And neither one of you seem to
be able to let this guy go.

741
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:51,479
But maybe it's not fair
for me to ask you to.

742
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:53,380
Ben...

743
00:36:58,855 --> 00:37:00,389
It's okay.

744
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:08,389
I'm gonna get some air.

745
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:21,168
Thomas!

746
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:23,089
Thomas, it's me.

747
00:37:23,212 --> 00:37:24,419
- Bethany!
- Oh!

748
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:25,704
Oh, my God!

749
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:27,641
She seemed so real.

750
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:29,737
It's fascinating.

751
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:32,109
Feds are gonna be on our tail.
We got to get him out of here.

752
00:37:32,662 --> 00:37:34,481
When I found my way here,

753
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:38,125
everybody was telling me
it was five years later.

754
00:37:38,354 --> 00:37:39,920
I thought I was going crazy.

755
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:41,923
Somebody called the cops.

756
00:37:42,298 --> 00:37:43,296
It's okay.

757
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:44,568
You're safe now.

758
00:37:44,593 --> 00:37:46,393
Sorry, guys, but we got to go
right now.

759
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:48,251
No.
I cannot go.

760
00:37:48,276 --> 00:37:49,847
You've been given massive doses
of Haldol.

761
00:37:49,872 --> 00:37:52,039
We need to get you somewhere
where you can detox.

762
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:53,558
But we cannot leave.

763
00:37:53,743 --> 00:37:55,743
Leo is meeting me here.

764
00:37:58,548 --> 00:38:00,146
He's not coming.

765
00:38:00,783 --> 00:38:02,372
I'm so sorry.

766
00:38:02,652 --> 00:38:04,372
A lot has happened.

767
00:38:04,587 --> 00:38:06,216
Five years?

768
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,078
- That is true?
- It is true.

769
00:38:09,325 --> 00:38:10,647
The three of us were
on the plane, as well.

770
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:12,435
We all lost five years.

771
00:38:12,565 --> 00:38:13,928
I am so sorry, baby.

772
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:15,858
I spoke to my mom.

773
00:38:16,499 --> 00:38:19,967
Leo disappeared two years
after the plane left.

774
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:23,374
No. No!

775
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:25,410
- No!
- I'm so, so sorry, baby.

776
00:38:25,435 --> 00:38:26,740
I'm sorry.

777
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,989
Thomas, we need to get you
somewhere safe.

778
00:38:29,014 --> 00:38:30,944
I cannot go!
If he is alive...

779
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,314
Thomas, look at me.
I am a cop.

780
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:36,031
If your boyfriend is alive,
I am gonna help you find him,

781
00:38:36,056 --> 00:38:37,390
I promise you that, but right now,

782
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,791
we have to go because there are
federal agents looking for you,

783
00:38:39,816 --> 00:38:42,089
and if they find you, you'll be
arrested as a stowaway.

784
00:38:42,274 --> 00:38:43,788
Not just you.
If you're found,

785
00:38:43,813 --> 00:38:46,847
Bethany will go to prison, too,
so we have to go right now.

786
00:38:46,996 --> 00:38:48,260
Where?

787
00:38:48,464 --> 00:38:49,873
Where can we go?

788
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,828
It has to be somewhere off
of Vance's radar.

789
00:38:51,853 --> 00:38:53,553
He is watching all of us.

790
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,300
What is this place?

791
00:38:59,442 --> 00:39:01,840
It's a boiler room, or it was.

792
00:39:01,944 --> 00:39:03,647
It hasn't been used in ages.

793
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:04,847
How'd you find it?

794
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,562
Kelly owned the building.

795
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:09,030
It'll be tied up in probate for years.

796
00:39:09,144 --> 00:39:10,755
So basically, no one's coming

797
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:12,636
down here any time soon?

798
00:39:12,955 --> 00:39:14,599
Just us.

799
00:39:15,831 --> 00:39:17,598
And my brother.

800
00:39:18,145 --> 00:39:19,851
I'm gonna go get some supplies...

801
00:39:20,062 --> 00:39:21,448
a cot, some blankets.

802
00:39:21,473 --> 00:39:23,706
And some water with electrolytes.

803
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:25,716
He's coming off a ton
of drugs he didn't need.

804
00:39:29,512 --> 00:39:32,694
It worked.
We completed the calling.

805
00:39:32,842 --> 00:39:34,254
Yeah.

806
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:37,281
I'm just not sure that's a good thing.

807
00:39:38,014 --> 00:39:40,245
How could it not be?
Thomas is safe.

808
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:42,493
You're harboring a fugitive in there.

809
00:39:42,697 --> 00:39:45,998
Do you not realize we're being
watched by the government,

810
00:39:46,036 --> 00:39:47,933
- the media...
- It's all worth it.

811
00:39:47,972 --> 00:39:49,338
Is it?

812
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:50,758
Because it sounds like "the calling"

813
00:39:50,827 --> 00:39:53,027
really screwed things up for Jared.

814
00:39:57,848 --> 00:39:58,909
That was my fault.

815
00:39:58,934 --> 00:40:00,739
I got the calling wrong.

816
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:04,471
These callings are pulling you
in deeper and deeper.

817
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,060
And what if the voices are bad?

Mr. Marx.

29
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:41,688
Ah, Ms. Crowne.
Thank you for coming.

30
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,870
I guess it couldn't wait?

31
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:43,906
I'm afraid not. Please.

32
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,507
Yellow? Sounds serious.

33
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:54,634
Well, it doesn't need to be.

34
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:57,218
My levels are fine, thank you.

35
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:01,627
It's come to my attention
that you are engaged

36
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:03,506
in an exclusive
sexual relationship...

37
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,673
I beg your... hold on.

38
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,937
With Henry Foster,
an Alpha Plus,

39
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:07,761
for over two months now.

40
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:09,440
No, that's not accurate.
I don't think...

41
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:11,434
This is last week.

42
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:13,308
You do remember?

43
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:14,603
Ah, this was a Monday.

44
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:16,478
Executive bathroom
above the gestational wing.

45
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:17,615
Wait, that's not...

46
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,991
Two Thursdays ago.
The breezeway.

47
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:20,605
Previous Tuesday. Twice.

48
00:03:20,684 --> 00:03:21,869
Stop.
The prior Monday.

49
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:23,993
Monday before that.
Oh, lots of Mondays.

50
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:25,832
Stop, please.

51
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,376
Oh, no.
There's no need for shame.

52
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,897
Lenina,

53
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:31,085
I assure you I'm quite used to
this sort of thing.

54
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,041
It comes with the job.

55
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,673
Well, I understand the impulse.

56
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:39,844
He's handsome, strapping, tall.

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,590
Ah, yes.

58
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:44,763
Our Henry Foster is every bit
the Alpha Plus, isn't he?

59
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,828
What I can never seem
to wrap my head around, though,

60
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,682
is the... selfishness.

61
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:54,544
I mean, two people engaged
in possessive, monogamous...

62
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,546
Forgive me, I don't know
what else to call it...

63
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,360
Relations in private, separate,

64
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,059
with no regard
for the social body,

65
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,981
no consideration
for the pain they cause,

66
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:03,939
the damage they inflict...

67
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,939
No.

68
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:08,491
Sorry, did you say "no"?
It was a few times.

69
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,085
22.
It just happened.

70
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,537
You can understand that,
can't you?

71
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:12,788
It was purely sexual.

72
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:13,789
I'm gonna stop you right there.

73
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:14,880
First we began to talk,

74
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:16,334
to prefer each other's company,

75
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:17,856
and I just thought that
that was...

76
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,833
No, you didn't.

77
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:22,339
You did not think.

78
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:25,672
You gave no thought whatsoever
to anyone but yourself.

79
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:27,869
Not your colleagues,
not your friends...

80
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,343
All of whom have just as much
a right to Henry Foster

81
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,590
as you do.

82
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,427
Or do you not agree with that?

83
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:40,956
Lenina?

84
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:45,781
Everyone belongs
to everyone else.

85
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,662
Yes. That's right.

86
00:04:47,738 --> 00:04:49,898
Good. That's... good.

87
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:53,576
Well, that's over now.

88
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:54,971
And I've found,
with things like this,

89
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,575
it's best to get
right back in the mix,

90
00:04:56,654 --> 00:04:57,704
to focus on one's duty.

91
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:58,861
And if you like,

92
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:00,671
I can recommend
a few excellent, um...

93
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,709
Go on.

94
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:06,616
A soma a day keeps
the jimjams away.

95
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,640
You wouldn't happen
to have something more...

96
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,983
An orange for you?

97
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:21,765
This really isn't
your fault, Lenina.

98
00:05:21,846 --> 00:05:24,056
You're a Beta.
Henry Foster's the Alpha here...

99
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,440
Beta Plus.

100
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:28,198
I'm a Beta Plus.
Yeah, no. Of course.

101
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,539
All I mean is that you can't be
expected to think so far ahead.

102
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,703
Henry needed to consider
the bigger picture.

103
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:34,644
And Henry...

104
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,068
Well, Henry didn't.

105
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:39,455
Nor did he consider all
of those who might desire you.

106
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:42,467
At least not until today.

107
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,169
Henry... Henry told you?

108
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,667
It's not important.

109
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,509
What's important
is that we caught it in time.

110
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,635
These things have a habit of...

111
00:05:54,712 --> 00:05:59,612
festering jealousy,
possessiveness, secrecy.

112
00:06:01,803 --> 00:06:05,483
Lenina, you're going to take
the recommended actions

113
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:07,017
and you are gonna feel better.

114
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,440
I promise.

115
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:51,964
<i>Bernard Marx?</i>

116
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,598
<i>Bernard Marx.</i>

117
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,241
<i>Are you ignoring me, Marx?</i>

118
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,768
No, sir. I would never.

119
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:59,894
<i>Listen...</i>

120
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:02,223
<i>there's been an incident.</i>

121
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,089
Where'd you get off to?

122
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,916
Or should I say,
"Who'd you get off with?"

123
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,980
Frannie, behave yourself.

124
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,868
If you say Henry Foster again,

125
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,623
I swear I'll report you.

126
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,535
Don't be silly.

127
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,500
Ending is better than mending.

128
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,675
<i>You are an essential part</i>

129
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,133
<i>of a perfect, social body...</i>

130
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:22,689
<i>Everybody in their place,</i>

131
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,892
<i>everybody happy now.</i>

132
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,044
<i>And Indra keeps us
all connected.</i>

133
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,638
<i>But imagine a world</i>

134
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:32,699
<i>without Indra's stability
and harmony...</i>

135
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,942
<i>A primitive land of greed,</i>

136
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:36,866
<i>superstition,</i>

137
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,993
<i>and pain.</i>

138
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,410
<i>You don't have to imagine.</i>

139
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:45,212
<i>Only an 11-minute rocket
from New London,</i>

140
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:48,945
<i>you'll find the Savage Lands.</i>

141
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,896
<i>Come and experience the magic.</i>

142
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,836
<i>You bring the friends;</i>

143
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:57,089
<i>We've got the fun,</i>

144
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:03,121
<i>with realistic shows performed
daily by actual savages.</i>

145
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,975
<i>All the misery of the old world</i>

146
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,934
<i>with all the comforts of home.</i>

147
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:13,237
<i>Adventures await
in the Savage Lands.</i>

148
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,353
Hot towel or soma fizz?
Thank you.

149
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:21,395
Hot towel? Soma fix?
Thank you.

150
00:10:22,697 --> 00:10:25,697
<i>Now arriving.
District of the Sublime.</i>

151
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:26,895
Hot towel? Soma fizz?

152
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,705
Are you the Gamma?
I'm from the bureau.

153
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,717
Counselor.

154
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,470
I'm happy you're here.
Yes.

155
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,762
What, uh... what happened?

156
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:47,766
Our residents were enjoying
a recreation session.

157
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,227
Satisfaction levels
were quite high

158
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:52,818
until one of the Epsilons, he...

159
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:56,089
He had an accident.

160
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,234
How rare.

161
00:10:58,307 --> 00:10:59,987
Show me?

162
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,906
They do happen, you know.
Accidents.

163
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:07,822
I've seen one myself.
Yes.

164
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,787
But it seems that
this accident was...

165
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,710
Well, see if you can
make sense of it.

166
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,010
This way, Counselor.

167
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,221
Excuse me.

168
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,100
Excuse me, sir. Thank you.

169
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,089
Hey, you Jacks.

170
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,192
Get away from there.

171
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:41,799
Hey, you Jack.
Did you hear what I said?

172
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,213
A soma for you, Jack.

173
00:12:25,102 --> 00:12:27,849
Nothing to worry about. Soma?

174
00:12:30,274 --> 00:12:32,294
One for you. Here you go.

175
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:34,568
It's a fine day.
Why waste it here, all right?

176
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,515
Clear the residents
from the area, yeah?

177
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:46,141
And tell these Epsilons
not to touch anything

178
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,255
till I get back.

179
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,554
You're leaving?

180
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:45,015
What's your name?
CJack60.

181
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:47,069
You knew this worker?

182
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:49,323
We knew this worker.

183
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,675
You see what happened to him?

184
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,263
I asked you a question.

185
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,540
This worker fell.

186
00:13:57,612 --> 00:13:59,412
Fell?

187
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,012
We clean up now.

188
00:15:08,349 --> 00:15:12,149
<i>I record feelings and
turn them into experiences...</i>

189
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:14,108
<i>Bigger, bolder,</i>

190
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:16,538
<i>better than anyone
could imagine,</i>

191
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:20,116
<i>and I give them to you,
my adoring audience.</i>

192
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:21,624
<i>And you're welcome.</i>

193
00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:24,616
I was just looking at
what was left of him, and...

194
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:26,527
I tried to imagine what it...

195
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,671
What it must have been like
to... to... to climb up

196
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:30,294
and look over the edge
and to plan it.

197
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:32,107
I mean, to choose it.
You lost me.

198
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,850
Choose what?
To end himself, to die.

199
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:35,734
I don't understand.

200
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,682
'Cause he jumped.
Jumped?

201
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:41,035
You make no sense.

202
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,776
Why would he?
No one's ever done that.

203
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,310
If he was in pain, if...
He could take a soma.

204
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:48,687
What if soma didn't work?
But it does.

205
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:50,450
What if I said that
there's a kind of pain

206
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:52,624
that... that...
That soma doesn't touch?

207
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:53,870
I'd tell you to take a soma.

208
00:15:55,604 --> 00:15:57,374
It's not funny.

209
00:15:57,398 --> 00:15:59,318
I felt it... what he felt.

210
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,290
I... I... I touched him, and...
An Epsilon?

211
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:02,248
The must have been
some part of him

212
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,328
that was still connected

213
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:04,531
to the network...
Bernard.

214
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:05,882
To Indra,
to everyone... I mean, to me...

215
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:07,786
The Epsilon?
Yes.

216
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,297
Are you listening?

217
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:11,757
Not even sure they have
feelings, the Epsilons.

218
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:16,548
Oh, don't do that.
You know what I mean.

219
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,795
I mean...

220
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,597
feel like we do.

221
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,309
They feel the same.

222
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:25,181
You're not well.
I'm fine.

223
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,154
I'm just... I'm trying
to explain something to you,

224
00:16:27,178 --> 00:16:28,588
something important.

225
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:31,223
And I am listening.
I always listen, don't I?

226
00:16:31,265 --> 00:16:32,965
'Cause I'm your friend, Bernard.

227
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,846
And as your friend, I'm going
to tell you this one time only.

228
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,660
These feelings you described,

229
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:42,291
these aren't Epsilon feelings.

230
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,408
These are Bernard feelings.

231
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:45,589
No, this is not
anything like that.

232
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:47,243
Oh, please.

233
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:48,842
How many times
have you sat in that very chair

234
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:50,185
and then complained about...
This is different.

235
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,928
"No one respects me
at the Hatchery."

236
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:53,180
"I don't feel like
an Alpha Plus."

237
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:54,281
Stop it.

238
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,805
"I never know what
to say to people.

239
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:57,381
I'm Bernard."

240
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,769
I'm telling you
that I connected with...

241
00:16:58,793 --> 00:16:59,793
I had a vision.

242
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:03,325
No, you had a bad afternoon.

243
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,316
You said you had no soma, right?

244
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:06,943
I ran... I ran out 'cause
I had to give it all to...

245
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:09,227
Right. So there you have it.

246
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:11,823
You were overtaxed.
Simple as that.

247
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:15,227
This Epsilon fell. Upsetting...
He jumped.

248
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:17,869
Stop it!
I don't want to hear it.

249
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:27,406
What are you doing?

250
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:29,588
I'm arranging for you
to have my table

251
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,615
at the Pleasure Garden tonight.

252
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,637
Why would you do...
Please don't...

253
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:36,251
You will go there, you will
meet some young, eager thing,

254
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,460
and you will do
what is expected of a man

255
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,921
in your position.

256
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,590
You want to make
a connection, Bernie?

257
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,600
Well, make it there.

258
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:46,316
'Cause quite frankly, my friend,

259
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,230
if you're not happy,
you're nothing at all.

260
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:03,328
That's the spirit.

261
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:09,454
It's not nice to tease.

262
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,590
Says who?
And who says I'm teasing?

263
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,457
What happened to "never
go minus before midnight"?

264
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:18,916
I'm just... testing the range
of my "come hither."

265
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,017
Well, lucky you.
You won't need it tonight.

266
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,631
Lucky me.

267
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:26,957
So here's what I'm thinking.
Hmm?

268
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,901
You ready? Be honest.

269
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:33,638
Hmm... mm.

270
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:36,811
No? Okay. Fine.

271
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:39,901
Too many memories anyway.

272
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:41,817
Wow, that is...

273
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:45,386
What? Not his thing?

274
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,656
It's not anyone's thing.

275
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,674
You never know.

276
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,500
Oh... you.

277
00:18:52,573 --> 00:18:53,733
Everybody likes Sexy Cat.

278
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,737
If you say so.

279
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,652
Maybe just be yourself.

280
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:49,801
Hi, Henry.

281
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,270
Hi.

282
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:55,296
This is Frannie.

283
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
This is Damon.

What?

320
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:49,675
Hi. I just...

321
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:51,106
<i>Thank you, everyone. Thanks...</i>

322
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,659
You okay?
Do I look okay?

323
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:57,343
Hell no.
I'm hot as balls in this thing.

324
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,829
Jesus, John, you gonna give me
a... hand here, or what?

325
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,176
Oh.

326
00:24:09,857 --> 00:24:12,417
So?

327
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,376
Oh, Christ, man. Spit it out.

328
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:17,057
They'll be coming soon.
No, no, no.

329
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,781
You didn't show last night,

330
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,251
so I thought maybe
something happened.

331
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:21,845
It's not a big deal.
Right.

332
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,928
Yeah, there was
a meeting last night.

333
00:24:23,954 --> 00:24:26,124
With your group?
Yeah.

334
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,668
You gotta come sometime.

335
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:32,342
It's too bad, you know?
I thought you were coming over.

336
00:24:32,412 --> 00:24:35,212
I wanted to show you the view.

337
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,870
You already showed me the view.

338
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,684
I wanted to show you again.

339
00:24:40,754 --> 00:24:43,064
You're bad.
Am I?

340
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:44,776
I already told you
it's not a good idea.

341
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,070
Why not?

342
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,362
Because I'm
with somebody, dummy.

343
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:50,896
Yeah, but I'd be good to you.

344
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:54,863
And what's that got
to do with anything, huh?

345
00:24:54,935 --> 00:24:58,775
Hey, dickhead.
Oh, see what I meant?

346
00:24:58,855 --> 00:25:01,105
I don't need to be dealing
with this shit.

347
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:03,395
Hey, I'm talking
to you, stagehand.

348
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,829
You better go.
I'll cool him out.

349
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,757
Today's show was a... mess!

350
00:25:07,781 --> 00:25:09,681
Get the hell out of here, John.

351
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,908
Hey, baby, come with me.
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

352
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:19,086
You made us look like a bunch
of... idiots out there.

353
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:22,397
How am I supposed to work
with this shit?

354
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:24,750
Sorry, Kvle.
Your sorry, man.

355
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,734
You don't care.
That's your problem.

356
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,444
I don't understand why
you can't just be professional

357
00:25:28,468 --> 00:25:30,018
for one goddamn show...

358
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,073
As we discussed, you have
to check the firing pin

359
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,797
before you use a weapon
in the show...

360
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,444
You check the...
Firing pin, prop boy.

361
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:38,055
Do your job!

362
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,439
And get it through your head...

363
00:25:39,513 --> 00:25:41,299
We don't do it right,
then maybe they stop coming.

364
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:43,167
And if they stop coming,
we don't eat.

365
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:49,474
Hey, I know you're not
gonna make me wait for you.

366
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:50,838
Jerk-off.

367
00:25:53,535 --> 00:25:54,755
You had enough yet?

368
00:26:56,473 --> 00:26:58,023
Just give me the goat.

369
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,320
Look, friend, I deal in quality.

370
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:02,536
It's a complete set.

371
00:27:02,562 --> 00:27:04,122
I can't go breaking it up

372
00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:06,848
just 'cause you got
certain... preferences.

373
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:07,876
Just give me the goat.

374
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:14,001
You're gonna buy something
this time?

375
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:15,524
What happened to the good stuff?

376
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:18,501
What are you talking about?
All I got is good stuff.

377
00:27:18,578 --> 00:27:22,128

These are rare
totemic artifacts.

385
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,574
I found them eight feet down,

398
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:31,335
Yeah. I can't do that.

399
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:34,289
I don't...
Hey, hey.

I'm gonna help you out.

to about finding the girl

00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,460

419

with those vile children.

an obscenity.

These outsiders come here,
take our land.

462
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:19,238
They build that insult
for their own amusement.

463
00:35:21,394 --> 00:35:24,574
I don't like being laughed at.

468
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,916
She can't help you.
I think you made a mistake.

469
00:35:40,997 --> 00:35:42,637

the wrong person.

474
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:56,653
washing those cars.

475
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,020
Putting on plays
for these outsiders,

476
00:35:59,098 --> 00:36:01,928
these New Worlders.

477
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,832
They love nothing.
They believe in nothing.

478
00:36:07,649 --> 00:36:10,209
Look at that blue horror
out there.

479
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,002
Burns you and me to ash
if we so much as touch it,

480
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:18,083
and yet, they walk
right through.

481
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,379
How do they do that?

482
00:36:21,454 --> 00:36:24,564
Makes you wonder
if they're even human.

483
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:31,577
You wanna know what's in there?
No.

484
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:35,886
Your destiny.
No, no.

485
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:37,797
No! Wait!

486
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,901
No, no.

487
00:36:39,973 --> 00:36:42,823
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

488
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:46,541
A chance to live or die by
your own wits, your own will.

489
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,745
Open your eyes.

490
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,829
We're going to tear it
all down, John,

491
00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:02,655
take back what's ours.

492
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,839
What do you want me to do?

493
00:37:05,915 --> 00:37:09,005
You're asking
the wrong question, sweetheart.

494
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:11,805
The question you gotta
ask yourself is "What am I?"

495
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:20,727
A free human being?

496
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,405
Or a washer of cars?

497
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,687
<i>Marx, what are you doing?</i>

498
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:13,297
<i>Why are you off-line?</i>
Oh, I wasn't.

499
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,038
I mean, for a moment, sir, I'm...

500
00:40:15,062 --> 00:40:17,016
<i>What is it you do?</i>

501
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,018
"Do," sir?

502
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,992
<i>When you're alone.</i>

503
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:26,189
<i>I reviewed your activity.
You've been private lately.</i>

504
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,706
No... have I... have I?
<i>Yes.</i>

505
00:40:28,784 --> 00:40:32,054
<i>Optic out, off network,
disconnected.</i>

506
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,640
<i>No recent sexual connections,
no communal...</i>

507
00:40:35,717 --> 00:40:37,394
Well, that's just a matter
of free time...

508
00:40:37,418 --> 00:40:40,138
<i>That's unacceptable, Bernard.</i>

509
00:40:40,213 --> 00:40:42,893
<i>It's solipsism.</i>

510
00:40:42,965 --> 00:40:45,345
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

511
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:49,936
<i>Privacy is a vice the social
body simply can't afford.</i>

512
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:53,654
<i>I shouldn't need
to explain this to an Alpha.</i>

513
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:58,246
<i>But then, you're not quite
an Alpha, are you?</i>

514
00:41:02,818 --> 00:41:06,228
I'm an Alpha Plus, sir.

515
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,666
<i>Clean yourself.</i>

516
00:41:10,493 --> 00:41:13,253
<i>Explain this.</i>

517
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:15,239
It's a grapefruit.

518
00:41:15,315 --> 00:41:18,755
<i>It's the grapefruit you
dropped at the incident today.</i>

519
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:20,604
<i>Why would you do such a thing?</i>

520
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,940
<i>You are to assess
emotional trauma</i>

521
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:27,897
<i>and administer soma accordingly.</i>

522
00:41:27,927 --> 00:41:29,767
The Epsilon...

523
00:41:29,845 --> 00:41:34,725
I wanted... to understand.

524
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:38,779
<i>You understand he fell?</i>

525
00:41:38,854 --> 00:41:41,124
<i>To believe otherwise
would be irrational.</i>

526
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,956
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

527
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,112
<i>To be honest, Bernard,
you don't look well.</i>

528
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,796
I'm... I'm fine, sir.

529
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,209
<i>Not well at all.</i>

530
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:00,420
<i>Depleted, exhausted.</i>

531
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,141
<i>Have you considered a vacation?</i>

532
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,800
<i>It isn't up for debate.</i>

533
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,860
<i>I know just the thing
to sort you out.</i>

534
00:42:18,978 --> 00:42:22,408
<i>Welcome to the Savage Lands!</i>

535
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,921
You gonna invite me in?

536
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,995
I thought you wanted
to show me the view.

537
00:42:35,077 --> 00:42:37,427
Not tonight.
Oh, don't be like that.

538
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:41,226
How the...
Do you want me to be?

539
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,100
Grateful.

540
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:46,047
We're giving you a chance.

541
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,050
I can't do what you're asking.

542
00:42:51,177 --> 00:42:53,187
It's not me.

543
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:56,451
I like you, John,
but the others...

544
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,371
Promise me you'll
think about it.

545
00:43:10,571 --> 00:43:13,451
I'd hate for anything
to happen to you...

546
00:43:16,911 --> 00:43:18,155
Or your mom.

547
00:43:37,523 --> 00:43:40,483
Lenina, what are you...
I didn't everything you said.

548
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,069
I reconnected...
I took, I touched, I gave.

549
00:43:43,145 --> 00:43:44,414
This is inappropriate
at your level.

550
00:43:44,438 --> 00:43:45,888
At my level? What about you?

551
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,035
Me? I'll have you know...

552
00:43:47,066 --> 00:43:49,406
I saw you tonight,

553
00:43:49,485 --> 00:43:52,445
standing there alone,
running away like a coward.

554
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,880
You're a hypocrite.

555
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,870
Did you hear me, Bernard?
Yes.

556
00:44:01,163 --> 00:44:02,433
I don't feel better.

557
00:44:05,918 --> 00:44:07,098
Neither do I.

558
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:11,898
What did you say?

559
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:17,256
I'm tired.

560
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,360
And it seems that I'm
in some sort of trouble.

561
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:22,903
I've been told my behavior
is private.

562
00:44:22,977 --> 00:44:25,027
I've been off network.

563
00:44:25,104 --> 00:44:27,082
But I know what's
expected of me,

564
00:44:27,106 --> 00:44:30,616
so I... I try to...

565
00:44:30,693 --> 00:44:32,438
I don't have a problem with sex.

566
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:33,588
I don't.

567
00:44:33,612 --> 00:44:35,641
I mean, sex is something
that I...

568
00:44:35,665 --> 00:44:39,125
Believe me, sex is something
that I... I...

569
00:44:43,706 --> 00:44:47,466
It's not real.

570
00:44:47,543 --> 00:44:50,263
What's not?
Any of it.

571
00:44:50,337 --> 00:44:54,637
I don't know. It.

572
00:44:54,717 --> 00:44:58,297
Me.

573
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:02,301
I'm not who I'm supposed to be.

574
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:04,115
Everyone sees.

575
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,460
Maybe I can help with that.

576
00:45:23,704 --> 00:45:26,016
Can't Indra tell the difference?

577
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,180
I mean, does this work?

578
00:45:30,252 --> 00:45:34,375
Projecting ourselves?
I don't know.

579
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:37,189
I've always wanted to try.

580
00:45:42,348 --> 00:45:45,068
You were wrong,

581
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,162
about Henry, I mean.

582
00:45:47,236 --> 00:45:50,346
It wasn't the Alpha Plus of him
that pulled me in.

583
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:52,623
What was it?

584
00:45:52,691 --> 00:45:56,541
Maybe it's my conditioning.
I'm a good scientist.

585
00:45:56,621 --> 00:46:00,261
I've always been curious,
wanted a look inside things.

586
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,176
Henry let me.

587
00:46:07,706 --> 00:46:09,386
Do you see inside me?

588
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:19,251
What do you see?

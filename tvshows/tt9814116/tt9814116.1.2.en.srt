<i>Yes. Him.</i>

00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,361

<i>I've seen enough.</i>

14
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:56,314
You're staring.

15
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:57,661
Don't stare.

16
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:01,813
I've just never
seen it done before.

17
00:01:01,837 --> 00:01:04,137
If I may ask,

18
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:06,894
what's it like?

19
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,247
Communing with Indra?

20
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:12,237
What do you hear?

21
00:01:16,268 --> 00:01:18,608
I need to speak
with this Epsilon.

22
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:19,907
Speak with an Epsilon?

23
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:22,568
Not "an" Epsilon.

24
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,289
This Epsilon.

25
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,498
Of course.

26
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:30,582
Well, he appears to be a CJack.

27
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,087
Nothing gets by you.

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,030
Thank you.

29
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,725
Told you.

30
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:41,029
Here it comes.

31
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,206
Ow!

32
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:47,984
I think maybe you enjoy this
more than you should.

33
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,188
I like coming down here.

34
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,265
All the sweet little faces

35
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,437
discovering the system together.

36
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,656
Learning how to fit.

37
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:00,819
Everyone in their place.

38
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:03,276
Everybody happy now.

39
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,416
You say it
like it's a bad thing.

40
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:08,382
Don't take it for granted.

41
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:10,533
These children will never know
violence, prejudice...

42
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:12,212
Ooh, wait for it.

43
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:13,752
Wait for it.

44
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,285
Told you.

45
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,840
<i>Lenina Crowne.</i>
Shit.

46
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:20,915
I'm late.

47
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,931
You made me late.

48
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:26,312
You know,
you don't have to go.

49
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:27,688
Why wouldn't I?

50
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:29,525
Everyone's always talking
about how thrilling it is.

51
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,439
Justin says you can get
right up close to them.

52
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:33,338
Yes, it's fascinating and wild,

53
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,982
and that's really not the point.

54
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,805
The point is,
you want your first time

55
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,660
to be a memory worth having.

56
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:41,735
You make love at the Excelsion

57
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:43,791
to anyone, everyone.

58
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,392
You visit the exhibitions.

59
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,866
It's all very authentic,
very real.

60
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:51,504
I don't remember you ever going.

61
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,775
You can rest assured
that when I do go,

62
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,718
it'll be with a proper Alpha,
not Bernard Marx.

63
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,002
He's an Alpha Plus.

64
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,427
Everyone says
his embryo was mishandled.

65
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:01,424
He's no Plus.

66
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:03,608
Probably not even an Alpha.
Who is "everyone"?

67
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:05,019
I'm trying to give you
some friendly advice.

68
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:07,313
Mm.
Kind of you.

69
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,967
I'll be sure to tell you
all about it

70
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:10,807
when I get back.

71
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:46,887
Sorry.
Ah.

72
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:49,018
Am I late?

73
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,296
Yes, you... really, you are,
but it doesn't...

74
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,731
You look...

75
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:56,369
Thank you.
So do you.

76
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,819
Oh, allow me to get these
for you.

77
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:04,172
Sure.

78
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:16,576
Well, this should be fun.

79
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,562
You know, I love
the Reclamation Center

80
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:31,586
at this time of day, don't you?

81
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,931
All the colors, so...

82
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,897
It's the cremation process.

83
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:40,526
The red color, I believe,
is phosphorous.

84
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:41,866
Or it could be aerosol particle

85
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,110
scattering of sunlight.

86
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,162
Which happens
when they're the same size

87
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,656
as the wavelength
of the radiation.

88
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,948
Smoke's denser there.
Do you see?

89
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,469
Shorter wavelengths
can't get through.

90
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,493
No blues, no greens.

91
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:55,909
All you see is what's left.

92
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:59,117
The remaining light.

93
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,177
Longer wavelengths.

94
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,751
And it's red.

95
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:05,128
Hmm.

96
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,826
Is it your first time?

97
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,445
There's nothing to it.

98
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:42,043
<i>Flight time:
11 minutes, 37 seconds.</i>

99
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:45,577
Come on, girls.

100
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,960
Imagine if we see a mother

101
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:49,668
or a father or what's...
A grandfather?

102
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,509
Excuse me.

103
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:56,466
Beta.

104
00:05:56,548 --> 00:06:00,428
Did you see that?

105
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,838
Ah.
Here we are.

106
00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:10,786
Every Alpha goes

107
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:12,748
to the Savage Lands at that age.

108
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:13,862
Why?

109
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,420
To learn what's at stake.

110
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,882
When you ask someone to care
for the health of a society,

111
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:24,466
it... well, it makes
quite an impression

112
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:25,884
to show them a dead one first.

113
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,513
Whoa, whoa, wait,
what is this?

114
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:34,094
<i>Stand by for launch</i>

115
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:38,099
<i>in four, three, two, one.</i>

116
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:44,638
Bernard.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,590
Out of range.
No network.

118
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,809
Nothing can reach up here.
Not even Indra.

119
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:34,216
You're gonna wanna feel this.

120
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,333
Stop it.

121
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,067
Stop it.
Stop that.

122
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,870
Sit down.
Stop it.

123
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:43,875
These new ones do cause me
some concern.

124
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:46,155
Amazing.

125
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:47,944
It's amazing.

126
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,598
Bernard, you must try this.

127
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,890
Maybe on the way back.

128
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:54,016
Lenina, you have
to come down now.

129
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,276
I'm flying!

130
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,100
And I see,
but we are clearing apogee

131
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,637
as we speak and you really...

132
00:07:58,711 --> 00:07:59,831
Lenina, don't.

133
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,283
Sorry.

134
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,851
Lenina.

135
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,784
Hey.

136
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,310
You ever lend money, goods,
or other stuff

137
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:39,353
to friends or family

138
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:41,007
and they take their sweet time

139
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,207
getting it back to you?

140
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,095
Well, those days are over,

141
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:46,402
thanks to a nifty new gadget
called the Thanks Buddy.

142
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,646
Here's how it works:

143
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,817
Just give your buddy some money,

144
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:53,856
clip on the Thanks Buddy
Responsibilibracelet,

145
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,323
and set the timer.

146
00:08:55,393 --> 00:08:56,533
And forget about it.

147
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,033
When your buddy gets you back,

148
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,824
you simply punch in the code

149
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:01,737
and you're all square.

150
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:03,736
Thanks, buddy.

151
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:05,671
But let's say your buddy thinks
he's a little slick.

152
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:08,045
Well, then the Thanks Buddy
has got you covered.

153
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,128
Thanks, buddy.

154
00:09:14,203 --> 00:09:15,723
<i>The guy who borrowed your rake?</i>

155
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,006
<i>Thanks, buddy.</i>

156
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:19,382
<i>Gave mom 20 for groceries?</i>

157
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:23,693
I was watching that.

158
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,310
You were out late last night.

159
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:30,694
You were with that girl.

160
00:09:30,762 --> 00:09:31,762
We're not doing this.

161
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,091
I have a lot of shit on my mind.

162
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,275
Mm.

163
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:41,069
She's gonna lock you
in that baby trap.

164
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,367
You're gonna end up
working for her fat daddy

165
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:47,832
in his worm farm.

166
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:50,914
Then what's gonna happen to me?

167
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,193
Where am I gonna go?

168
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,747
You wanna go?

169
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,016
Let's go.
The truck's charged.

170
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,472
We get in right now,
drive a few hours.

171
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,756
We could be in...
Where? The desert?

172
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,201
Stranded, no roof?

173
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,415
There... there are places.

174
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:02,811
What places?
Says who?

175
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,225
We're gonna die here!

176
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:12,186
Well, then...

177
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:13,541
I might as well have a drink.

178
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:22,401
He's not coming back.

179
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,870
He doesn't exist.

180
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,946
Shut your mouth.

181
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:35,111
John.

182
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:49,805
Oh, that really was fun.

183
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:55,017
Everything you imagined?

184
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:58,146
How could I ever imagine this?

185
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:02,221
Shall we?
It's, um...

186
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:16,496
Lenina.

187
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:17,916
Hmm?

188
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,468
It's a deer beast.

189
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,182
Hideous.

190
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,532
As if it's not hard enough

191
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,440
scraping out some meager
existence in this place,

192
00:11:29,464 --> 00:11:31,033
you have to worry
about being gored and eaten

193
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,337
by one of those things.

194
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,822
Don't worry.
I'll protect you.

195
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,490
Well, they're all gone now,
thankfully,

196
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:41,024
so you're off the hook.

197
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,980
The Savages saw to that.
Oh.

198
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,320
It's a bit...

199
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:47,276
it's a bit sad, isn't it?

200
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:49,376
They had to do something,
didn't they?

201
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,250
Said they fought them
with everything they had.

202
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,497
Their guns, their auto cars,

203
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:54,588
whatever they could get
their hands on.

204
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,317
They're actually
quite resilient people.

205
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,341
Yeah, sure, but...

206
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,338
whole species.

207
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,920
Bernard Marx?
Is this her?

208
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:04,975
Yes.
Lenina Crowne.

209
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,139
How lovely.
Welcome to the Savage Lands.

210
00:12:07,218 --> 00:12:09,288
I have these for you.

211
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,852
Thank you.

212
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:14,985
You just put it on there.

213
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,940
Allow me.

214
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:22,615
Now, I believe
you're not scheduled

215
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,620
to go into the park
until tomorrow, correct?

216
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,034
Yes.

217
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:27,456
Yeah, we thought we would take
a bit of time,

218
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,720
check out the hotel, settle in.

219
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,030
Indeed, sir.
Indeed.

220
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,380
Outstanding.

221
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,089
There are already
a number of guests

222
00:12:36,113 --> 00:12:37,132
at the conjugal pool if you...

223
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,156
Thank you.

224
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,999
Your guidebook.

225
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:44,138
Oh.

226
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,553
Oh, so quaint.

227
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:47,223
Yes.

228
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,261
So there are two tours each day,

229
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,925
morning and...
That's our afternoon tour

230
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,474
heading out in an hour or so.

231
00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:55,928
There are four houses to visit
in the park:

232
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,268
House of Want,
House of Futility,

233
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,944
House of Consequence,
and House of Monogamy.

234
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,303
If you're staying a few days,

235
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:04,243
by all means,
see each and every one,

236
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:05,907
but if you're pressed for time,

237
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,575
I recommend visiting Want
and Consequence.

238
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,099
Not the others?

239
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,163
Each house provides an authentic

240
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,623
and fascinating view
into Savage life,

241
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:17,874
but I do advise
our more sensitive guests

242
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:19,537
to avoid Monogamy.

243
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:21,175
It's quite compelling,
of course,

244
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,510
but challenging.

245
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:26,949
Thank you.

246
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,423
<i>Listen to this:</i>

247
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:30,929
"Among the Savage traditions
still practiced today

248
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,060
is saving oneself
for marriage."

249
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:35,297
For or from?
Listen.

250
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,526
"Males and females
entering into monogamy

251
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,028
voluntarily withhold
sexual pleasure."

252
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,572
From each other?
From everyone.

253
00:13:41,596 --> 00:13:42,696
Anyone.
Themselves, even.

254
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,652
That's cruel.
Why?

255
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,124
Why?

256
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,369
Doesn't say why.

257
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,113
Hmm.

258
00:13:49,186 --> 00:13:51,526
I suppose no one knows why.

259
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:55,656
That's what makes it
so primitive and mysterious.

260
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,335
Here we are.

261
00:13:57,412 --> 00:13:58,842
417.

262
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:08,304
What's wrong with it?

263
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:09,652
Oh, hold on.

264
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:22,016
Oh, Bernard.

265
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:29,113
It's so authentic.

266
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:39,621
They let you touch the skin
of an ancient one.

267
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:43,325
It's transparent, the skin.

268
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:44,443
Pass on that.

269
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,012
This isn't right.

270
00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:58,603
This isn't right.

271
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:03,498
What do you mean?
It's perfect.

272
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:26,673
There's a view.

273
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:29,002
And a smell.

274
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:31,168
We're on the wrong side.

275
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:33,557
I specifically requested...

276
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,808
Why does it never...
What's wrong?

277
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,107
Nothing.
It's fine. Forget it.

278
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,333
Well, it doesn't seem
like there's...

279
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:43,427
It's nothing.
Go read your book.

280
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,989
It... I just had a...

281
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:50,575
I just had it a certain way
in my head

282
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:52,409
and now it's just...

283
00:15:56,731 --> 00:16:00,121
On my Teen Alpha trip,
I just remember

284
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,332
there was a big room
on the top floor

285
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:05,358
facing the sunset.

286
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:09,092
For all of us.

287
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,288
And a whirling water tub
on the balcony.

288
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,630
And...

289
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,256
I don't know.
I was young and...

290
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:17,352
Bernard?

291
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,060
But there was... there was
something about that view.

292
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,814
Or that night or...

293
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,239
maybe it was being
out of New London

294
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:30,503
for the first time that just...

295
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,646
It made us forget who we were.

296
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:41,538
I was happy.

297
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:45,327
I was...

298
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,834
I was different.

299
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,247
They were different.

300
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:52,113
Different how?

301
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,218
They were kind.

302
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,126
Did you know

303
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,650
before the monogamy,

304
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:12,158
the females take the bride

305
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,691
to look at greased, naked males?

306
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:20,108
She's aroused, but...

307
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:23,409
she doesn't touch.

308
00:17:23,484 --> 00:17:25,834
She can't.

309
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:27,565
You need to stop with that book.

310
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,709
And then on the wedding night,

311
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,844
after all that arousal,

312
00:17:34,912 --> 00:17:37,762
all that waiting,

313
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:41,222
the female...

314
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,553
gives her virginity to the male.

315
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,890
She does?

316
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,806
She does.

317
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,235
What's a virginity?

318
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,559
I have no idea.

319
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,583
What's wrong?

320
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,757
Oh, sorry.
Where were we?

321
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,731
No, tell me.

322
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:34,215
Please.

323
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,399
It's just a silly idea.

324
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:39,864
Silly?

325
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:43,641
Well, maybe not silly.
Maybe just more...

326
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,285
naughty.

327
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:49,253
Like, bad.

328
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:56,939
Go on.

329
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,882
What if we're not
like everyone else, Bernard?

330
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,298
Not here in this place.

331
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,636
What if...

332
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:10,222
What if we can be different
here?

333
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,349
I mean, I thought,
what would happen if...

334
00:19:12,426 --> 00:19:14,922
If we... if we...

335
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,236
If we saved ourselves.

336
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,276
It could be...

337
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,681
It could be... it could be...

338
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,355
It could be our wedding night.

339
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,950
Oh...

340
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:47,971
We're Savages.

341
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:02,074
You will respond
to the following question

342
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,568
by stepping forward.

343
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:05,622
Which of you touched
the deceased Epsilon

344
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:08,976
known as CJack57?

345
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,120
You will make yourself known.

346
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,962
I don't understand.

347
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:21,488
Epsilons are incapable
of deception.

348
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,215
A virus enters a cell.

349
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,594
That's how it begins.

350
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:32,481
Once inside, it corrupts,

351
00:20:32,556 --> 00:20:35,716
changing its nature,
altering its purpose.

352
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,061
The virus spreads,

353
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:41,807
cell by cell, undetected,

354
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,570
turning the body against itself

355
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,193
until...

356
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,570
I'm sorry, a what?

357
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,867
Virus.

358
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,740
It's an old word.

359
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,238
From before.

360
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,750
I see.

361
00:20:56,822 --> 00:21:00,212
What does it mean?

362
00:21:00,284 --> 00:21:02,964
It means
that perhaps our Epsilon

363
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:05,887
is no longer an Epsilon.

364
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,143
Stand aside.

365
00:21:12,212 --> 00:21:14,262
Make way
for World Controller Mond.

366
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:29,076
Tell them they may go.

367
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:30,525
All right.

368
00:21:30,606 --> 00:21:32,916
You Jacks get back to work.

369
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,582
Not you.

370
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:44,543
What is our name?

371
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,170
CJack60.

372
00:21:47,247 --> 00:21:50,007
We touched the dead worker.

373
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:51,269
Did we know the worker?

374
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:53,080
Yes.

375
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,264
I knew him.

376
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:00,233
You're a bit different,
aren't you?

377
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:02,142
It's all right.

378
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,531
You can tell me.

379
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,929
Truth is,
I'm a bit different too.

380
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:14,964
I wasn't.

381
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:18,084
But then...

382
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:19,153
now I am.

383
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:20,955
You changed?

384
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,130
When you touched him?

385
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:26,169
What happened to you?

386
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,665
What did you feel?
I didn't.

387
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:29,877
I don't.

388
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:31,717
Oh, I think you do.

389
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:32,953
Feel.

390
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,984
I felt him.

391
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,839
The worker.
My friend.

392
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:53,859
Did anyone else touch the body?

393
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:54,939
I need to know.

394
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:02,858
The Soma man.

395
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:10,881
Hey!

396
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,896
Sorry.
Sorry, everybody.

397
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,375
Apologies.

398
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,021
Sorry.

399
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:21,926
Greetings, and welcome
to the Savage Lands Adventure.

400
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,729
I'm Gamma Gracie,
and I'll be your guide today.

401
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,082
Before we get to the park,
I have a couple bits of info

402
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:31,196
to keep your visit fun, safe,
and Savage.

403
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,280
According to Savage lore,
their culture dates back

404
00:23:37,357 --> 00:23:40,697
almost 200 years.

405
00:23:40,777 --> 00:23:42,964
When the inception of Indra
allowed the civilized people

406
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,025
of the world
to form the World State,

407
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,219
the Savages chose to reject
that destiny,

408
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,753
which is why they continue
in their primitive existence

409
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,048
to this day.

410
00:24:32,996 --> 00:24:34,956
You didn't forget, did you?

411
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,090
Madysun.
Hey.

412
00:24:38,168 --> 00:24:40,008
Oh, shit, right.

413
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,807
Gimme a second.

414
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:16,139
It's gonna be a good crowd
today.

415
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,255
That's great.

416
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:21,288
That's great.

417
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,012
I need to talk to you.

418
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,508
Okay, places in 20.

419
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:28,863
Find me after the show.

420
00:25:33,557 --> 00:25:36,117
Hey.
Why aren't you ready?

421
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,337
She... loves me, man.

422
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,420
Look, dude,
I'm sorry about yesterday.

423
00:25:55,495 --> 00:25:58,005
You know, beaning you
in the head and stuff.

424
00:25:58,081 --> 00:25:59,931
Yeah. That's okay.
No, it's not.

425
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,878
I mean, God damn it,
I'm an artist, John.

426
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,039
You know this.

427
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,553
When things don't go right
out there,

428
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:08,271
I just can get a little...
You know?

429
00:26:08,342 --> 00:26:10,062
Right.

430
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,315
Hey.

431
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,362
Look, man,

432
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:19,941
there's nothing more dangerous
than live theater.

433
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,110
Okay?
There's no net, you know?

434
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:24,499
And I walk that wire
because in the end,

435
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:27,325
I want the same thing you want.

436
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:29,882
I just wanna show these people
something true.

437
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,205
Right?

438
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,961
Uh-huh.

439
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:35,571
Anyway, you were just trying
to do your job

440
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,585
and I was outta line, so...

441
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:39,093
I mean... it, man, come on.

442
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,894
Let's... let's have a good show.
Come on.

443
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,128
That feels good.

444
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:46,081
Yeah.

445
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,305
Oh, and one more thing.

446
00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:50,232
You go near my girl again,

447
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,899
I'll... kill you.

448

If I may direct your attention

452
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:30,639
to the left side,

453
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,466
I think I see...

454
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:33,551
Yes.

455
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:36,353
It's a complete unit.

456
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,884
Now, we don't always see
the females out like this

457
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,108
in the daytime.

458
00:27:40,183 --> 00:27:42,983
Notice the distended abdomen?

459
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,206
The infant will remain inside
her for a few more months

460
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,350
until it can fight its way
out of her body.

461
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:51,025
Beta.

462

Get up.
I can't see.

463
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,035
You heard me.

464
00:27:55,115 --> 00:27:57,165
I asked your Beta to move.

465
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,095
Yeah, I think the view's
actually better up front.

466
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,039
No.
I'm an Alpha.

467
00:28:01,121 --> 00:28:03,961
She's a Beta.
She moves.

468
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,180
No, wait.
Just...

469
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,180
Hey!

470
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,356
I'm sorry,

00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:18,171
great superstitious meaning
for the Savages,

497
00:29:18,248 --> 00:29:21,118
but from Savage lore, we know
that none were more important

498
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:23,341
than the annual Day of Black.

499

00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,732
<i>Next up,
the House of Monogamy.</i>

507
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:28,378
<i>Now, the reasons behind</i>

508
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:31,361
<i>the Savages' most primitive
practice remain a mystery,</i>

509
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:34,158
<i>but we do know that monogamy
is an important tradition</i>

510
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,377
<i>which allows the Savages
to combine the core values</i>

511
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,312
<i>of their culture:</i>

512
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,606
Ownership, competition,

513
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,750
jealousy, and strife.

514
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:43,253
And here we are.

515
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:46,375
We do hope you enjoy
the presentation.

516
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:49,253
For those of you continuing on
to the House of Consequence,

517
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:51,451
we'd like to remind you
to please keep your hands...

518
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,595
What's the House of Consequence?

519
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:55,227
It's called a prison.

520
00:30:55,304 --> 00:30:56,684
They...

521
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:58,685
Yeah, they cut off
part of their Social Body

522
00:30:58,765 --> 00:30:59,835
and keep it there.

523
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,461
Oh, fun fact:

524
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,095
Outside of captivity,
Savages are able to double

525
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:05,590
or even triple their body mass

526
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,824
through the consumption of food.

Yes.

I thought you weren't coming
till tomorrow.

538
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,825
Sorry, forgive me.
Who are you?

539
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:51,269
Cortez.

540
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:52,401
I administer the park.

541
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:53,871
Surely the Director told you
about me.

542
00:31:53,895 --> 00:31:57,155
Oh.
No.

543
00:31:57,232 --> 00:31:58,518
But he can be forgetful.

544
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,895
Can he?

545
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,539
Well, I suppose he can, yes.

546
00:32:02,612 --> 00:32:04,752
He sent me to administer
the park for one year.

547
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,553
Seven years ago.

548
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:12,415
Well, I hope you enjoy
your stay.

549
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:13,647
Oh, thank you very much.

550
00:32:13,674 --> 00:32:15,764
No, everything is just
as I remember it.

551
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,537
Oh, good.
When I came to the...

552
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:00,844
Well, I am going to miss it.

553
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,610
Oh, you're leaving?

554
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,852
He didn't tell you?

555
00:33:05,925 --> 00:33:07,611
Tell me what?

556
00:33:07,635 --> 00:33:08,635
Oh, it's time.

557
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,965
Do come and find me
after the show.

558
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,689
I'd love to give you a tour
personally.

559
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:14,365

But what does he do?

575
00:34:06,152 --> 00:34:08,582
He oversees the transfer
of ownership

576
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:10,049
to assure
that both sides are satisfied

577
00:34:10,073 --> 00:34:12,503
with the exchange.

578

Why does he wear that hat?

579
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,839

00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,603
They haven't changed a thing.

585
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:29,610
Why are the bridesmaids
so angry?

586
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,112
Because they're next.
Come on. Come on!

587
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:32,422
There's the father.

588
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:33,764
It's the second one
I've seen today.

589
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:35,218
I know.
They're everywhere here.

590
00:34:35,298 --> 00:34:36,676
I knew that... I mean,
it's one thing to know it,

591
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,827
but to see it
with your own eyes...

592
00:34:37,851 --> 00:34:40,861
Look, see, he gives her away
to the...

593
00:34:40,937 --> 00:34:43,107
To the groom man.

594
00:34:43,189 --> 00:34:45,029
Why?

595
00:34:45,108 --> 00:34:46,618
Doesn't he want her anymore?

596

<i>♪ A love that's lost its way ♪</i>

597
00:34:49,112 --> 00:34:52,002
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

598
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:55,043
to join Petr and Madysun

599
00:34:55,118 --> 00:34:57,088
in monogamy.

600
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,432
If there's any man here
who has some reason

601
00:34:59,506 --> 00:35:01,426
why they shouldn't be joined
together,

602
00:35:01,457 --> 00:35:03,467
forever and ever,

603
00:35:03,543 --> 00:35:06,433
without having anybody else,
ever,

604
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,607
let them speak now
or forever hold their peace.

605
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:10,641
I do.

606
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:11,711
I have something to say.

607
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:12,962
Not you.

608
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,806
Kvle the town outlaw?

609
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:17,739
Don't be monogamous with him,
Madysun.

610
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,686
Be monogamous with me.

611
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:22,157
This is jealousy.
It will lead to violence.

612
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:23,817
Let him speak.

613
00:35:23,897 --> 00:35:25,817
I am the mother of the groom

614
00:35:25,899 --> 00:35:28,978
and we must know if she has
no virginity to give!

615
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,733
Oh, Madysun.

616
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:35,527
How many nights did I call out
your name in the darkness?

617
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:38,671
All those nights I spent
in the cold,

618
00:35:38,745 --> 00:35:41,875
cursing the day I left
to seek my fortune,

619
00:35:41,956 --> 00:35:44,086
hungry by the roadside,

620
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:45,967
alone,

621
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:50,144
staring at the moon wondering,
"Is this her moon too?

622
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,475
Is there still some light
we share?"

623
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,005
And I dreamed of you, my love.

624
00:35:57,764 --> 00:35:59,944
And that dream saved me.

625
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:01,761
It kept me alive.

626
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:05,565
And I wanted to give it a word,
a name.

627
00:36:05,647 --> 00:36:08,697
What word do you call
your salvation?

628
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:11,695
Love?

629
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:14,023
That's not enough.

630
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:17,207
Because some women
carry the grace

631
00:36:17,283 --> 00:36:19,883
that requires metaphor.

632
00:36:19,953 --> 00:36:22,963
So I called it Moon.

633
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,709
And that's the name

634
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:26,881
I'm gonna call that baby
in your belly

635
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,560
because I'm the one
who put it there.

636
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:30,105
It's mine!

637
00:36:30,129 --> 00:36:31,609
It's my baby!

638
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:33,971
Like hell you will.

639
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,520
I'll kill you first.

640
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,552
Jealousy!

641
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:43,946
Is this part of it?

642
00:36:43,977 --> 00:36:46,827
Of course.

643
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,291
You!

644
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:58,089
I don't remember this.
They're not blanks!

645
00:36:58,116 --> 00:36:59,836
They're not blanks!
They're live rounds!

646
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:01,553
What, that's not his line.
They're live rounds!

647
00:37:01,577 --> 00:37:03,239
It's not his line!

648
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,220

649
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,012
Bernard?

650
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:10,635
Bernard?
Come on.

651
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,060
Come on!
Run!

652
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:14,000

653
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,620

Bernard.

Come on.

656
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:41,802
Bernard.
Bernard, open up.

657
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,126
Swallow.

658
00:37:43,202 --> 00:37:44,642
There's...

659
00:37:44,713 --> 00:37:46,013
They're shooting guns at us.

660
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:47,683
What? Why would...
There's something in me.

661
00:37:47,707 --> 00:37:48,885
What?
There's something...

662
00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:50,236
What... what do you...

663
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,800
No!

664
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,028
Why are you doing this, Bernard?

665
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:01,852
Bernard, stop doing this.

666
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:04,634
Two of them!
Spread out!

667
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:06,594
Come on.
Come on, Bernard.

668
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:52,948
Don't pity them.

669
00:38:53,022 --> 00:38:54,332
They don't deserve it.

670
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,250
They're dead.

671
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:05,376
You look at me.

672
00:39:05,451 --> 00:39:09,091
The outsiders,
they took our land.

673
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:12,133
They didn't take our dignity.

674
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:16,388
It was traitors like these
who gave it away.

675
00:39:16,462 --> 00:39:19,892
We didn't kill these people.

676
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:21,776
These people were never alive.

677
00:39:26,722 --> 00:39:29,902
Are you alive, John?

678
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,337
22 on the bus.

679
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:42,056
Seven dead.
Two missing.

680
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,420
I have people searching now.

681
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:47,881
They're not made for running.

682
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,712
Take whatever folks you need.

683
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,838
Go house to house

684
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:55,336
until you find them.

685
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,980
They're going to listen now.

686
00:40:07,054 --> 00:40:09,484
We will not be ignored.

687
00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:11,147
But first,

688
00:40:11,225 --> 00:40:14,315
collaborators must be held
to account.

689
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:15,485
You get up!

690
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,170
There is work to be done.

691
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:31,253
You don't wash cars anymore.

692
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,531
Bernard.

693
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:47,987
No!

694
00:40:53,893 --> 00:40:55,045
Bernard.

695
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:04,874
Bernard.

696
00:41:04,946 --> 00:41:06,906
Bernard.

697
00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:09,339
Bernard.
Please.

698
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,880
Shh.

699
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:45,039
Shh.

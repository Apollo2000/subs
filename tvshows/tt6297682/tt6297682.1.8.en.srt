1
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,351
- Ms. Harper!
- Ms. Harper, have you arrested

2
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,645
all four of the officers involved?

3
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,540
- Is this a conspiracy?
- What are the charges?

4
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,233
Is the JCPD cooperating
with your investigation?

5
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,945
- What penalties are you seeking?
- Ms. Harper, was Brenton Butler murdered?

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,613
Based on newly discovered evidence,

7
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,200
we have arrested four police officers
from Jersey City's South District

8
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,619
for their involvement in the death
of Brenton Butler.

9
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,955
I'll announce formal charges
at a bail hearing tomorrow.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,332
When will you release the names
of the four cops arrested?

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,584
Does this indicate a new...

12
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,355
- They lawyered up yet?
- Before we got the cuffs on them.

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,524
What do you expect?
They read the Miranda rights for a living.

14
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,468
The way they treat suspects, didn't think
they knew what they were saying.

15
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,140
Make sure you put them in separate cells.

16
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,980
Do you understand?

17
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,024
Because you don't look like you do.

18
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,115
Shit. Look who it is!

19
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,744
Man, yo! I'm about to make you my bitch,
pretty boy.

20
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,970
Hey, I'll see you in the yard!

21
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,139
Fuck her. You guys are all in here.

22
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,787
- We gotta get our shit straight.
- They don't got nothing on us.

23
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,456
- They can't prove we did anything.
- Hey, fuck you!

24
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,334
- This is on you! We ain't do shit!
- Yeah?

25
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,129
Well, you got rid
of that fucking grill guard off my car.

26
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,755
That makes you an accessory.

27
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,550
They're not gonna put us away,
we're fucking cops!

28
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,803
The car's gone,
they're never gonna find it.

29
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,055
- And we got alibis for that morning.
- "We"?

30
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,931
Not me.

31
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,894
You think I wouldn't find out
you left me off that report?

32
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,899
- The fuck you talking about?
- He was gonna set me up to take the fall.

33
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,735
That's crazy. Come on.
They can't even prove we were there.

34
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,154
They got the witness.

35
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,614
Yeah.

36
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,867
Why you think we in here?

37
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,952
Because of her.

38
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,396
Sorry. Hi.
I have seats for us down here.

39
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,885
Murderers!

40
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,347
You're going down! Going down!

41
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,194
Remain seated. Court is now in session.

42
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,738
The Honorable Steven Lafferty presiding.

43
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,376
Case number 1782439,

44
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,337
the State of New Jersey
v. Michael DiAngelo,

45
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,967
Emmanuel Gary Wilcox, Felix Osorio,
and Peter Jablonski.

46
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,095
KJ Harper for the State, Your Honor.

47
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,639
Barry Piumetti for the Defense,
Your Honor.

48
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,558
Does the prosecution wish to be heard
on the issue of bail?

49
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,768
Yes, Judge.

50
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:34,190
The State asks that the defendants
be detained without bail pending trial.

51
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:43,116
Or alternatively held
on a $500,000 cash bail.

52
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,743
Hold the noise down!

53
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,579
Hold it down or you'll be ejected
from the courtroom.

54
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,541
We have evidence connecting
one of the defendants

55
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,210
to the vehicle
that very likely hit Brenton Butler.

56
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,631
A witness places
the other three defendants at the scene.

57
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,885
For this reason,
the State charges the defendants

58
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,554
with aggravated manslaughter.

59
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:09,434
A firstdegree felony carrying
a maximum 20year sentence.

60
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,731
That's a joke!

61
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,029
Guys, come on. I mean it.

62
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,573
I can't let you disrupt
my judge's courtroom.

63
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,909
Either you sit down or you leave.

64
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,498
- Get out! Get out!
- Get out!

65
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,437
Proceed.

66
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,025
The seriousness of the crime charged
increases the chances that they'll flee.

67
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:03,446
Additionally, defendant Jablonski
has already proved himself a flight risk.

68
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,996
I'll set bail at $25,000 each,
cash or bond.

69
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,790
What?

70
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,792
That ain't right!

71
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,294
No way! That's not justice!

72
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,464
Settle down now!

73
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:25,009
Your Honor, at least require a cash bail.

74
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,220
Jablonski is a flight risk.

75
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,848
Defendant Peter Jablonski is granted bail

76
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,309
on the condition that he wear
a monitoring bracelet

77
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,311
until the completion of the trial.

78
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,521
Next case.

79
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,026
Case number 1782455,

80
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,404
the State of New Jersey v. James Miller.

81
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,954
My cousin Rusty got twice that bail
for burglary.

82
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,499
The police kill Brenton
and they're on the way to their crib?

83
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,669
- Some fucking bullshit.
- 'Cause Brenton's life don't matter.

84
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,297
He was nothing more
than a gangbanger to them.

85
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,216
Brenton wasn't no Five King!

86
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,969
What did you say?

87
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,221
Hey.

88
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,267
How'd he get that bike then?

89
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,939
It was mine.

90
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,358
Not Brenton's.

91
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,028
What was he doing in the park?

92
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,868
You better answer me, boy.

93
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,537
What was Brenton doing there?

94
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,968
Twenty years? Motherfucker!

95
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,972
Look, I'm just General Counsel to
the National Association of Police, okay?

96
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,891
I give advice, I make appearances.

97
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,893
I've never handled a case
like this before.

98
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,563
I'm not doing time behind bars
like a fucking animal, you understand me?

99
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,607
You're getting new representation.

100
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,027
Okay? Someone who has been to trial
multiple times.

101
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,070
Sam Hennessy is a ballbuster.

102
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,824
We were just talking about you.

103
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,461
I'm Sam Hennessy.
Pleasure to finally meet you.

104
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,674
Fuck me!

105
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,764
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's just, um...

106
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,643
- I'm Mike DiAngelo.
- I know who you are.

107
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,521
Half the fucking state knows who you are.

108
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,481
That's the problem.

109
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,861
Now that playtime's over,
I'm gonna need you to sign these

110
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,905
if you agree to retain me
as your attorney.

111
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,950
Fees will be paid
by the National Association of Police.

112
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,826
Any questions?

113
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,705
Only thing they got us on
is hindering an investigation, maybe...

114
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,542
conspiracy to leave the scene.

115
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,462
I see you've got it all figured out.
Shall I go ahead and leave now?

116
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,551
From now on,
leave the legal arguments to me.

117
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,972
None of what he says applies to me. Okay?
I was just riding in the back seat.

118
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,349
Yeah, me, too.
I want my case tried separate.

119
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,810
You want to go it alone?
Find your own attorney?

120
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,271
There he is.

121
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,608
Otherwise, you need to understand this.
It's simple.

122
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,362
Alone, you're just an idiot
who got his hand caught down his pants.

123
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,406
Together, you're cops.

124
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,325
Together, they have to put
the entire police force on trial.

125
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,704
And no jury ever convicts
the entire police force.

126
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,416
So, you all on board?

127
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,837
We're a team.

128
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,173
We do this together, right?

129
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,300
Yeah, okay.

130
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:53,718
Yeah, sure.

131
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,261
Good choice.

132
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,638
Any other questions?

133
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,473
What about the 20 years?

134
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:03,519
My guess is this assistant prosecutor,
KJ whatever the fuck her name is,

135
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,146
is overreaching.

136
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,982
Typical ploy to scare the bad guys
and get them to plea out,

137
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,275
you know how it goes.

138
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,945
Now, I'm gonna need you to tell me
everything that happened that morning.

139
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,030
Don't leave anything out.

140
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,825
Also need those pens back when you're done

141
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,994
so you don't turn them
into homemade shanks.

142
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:27,793
If the grand jury hands down indictments
for manslaughter, we can revisit bail.

143
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,256
I'm disappointed
we couldn't keep them locked up.

144
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,423
- We need to talk to Howard.
- Who?

145
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,551
He's Jablonski's neighbor.
He lives across the street from him,

146
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,803
and he knows things.
He knows about that blue car.

147
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,889
And I can take you to his house

148
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,974
- and make him tell me...
- You went to his house?

149
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,378
That won't be necessary.
Hey, hey, that won't be necessary.

150
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,853
I'll find this Howard.

151
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,855
Then I probably should go back
to the hospital,

152
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,024
because now we know
that Jablonski was there.

153
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,234
Latrice, please.

154
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,825
I have to prepare for a grand jury.

155
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,579
We don't even get a trial
if the grand jury doesn't indict.

156
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,915
And I need to put you on the stand.

157
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,377
But right now,
you don't make a credible witness.

158
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,590
Maybe you could talk to someone

159
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:17,093
who understands
what you're going through.

160
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,472
Can I ask where you're staying now?

161
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,683
Are you still in that motel?

162
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,104
I have a friend.

163
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,439
And I can stay with her.

164
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,152
I'll let you guys know
where you can reach me.

165
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,322
Yo, yo, yo. He good, he good.

166
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,243
I won't be needing this.

167
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,745
I say you do.

168
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,416
That mission you went on
to put down Jablonski?

169
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,084
It was sanctioned by a cop.

170
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,503
His higherup gave me the goahead.

171
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,881
A cop greenlighting a hit on another cop

172
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,426
sure as hell won't lose no sleep
killing your black ass.

173
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,348
You knew from the get
the motherfuckers who killed my nephew?

174
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,726
Look around you, man.

175
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,857
Do you know how many motherfuckers eat
because of me?

176
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,194
It's a delicate ecosystem.

177
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,238
Certain alliances are necessary.

178
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,117
I'm just playing the board
the way it's laid, bro.

179
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,536
We all do.

180
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,297
"Five to the sky till the day we die."

181
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,642
This is where we part ways, bro.

182
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,693
We can put them in the park.

183
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,446
Their cell phones were pinging off
the closest tower.

184
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,407
Jablonski was on the phone to DiAngelo
around the time of the accident.

185
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,327
Which constitutes the reckless mens rea
for death by auto,

186
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,828
not aggravated manslaughter.

187
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,998
This is all circumstantial.

188
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,543
- We have the witness.
- Who's a minor.

189
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,670
How do her parents feel
about her testifying?

190
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,421
They kicked her out a while ago.

191
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,840
She's been under police protection since.

192
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,717
I didn't see anything about that
in the file.

193
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,386
We had to keep it needtoknow.

194
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,805
Look at the nature
of who we're investigating.

195
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,976
She's with Fish's exwife,
who's an NYPD cop, on Long Island.

196
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,477
She is safe.

197
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,105
They hired Sam Hennessy.

198
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,274
Fine.

199
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,657
Hey.

200
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,576
Look at me.

201
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,290
Are you okay?

202
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,967
I am so sorry.

203
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,598
- I hate that this happened.
- I just want to get on with this.

204
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,893
She left.

205
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,228
Took the kids.

206
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,992
I wouldn't turn down a plea deal
if Hennessy offers.

207
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,702
I'll have Jessie set up a meeting.

208
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,121
Let me know how it goes.

209
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,378
The PO's gonna want to know my address.

210
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,190
They're gonna have to limit my movements
with the ankle bracelet.

211
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,217
You can't come back to the house.

212
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,345
Why didn't you leave?

213
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,263
What were you thinking?

214
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,683
I ain't a fucking coward.

215
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,435
I'm sick of your secrets,

216
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,647
I'm sick of being cut out of everything
in your life.

217
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,899
- No, what are you talking about?
- Your past.

218
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,110
This is about your dad, your childhood.

219
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,280
You think I'm so weak
I can't handle the truth of things?

220
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,908
Some things you don't need to know.

221
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,120
That shit doesn't matter.
You know me better than anyone.

222
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
Maybe.

223
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,335
I know your heart,

224
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,671
but not your life.

225
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,675
What kind of marriage is that?

226
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,848
Gonna need you to put
your foot up on that to get this on.

227
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,600
Yeah. I was just leaving.

228
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,648
What we're witnessing here
is nothing more than a witch hunt

229
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,858
against the Jersey City Police Department.

230
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,361
It's one we've become accustomed to seeing

231
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:31,699
in cities like Baltimore, Chicago,
New York... the list goes on.

232
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:36,120
Every police officer in America is at risk
of becoming the next scapegoat

233
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:40,249
for the racial ills of our society
and political correctness run amok.

234
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,127
It's a shame and it's a sham.

235
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,838
Thank you.

236
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:46,922
Thank you.

237
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,135
You've all been placed
on administrative leave.

238
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,429
So stay home, keep a low profile.

239
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,764
Yo, DiAngelo.

240
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,774
I'm not visiting you in jail.

241
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,405
Yo, man, if you want to get your story
on the record, I'll be fair to you, bro.

242
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,115
I'm not your bro. Quit hassling me.

243
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,793
I have to get up on the stand like on TV?

244
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,796
Forget whatever bullshit
you've seen on TV. Court is boring.

245
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,506
People will barely be paying attention.

246
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,633
We'll be lucky if the judge is even awake.

247
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,969
No, don't do that. Don't do... Jesus.

248
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,263
- I'm embarrassed for her.
- It's so she'll look cute.

249
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,016
I gotta make her stand out
from all the other bitches.

250
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,393
It's not a freaking Tinder profile.

251
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,687
It's so she'll get adopted.

252
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,775
Are you done thinking about it yet?

253
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,985
I got seven dogs. I can't, I'm sorry.

254
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,447
Come on. That dog in Pampers
is gonna die any day now.

255
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,032
It can't even move.

256
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,368
I bet you're gonna see a lot of her
every day for a long time to come.

257
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,038
She's gonna get adopted,
but probably not right away.

258
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,998
This place is a fucking death camp.

259
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,543
They give the dogs a couple weeks
to get adopted,

260
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,670
and if they don't,
they gas them in the back.

261
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,090
I saw the room.

262
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:16,887
It's her personality that makes her cute,
but you can't see that in a picture.

263
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,932
I'll take a picture of both of you,

264
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,975
and then you'll have something
to remember her by.

265
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,019
Because she's gonna get adopted
like tomorrow.

266
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,938
Say cheese.

267
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,899
Nadine.

268
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,568
She's gonna be okay.

269
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,694
Come on.

270
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,406
There you go. Get in there.

271
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,283
There we go.

272
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,702
Okay.

273
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,829
See?

274
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,500
I'll email that to you, and once you get
your phone and your internet back,

275
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,336
you can use it as your wallpaper,
whatever, when all this is over.

276
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,965
It's never gonna be over.

277
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:01,682
I am so grateful to have found all of you.

278
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,185
You know what it's like
to lose a child to violence.

279
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,148
There's no explaining, no justifying.

280
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,692
Just a lot of loving.

281
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,070
Wes.

282
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,822
You wanting to share?

283
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,616
Thanks, Ellie.

284
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,119
So today, um...

285
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,414
I woke up.

286
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,836
And I heard Andrew's laugh.

287
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:37,593
I know I share how quiet my son was,
but...

288
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,845
that laugh...

289
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,682
I don't even know where that came from,
you know.

290
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:48,437
He had one of them contagious joints,
you know what I mean? Like...

291
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:52,149
The next thing you know, you're laughing.
You don't even know why.

292
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,863
I remembered it this morning.

293
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:03,785
Made me think I'm the luckiest man
living on this earth...

294
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,163
that I heard my son's laugh.

295
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,460
Yeah.

296
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,172
Ms. Butler, you see how we do?

297
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,674
You want to...
You want to share something?

298
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,928
Um...

299
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,056
I don't know what to say.

300
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,480
I saw the man that...

301
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,857
that murdered my son.

302
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,943
And he was...

303
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,988
He wouldn't say it, he...

304
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,990
He wouldn't say what he did.

305
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,909
And I...

306
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,953
Now I...

307
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,457
I don't know what to do.

308
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,042
I just... I feel...

309
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,544
like I'm losing my mind.

310
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,546
I feel like, um...

311
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,926
like I don't know who I am.
I'm... I'm just...

312
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,348
I just don't know what to do anymore.
And I'm just really angry, and I...

313
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,103
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I need to go.

314
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,489
Excuse me.

315
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,284
- I have someplace I got to be.
- No, no, this... this you, right?

316
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,122
Thank you.

317
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,374
No problem.

318
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,917
Hey, listen.

319
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,338
All I had was anger, for years.

320
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,259
And it fueled me, gave me purpose.

321
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,261
I didn't want to let that go.

322
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:49,224
I felt like maybe I'm giving up on my son
or betraying him.

323
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,311
It's all I got.

324
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,148
I don't want to feel anything else.

325
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,987
You know what?
Six days out of seven are good.

326
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,449
It does get better.

327
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,829
Your son, when did he...

328
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,122
Ten years ago.

329
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,042
And last month was the anniversary.

330
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,877
Listen, just...

331
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,880
just keep coming back, all right?

332
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,674
Just holler at me.

333
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,927
Look, we're just here for each other,
that's all. All right?

334
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:30,182
So, ain't no shame, pick up the phone
if you want to, you know,

335
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,184
cry, you want to rage.

336
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:35,145
You know, you want to talk
about the weather. Whatever.

337
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:36,813
All right?

338
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,942
Take care of yourself.

339
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,880
Yo, Seth here?

340
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,924
He ain't been on the corner.

341
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,551
No, I haven't seen him.

342
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,016
Mind if I see Brenton's room?

343
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,064
I used to tease him.

344
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:05,652
Called him "rich boy"
because he had his own room.

345
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,533
Me and my brother and my sister
shared a room when we was young.

346
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,505
There was a seagull in the spokes
of my bike.

347
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,092
You think maybe I could get it back?

348
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,052
Police got your bike.

349
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,597
It's part of the investigation.

350
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,018
I'll see what I can do when they done.

351
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,229
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

352
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:50,280
Why was Brenton riding your bike
in the park that morning?

353
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,494
Please.

354
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,331
I need to know why this happened
to my son.

355
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,046
He was using my bike
to get through the park.

356
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,256
It was the fastest way home.

357
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,635
He didn't want y'all to know
he was out all night.

358
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,182
Brenton was...

359
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,102
He was with me
the night before he got hit.

360
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,243
He spent the night with me.

361
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,043
You and Brenton?

362
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,391
No.

363
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,145
Nah. No.

364
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,441
Brenton wasn't like that.
I didn't raise him that way.

365
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,110
This ain't got nothing to do with you!

366
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,698
When we was little,
they beat down Fernie Johnson.

367
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,617
Remember that?

368
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,789
I'll never forget the smell
of shit and blood coming off of him.

369
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:26,668
They had him laid out on the block
with his pants down to his ankles.

370
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,421
People wanted everybody to see it.

371
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,551
I just remember his eyes.

372
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,307
I protected Brenton.

373
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,895
I was slanging to save up money
so we could get out of here.

374
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,858
So we could be free.

375
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,283
Boys like us don't make it out of here.

376
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,961
Brenton made that seagull for me.

377
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,173
I want it back.

378
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:17,843
Get out.

379
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,514
What did you say?

380
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,475
I said get out!

381
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,268
- Get out!
- Get the...

382
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,561
Get out!

383
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,230
Get out! Get out!

384
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,980
All right, here we are.

385
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:27,122
- KJ. Great to finally meet you.
- Yeah.

386
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,251
So, what does "KJ" stand for?

387
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,423
It's a rush, right?

388
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:41,177
Walking into a room,
they expect to see "KJ" or "Sam,"

389
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:42,929
and it's us.

390
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,307
No better "fuck you" than that.

391
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,813
I was going to reach out to you,
but you beat me to it.

392
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,984
- It was my boss, not me.
- You'd rather go straight into the ring.

393
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,989
You can take the girl out of Jersey City,
but not the JC out of the girl.

394
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,534
- I'm from West Bergen.
- I'm from Brookdale.

395
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:09,164
The difference is nobody knows
you're from Jersey City, but me?

396
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,251
They always assume I'm from the hood,
even though I'm not.

397
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,712
Let's get to it.

398
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,088
What are you offering?

399
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,008
You have a circumstantial case at best.

400
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,261
I'm sure I can get my clients
to plead to hindering

401
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:26,097
and maybe assault by auto for Jablonski.

402
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,184
How about we just agree on jaywalking?

403
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,519
They'd get more time for that.

404
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,106
You can't even prove my client
was driving that car.

405
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:41,112
With my offer, you'll get your conviction,
you'll be a hero without the bullshit.

406
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,447
A kid died.

407
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,908
You call that bullshit?

408
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,495
- A gang member died.
- The press is wrong about Brenton Butler.

409
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,662
Who cares?

410
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,957
All that matters
is what the jury believes.

411
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,461
You were in that courtroom.
It's only going to get worse.

412
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,548
The cops will stop cooperating
on your cases,

413
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,134
which means your boss
stops getting convictions.

414
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,638
Last I heard,
Connelly's poll numbers were falling.

415
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,475
Your case must be weak
if you have to threaten a plea out of me.

416
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,060
I'm simply stating the facts.

417
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,396
Whether you choose to accept them as such
is your choice.

418
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:20,360
The police don't tolerate the prosecution
of one of their own. Ever.

419
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,863
A lot of cops think the law
doesn't apply to them.

420
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,825
But let me assure you, it does.

421
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,536
Would you like a drink?

422
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,497
My boozing days are over for good,
but feel free.

423
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,749
I'm fine with water.

424
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,795
Yeah, I used to match the boys
bourbon for bourbon.

425
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,297
Woodford, that was my poison.

426
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,635
I hear yours is Bombay Sapphire.

427
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,140
That's why it's important for us girls
to stick together.

428
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,060
Boys just can't keep dirty secrets.

429
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,940
It's a little early
to roll out the howitzer.

430
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,485
I thought you'd at least wait
for the appetizers.

431
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,196
Excuse me.

432
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,876
Those applying
to the Veterans Employment Program

433
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,378
must attend the initial
evaluation assessment.

434
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,380
Only then will you receive assistance.

435
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,640
What number you got?

436
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,062
We might be here a while.

437
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,026
Name's Khalil.

438
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,736
Seth.

439
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,703
Don't do it, my brother.

440
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,622
Shorter wait to reenlist,

441
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,665
but this here's less deadly.

442
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,091
Hey, um... Excuse me, brother.

443
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,677
Think you could save my seat
till I get back?

444
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,179
Just be about ten minutes.

445
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,644
Excuse me.

446
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,606
Excuse me.

447
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,826
Number 183.

448
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,913
Please bring all forms
and your military ID to the front desk.

449
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,964
Yo. Excuse me, man.

450
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,298
What's up?

451
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,717
Thank you too. I appreciate it.

452
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,310
Yo, you got something?

453
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,232
Yeah, I got something.

454
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,526
But not what you think.

455
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,589
Slice up that banana for Maggie's cereal,
will you?

456
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,970
You got any blueberries?
I hear antioxidants are good or whatever.

457
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,933
- Right.
- Nadine's been fine.

458
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,477
- I know you're dying to ask.
- Really?

459
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,540
'Cause I know it's a messedup situation,
me bringing her here and everything.

460
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,691
I like her. I mean, don't get me wrong,

461
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,735
I took away her phone,
disconnected the WiFi,

462
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:52,822
she wasn't too happy about the 9:00 p.m.
bedtime, but she's a good kid.

463
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:57,326
Yeah, once you pry the attitude
off of her, she's kind of sweet.

464
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,163
What you're doing,
taking care of this girl...

465
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,498
it's real good, Fish.

466
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,170
Maggie! Nadine! Breakfast.

467
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,255
Would you go up, get them?

468
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,299
I think you know your way upstairs
pretty well.

469
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,598
Okay, this is how I do it.

470
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,767
My mom's gonna kill me
if she finds out.

471
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,852
Can't believe you've never done this.

472
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:28,316
- Okay, so this is how I do it.
- Hey! Do you like my mani?

473
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,193
- Hey.
- Beautiful.

474
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,238
Your mom's calling.
And I gotta drop you off, so...

475
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,322
Let's boogie.

476
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,785
No, Dad, can we just finish? Please?

477
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,414
Just don't start in on her toes. Please.

478
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,961
This is horseshit.
You got no right to take her.

479
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,463
- Calm down.
- You're out of state,

480
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,067
you don't got jurisdiction here.
I don't care you got court order.

481
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,676
- Bring Nadine down.
- You need NYPD to execute that.

482
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,178
You can't just cross state lines.

483
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,764
- What's going on?
- You won't believe this shit.

484
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,811
A ward of the state?

485
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,896
We're obligated to keep
a minor like Nadine safe.

486
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,607
She was safe. And you thought telling him
was a good idea?

487
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,050
Look, KJ, her parents were gonna quash
any sort of subpoena.

488
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,945
It was the only way
to get her on the stand.

489
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,696
Where she'll be a hostile witness.

490
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,699
You've destroyed all the trust
we've built with this girl.

491
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,829
Do you have any idea how difficult it was
to get her to talk in the first place?

492
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,112
- Where did you put her?
- In a lockdown rehab facility.

493
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,624
It's the best place for her.

494
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,168
Twentyfour hour surveillance,
she's not going anywhere.

495
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,480
- Didn't leave me any choice.
- We had the situation handled.

496
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,631
She tested positive at the clinic
for heroin.

497
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,550
That's what you call handled?

498
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,763
This is my case
and you should have consulted me.

499
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,808
Who's that?

500
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,686
What's he doing?

501
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:03,077
Nadine, I didn't know they'd do this.
I swear to God.

502
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:07,081
They found her locked
in an abandoned house, starving to death.

503
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,004
Somebody left her in there
knowing she was gonna die, but...

504
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,256
they just didn't care.

505
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,844
No...

506
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,097
No, someone will come for Whiskey.

507
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,517
She'll be fine.

508
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,603
I promise.

509
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,700
Go away.

510
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,875
I'm sorry.

511
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,610
You watching this?

512
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,195
Motherfuckers.

513
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,821
Riot outside of Jersey City...

514
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,866
Look, why don't you go call the boys,
go out for a drink or bowling?

515
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,190
Do something. You're driving me crazy
just sitting there.

516
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,411
Sons of bitches.

517
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,666
You see this shit?

518
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,833
Get a fucking job!

519
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,127
Jesus, Mike. Enough.
What is wrong with you?

520
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,630
These fucking...
Who the fuck they think they are?

521
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:41,259
- I swear, I did not sign up for this shit.
- What the fuck you mumbling about?

522
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,219
I don't want you like this.

523
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,179
I don't want any of this.

524
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,683
How could you let this happen to us?

525
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,939
Get the fuck out.

526
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,523
Get out.

527
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,610
Get the fuck out of my house!

528
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,780
- Go! Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

529
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:11,080
The street nearly 13 hours
after the protests began.

530
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,626
Four Jersey City police officers
were arrested

531
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,296
in connection with the hitandrun
of 15yearold Brenton Butler.

532
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:23,509
Within hours of their arrest,
the four officers were released on bail.

533
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,053
Since then,
the National Association of Police

534
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:30,474
has hired prominent trial lawyer
Sam Hennessy to represent them.

535
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:34,770
A grand jury hearing will soon be held
to determine if they will be indicted

536
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,273
on charges of aggravated manslaughter,

537
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,233
a felony, that if convicted,

538
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,153
could put them behind bars for 20 years.

539
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,114
Neither the officers nor the family
of Brenton Butler

540
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,241
have made confirmations to the press.

541
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,712
Hey.

542
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,048
- Petey, you gotta come home.
- What happened?

543
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,300
Please. You gotta come home.

544
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,136
Marie, are you okay?
Are you all right? Is Mikey all right?

545
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,929
Just get over here now!

546
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,443
You okay?

547
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,653
Where's Mikey?

548
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,615
He's in the house and he's aslee...

549
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,949
What... What happened?

550
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,369
- They know where we live. I can't...
- Who?

551
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,121
- I can't stay in this house!
- Who are you talking about?

552
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,082
I can't stay here with Mikey.

553
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,875
They... They were here!

554
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,461
What... What are you talking about?

555
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:06,070
Pearl's four now
and Felix is just crazy for her.

556
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,613
It makes me jealous.

557
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,906
Don't talk about Pearl.

558
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:12,159
I don't want my kid's name in the paper.
Too many crazies out there.

559
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,595
Feeling threatened by the protests?

560
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,789
They attacked cops, outside the district.
One of our guys is in the hospital.

561
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,917
With a broken wrist.
Three of the protestors are in the ICU.

562
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,670
- Yeah, whatever.
- Papi.

563
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,341
Don't write that down.
That's off the fucking record.

564
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:32,221
Let's talk about the general culture
at the JCPD.

565
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,974
You ever been a victim
of any kind of racial epithets?

566
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,059
What? Get out of here. No.

567
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,941
"Two tacos and a tamale."
You forget about that?

568
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,776
You wrote that down?

569
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,279
Yo, Wilcox was just pulling my chain.

570
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,906
From what I recall,
you weren't exactly amused.

571
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,676
That's not going in the article.
Take it out or I'm done talking.

572
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,166
Look, man,
I know you don't want to do this,

573
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,252
but when your attorney set this up,
she said no questions about the case.

574
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,212
And you say no questions
about your family.

575
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,841
- But I need to write about something.
- Do you want a coffee or something, Luis?

576
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,635
I have some mallorcas to go with it.

577
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,846
Sure, thanks.

578
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,933
- Where's your bathroom?
- Down the hall, I'll show you.

579
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,966
Hennessy. This is Felix.

580
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,053
I got something from that reporter.

581
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,723
We have proof
that the lead investigator

582
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,016
on the Brenton Butler case,

583
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,185
Detective Joseph Rinaldi,

584
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,479
shared with a press source
false information

585
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,981
regarding police involvement
in the hitandrun.

586
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:10,486
This leak occurred before there was
any actual evidence to support it.

587
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:14,573
Clearly, Detective Rinaldi tried to create
an assumption of guilt

588
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,700
before his investigation was complete.

589
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,869
It is clear that since that time,

590
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:22,331
he has sought evidence to assert the guilt
of these four officers

591
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:25,209
as opposed to seeking
to discover the truth.

592
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,128
How could you have been so stupid?

593
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,673
I had no choice. You were gonna
abandon the case. Shut up!

594
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,175
Now the defense can discredit
any testimony you give.

595
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:36,845
- They'll say you fabricated evidence!
- I didn't fabricate shit and you know it!

596
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,057
It doesn't matter what I know,
it matters what the jury believes!

597
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,769
Your credibility's shot. She'll say
that you had it out for the cops.

598
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:48,023
- That's ridiculous. I'm a fucking cop.
- Whose wife slept with half his precinct.

599
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,067
That's what she's gonna say.

600
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,778
You opened the door with this.

601
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,623
Everything I couldn't be,
I wanted for him.

602
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,669
College, career.

603
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,464
Not just a job,
something that he could be proud of.

604
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,341
Um...

605
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:15,926
A wife.

606
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,512
Babies of his own.

607
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:24,351
We all have grieved loss
and wondered about what could have been.

608
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,521
Turns out, Brenton wasn't interested
in any of those things.

609
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,733
A wife.

610
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,324
I see.

611
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,783
Did Latrice know?

612
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,952
No, no, none of us did. How could we?

613
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:47,458
I mean, I always knew he was different.

614
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,629
But this?

615
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,882
Never.

616
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,885
Isaiah, let me ask you something.

617
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,889
How's it make you feel about your boy?

618
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:04,808
"Wicked."

619
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,979
"Abomination."

620
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,275
Those are God's words.

621
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,947
What am I supposed to do with that,
Pastor?

622
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:23,535
I can't begin to tell you
how foul I was living

623
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,538
before God called me to preach.

624
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,667
I came to a realization on my walk.

625
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:34,630
No one sin is any greater than any other.

626
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,298
But still, it's sin.

627
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,091
Maybe.

628
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,512
Or maybe God, in his infinite wisdom,

629
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:45,599
made your son exactly
what he wanted him to be.

630
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,768
Hey, where's that in the Book, Pastor?

631
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,856
Is God gonna forgive Brenton
for what he was?

632
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,193
I know what is in the Book, Isaiah.

633
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,611
The real question is...

634
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,115
can you forgive?

635
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,274
Good afternoon.

636
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,151
- Go ahead.
- Have your tickets ready.

637
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,745
So this is what you do all day long,

638
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,581
go back and forth across the river?

639
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,835
The address was on the card, so...

640
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,089
I wouldn't have it any other way.

641
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,757
Being out there on the water.

642
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,094
The best views are up top though.

643
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,596
It's cold down here.

644
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,890
It gets even colder up there.

645
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,894
Let me show you.
Save you some money too.

646
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,737
It's good to see you.

647
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,448
I didn't think I was gonna hear from you.

648
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:29,995
Yeah, I just... I don't know what to do
with myself. It's like...

649
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,624
My son's case...

650
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,585
The waiting is the hardest part.

651
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,215
Yeah, it is.

652
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,970
Can I ask you something?

653
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,555
How did Andrew die?

654
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:59,024
He went into a 7Eleven.

655
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,734
These dudes were sticking it up.

656
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:02,861
They shot him.

657
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:07,032
He just went in for a soda and a snack.

658
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,466
I didn't mean to bring up anything
that you'd rather not talk about.

659
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:17,334
It's all right. I just... I don't really
think about it too much, you know.

660
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,636
I still need to think about Brenton
every minute of every day. I...

661
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,682
I don't want to do anything else.

662
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,687
I think about my son
every minute of every day,

663
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:40,023
but I just try to remember how he lived.

664
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,115
It's beautiful out here, ain't it?

665
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,200
Even when it's cold.

666
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,720
Thank you.

667
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,901
Yo. Yo.

668
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,163
Yeah, I once waited three days
for my number to be called,

669
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,664
so I knew you'd be back.

670
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,957
Saved a seat for you.

671
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,041
Thanks.

672
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,675
Um...

673
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,179
- Could you save my...
- Yeah. Yeah.

674
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,734
- Would you like to pray?
- Nah, I'm good.

675
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,444
You are good, brother.

676
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,071
You don't know that.

677
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,782
You don't know shit about me, son.

678
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,452
Two days ago, I almost killed a nigga.

679
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,707
I had a gun in one pocket
and a photo of my nephew in the other.

680
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,166
When time came...

681
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,465
When time came, I took the photo out
instead of the gun.

682
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,679
I don't know what happened.

683
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,850
I don't know what...

684
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,020
stopped me from killing that man.

685
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,735
Maybe it was Allah, brother.

686
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,362
He only wants peace for us in the end.

687
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,507
You need to get the fuck out of here
with this bullshit, man.

688
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,019
Yo, can you pass me my jacket?

689
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,745
Do you recognize this man?

690
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:27,083
Nadine, look at the photo.

691
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,924
Gotta be more convincing than that.

692
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,762
Grand jury's in a couple hours.
Come on, snap out of it.

693
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,474
I already told you,
he looks like the asshole

694
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,434
I saw stealing my shit
from the power plant.

695
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,311
Looks like him or is him?

696
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,063
It is him, okay? Fuck! Whatever.

697
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:54,402
And in your witness statement, you said
the same man followed you to the diner

698
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,279
on Jefferson Avenue and later...

699
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,949
You know, you're such a fucking
lying asshole. You know that?

700
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,451
If I can come here,
why can't I see Whiskey?

701
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:05,080
I'm gonna be straight with you.
This is all on you, kid.

702
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:10,126
If you don't testify,
the three of them are gonna go free.

703
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:12,337
And why should I care?

704
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,768
You don't give a shit about me,
leaving me in that fucking hellhole.

705
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,052
That fucking hellhole is saving your life.

706
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,222
They came at you.

707
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,808
They came to your home.

708
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,475
Think about that.

709
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:33,733
They're not gonna stop
until you put them away.

710
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:37,696
Your testimony to the grand jury tomorrow,
and if we're lucky, at trial,

711
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:38,905
it's all we got.

712
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,284
I wish it was different, I swear to God.

713
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,828
But it is what it is.

714
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,087
- He was the one that followed me.
- Okay, good.

715
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,634
And he looked in the ditch.

716
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,598
What do you mean, looked in the ditch?

717
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,518
Nadine, you said all you saw
were three cops

718
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,729
- get in their car and drive away.
- He looked, okay?

719
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:11,980
They all looked!

720
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:17,277
The cop with the baseball cap
threw the bike in and they all looked.

721
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,488
And I should've too
because that kid would be alive if I had!

722
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,794
I'm gonna prepare a new witness statement.

723
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:23,824
Yeah.

724
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,372
I'm sorry.

725
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,332
No.

726
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:38,340
- I was just too scared to look.
- It's okay, it's okay. Hey, it's okay.

727
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,468
Don't worry. Don't worry, it's okay.

728
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:47,349
The grand jury just handed down
a true bill for aggravated manslaughter.

729
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,228
- All four defendants were indicted.
- Did really good. Gonna be fine.

730
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,899
Thanks to a new piece of evidence
provided by a witness,

731
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,984
we're going into trial
with a very strong case.

732
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,630
- Thank you.
- Can you give us the name of the witness?

733
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,740
The identity of the witness
cannot be revealed at this point,

734
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,784
but the witness
will be testifying at trial.

735
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,327
- When?
- Needless to say...

736
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,204
You ready to make
a serious offer now?

737
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:12,332
I wouldn't get too confident.
You had no opponent in there.

738
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,458
Maybe not,

739
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,419
but I also don't have to defend
four guilty men.

740
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,714
- That's for the court to decide.
- What? No plea bargain?

741
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,093
Assault by auto will always
be on the table.

742
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:28,014
We have a long record
of listening to our citizens' concerns

743
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,516
and acting on them.

744
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,059
We'll continue to do so.

745
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:40,235
When I asked you for a detailed account

746
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,278
of what transpired that morning,

747
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:45,240
somehow climbing to the top of the ditch,

748
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:49,202
looking down at the victim, and then
making the decision to walk away,

749
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:52,205
just, I don't know, slipped your minds?

750
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,291
Well, I guess it's time to earn your keep,
Counselor.

751
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,294
I thought he was dead.

752
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:02,173
The amount of blood in that ditch,
the head wound...

753
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,092
We all thought he was dead.

754
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:08,304
- State of mind, that is a mitigating fac...
- Shut up.

755
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,599
You think I need to be educated on the law

756
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,227
by some cop
with a community college degree?

757
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,732
Let me explain
an aggravating factor to you.

758
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:22,569
As cops,
you've got this little obligation.

759
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,112
It's called Duty of Care.

760
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:28,575
Which means once you, all of you,
looked into that ditch,

761
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,994
you are obligated
to notify the authorities.

762
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,580
- They gotta prove that though.
- They have a witness!

763
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,543
And she's gonna hang you
when we go to trial.

764
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,587
What kind of time are we looking at?

765
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,714
I don't know.

766
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,425
Twenty years.

767
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:49,679
Fucking Jablonski.
He's the cause of all this!

768
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,515
He drove off that day,
he left us holding the bag.

769
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,167
- You should've told me about the witness.
- What would you have done?

770
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,359
Not taken the fucking case.

771
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:08,531
If I thought that kid was alive,
I would've never walked away.

772
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,702
That's the fucking truth.

773
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,957
Welcome to the criminal justice system,
gentlemen.

774
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,127
No one gives a fuck about the truth.

775
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,183
I thought you had to go see your lawyer.

776
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,646
No, this is more important.

777
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,649
I finished painting over the garage.

778
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:48,822
I put dead bolts on all the doors
and security locks on the windows.

779
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:53,910
These are the new keys.

780
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:55,829
I'm gonna go.

781
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,593
You want to know about my childhood?

782
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,515
I hated my mother.

783
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,934
I hated him worse. But her?

784
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,103
She was weak.

785
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,774
Couldn't stand up for herself.

786
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:31,156
I'd hear him whaling on her, and she...
she's screaming.

787
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,576
I never did nothing.

788
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:41,583
Never stopped him, never...
never called the cops.

789
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,253
I just stayed in my room.

790
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,507
Hid in the closet like a fucking coward.

791
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,016
I just...

792
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,854
I just wanted to be
a different person for you.

793
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:04,856
You know, and for Mikey.

794
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,073
Face this thing... like a man.

795
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,622
Petey.

796
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,591
You can stay on the couch.

797
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,794
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

798
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,633
Hey. Hey, it's okay.
It's okay, Whiskey. I got you.

799
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,635
Nothing's gonna happen to you, okay?

800
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,470
Okay. You're okay.

801
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,944
No! Get off me!

802
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,447
Let me go!

803
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:46,499
Hey.

804
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,296
Hey.

805
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,342
You lost?

806
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:51,731
Get out.

807
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,316
No. No.

808
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:59,155
- Get the fuck out. Get out!
- No, no, no, no!

809
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,373
- Please.
- Relax.

810
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:09,582
Please, please. I...

811
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,752
I won't... I won't tell anybody. I promise.

812
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,545
I won't say anything, okay?

813
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:18,216
I'll run away and nobody will find me,
okay? No one. I promise!

814
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:22,887
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
- No! No! No!

815
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,639
- Get her on the fucking ground!
- No!

816
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:28,351
Get off of me! Get off! Please!

817
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,727
Please don't hurt me! Please!

818
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,939
- Hey, shut your fucking mouth! Shut up!
- Stop screaming!

819
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,400
Stop fucking screaming! Stop screaming.

820
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,696
Please. Stop screaming.

821
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,448
- Let's go, Mike.
- Come on, do it.

822
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,118
I just want to go home.
I won't say anything.

823
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,120
I promise. I just want to go home.

824
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,581
- What you waiting for? Come on!
- Please!

825
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,376
- I won't say anything. No!
- Do it! Just fucking do it, man!

826
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:01,175
- My God! No! Help me!
- Yo! Fuck! What the fuck was that?

827
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:04,512
- Help! Somebody help me, please! Help!
- What the fuck?

828
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,683
Help me! Help! Please, help!

829
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:13,896
Help! Help! Help me!

830
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,606
Help me! Please!

831
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,692
Please, somebody help!

832
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,193
Help! Help me!

833
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,863
Help! Somebody help me! Please!

834

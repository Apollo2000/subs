1
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,003
Hey.

2
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,797
You're still wet, babe.

3
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,717
I gotta go.

4
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,345
What are you doing?

5
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,890
What do you think I'm doing?

6
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,060
Come on. What about the baby?

7
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,187
The baby's asleep.

8
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,316
But Mama's wide awake.

9
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,284
Looks like Daddy's waking up too.

10
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,877
Come on, just a quickie.

11
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,005
The doctor says it's good for labor.

12
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,522
Petey, Petey don't rip them!

13
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,940
They're like new from Victoria's.

14
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,668
Fuck.

15
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,853
Yo, mama!

16
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,779
Fucking bitch!

17
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,910
Come on over here, baby.

18
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,245
Mr. Dorsey...

19
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,124
I'm KJ Harper
from the prosecutor's office.

20
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,608
You said you were asleep in your car
under the Pulaski Bridge

21
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,629
- when you were arrested last night.
- Fuck you!

22
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,343
This will help with the shakes, okay?

23
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,974
The Pulaski's far from the park.

24
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,185
Are you sure
that's where you were sleeping?

25
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,103
Yeah, I'm sure.

26
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,439
Can anyone confirm you were there?

27
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,575
There was a pint in your car, of whiskey,

28
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,452
and you hadn't touched it.

29
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,913
So you'd just bought it, right?

30
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,457
What time did you buy the booze?

31
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,209
I don't remember!

32
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,169
Mac, look at me.

33
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,674
Where do you usually buy your liquor?
Is there a place you like to go?

34
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,010
Charlie, the guy at the store,

35
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,388
A1 Westside Ave,

36
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,057
lets me clean up in his toilet.

37
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,103
Thank you, Mr. Dorsey.

38
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:31,895
Officer.

39
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,525
Hey, come on man where you going?

40
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,045
Nurse.

41
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,425
Nurse. Nurse!

42
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,510
Nurse!

43
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,056
Where is he?

44
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,145
They've taken him downstairs
for more tests, but I saw him blink.

45
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,522
- What?
- I saw him blink his eyes.

46
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,066
- What does that mean?
- The doctors, they did a scan.

47
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,693
And she said there were lines on it.

48
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,570
Brain activity.

49
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,533
It means that he can come back to us.

50
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:30,246
All right, he's going to need a lot
of mental stimulation, talking, music.

51
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,041
I've seen people
with worse injuries.

52
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,793
Brain injuries recover from this
over there.

53
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,794
- More than...
- Yeah.

54
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,796
We'll call the whole family
to come and visit.

55
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,633
We'll play his favorite music.
And Seth, you'll put your uniform back on.

56
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,261
He wanted to see you in it so bad.

57
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,431
- Um, anything for Little Man.
- Yeah. Yeah.

58
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,059
All night. All night I kept saying,

59
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,437
"Please, please come back to me.
Come back to your mama."

60
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,979
He heard me.

61
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,689
He heard me.

62
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,737
God is good.

63
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,157
All the time.

64
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,620
- All the time.
- God is good. God is good.

65
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,871
God is good.

66
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:13,915
God is good.

67
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,084
Think that's funny? Want one of these?

68
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,336
- No, I don't eat that cake donut shit.
- No?

69
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,838
It's like PlayDoh.
You'll shit it out a year later.

70
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,173
You got experience with that?

71
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,592
Hey, at least my mommy
doesn't pack my breakfast.

72
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,428
- What is that dog shit anyway?
- It's a pastel, dumbass.

73
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,223
Coño, perdóname. Pastel.

74
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,183
Shit's homemade, bitch.

75
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,351
You better look out!

76
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,104
Finish your Puerto Rican muffin
and get out of here.

77
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,688
Manny, you're with Osorio.

78
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,316
You call me on my cell later.

79
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,107
Jablonski, you're with me.

80
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,695
The new guy? Seriously?

81
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,118
You breaking up the team, Di?
You and me, Starsky and Hutch, baby.

82
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,328
Go on, man. Get out of here. Do your job.

83
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,050
How you holding up?

84
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,886
I'm good.

85
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,930
You're what?

86
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,682
I'm good.

87
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,108
Leave him alone, mamita, he's married.

88
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,735
I don't mind married.
I don't kiss and tell.

89
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,821
Let's go. Come on.

90
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,576
You new here, papi? You cute.

91
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,666
You work narcotics in the South District,
girls like that are just part of the...

92
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,877
the benefits package.

93
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,215
Well, I never even took a free cup
of coffee working in the East.

94
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,633
I guess...

95
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,013
whatever they taught me at the Academy
just stuck.

96
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,807
Well, they also teach you
to climb a fucking rope.

97
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,770
You've been out how many years? How
many fucking ropes you climbed?

98
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,694
Fucking idealist with a badge.

99
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,910
You remind me of me back in the day.
Open your window.

100
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,247
Open it.

101
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,921
- You're freezing, right?
- Yeah.

102
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,424
Good, that's going to wake you up,
because this shit ain't patrol.

103
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,221
There's no parking behind the 7Eleven,
jerking off till your shift's over.

104
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,472
We're like athletes.

105
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,603
Can't think about what they're doing,
they just gotta do.

106
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,647
You think too much, you fuck it up.

107
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,107
Now for players, that's...

108
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,319
that's just a lost game. But for us?

109
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,823
That's me showing up to Osorio's house,
telling his mama her son's dead.

110
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:56,744
Who's the guy?

111
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,580
The one they put away for it.

112
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,249
He's a bum.

113
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,752
Would've killed somebody someday.
Good riddance.

114
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:14,053
In case you hadn't noticed, bro...

115
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,764
this ain't the East.

116
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,604
Yeah? Don't give me any shit.

117
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,907
Let me ask you something.
Where did Di find him?

118
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,702
- Jablonski.
- East District.

119
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,537
Was teaching one of those
undercover classes

120
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,205
he does at different precincts.

121
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:45,376
Went over to Jablonski's house
a few times, whatever.

122
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,421
You know how he gets about the new guy.

123
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,466
Jablonski's from the East District?

124
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:57,096
All them cops do is fucking arrest yuppies
for drunk and disorderlies.

125
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,224
Fucking rookie.

126
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,103
What if he cracks?

127
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,231
DiAngelo vouches for him, so that's that.

128
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,442
He says Pete's good people.

129
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,945
Yeah, okay. He goes to Jablonski's
a few times, he has a few beers,

130
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,281
his wife cooks him a few dinners,
so he's good people.

131
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,617
Fuck that, fuck good, fuck him.

132
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,213
Fish... it's KJ.

133
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,051
KJ Harper
from the prosecutor's office again.

134
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,179
Um, when you get this, call me.

135
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,558
It's about the guy you arrested, Dorsey.
Call me.

136
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,332
Hi...

137
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,667
Is James home?

138
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,755
I need to talk to him about a case.

139
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:19,887
You can wait here.

140
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,813
- What the hell is she doing here?
- Honey, calm down.

141
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,189
You need to handle this.

142
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,712
- It's not happening again.
- I'll take care of it. Calm down.

143
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,611
Have you lost your mind?

144
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,031
Okay. Look, Dorsey didn't do it, okay?

145
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,659
He was at a liquor store across town,

146
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,078
three miles from the park
when the accident happened.

147
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,281
- Who the hell is Dorsey?
- The hitandrun in the park.

148
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,291
I tried to tell you,
but you weren't answering your phone.

149
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,380
Look, the victim's a kid,
from a good family.

150
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,426
And you're at the start of a campaign...
We can't ignore this.

151
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,637
Are the papers picking it up?

152
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,889
No.

153
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,809
But his family are churchgoers

154
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,854
who most likely vote,
and every vote counts.

155
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,480
You know I'm right.

156
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,025
Don't let your caseload slip, KJ.

157
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,617
Thanks... James.

158
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,956
Don't ever come to my home.

159
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,758
It's wonderful
how well your son is doing.

160
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,428
I see you have a deductible plan
with your wife's insurance.

161
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,764
Yeah, yeah. How much
is it going to cost me?

162
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,225
We're looking $350 per day in the ICU.

163
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,311
With Dr. Sangupta's recommendation,

164
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,355
he'll be here from 30 to 45 days.

165
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:58,486
I've also included surgery costs,
rehabilitation, lab tests.

166
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,746
We just bought a house.

167
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,541
If there is financial hardship,
we have programs to help...

168
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,001
I got a job, man.

169
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,005
- We'll figure it out.
- I understand.

170
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,218
But we will need to discuss
a payment plan.

171
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,345
Wh... What amount can you start with?

172
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:26,888
Today.

173
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,477
Hey, the kids
ain't stopped talking about last year

174
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,895
when you took them for ice cream.

175
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,524
So, you got to hurry up, get better,
so you can take them again.

176
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,274
Latrice.

177
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,364
I got to go to work.

178
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:47,868
So, I want you to stay here
with Brenton and...

179
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,871
just call the school,
let them know you need time off.

180
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,207
I'll... I'll call them.

181
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,877
Thanks, Marcelle.

182
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,841
Isaiah, come over here
and talk to Brenton.

183
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,510
Before you go.

184
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,846
It's good for him to hear your voice.

185
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,600
Come on. Tell him you love him.

186
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,103
Tell him.

187
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,492
He already knows.

188
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,677
Shut up!

189
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,972
Shut up!

190
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,683
Where were you?
I left you, like, three messages.

191
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,811
Seven. Exactly seven. Now don't make me
put you in the hole?

192
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,897
All right, come on. No.
You better duck in before they get out.

193
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,441
And don't stare at them.
Dogs don't like you staring at them.

194
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,653
This is Jack and Jill, they're the twins.
They're going blind.

195
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,447
This is Ginger over here, right?

196
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,992
She I got in Atlantic City.

197
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,453
This is Lady here. She's almost 15.
That's why she's got to wear that diaper.

198
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,015
- Why didn't you call?
- I turn my phone off while I'm sleeping.

199
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,719
Don't wanna mess
with my circadian rhythms.

200
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,420
You should do the same. It'd probably
be good for your OCD, or your DTs.

201
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,840
We need to send the victim's clothes
to the lab

202
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,134
to test for paint transfer
from the vehicle.

203
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,553
And I want to talk to that narc's CI.

204
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,930
Maybe he mistook Dorsey
for someone else.

205
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,142
Okay, well, first of all,
this isn't the crime of the century.

206
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,560
The kid was probably a banger.

207
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,896
And second,
I'm not the "almost dead police," okay?

208
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,773
Kid ain't dead. Call me when he is.

209
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,068
Well, prosecutors outrank detectives...

210
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,779
so get dressed, let's go.

211
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,699
Really? You went there?

212
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,993
Well, the kids haven't eaten yet,

213
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:20,497
and Jackson, he's missing his epiglottis,
so I got to put him in his high chair,

214
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,341
and feed him with the funnel,
then we can go.

215
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,294
- Okay, I will meet you at the district.
- Okay, that sounds great.

216
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,963
Come here. Come on. Come here.

217
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,300
What's a matter? You guys don't like her?

218
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,592
I don't blame you.

219
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,221
Hey, I don't know nothing, man.

220
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,474
I swear to God,
you fuck around too much, man,

221
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,018
you play too many games, man.

222
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,478
DiAngelo, right?

223
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,773
- Fish Rinaldi. That's right.
- Yeah. From last night. How you doing?

224
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,275
- Good. How you doing?
- You meet my team yet?

225
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,943
- Manny Wilcox.
- Hey.

226
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,029
- Felix Osorio.
- Hey.

227
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,949
And the rest, who gives a fuck?

228
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,912
Listen, I hate to hassle you,
but about that job last night...

229
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,081
- We need to talk to your CI.
- Yeah.

230
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,041
The one who ID'd Mac Dorsey.

231
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,881
- I'll check you later, Di.
- All right, Donny. You stay safe.

232
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:11,964
Okay, man.

233
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,930
You know, they call it
a "Confidential Informant"

234
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,473
for a reason, Marcia Clark.

235
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,100
I tried to tell her that.

236
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,271
I can't make the charges stick to Dorsey
if I don't talk to your CI.

237
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,608
You can't make the charges stick
if you don't show up for court.

238
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,779
We believe Dorsey was across town
when the kid got hit.

239
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,324
Yeah, says a guy whose brain's been
soaking in Jim Beam for 50 years?

240
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,744
Not him, the store owner
who sold him the Jim Beam.

241
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,164
Is that right?

242
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,334
That's my bad, then.

243
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,587
Guess I jammed you up
with some faulty intel.

244
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:54,424
CI's lie out their assholes.
Anything for a bump or a blowjob.

245
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,260
It happens, right? What are you gonna do?

246
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,930
I would still like to talk to him.

247
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,600
Well, I'll see what I can do, KJ.

248
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,479
You want to leave me your personal cell?

249
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,817
You can reach me at the office.
You know the number.

250
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,977
We need to go to the hospital.

251
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:18,365
I got to get the kid's clothes to the lab
and the accident unit down to the park...

252
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,242
Fine. Do that.

253
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,414
You fuck her yet?

254
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,000
Everyone here has.

255
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,379
So, what's up with the kid?
Is he still up at the ICU?

256
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,965
Stapled head, and she's on a mission
for a fucking carrot.

257
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,218
Listen, I got to jet, brother.
It was good to see you.

258
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,429
Keep me in the loop.
I might have some tips for you.

259
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,849
- And I'll get back at you about my CI.
- Appreciate that.

260
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,058
All right.

261
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,397
Wilcox, you're with me.

262
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,526
What the fuck? You said Dorsey was solid.

263
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,154
Keep your fucking voice down, man.

264
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:01,575
We're way out on the limb here, Di,
for a new guy nobody knows.

265
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,743
I know him.

266
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,580
- I trust him. I'm taking care of this.
- You said the same thing about Dorsey.

267
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,836
You want to repeat that,
because I didn't hear you right the first.

268
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,884
Go do your fucking job.

269
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,811
So, I got the back room at Mancini's.
There's gonna be like 30 of us.

270
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,440
It's me and Jake, Nona, Pops,
and that nightmare cunt he calls a wife.

271
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,359
Wow, babe.

272
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,694
Nice!

273
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,613
I thought you were gonna paint.

274
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,616
The wallpaper's better for the baby.
There's no fumes.

275
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,619
Paint's more permanent, you're not
gonna have to redo it every year.

276
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,412
What you got there's kind of cheap.

277
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,872
Bed Bath & Beyond?

278
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:50,998
I don't think so.

279
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,253
I saw that same design
at Walmart last week. I don't know.

280
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,922
We were just talking
about the christening brunch.

281
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,966
Everyone's coming.

282
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,760
What about you, Pete?
Anyone coming from your side?

283
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,721
I mean, you can't be adding last minute,
so if no one's coming...

284
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,556
I fucking heard you the first time.

285
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,309
I left my phone in the living room.
Can you go get it?

286
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,896
I just remembered a few names
I want to add to the list. Go.

287
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,860
Your cousin is a fucking bitch.
No wonder her boyfriend kicked her out.

288
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,363
You're always letting her get to you.
Always.

289
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,117
The room looks great, babe.

290
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,328
You're a good daddy.

291
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,622
And Little Poke likes it.

292
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,044
Come on.

293
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,429
You ever think maybe you ought
to invite him?

294
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,974
- No.
- He called again.

295
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,853
He wants to see you.

296
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,105
I told him about the baby.

297
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,315
You did what?

298
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,901
He keeps calling,
what was I supposed to do?

299
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,405
- You don't pick up the phone, that's what.
- Okay.

300
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,699
God.

301
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,395
- No way.
- He wouldn't even quit.

302
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,171
Come in.

303
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:21,922
Hi...

304
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,218
Mrs. Butler,
this is our evidence technician.

305
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,181
We'll need to process Brenton

306
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,744
for any evidence that may have transferred
during the accident.

307
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,769
Why do you need to do that now?

308
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:37,064
Sometimes debris from the vehicle
gets on the victim.

309
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,628
It could help with the investigation.

310
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,986
' "Help with the investigation"?
You said you got the man who did this.

311
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:45,530
It's a formality.

312
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,826
I'll need your consent for the collection.

313
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,583
We won't hurt him, I promise.

314
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,230
Thank you.

315
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,611
- Start with his right foot.
- Okay.

316
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,326
Okay.

317
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,042
You don't have to be afraid. He's strong.

318
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,964
He's getting stronger every day,
the doctor said so.

319
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,227
I got something.

320
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,780
Right there.

321
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,161
- Got it. Yeah.
- Okay.

322
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,524
I'm sorry.

323
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,194
He's been doing that
for the past few days.

324
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,738
It's a reaction to being touched.

325
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,574
He knows you're touching him.

326
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,790
Yeah. Detective Rinaldi.

327
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,042
Fish, I found something.

328
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,211
Good for you. I can't find his shoes.

329
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,130
- What?
- I'm missing his shoes.

330
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,636
Unless he decided to just wear his socks
to go bike riding in the park.

331
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,973
But I don't see his shoes
in the crime scene photos either.

332
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:02,227
- Did you check evidence?
- No. I just looked under my desk here.

333
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,310
Listen,

334
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,689
we found what looks like a paint chip.

335
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,649
A blue paint chip in his hair.

336
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,442
So it's a blue car.

337
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,237
That's good.
No, it is, because you just expanded

338
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,155
our suspect pool by 200,000.

339
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,284
Maybe if he tried to dump the car,
a salvage yard has it.

340
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,911
There's like 200 of those
in the city alone.

341
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,331
So get uni's to canvas them.
And check the DMV, okay?

342
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,666
For a blue car?

343
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,835
The lab will narrow down
what we're looking for.

344
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,962
I'll send them the paint chip now and...

345
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,132
I will check the hospital
for these shoes you can't find.

346
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,860
- What are you going to be doing?
- Looking for a blue car I guess...

347
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,469
He... Goddamn.

348
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,224
My CI's in the wind,
the one who fingered Dorsey.

349
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,227
It doesn't matter,
Dorsey didn't do it.

350
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,690
The vehicle that hit the kid,
it was a blue car, not a brown car.

351
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:50,984
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

352
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:54,237
And now she wants me to check
every salvage yard from here to Timbuktu.

353
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,365
So, what else you got?

354
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,911
Well, the assholes that found him
in the park pinched his shoes.

355
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,665
That or some piece of shit in the park
took them.

356
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:11,171
Yeah, Tim's go for a mint in the hood,
right? Every banger's got ten pair.

357
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,759
To mix and match with their pit bulls.

358
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
The ghetto elk.

359
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,182
Hey, listen. Listen. Me and the guys,

360
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,726
we usually hit up Mahoney's
most weekend nights, right?

361
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,853
- If you want, drop by.
- All right.

362
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,456
Just don't bring your fucking partner.

363
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,921
- She's not my partner.
- All right.

364
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,901
- Yeah, let's do it soon.
- Okay.

365
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,234
All right.

366
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,550
Way, way over there. I'll look here.

367
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,470
If the boots were here,
they're long gone by now.

368
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,264
Goddamn it. Look at this thing.
Look at it.

369
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,307
What?

370
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,976
- Come over here.
- I'm fine where I am.

371
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,854
- What is it?
- I got a fucking hole in this.

372
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,356
I swear to God,
it wasn't there five hours ago.

373
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,233
Look, you can see my sock.

374
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,319
The boots aren't here. Let's go.

375
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,489
The hospital never logged them,
so they have to be here.

376
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,240
The dog stole the boots.

377
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,326
Or the Jehovah's Witnesses
that were in ICU.

378
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,456
Don't you have more cases to be working?
Why do you got so much free time?

379
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,877
You must not have kids or a husband.

380
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:57,836
Or a boyfriend.

381
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,132
Why did you leave New York?

382
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,176
I like the view
from this side of the river.

383
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,638
Check it out. She's like,
"Yo, all you foreigners out there"

384
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,015
that aren't Muslims, come to our shores.

385
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,892
"Jersey City, look at my ass."

386
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,270
That's her ass, right? Not her fupa?

387
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,360
- Where you going? The car's over there.
- Well...

388
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,572
if somebody stole them,
maybe they saw the accident.

389
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,242
Or whoever left the accident.

390
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,702
Or maybe they didn't see diddly shit

391
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,288
because they got to the accident
five hours later.

392
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,334
This is where he got hit?

393
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,922
No, the point of impact was over there.
That's where the car stopped.

394
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:51,765
What?

395
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,940
That's a lot of windows.

396
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,233
Yeah.

397
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,486
You locked me out.

398
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,163
- I asked you to keep my car off.
- It's freezing, I had to run the heat.

399
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,040
You waste gas like that.

400
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,917
I'll get you back, don't worry.

401
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,461
- Did you find anything?
- Nope, nada.

402
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,505
What?

403
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,300
He had a thing for seagulls.

404
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,553
That's sweet. Let's go home.

405
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,639
We need to find those boots.

406
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,559
Open markets?

407
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,268
Thrift shops?

408
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,481
Anywhere you can sell stolen Timberlands.

409
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,233
Come on, you're the detective.

410
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,276
Last time I checked, I am.
So here's the deal.

411
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,112
Every banger in the city's got a pair.

412
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,156
They're born with Tims on,
so unless you want to drive around,

413
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,325
staring at everybody's feet,
we're wasting our time.

414
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,536
Because you have
so many other things to do.

415
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,040
Where to, boss?

416
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,220
Keep your truck off the road
for a few more days.

417
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,138
Why?

418
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,224
Because I said so.

419
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:44,022
You're riding with me. You two check out
the projects on Dale Avenue.

420
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,649
Don't give him the keys though.
I'm just saying.

421
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,823
Hey, wassup?

422
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,869
How you doing, beloved?

423
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,582
- I'm very thirsty. Thank you, beloved.
- Appreciate it.

424
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,626
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

425
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,922
Hey, give me the fried pigs' feet.

426
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,473
Hands up, don't shoot.

427
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:26,689
Yeah, you gonna be on YouTube, man.
Like a reallife celebrity and shit.

428
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,150
Look at this nigga, boy.

429
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,698
Yo, what the fuck? I just got that.

430
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,076
You want your phone?
There's your fucking phone.

431
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,871
Why don't you call Messiah on it?

432
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,333
Go on. Do it. He ain't gonna be too happy
when I check in with him,

433
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,335
tell him how his punks are representing.

434
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,498
- Chill, we was messing with you.
- You still talking?

435
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,635
Get the fuck out of here.

436
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:10,941
Come on, let's go.

437
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,699
Yo, who's Messiah?

438
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,164
I'm talking to you.

439
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,884
Yeah, well, all Dr. Taranaweh said is,
we need to keep an eye out for spotting,

440
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,010
like last time.

441
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,888
And...

442
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,350
there's none. I checked.

443
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,018
I check, like, every morning.

444
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,610
What's wrong with you?

445
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,697
You've been acting weird.

446
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,326
Maybe I should've stayed in the East.

447
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,205
We're supposed to be doing good,
right?

448
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,543
- I mean, that's why I joined this team.
- Is this about DiAngelo?

449
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,587
What's going on?

450
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,007
I don't know.

451
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,135
Well, maybe I was wrong.

452
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,803
Wrong about what?

453
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,020
What the fuck are you doing?

454
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,397
Get out of the road!

455
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,399
Get out of the fucking road!

456
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,818
You don't come
where the fucking car is coming!

457
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,332
Motherfuckers.

458
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:04,347
Are you sure the girl that holes up
in that old power plant, she comes here?

459
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,224
We all do for the dollar menu.

460
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,061
They got a special this week,
buy one get two items free.

461
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,982
That's her! That's Nadine.

462
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,276
With the purple streak in her hair.

463
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,374
All right, Mimi, you go get yourself
something to eat, all right?

464
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,104
You got a light?

465
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,623
Looking for a date?

466
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,168
Why, you offering?

467
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,172
I'm not wearing any panties.

468
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,430
Asshole.

469
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,853
You hungry?

470
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,608
I got you something to eat.
Meatloaf and mashed potatoes.

471
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,070
The lady in the cafeteria said
they got a mean apple pie,

472
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,571
but I figured we'd start with this.

473
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,074
You just got off a shift?

474
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,116
Yeah, I...

475
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,621
I picked up a double.

476
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,332
I got to be back there in an hour,
but um...

477
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,377
I just wanted to see Brenton
before I did.

478
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,233
Trice, you should get something to eat.

479
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,094
Thank you, babe.

480
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,644
Dear heavenly Father, thank you
for this food we're about to receive,

481
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,847
for the nourishment of our minds,
bodies, and spirits,

482
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,106
in your son Jesus' name.

483
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,066
- Amen.
- Amen.

484
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,070
Um...

485
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,454
Trice, you know me,
I ain't good with words.

486
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,457
I do know you.

487
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,465
Babe, it was just a bike.

488
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,928
Whatever fears you have,
he's still your son.

489
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,017
What did I ever do to make you think
I don't know that?

490
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,776
Nothing.

491
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,280
Nothing.

492
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:04,961
Thank you.

493
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,180
I got to go back to work.

494
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,407
It's after dinner.

495
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,869
Kids don't get their dinner,
they lose their minds.

496
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,954
We've hit up every open air market
in the city.

497
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,582
- What do you say we call it for the night?
- Gotta be more.

498
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,666
But there's not.

499
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:45,794
Why do you care?

500
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,339
- The kid was a banger.
- How do you even know that?

501
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,800
He's from a nice family. He's in school.

502
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,762
And he worked the Early Bird Crackhead
Special before first hour, so...

503
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,723
- There weren't any drugs on him.
- What was he doing in the park?

504
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,935
Why do you even do this job
if you don't care about anything?

505
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,853
I care about things.

506
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:07,316
I care about my dogs.
I care about Point of Know Return.

507
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,529
- It's a Kansas album, 1977. Classic.
- Stop the car.

508
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,364
Do it. Now.

509
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,617
What, going karaoking?

510
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,497
Unlock the door.

511
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,833
- How are you going to get home?
- Uber.

512
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,878
I don't think Uber picks up around here.

513
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,090
- Unlock the damn door.
- Fine.

514
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,177
You should really use Lyft.
They treat their employees much better.

515
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,695
Here comes your part B.

516
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,211
Hey...

517
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,379
Stop.

518
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,424
You ain't serious.

519
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,719
The Lord did not bless me
with the voice he did your brother.

520
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,680
Maybe not,
but he sure gave you some moves.

521
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,852
This is what we listen to
on the way to school.

522
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,146
You know how quiet he usually is.

523
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,316
This is our thing in the morning.

524
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:38,907
How you holding up?

525
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,827
You know. It's good to be home.

526
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,832
As soon as we get Brenton back
on his feet, I'm gonna find some work.

527
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,436
Want to come to the house,
help out with the bills...

528
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,255
No. We're fine. We are just happy
to have you back home.

529
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,177
- He squeezed my hand today.
- No.

530
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,348
Yes. Yes, I was talking to him,
just like the doctors said,

531
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,934
and I said, "Brenton, if you can hear me,
baby, just squeeze my hand."

532
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,603
And he did.

533
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,357
Yeah! Yeah, B!

534
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:16,362
Okay, you got to try. Come on!
Come on. No, you got to try.

535
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,034
Hey, Brenton.

536
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,703
Your Uncle Seth is here. Can you feel him?

537
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,916
If so, just give a squeeze, okay?

538
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,882
- He did it before.
- Yeah, I'm sure he did.

539
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,731
Hey, Little Man.

540
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,149
Can you hear me?

541
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,957
Come back to us, you hear?

542
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,545
Your mama here, your father here,

543
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,588
your Uncle Seth here...

544
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,926
we're all here, and we're waiting for you
to come back to us.

545
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,472
And we ain't leaving until you do.

546
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:31,937
I love you, B.

547
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,258
All right.

548
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,804
I'm gonna get something to eat.

549
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:09,349
I know you don't like rice,
but I got that soup. Yeah?

550
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,858
- Who is it?
- It's your chauffeur.

551
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,949
- It's one in the morning.
- I got takeout. You hungry?

552
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:27,742
Ooh.

553
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,329
You need a Tic Tac.
How many did you tie on tonight?

554
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,206
No, listen. I'm just kidding. Look.

555
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,792
I found the Tims.

556
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,129
Size ten. Seagulls drawn on them.
He's into seagulls, right?

557
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,466
- Yeah.
- Yeah, some street hawker on Fifth Street

558
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,677
said some junkie showed up yesterday
with these.

559
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,347
Scared out of her mind,
desperate to score.

560
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:51,600
He didn't have a name, but he said
she's this white girl, 15 to 16.

561
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,323
She's got this purple streak in her hair.

562
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,187
And she'd sold stuff to him before,

563
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,112
stuff that she stole
from some local pharmacy.

564
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,274
- You talk to the pharmacy?
- No, they're closed.

565
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,944
They're open in like five hours.
I figured you'd be here.

566
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,404
- Let's go get some breakfast.
- Look...

567
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,114
I need to sleep.

568
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,576
Yeah, okay. Yeah, no problem. You do you.

569
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,579
Um, I'll be back, a couple hours,
with the limo, okay?

570
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,748
Good night, Fish. Good work.

571
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:15,957
Thanks.

572
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,506
The bathroom is the other way.
The other way.

573
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,134
They don't even make a Tic Tac for that.

574
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,684
Hey, you know where DiAngelo is?

575
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,894
No, you want to take a seat,
his desk's over there.

576
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,521
I know where his desk is at.

577
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:44,963
What's up?

578
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:48,467
DiAngelo wants you to hang back.
He'll hit you up if he needs you.

579
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,845
He called me like two hours ago
and said we were heading out.

580
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:52,928
Yeah, we are.

581
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:54,890
You ain't.

582
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,016
Later, man.

583
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,435
Where you going?

584
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,004
- My man Messiah.
- Peace.

585
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,091
- You good?
- Hell, yeah!

586
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,687
Peace out.

587
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,088
No.

588
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,340
No, no.

589
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,135
No.

590
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:58,596
No.

591
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,869
Brenton, I'll be back, baby.

592
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,050
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Hi.

593
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,510
Can I help you?

594
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,636
Um...

595
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,721
Can I get a piece of your apple pie?

596
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,141
- You gonna have that here?
- To go.

597
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:49,481
- I hear you make a mean one.
- Not me, my daughter.

598
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,525
She works in the back.

599
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,443
Does all the baking.

600
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,696
I said to her,
"Open your own store and hire me."

601
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,075
Thank you.

602
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,993
God bless you.

603
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,665
He does.

604
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:08,500
Every day.

605
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,359
Mrs. Butler?

606
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:23,408
Mrs. Butler, we've been trying
to call you.

607
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:33,793
The doctors did everything they could
for him. I'm sorry.

608
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,880
Brenton.

609
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,133
Baby?

610
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:51,269
Would you like me to call someone for you,
Mrs. Butler?

611
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,244
There you go, baby.

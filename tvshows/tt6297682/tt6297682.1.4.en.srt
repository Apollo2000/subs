1
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,466
Excuse me.

2
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,101
Don't give me that look. I'm starving.

3
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,943
This is a waste of time.

4
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,114
What? Half the job is sitting around,
waiting around in a car.

5
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,368
- You want a coconut cream? You sure?
- Mmmmm.

6
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,622
Just don't do anything illegal. Okay?

7
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:06,876
Well, half of my job is cleaning up cases
when cops cut corners.

8
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,170
Okay, try saying that
five times in a row real fast.

9
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,454
Cleaning up cases when cops cut corners.
Cleaning up cases when cops cut corners.

10
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,300
Cleaning up cases... I can't do it.

11
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:20,557
We're gonna have a conversation
in a public place with this...

12
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,228
Ka... Kaduche... Kadeuce... Kadeuce Porter.

13
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,191
Fucking crazy, the shit you can find
online with a cell phone number, isn't it?

14
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,610
You ever look yourself up?

15
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,530
I'm going to look you up
and see what "KJ" stands for.

16
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,658
It doesn't stand for anything.

17
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,202
My dad gave me the nickname.

18
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,663
Gotta stand for something.

19
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,206
Nope.

20
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,754
He said the world would take me
on my merits if they thought I was a man.

21
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:57,218
So I put "KJ" on my college applications
and every job application,

22
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,262
and I think he was right.

23
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,516
I think it opened a lot of doors
that otherwise would have stayed closed.

24
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,270
- Cynical.
- It's reality.

25
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,858
That explains why you're plea bargaining
shoplifting cases.

26
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,694
You know, talking about,
don't you gotta be in court,

27
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,820
work your other jobs?

28
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,530
The other half of my job is paperwork,

29
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,450
and I would be working
if you'd shut up for half a second.

30
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,828
Sure you don't want
that coconut cream?

31
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,832
Wallet, keys, mints, belt, shoelaces.

32
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,051
Are these all the possessions
you came in with, sir?

33
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,134
Yeah.

34
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,053
Sign here.

35
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,156
Yo, what'd they do to you?

36
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,704
I didn't tell Tricey that you were...

37
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,373
She even ask?

38
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,299
'Saiah?

39
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,095
Who's there?

40
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,680
It's us, Tricey.

41
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,107
'Saiah? Is that you?

42
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,443
'Saiah. Where you been?
I've been waiting all night.

43
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,237
- I...
- Look, look, look. Look.

44
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,449
Look, I found that in Brenton's things
from the hospital.

45
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,787
There was a white man in his room
that first night we were there and...

46
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,833
I found this. I found it in Brenton's bed.

47
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,751
Why would he have one of his seagulls?

48
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,087
So we gotta go to the police.

49
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,170
We gotta let them know about this man
because maybe he might know something.

50
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,759
He might know who did this to Brenton,
so we gotta go.

51
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,179
Latrice, how many days has it been
since the repast?

52
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,724
What have you been doing?

53
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,561
I'll clean up, Tricey.
You go on and rest.

54
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,104
Did you hear what I said, 'Saiah?

55
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,399
'Saiah, I saw a man in Brenton's room.

56
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,943
They had people going in and out
around the clock.

57
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,903
It could've been anybody
from the hospital.

58
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:26,034
- Why would they leave this in his bed?
- Did you actually see him put it there?

59
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,577
- Did you?
- No.

60
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,328
But...

61
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,456
How else would it get there?

62
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,499
You know B.

63
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:38,963
All right? He always had one of those
seagulls he was working on with him.

64
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,675
- We gotta go to the police, right now.
- I've heard enough.

65
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,680
I gotta go to work, do you hear me?

66
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,727
- Come on now.
- Isaiah...

67
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,354
Now this house ain't fit enough
for animals to live in.

68
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,694
Get your hands back. Feet back.

69
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,822
You stay up against that fence.
You do not turn around.

70
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,824
- Fucking...
- Look at the fucking ground!

71
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,117
I'm not gonna tell you again!

72
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,286
Find anything in there? Anything?

73
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,455
Spread your fucking legs! Spread 'em!

74
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,625
All right, put your shit up. Come on.

75
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,788
Hands up. Hands...
Spread your legs. Spread 'em more.

76
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,295
- Do not turn around!
- Let me see.

77
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,881
Take it all off, fat boy.
I know you're holding the stash.

78
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,300
The fuck you hassling us for, man?
We not doing nothing.

79
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,928
No drivethru you've been running
for the past two hours?

80
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,096
No, that ain't nothing?

81
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,224
Little birdie told us
you fuckheads are moving a serious stash.

82
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,827
Don't know nothing about nothing, man.

83
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,853
This one's clean.

84
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,980
What I say, man?
We was just out here chilling.

85
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,900
You and your boys are just out here
having breakfast, right?

86
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,568
The fuck is this?

87
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:46,030
Red Hots and Red Roosters, man.
Breakfast of champions.

88
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,242
And we're the reason
these kids are dying young?

89
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,074
Gonna make it real simple.

90
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,455
You tell me where that stash is,
I won't lock your ugly ass up.

91
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,042
For real, if I knew what you was
talking about, man, I'd help you out.

92
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,043
I'm serious.

93
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,088
Fat boy's only got a couple of dime bags,
DiAngelo. That's it.

94
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,172
I got nothing.

95
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,092
You said this tip was solid.

96
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,427
Bad intel. Sorry, man.

97
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,020
Cut them loose.

98
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,314
Except for Fat Albert,
we're taking him in.

99
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,483
All this for a couple
of fucking dime bags, man!

100
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,569
You heard the man.
Hurry the fuck up. Cut me loose.

101
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,070
Turn around. The fuck outta here.

102
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,698
Let's go, get your bag, get your shit,
let's go.

103
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,324
Shut your fucking mouth.

104
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,994
- Hands behind your back.
- Hurry the fuck up. Let's go.

105
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,954
- Grab your boots and go.
- Turn around.

106
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,962
Next time you come around,
bring me some donuts, bitch.

107
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,824
Is that your happy hour date already?

108
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,331
KJ Harper.

109
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,750
Hello?

110
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,338
This is, um,
Brenton Butler's mother.

111
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,635
I'm sorry, Mrs. Butler.
How can I help you?

112
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,139
I saw a man in my son's room
and we need to find him.

113
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,434
There's a man in your son's bedroom?

114
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,271
No, no, at the hospital.
I saw a man at the hospital.

115
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,404
And I think he...
He left something with Brenton.

116
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,448
One of his seagulls.

117
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,785
It might've already been in his things.
I'm... I'm not sure.

118
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,124
My own husband doesn't believe me
right now. I need to know...

119
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,378
I need to know if you do.

120
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,756
Are you alone right now, Mrs. Butler?

121
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,885
What does that matter?
I'm not making this up, I'm not crazy.

122
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,972
I didn't say that, Mrs. Butler.

123
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,641
Can you describe this man?

124
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,145
I think so. I don't know.

125
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,229
Well...

126
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,650
You should talk to a sketch artist
at my office.

127
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,318
Okay? It's on Newark Avenue,

128
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,196
and if you mention my name,
they'll set you up with someone.

129
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,865
Can...

130
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,033
Can...

131
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,036
Can you meet me there?

132
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,831
Yes. Yes. Of course I'll meet you.

133
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,584
Give me a half hour, okay?

134
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,502
Thank you.

135
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,718
She's remembering this mystery man now?

136
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,054
It could be something.

137
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,685
Like an orderly on bedpan duty.
Put an APB out on that.

138
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,106
There's our guy.

139
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,567
- Okay.
- No, no, no. Wait here.

140
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,129
Hey!

141
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,517
Get off. Get the fuck off me, man!
I ain't do nothing!

142
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,062
Then why the fuck are you running?

143
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,855
Fuck you!

144
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,538
- You made me rip my fucking jacket.
- Who the fuck is this bitch?

145
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,195
See? What'd I tell you?
This conversation in public.

146
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,405
Get up, stupid.

147
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,199
Get up!

148
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,998
Stop fucking tapping your fingers
or I'mma fucking break 'em.

149
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,127
You can get out of here now. Just tell me,
Brenton Butler, how do you know him?

150
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,671
Don't know shit about no Brenton Butler.

151
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,050
You just got a thing
for funerals then?

152
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,010
- I wasn't at no funeral either.
- Okay.

153
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,679
That settles it. You can go.
You want your phone back?

154
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,602
Go ahead. Take it. We're done here.
I'm just gonna make a quick call.

155
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,069
It's playing our song.

156
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,322
Why does Brenton Butler
have your number?

157
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,700
Why is your phone number
the only fucking number

158
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,327
in Brenton Butler's burner?

159
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,663
- Don't know shit about that.
- He dealing drugs for you?

160
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,499
- Man, fuck you.
- No, fuck you, motherfucker!

161
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,626
- Get the fuck off me!
- Piece of shit!

162
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,338
You don't seem too shook up
that you got your phone friend killed.

163
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,048
I ain't get nobody killed, man!

164
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,915
Nobody in the game
dumb enough to fuck with a Five King.

165
00:11:58,968 --> 00:11:59,968
Somebody did.

166
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,637
Was it you, asshole?

167
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,561
Look at that.

168
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,109
Isn't that sweet? You and little Brenton.
It was in your room.

169
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,155
Look at it.

170
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,827
You gonna tell me now that
you don't know a Brenton Butler?

171
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,834
We're just trying to find out
who killed your friend, okay?

172
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,383
I don't know no Brenton Butler.

173
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,515
All right, well, we're gonna have
to keep you in County for the day.

174
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,767
Fuck, you know what? It's Friday.

175
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,871
Means you won't be arraigned
till after the weekend.

176
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,231
I don't give a fuck.
It's warmer in here than out there.

177
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,234
So go ahead.

178
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,702
Can you get him the fuck out of here?

179
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,373
Get off me, man.

180
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,791
Get the fuck off me!

181
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,755
That was a waste of time.

182
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,683
Fuck.

183
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,730
Can you describe
the size and shape of his face?

184
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,944
Um...

185
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:43,447
He was wearing a... like a hoodie.

186
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,158
So it was... it was covering up...

187
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,786
some of his face.

188
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,622
So, no. What about eye color?

189
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,041
Um, I guess...

190
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,585
I guess the hoodie was...

191
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,214
I guess it was covering up his eyes.

192
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,049
You couldn't see his eyes?

193
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,677
What about the shape of his nose?

194
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,761
Um...

195
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,389
Is Ms. Harper coming?

196
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,432
Because she promised
that she would meet me here.

197
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,516
I don't know.

198
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,103
Can you describe the shape of his mouth?

199
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,604
Um...

200
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,400
- His mouth.
- Or was the hoodie covering that too?

201
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,483
Um...

202
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:28,033
Um, II remember his voice.
I remember his voice.

203
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,201
It was, um...

204
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,954
It was... It was young.

205
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,623
And it was deep, and he was...

206
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,625
he was scared, like...

207
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,002
like he knew something.

208
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,714
Like he knew who killed my son.

209
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,304
I can't draw a voice, ma'am.

210
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,654
I've worked here for 15 years.
Never once been late for a shift.

211
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,241
- Four hours isn't a little late.
- Believe me, it won't happen twice.

212
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:13,120
I understand you lost your son, Isaiah,
and I'm sorry, I am.

213
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,624
But the County Health Inspector
was here for his monthly visit

214
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,543
and we got shut down because
none of the machinery was sterilized.

215
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,756
- We can't just let this go.
- It was an unforeseen circumstance.

216
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,258
- It won't happen again.
- It's out of my hands.

217
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,833
Ma'am?

218
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,586
How are you, Mrs. Butler?

219
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,381
You remember me?

220
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,591
I do, yes.

221
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,593
And your son.

222
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,762
Did... There was, um...

223
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,681
There was a man

224
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,643
that was in this room with a hoodie
that first night that we were here.

225
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,437
Did you... Did you see him?

226
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,605
No. Um...

227
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,151
But the cleaning crew
comes around late at night.

228
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:12,865
I know I saw him in this room
standing right here.

229
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,743
I know I saw him.

230
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,496
I'm sorry, Mrs. Butler, but...

231
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:25,169
your son was in the room down the hall,
not this room.

232
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,697
Mrs. Butler?

233
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,160
It's KJ Harper
from the prosecutor's office.

234
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,670
I know I said I would meet you
and I didn't and...

235
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,923
I tried calling you.

236
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,218
I'm sorry.

237
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,096
We need to talk about Kadeuce Porter.

238
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,099
Mrs. Butler?

239
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,118
- Fuck!
- What the fuck? Motherfucker!

240
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,745
That's how it fucking goes, right?

241
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,497
One fucking spare.

242
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,875
- Yo, Gary, we need some more beers!
- I thought you said you didn't drink.

243
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:51,338
It's on me. Don't worry.
I got you all night long, baby!

244
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:55,843
Hey, but you gotta hurry up though,
because my lady's thirsty.

245
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,016
- Whoo!
- You see that?

246
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,107
Yeah! Strike, baby.
Don't stop shaking that ass.

247
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,234
- DiAngelo, you're up.
- One sec.

248
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,571
Give me one minute, one minute.
You dance with the ladies.

249
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,698
Where you going, DiAngelo? It's your roll.

250
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,117
The faster you play, the faster I win.

251
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,536
You all right?

252
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,126
Hey, DiAngelo! It's your turn, man!

253
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,836
I fucking heard you, all right?

254
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,091
You could've bought it last night
in that trap house.

255
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,302
We all could've.

256
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,390
You think any of these people here
we protect

257
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:47,352
give two shits that your wife
gotta raise Mikey on her own?

258
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,856
Start it over again.

259
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,109
They deserve more than that.

260
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,155
'Cause you're a father...

261
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,324
and a husband.

262
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,661
And that is worth
one hell of a lot more...

263
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,249
than a picture and a pension.

264
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,878
Right?

265
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,092
Come on.

266
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,643
It's the only thing that does.

267
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,568
You fucking dance with your wife.
Come on.

268
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,043
- Come on.
- Do you want it?

269
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,503
Lost your turn already.

270
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,381
- I'll take it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

271
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,193
Shit, is there any more? Only two left?

272
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,997
My boy! My boy!

273
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,798
Didn't know you stuffed.

274
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,718
Nipple pads.

275
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,638
The sexy they don't tell you about
when you're having a kid.

276
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,851
These things are leaking worse
than the Titanic.

277
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,770
A lot of girls,
tits drop right down to their ankles,

278
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,149
never come back up after having a kid.
You bounced back real good.

279
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,739
You know, to be honest,
when we first met...

280
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,200
I kind of thought you were a bitch.

281
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,413
Because I am.

282
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,832
You gotta be when you're married
to a cop, right?

283
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,669
- You two ever think about having kids?
- Yeah.

284
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,046
Yeah, we did, but whatever.

285
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,756
Um, Mike can't.

286
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,591
Some genetic thing with his family.

287
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,093
He would've been a great dad though.

288
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,137
- It's kind of all he ever wanted.
- I'm so sorry.

289
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,432
No, you're... No, it's fine, it's fine.
We got a real good life, you know?

290
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:34,019
Got a nice house, nice car,
nice dinners out,

291
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,646
we go to the islands once a year.

292
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,399
I mean, what else could you want,
you know?

293
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,074
Petey's never home no more.

294
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:51,119
Between the night shifts with the team
and then picking up days in the East,

295
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,747
I'm like alone most of the time
with the kid.

296
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,917
Wait, he's still working patrol?
You got to get him to quit that shit.

297
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,753
Well, the paperwork hasn't cleared yet
for DiAngelo's team.

298
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,548
And one check ain't gonna cut it.

299
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,968
Your husband is busting drug dealers.

300
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,763
Girl, there's all sorts of ways
you can cut it.

301
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,682
It's not like those mooks
are doing good deeds

302
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,684
with all the cash they got lying around,
right?

303
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,108
Petey's like a choir boy
about that stuff. He...

304
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,112
He's been that way since we were kids.
He would die before he...

305
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,533
you know, did something like that.

306
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,076
Trust me...

307
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,122
what your husband does at work
you don't need to know.

308
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,707
You don't want to know.

309
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:49,094
And these separate
but related incidents that come under...

310
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,014
Five, eight, six...

311
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,518
two... one, one.

312
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,402
I was thinking maybe Brenton
was an internal hit.

313
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,696
The Five Kings taking out
one of their own.

314
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,073
People usually say "hi"
when they pick up the phone.

315
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:15,370
Kadeuce, he seemed pretty confident
that no other gang would touch a King.

316
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,874
So now Brenton Butler's a King.
Welcome to the party.

317
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,348
Most gangbangers think they're
untouchable until they take a bullet

318
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,630
- in their knucklehead.
- No, listen. I think Kadeuce was right.

319
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,301
Been going through drug arrest records
for the last year in the South District,

320
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,012
and... not even the police
are touching them.

321
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,724
Or if they are arresting any Kings,
it's for misdemeanors, nothing real.

322
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,393
Kings are running a tight ship.
How does that connect to Brenton?

323
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,730
I'm looking for a blue car
in these case files.

324
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,857
No luck so far.

325
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,235
You've got even less
of a life than my middleaged ass.

326
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,403
Fuck!

327
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,363
What are you doing?

328
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,325
I'm trying to fix my jacket
that asshat ripped.

329
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,619
I spent a lot of money at Kohl's
for this thing.

330
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,245
Where'd you run off to earlier?

331
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,497
A hearing. I forgot about it.

332
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,000
Yeah, well, you're always running off.

333
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,337
The Unis spotted our witness Nadine
trying to score in Bayside.

334
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,588
Want to go for a ride?

335
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,717
I got a lot more files to go through,
but let me know if you find her, okay?

336
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,929
Okay, let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa.
I want halvsies on the credit.

337
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,723
Yeah, okay. Jimmy Hoffa. Great.

338
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,576
Thank you. That's great.

339
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,500
They'll be sure to bring it up.

340
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,728
Ooh.

341
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,813
Hi, Dad.

342
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,900
You... You grew like, two inches, Mags.

343
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:09,984
I guess.

344
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,029
What are you... What are you doing?

345
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,573
Here, sit down.
What... What are you doing here?

346
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,412
I wanted to talk to you, like, in person.

347
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,164
Mom said I should. She's outside.

348
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,084
Okay. What's up?

349
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,630
I don't want to live with you.

350
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,967
Why?

351
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:38,972
It's just, like, school's kind of far away
from where you live now, and, like...

352
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,975
when am I gonna see my friends?

353
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,645
When are you gonna see me?
Did you ever think about that?

354
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:49,065
Whatever bullshit
she's putting in that head of yours,

355
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,026
I'm still your father.
You keep that straight.

356
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,154
No, I know. I'll come live with you
half the time. It's fine.

357
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,780
Half...

358
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,583
You're growing up, right?

359
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,004
Right in front of my eyes.

360
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,340
Hey, listen, I get it, you know, I mean...

361
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,427
who wants to bring their boyfriend home
to meet Pop the Cop?

362
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,179
God, I don't have a boyfriend.

363
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,021
We'll see each other, okay?
We'll figure it out.

364
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,274
There's phones, you know.
We can call each other.

365
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,902
- Maybe we can text too?
- Yeah, we can text.

366
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,236
That's right. We'll text.

367
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,448
I'm like a teenager with that shit.

368
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,672
Well, you should go.
Your... Your mom's waiting for you.

369
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,509
- Okay.
- Okay.

370
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,228
Bye.

371
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,646
Hey, Mags.

372
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,275
Gonna be okay.

373
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,465
I've been thinking
about going back to work.

374
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,469
I mean, I know everything's new
with Mikey, but...

375
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,263
We already talked about this.

376
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,931
I'm working, you're staying home.

377
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,558
Petey, you're never home anymore.

378
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,603
And these baby expenses,
they cost money.

379
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,605
And I said I'm taking care of it.

380
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,568
Okay. Fine.

381
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,868
You expecting something?

382
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,077
No. Are you?

383
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,458
Does it say who it's from?

384
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,340
Petey, who's it from?

385
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,528
Petey. Shit.

386
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,491
I wasn't expecting you so late. Um...

387
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,702
Come on in. Come on in.
I could've...

388
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:53,082
I would've cleaned up and got some Cutty
if I knew you were stopping by.

389
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,168
Come on in. Make yourself at home.

390
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,385
So, did you...

391
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:10,141
get the gift I left for my grandson,
little Petey the third?

392
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,935
His name's Michael.

393
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,812
Yeah, okay.

394
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,647
Whatever you name him,

395
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,610
the fight, it's in our blood, Petey.

396
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:24,989
You, me, him.
He should have your old gloves.

397
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,783
It's like father, like son.

398
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,701
I had to toughen you up some.

399
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,286
I was six years old...

400
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,164
and you broke my fucking arm.

401
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,042
That's what you call toughening up?

402
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,671
You know, I never said I was perfect,
Pete.

403
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,841
But you seemed
to have turned out okay, right?

404
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,468
I mean, look at you.
You're doing great.

405
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,872
Maybe if I had hit you a little harder,
you'd be president.

406
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,934
All those nights, you coming home...

407
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,855
calling me to the back room.

408
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,653
You fucking coward.

409
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,865
You weak...

410
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,159
fucking small man...

411
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,705
that never had nothing,
never was nothing...

412
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,750
but coming home to a little kid...

413
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:21,504
and taking your wasted life out on me
until I couldn't breathe.

414
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,216
And then you fucking run out on us,
you fuck!

415
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,807
Now, I may have your blood...

416
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,644
but I'm nothing like you.

417
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,440
Now, you ever go near my son again,
I'll fucking kill you.

418
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,068
And that ain't a threat, that's a promise.

419
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,962
Just keep on living, son.

420
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,137
You'll see.

421
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,443
Hey, you seen Nadine?

422
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,337
Have you seen Nadine?

423
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,339
Nadine. White girl.

424
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,988
Fuck.

425
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,326
What are you doing? Where are we going?

426
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,453
We're gonna drive around
until you sober up,

427
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,665
then have a civilized conversation
about what you saw in the park that day.

428
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,959
I think it sounds like a great idea.
What do you think?

429
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,336
Okay, good. Watch your head.

430
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,321
Brenton.

431
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,715
Sorry, Tricey, I just got in. I wake you?

432
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,177
Um...

433
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,305
You okay?

434
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,643
They told me to go on food stamps.

435
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,729
The VA?

436
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,234
I thought they were lining up
a job for you.

437
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:15,446
Backlogged with all of us vets
coming back, looking for a life.

438
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,702
They said I got to wait six months
for a job to open up.

439
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,249
Told me to consider reenlisting.

440
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,258
I can't just live off of you, 'Saiah.

441
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,759
- Y'all got bills.
- You're family.

442
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,719
We'll get through it.

443
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,806
I know the hospital bills ain't been paid.

444
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,893
I saw the mail, Trice.

445
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,523
All right, he's got another bill
for the house...

446
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,316
- Your brother's taking care of things.
- Is he?

447
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,159
I just worry.

448
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,582
I think I'm losing my mind.

449
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,419
I thought you were Brenton.

450
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,837
He used to...

451
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,967
come down in the middle of the night

452
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,261
to eat a bowl of cereal.

453
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,017
He loved his Froot Loops.

454
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,275
You're grieving, Tricey.

455
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,449
And that weighs the heart down,

456
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,994
makes your mind see
what you wish was there.

457
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,121
It should be there by all rights.

458
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,585
You ain't wrong in the head, Tricey,
all right? You ain't wrong.

459
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,712
All right, you...

460
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,925
You just got a broken heart.

461
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,435
Brenton gave me this when I went on tour.

462
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,104
Told me, "Keep it close."

463
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,860
Said it had magical powers to protect.

464
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,572
This got me through all my tours,

465
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,282
brought me home.

466
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,579
It's yours now, Tricey.

467
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,755
You can come home too.

468
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,429
No.

469
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,975
You keep it.

470
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,061
You keep it.

471
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,353
Hey.

472
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,400
- Let's go. Come on. Ride's over.
- Stop.

473
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,737
Why are we here?

474
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,490
Well, now that you're feeling better,
we're gonna have that oneonone convo.

475
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,618
I told you, I don't know anything!

476
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,454
You through?

477
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,541
Let's go. Get up.

478
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,879
Fuck you! Hey, fuck you,
you fucking old fuck! I hate you!

479
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,882
- Get off! Get off of me!
- You little shit, you scratched me.

480
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,425
- You know what?
- Get off!

481
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,970
- Get off of me!
- I tried to make this easy, but fuck it.

482
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,931
- You're gonna go to lock up, okay?
- Get off!

483
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,731
They call them dumdum bullets.

484
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:23,110
Once it came through my hip, it broke up
into fragments for maximum damage.

485
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:27,740
Doctors cleaned out what they could.
The rest were too close to remove.

486
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,451
Didn't want to risk full paralysis.

487
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,534
Damn.

488
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:35,206
- Man, it's hard to see you like this, bro.
- Yeah, man.

489
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,500
I'm setting off metal detectors and shit.

490
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,502
TSA hate to see me coming.

491
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,171
But no need to cry for me, man.

492
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,882
You lose one thing,
everything else is better.

493
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,220
I'm stronger,
sharper in my mind, you know.

494
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,764
Nothing like coming facetoface
with death

495
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,141
to really make you appreciate life.

496
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,938
Now you wear the crown.

497
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:04,235
It's the shit we used to dream about
when we was kids, scrambling...

498
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,530
working the corner for ButterBreeze.

499
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,657
Yeah.

500
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,994
My condolences about nephew.

501
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,080
Shit's fucked up, man.

502
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,250
Isaiah and Tricey, they struggle.

503
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:25,172
You know, they can't... they can't tell up
from down, and I ain't on my feet yet.

504
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:29,176
You know, with the hospital bills,
the house, the funeral cost...

505
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,679
What the fuck you trying to say, Seth?

506
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,932
Do you need some money?

507
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,855
You know, it's funny, man, because...

508
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,525
when I hit the ground after I got shot,

509
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:51,782
all I could hear in my head
was your voice saying, "Get up."

510
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,662
You was with me in spirit, man.

511
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,289
Like always.

512
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,292
Shit, we might as well be blood, bro.

513
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,922
Don't you ever hang your head
to ask me for shit.

514
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:08,757
I got you.

515
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,054
Sarah?

516
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,932
Hey.

517
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,308
How are you?

518
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:19,684
Hi.

519
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,067
Hi.

520
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,450
Hi.

521
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,745
I didn't think you'd make it.

522
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,998
Of course I was going to make it
for Daddy's birthday.

523
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,250
He only turns 63 once, right?

524
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,418
Sixtyfour.

525
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,922
It's been way too long. I missed you.

526
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,716
You still working in Jersey City?

527
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,093
Yeah, same old, same old.

528
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,179
Well, you look really good.

529
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,138
Thanks.

530
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,431
And happy.

531
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,392
You look happy.

532
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,686
I am... happy.

533
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,606
You should say hi to Daddy,
he's been waiting.

534
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,572
I'm really glad you made it.

535
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,657
Come here.

536
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,408
Thanks for coming.

537
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,377
- Hi.
- Hey.

538
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,755
Thought you gave everyone the slip?

539
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:30,965
I'm wise to you.

540
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,470
You know, 30 years ago,

541
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,598
couldn't see two feet in front of you
at one of these shindigs.

542
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,685
Now, I light one up just inside
and your mother skins me alive.

543
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,312
How's my angel?

544
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,771
Good.

545
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,399
I'm really good.

546
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,818
Actually, um, I've been busy.

547
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,029
- Tell me about it.
- I'm working a homicide.

548
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,990
It's... it's a hitandrun.

549
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,243
A black teenager
was left out in the cold to die.

550
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:00,703
That's a shame.

551
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,622
It's still a traffic violation.

552
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,917
It's a murder, Dad,
it's not a speeding ticket.

553
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,962
Well, clearly, it's a seconddegree crime.

554
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,175
The driver left him to die in a ditch
like a piece of roadkill.

555
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,552
If you can prove that.

556
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,306
Hitandruns are notoriously difficult
to prosecute.

557
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,017
Unwinnable, mostly, in my experience.

558
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,521
Come on, KJ. You gotta toughen up.

559
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,399
You gotta be stronger than that.
You gotta be stronger than them.

560
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,488
You've been saying that to me
my whole life.

561
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:40,075
Look, I just don't want this
going sideways on you.

562
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,369
What... The last one.
That was a kid too, wasn't it?

563
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,705
That case was completely different.

564
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,416
And I'm not going sideways or anyways,

565
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,960
I'm upset because
you're not listening to me.

566
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,795
I am listening to you.

567
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,214
That's why I worry, baby.

568
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,274
What are you doing here?

569
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,901
You look fancy.

570
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,196
I had a family thing.

571
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,279
Okay.

572
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:22,076
Yeah, me too. Come in, join in the fun.
Get out of here.

573
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,495
You guys remember KJ?

574
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,080
Yeah!

575
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,207
- Don't bite her.
- Hey.

576
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,419
It's...

577
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,631
food prep night here.

578
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,092
I'm mixing the hamburger
with the gizzards

579
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,511
and these, these flax seeds.

580
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,805
They like their liver too.

581
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:44,848
I know.

582
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,184
Pretty crazy weekend here.

583
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,228
Have to call the fire marshal,

584
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,731
shut this rager down
before it gets out of hand, you know?

585
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,734
You want a drink? You want a drink.

586
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:59,113
You know, I think I got some Rumple Minze
somewhere here from New Year's.

587
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,447
I'm good. Thanks.

588
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,616
You sure?

589
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:07,079
How'd it go with the witness?

590
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,289
I could've told you that over the phone.

591
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,835
She is a real pistol, man.
I'm telling you.

592
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:16,004
II hope that a night in lockup
will...

593
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,215
cool her out. You know?

594
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,758
- Great.
- Yeah.

595
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,553
- That's really great.
- Yeah. Yeah.

596
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:28,183
But tonight is just
Fish's famous fourlegged feast.

597
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,267
Hey.

598
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,644
What are you doing?

599
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,565
What... Why...

600
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,651
- Hey, what are you doing that for?
- Um...

601
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,319
You know, it's... it's not a big deal.

602
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,155
It's a big deal to me. Where you going?

603
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,785
- I should go.
- Hey. No, wait. No, KJ.

604
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,663
Don't go out there
and do something stupid.

605
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,167
Hey! Whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey, stop.

606
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,835
Stop that right now. Stop that.

607
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,464
I just fuck...

608
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,383
I just fuck everything up.

609
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,218
You think you're a fuck up?

610
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,889
My kid doesn't want to see me anymore.
That's right.

611
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,891
Because I'm such a shitty fucking dad.

612
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:14,354
Now she's all grown up and that's it.
No second chances, no doovers, nada.

613
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:20,527
Listen, just stay here
and we can both hate ourselves together.

614
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:23,864
Why waste a perfectly good
Saturday night?

615
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:32,386
If you're trying to get me to sleep
with you, it's not gonna work.

616
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,876
You want... You want...
You want a liver sandwich?

617
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,672
I'd offer you gizzards,
but Lizzie will tear your throat out.

618
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,257
Come on.

619
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,884
Come on!

620
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,302
I don't like liver.

621
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,977
I can't remember the last
homecooked meal I had.

622
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,479
Don't get your hopes up too high.

623
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:58,899
Roast beef is Isaiah's favorite,
and I haven't made it in a while.

624
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,693
Just in time. I hope you're hungry.

625
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,196
Yeah, we got some fine cuts
from Zeke's.

626
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,949
You know, he's still running
that brokeass joint down on Duncan.

627
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,618
How dare you come into my house
after what you did?

628
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,411
'Saiah! My God!

629
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,373
No! Seth!

630
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,165
Seth!

631
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,794
Seth, stop!

632
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,129
Stop! Stop!

633
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,214
- No!
- Blood money.

634
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:25,217
After all I sacrificed to raise you right,
this is how you do me?

635
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,469
Somebody gotta pay them bills,
it wasn't gonna be you.

636
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,137
Know your place or I'll put you in it.

637
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,598
Woo!

638
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,476
That's how your God talk through you?
Hallefuckinglujah.

639
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,186
- Mother...
- Stop it! Isaiah!

640
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,272
He used drug money from that gang!

641
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,483
I don't want you interfering
with my family.

642
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,736
Where was your God when Brenton
lay bleeding down in that ditch?

643
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:49,366
And you sitting up in here,
telling his mama that God got a plan?

644
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,449
What?

645
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,995
To let B die down there like a beat dog?

646
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,038
If that's God's plan, he's a fucking punk.

647
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,456
Don't blaspheme in my house!

648
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,874
This house, this house,

649
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,711
it's the only thing you care about,
the only thing you ever loved!

650
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,797
I provided a better life for my family
because that's what a man does.

651
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,965
Calm down.

652
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,426
Don't tell me about responsibility, boy!

653
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,928
- Isaiah.
- You took care of your family?

654
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:15,017
What a father does is know his son...
to the core, to the bones!

655
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,935
What he loves, what he hates...

656
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,480
what makes him cry with joy and pain,
and everything in between!

657
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,232
Seth, calm down.

658
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,402
You tell me one thing you know
about your son.

659
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:32,034
It was the only thing
Brenton ever wanted...

660
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,829
for his father to know him.

661
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,671
All you had to do was ask.

662
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,338
Yo, man, what you need?

663
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,255
Fuck!

664
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,800
A bag of Red Hots to go with my donuts.

665
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,551
The breakfast of champions.

666
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,062
What the fuck you doing here?
I gave everyone the night off.

667
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:45,315
I want to talk about the bust
Wilcox ran point on.

668
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,525
Yeah?

669
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,444
Junkie left half a burger.
You want something to go with that?

670
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,698
Yeah, so, time to time,
Wilcox sticks his head up his ass.

671
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,491
That's what I want to talk about.

672
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,704
This wasn't one of those times.

673
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,043
Drugs here will fetch us
a couple hundred each.

674
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,170
I want in.

675
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,965
The same cut as everyone else.

676
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,348
Should've bagged that out on the street.

677
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,935
You know the rules
of proper evidence handling.

678
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,605
I ain't wired, ain't IA.

679
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,441
Ain't out for nothing but a way in.

680
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,069
I got a family to think about now.

681
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:34,948
I need them to be taken care of
if something happens to me.

682
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,745
That kid on the bike in the park
was just a banger like the rest.

683
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,372
Well, the animal got what he deserved.

684
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,792
I'll do what it takes. I ain't no coward.

685
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:52,132
What, are you fucking stupid
bringing this shit into the station?

686
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,761
Our business stays on the street.
You got it?

687
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,847
You clean all that shit up.

688
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,184
Meet me outside in five.

689
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,651
Your bus is coming.

690
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,115
That was Five King's money.

691
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:44,119
I don't want to have nothing
to do with that.

692
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:46,830
He was just trying to help.

693
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,130
You okay with going back to work?

694
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,474
Only have one shift
at the slaughterhouse today,

695
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,556
so I'll be back around six or seven.

696
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,683
Okay.

697
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,276
You're so fucked.

698
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,154
I'm gonna tell everyone
you kidnapped and raped me.

699
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,994
You're being charged
with possession of a narcotic, vagrancy,

700
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,538
resisting arrest,
and assaulting an officer.

701
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:56,501
What? So yesterday you were good cop,
today you're bad cop? Not gonna work.

702
00:54:57,085 --> 00:55:00,880
Up until your trial, you're going
to be held at a community youth house.

703
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,804
Sentence begins, gonna be transferred
to a woman's correctional facility

704
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:06,443
where you're gonna do four to seven
years, depending on behavior.

705
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,514
And I'm guessing with you,
it's going to be closer to seven.

706
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,646
I saw three guys in the park.

707
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:21,276
They got in their car and they drove off.
That's it, that's all I saw.

708
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,278
- Can I please go now?
- What kind of car?

709
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:24,404
I don't know.

710
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:30,243
It was black.
Black with a red stripe on it.

711
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,305
We need a signature right here and right...

712
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:35,123
That's what I saw! I'm not lying!

713
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,002
How'd you see that car?
How'd you see these guys?

714
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,212
I was sleeping in that old power plant.

715
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:44,340
I go up there to sleep sometimes.
And I heard this...

716
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,092
this sound and...

717
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,054
I mean, I didn't do anything,
but then it got real quiet after a while,

718
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,306
so I got up, and that's when I saw them.

719
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,350
I swear to fucking God, I'm not lying.

720
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:58,605
Don't go anywhere.

721
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:03,610
Hey, Mama, what you wearing?

722
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,404
Yeah, in your dreams.

723
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,198
Nadine awake yet?

724
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,824
Yeah. I'm talking to her right now.

725
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:13,328
She says she a black car, not a blue car.
A black car with a red stripe.

726
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,205
Wait. Wait, wait. What color was the car?

727
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,415
A black car with a red stripe. Why?

728
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,835
- Doesn't know what she's talking about.
- Just keep her there, okay?

729
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:21,836
I'm on my way.

730
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,880
Fifty dollars.
You know that, right?

731
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,007
All right. What you got? What you got?

732
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,384
Let's go, let's go.

733
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,558
So here's the deal.

734
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,978
We're gonna sit tight
until my assistant prosecutor shows up,

735
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,563
and then give your statement to her.

736
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,023
- Yo, what's up?
- Not much. You?

737
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:46,152
What happened?
Your boyfriend forget the safe word?

738
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,822
Yeah, I said chimichurri
instead of chimichanga.

739
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,323
He got all confused, you know.

740
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,350
- What?
- You owe me money.

741
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,894
Fifty dollars. Get it done.

742
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:21,854
All right.

743
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,567
You know that, right? All right.

744
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,301
Get off me!

745
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,514
Don't make me tell you again!

746
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:20,598
Spread your legs.

747
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,601
- Now you fucking...
- You don't move.

748
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,853
- Don't fucking move.
- Don't you fucking move.

749
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,981
Now, turn around. Face the wall.

750
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,107
Motherfucker.

751
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,901
Don't you fucking look at me.

752
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:35,321
Now, let's go, motherfucker.
You know the fucking drill.

753
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,156
Let's start fucking moving.

754
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,952
- You think you're fucked now?
- Get off me!

755
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:44,622
Move your ass or I'll show you
what fucked is, you motherfucker.

756
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,749
This piece of shit. You feel me?

757
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,711
I'll show you what fucked is.
Get him out of here.

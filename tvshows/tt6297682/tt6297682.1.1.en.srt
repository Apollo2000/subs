1
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,458
Hey, tell Marie I'm on my way.
I'm headed to the hospital now.

2
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,418
And tell her I love her.

3
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,253
And everything's gonna be okay.

4
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,840
Hey, call me when you get this
and let me know what's going on.

5
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,848
- Marie?
- Nah, it's DiAngelo.

6
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,100
- You talk to her yet?
- I can't get through to her.

7
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,864
Her cousin Teresa isn't picking up either.

8
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,979
She's gonna pull through, man.
The baby, too.

9
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,397
Yeah. They will.

10
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,609
Hey, look, I gotta go,
I gotta try her again.

11
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:50,852
I'll catch up with you later.

12
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,542
Yeah, I'll catch you later, man.
Call me back when you hear some...

13
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,955
You okay, Pete?

14
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,541
What happened?

15
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,131
He came out of nowhere.

16
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,259
DiAngelo.

17
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,313
What condition's he in?
Male, female, what?

18
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,816
I don't know.

19
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,500
What the fuck you do, Jablonski?

20
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,058
Who's over there, Di?

21
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,021
Stay on the fucking road.

22
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,752
Put it in the trunk.

23
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,715
Di.

24
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,308
You talk to your wife yet?

25
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,185
How's she doing?

26
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,105
What the fuck are you talking about?

27
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,567
No one saw you, right?

28
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,115
Yo, Di!

29
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,738
This is what's gonna happen.

30
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,914
You're gonna leave right now. Go.

31
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,874
- Di, what the fuck?
- Shut up!

32
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,044
- No, we got to call it in.
- He's dead.

33
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,465
There's nothing you can do for him.

34
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,593
Did you go over there?

35
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,762
Did you see what's in that ditch?

36
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,892
They're gonna crucify you for this.

37
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:37,355
Every one of us is gonna pay for this.
You understand what I'm saying, right?

38
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,818
No one's gonna find him here, okay?

39
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,486
No one's gotta know.

40
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,488
Hey. Hey.

41
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,116
I said I got this.

42
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,869
Get to the hospital. Go be with your wife.

43
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,292
Drive away.

44
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,399
Get it out of the road.

45
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,339
Where do you want me to put it?

46
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,347
- Yeah.
- What are you doing to her?

47
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,640
Pete.

48
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:59,395
It's okay. Don't look so worried.
It's just a little spotting.

49
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,024
Did you see Teresa?
She was... She just walked out.

50
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,694
Dr. Taranaweh ran an ultrasound.
I can pull it up for you if you want.

51
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,946
No, why don't you get the fucking doctor?

52
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,411
Yeah. Sure.

53
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,124
Seriously, Petey?

54
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,542
That was rude.

55
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,171
No, you said you were bleeding.

56
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,672
It stopped.

57
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,050
Okay?

58
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,928
- You...
- It's fine. I promise.

59
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,474
Hey, come here. Come here.

60
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,773
We're past the five month mark, Pete.

61
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,194
I have a good feeling, you know?

62
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,948
Yeah, I know. No, it's just...

63
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,579
- You just scared me there.
- I know. I know.

64
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,545
What happened?

65
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,591
It was nothing. No, we just...

66
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,595
- We were working.
- Doc will be here in a minute.

67
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,393
It'll turn itself off.

68
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,355
Babe.

69
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,527
There he is.

70
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,666
Little Poke.

71
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,528
Don't lose anymore, all right?

72
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,489
Those things are expensive.
Last pair. All right.

73
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,716
Excuse me.

74
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,428
- You waiting for somebody?
- Yeah, my brother.

75
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,680
He's supposed to be here.

76
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,184
What grade is he in?

77
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,560
Sixth.

78
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:48,064
No, sixth graders, they left already,
so that means he left too.

79
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,484
- Is there somebody you want to call?
- Yeah, I just did. My mom.

80
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,154
Maybe your brother walked home?

81
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,824
He didn't.

82
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,534
He takes his bike to school.

83
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,876
What your brother would be doing
down here is beyond me.

84
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,462
He's not here. He's at the park.

85
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,007
Do you see him?

86
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,094
All right!

87
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,472
Where else do you think he could be?

88
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,349
I don't know.

89
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,646
Ryan!

90
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,442
What the fuck?

91
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,494
Little shit.

92
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,746
Fuck off.

93
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,087
I...

94
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,592
kind of sat on this. Sorry.

95
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,595
It's okay.

96
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,847
What is that?

97
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,978
It's a seagull.

98
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,440
My son Brenton made it.

99
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,735
Wow. It's cool.

100
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,533
Put on your seat belts.
If we hurry up, we can get you home

101
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,410
before it really starts kicking up.

102
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,303
Ready for another?

103
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,015
Yeah.

104
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,867
- I got tied up on the turnpike. So sorry.
- All rise.

105
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:53,457
Superior court of Hudson County,
state of New Jersey, is now in session,

106
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,376
Honorable Richard Blatt presiding.

107
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,836
Please sit.

108
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,130
Um...

109
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:05,636
Your Honor, the State presents
complaint number...

110
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,348
It's... Got it. It's...

111
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,935
complaint number 5977.

112
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,439
This is the defendant's third
shoplifting charge.

113
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,318
Ms. Lufts stole $200 in cat food.

114
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,237
You've got the wrong defendant.

115
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,908
That's not the complaint number
I'm looking at, Counselor.

116
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,035
Um...

117
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:34,164
Get your paperwork in order
before you walk into my courtroom.

118
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,375
- Your Honor, I have it right here. It...
- Next.

119
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,256
Our county is the gold standard
in law enforcement.

120
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,217
Working hand in hand with its citizens.

121
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,219
The police violence we're witnessing

122
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,097
in black and brown communities
throughout America

123
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,725
has no place in New Jersey.

124
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,352
As prosecutor, good police
and community relations

125
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,116
have been a priority in my administration.

126
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,940
Mr. Connelly, when are you
announcing your run for governor?

127
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,272
Darius!

128
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,819
Darius!

129
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,407
He was a little offbeat though.

130
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,575
- Gotta tell you.
- No.

131
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,036
I saw Brother Jerrel
and you saw Brother Jerrel too.

132
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,370
And who he was looking at.

133
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,040
You are crazy!

134
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,085
'Saiah, you know that woman is married.

135
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,260
I know, I'm just saying she looked good
after she lost all that weight.

136
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,090
Brenton? Baby, you home?

137
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,051
Brenton! Your mama's calling you, boy!

138
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,513
He should be here by now.
Or did he forget about tonight too?

139
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,599
No, Uncle Seth's coming home,
and that's all he could talk about.

140
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,727
He is so excited.
He's got a surprise for the both of you.

141
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,813
What? That he forgot
his uncle's homecoming?

142
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:31,443
Aw, come on, he's either in the yard
or upstairs in his room. I'll check.

143
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,987
I see he's been messing with my TV again.

144
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,074
I can't turn it on if he's done playing
with his damn video games.

145
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,285
Well, maybe you should leave it off
seeing as you got a whole house to paint.

146
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,473
You have one new message.

147
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,599
Brenton!

148
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,394
Yeah, we're looking for the parents
of Brenton Butler.

149
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,480
Could you call the South District
police station when you get the message?

150
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,023
It concerns your son.

151
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,385
I heard the callout.

152
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,357
Found him with a BMX bike
that's pretty banged up.

153
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,109
Got any ID on the kid?

154
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,654
Brenton Butler. Black male, 15 years old.

155
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,825
Notified the parents. He's at the ER
at Jersey City Medical Center in surgery.

156
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,703
Anyone have a conversation
with the parents?

157
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,121
Wanted to wait for you.

158
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,497
- He's alive?
- Yeah.

159
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,221
He's probably fucking brain dead.
It's like the Red Sea down there.

160
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,624
- Hey. I'm sorry, brother. Um...
- You gotta wait.

161
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,377
I'm sorry. It's my son.
He's been in a car accident.

162
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,628
You got to wait in line.

163
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,673
We're sorry, we don't know
what's going on with our son. Please?

164
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,968
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- His name is Brenton. Brenton Butler.

165
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,892
There's no "r." It's "Benton."

166
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,436
Gave me the wrong spelling.
I'll need you to fill this out.

167
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,689
- Do you have your insurance card, ID?
- Yeah.

168
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,071
Have a seat, the doctor will talk to you
when he's done in surgery.

169
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,281
Surgery?

170
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,556
Just have a seat. The doctor will talk
to you when he's done.

171
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,411
- Why would he be in surgery?
- I don't know.

172
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,162
They don't tell us these things.

173
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,956
Please, just have a seat.

174
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,174
Surgery?

175
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,055
Why is he in surgery?

176
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,402
Why do they have him in surgery?
Why's he in surgery?

177
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,071
Father God, praise be to you.

178
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,825
Your glory, your mercy.

179
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,454
Watch over our baby.

180
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,875
Please don't let my baby die, Father God.
I don't know...

181
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,919
I ask this in your holy name.

182
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,758
Please, Father God. Look after my...

183
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,369
Fuck.

184
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,042
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

185
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,211
You're fine.

186
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:13,118
I'd been sleeping in my car
under the Pulaski the whole day.

187
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,370
Nobody bothers me there,

188
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,165
except when that cop came
banging on my window.

189
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,458
Did you drive through the park
this morning?

190
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:26,840
No, I... I told you I was sleeping
under the Pulaski all day.

191
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,842
Drinking too, right?

192
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,094
All the live long day.

193
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,180
You the oncall AP?

194
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:37,726
Yeah, I'm KJ Harper.
They just put me back on an hour ago.

195
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,646
Right. One of my Cis tipped us off
to this guy.

196
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,317
Saw Gramps here cleaning blood off
the front of his car

197
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,480
near the park this morning.

198
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,403
We just picked him up
riding around near there,

199
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,905
two sheets to the wind.

200
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,742
Why's narcotics interested
in a hitandrun?

201
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,995
We just got a tip.

202
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,623
And he looks good for it.

203
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:03,084
Two prior DUls, it's a matter of time
before he killed someone.

204
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,504
That's in the report.
You read that, right?

205
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:08,882
Of course I did.

206
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,846
I just didn't realize reports were read
by every Joe in the district.

207
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,139
Every...

208
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,644
Mike DiAngelo.

209
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,108
I've seen you before,
down at the courthouse.

210
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,862
You work the shoplifting cases.

211
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,621
You got this tied up with a bow.

212
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,458
You got enough for a plea
without lifting one bejeweled nail.

213
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,629
I know how to do my job, but thanks.

214
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,964
Well, then do it.

215
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,303
Mr. Dorsey seems to believe
he was asleep in his car.

216
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,347
Well, what's he gonna say?

217
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,059
"I just rolled over some kid's head
in my Buick, my bad"?

218
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,562
Come on.

219
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,981
Okay. Thanks.

220
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,234
Hey.

221
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,946
The trash can's down there.

222
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,036
This fucking guy.
It's your boy, Jablonski.

223
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,413
He keeps calling.

224
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:24,541
I didn't kill no kid.
I was sleeping.

225
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,797
Yo! Ms. Harper!

226
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,131
Yo! Hey!

227
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,510
Are you the assistant prosecutor
on my job?

228
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,430
I'm Joe Rinaldi. You can call me Fish.

229
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,432
Former NYPD,

230
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:44,269
but I just got this new place
out on the water. It's fucking beautiful.

231
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,939
The kids love it, so I figured, fuck it,
why not Jersey.

232
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,774
- Did you need something from me?
- Yeah.

233
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:54,321
Yeah. The guys in there said
that you're ready to file this job.

234
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,365
- You got enough for that?
- Yep.

235
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,409
Yep. Okeydokey. Um...

236
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,080
Yo, are you going to the hospital?
I need to pick up the victim's belongings.

237
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,999
- Yeah. Yeah, I am.
- Mind if I ride with?

238
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,419
Sure. Yeah.

239
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,213
If we pass a bodega en route,
think about picking up some mints.

240
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,593
I'm just... I don't care.

241
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,595
I'm just saying,
out of respect for the family.

242
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,766
I can smell you like a mile away.
Not a good look.

243
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,773
Actually, I have to go to the office
for some paperwork, so...

244
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,734
Get your own ride there.

245
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,881
What'd they do to my boy?

246
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,550
What'd they do to my boy?

247
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,639
- Be with you every step of the way.
- It's all good, bro.

248
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,766
It's all right.

249
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,935
Latrice.

250
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,358
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

251
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,739
Brenton, he was counting the days
to see you in uniform.

252
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,993
It's been a while. He's so proud.

253
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:28,998
And he wants to hear all the stories
about Afghanistan and Kandastan.

254
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,000
Are you the parents of Brenton Butler?

255
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,794
- Yeah.
- He's stable.

256
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,713
I was able to relieve the pressure
on his brain,

257
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,216
but there's been significant impact,

258
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,761
primarily to the posterior cortex,
the back of his head.

259
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,929
What does that mean?

260
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,640
He could lose the ability
to function independently.

261
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,143
He could be on a ventilator
for a long time.

262
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,147
What happened? Was he at school?

263
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,858
- The police haven't told us.
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

264
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,861
Can we see him now?

265
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,905
Not everyone right now, just the parents.

266
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,490
- You can come with me.
- Okay.

267
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,645
- Where's DiAngelo at?
- Come here.

268
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,147
Not picking up his phone.
No one's picking up.

269
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,571
Now what the fuck is going on?

270
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,825
DiAngelo would fucking lose his mind
if he saw you here.

271
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,660
We're taking care of it.

272
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:33,081
The kid's alive. Now that's what you call
taking care of it?

273
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,501
You think we fucking knew that?

274
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,838
Look, all I'm saying is
there's got to be another way.

275
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,382
This is wrong, and you know it is.

276
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,435
This whole thing's gonna blow up.

277
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,814
And we're all gonna go to prison
for a fucking accident.

278
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,899
A white cop and a black kid?

279
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,360
Don't you watch the news?

280
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,489
There are no fucking accidents anymore,
and you know it.

281
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:12,287
The assistant prosecutor's filing papers
on a guy tonight. It's over.

282
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,126
What guy?

283
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,922
Who cares, man? Not you.

284
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,792
Excuse me, I just started
the Narcotics Unit here.

285
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,502
DiAngelo's team?

286
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,757
You know who's um...
who's working the hitandrun in the park?

287
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,010
Another new guy, Rinaldi.
He's out, left an hour ago.

288
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,181
- Know when he's gonna be back?
- I have no idea.

289
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,599
Do you want to leave a message?

290
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,811
What about the captain? You got his name?

291
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,455
You got a report, you can turn it in
to your supervising officer.

292
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,443
I gotta talk to the captain. Direct.

293
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,613
I'll leave my cell, all right?

294
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,257
Just make sure he gets it.

295
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,050
Yep.

296
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,868
Got the kid's clothing. How about you?

297
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,829
Get all your personal business
taken care of?

298
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,789
Pick up some milk? Go to the bank?

299
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,416
That's good. That's important.

300
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,421
Mr. Butler? Mrs. Butler?

301
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,049
Who are you?

302
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,885
We're with the prosecutor's office.
We're looking for the parents.

303
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,845
Yes.

304
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,390
I'm Detective Rinaldi. This is KJ Harper.

305
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,766
What happened to my son?

306
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,436
- They said he was in a car accident.
- Yeah.

307
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,148
No one's talked to us.
The police haven't said anything.

308
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,944
We need some privacy
right now to talk. Please.

309
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,324
Joseph, can you give us a minute?

310
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,410
There's a waiting room
at the end of the hall.

311
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,754
There'll be a bail hearing tomorrow
before the arraignment at the courthouse.

312
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,380
That's not what they asked.

313
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,716
We need to know exactly how this happened.

314
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,385
Your son was in a hitandrun this morning
at Liberty State Park.

315
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,469
This morning?

316
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,972
They didn't call us until a few hours ago.

317
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,807
That's when they found him,
earlier tonight.

318
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,101
Two people found him. Their dog, actually.

319
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,563
We have the man in custody
who we believe did this.

320
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,066
I'll be filing paperwork
with the judge tonight

321
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,734
for his hearing first thing tomorrow.

322
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,278
Can you be a little more clear
with the details? I...

323
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:36,115
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

324
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,536
It's a nice bike your son's got.

325
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,705
Five Kings rides them too.

326
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,041
That series of BMX
goes for some serious bank.

327
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,375
What are you implying?

328
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,504
That Brenton's with a gang? Really?
You gonna do this now?

329
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,423
Wanna step back, whoever you are,
and let me talk to the family?

330
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,093
I am family, and I don't appreciate you
coming up in here

331
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,471
- and accusing my nephew...
- Seth, let me handle this.

332
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,556
We bought the bike.

333
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,309
Brenton's 16th birthday's coming up soon.

334
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,813
Now, what's gonna happen
to the man who did this?

335
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,689
Well, I'll be charging Mr. Dorsey

336
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,150
with leaving the scene
of a motor vehicle accident

337
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,069
resulting in serious bodily injury.

338
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,072
And I'll suggest the maximum sentence
for this type of felony.

339
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,074
Which is what, exactly?

340
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,617
Three to five years.

341
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:27,792
My son laid in the cold...

342
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,003
in the snow, in pain...

343
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,214
for hours.

344
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,802
And no one came for him except a dog.

345
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,890
He may never walk again.

346
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,394
He may never wake up again.

347
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,939
And you're telling me
that the person that did this

348
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,441
will get three to five years?

349
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,903
That man deserves to die
for what he did to my son!

350
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,028
Latrice.

351
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,245
I'm sorry.

352
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:09,917
My card.

353
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,190
Damn it.

354
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,942
You're locking yourself out
doing it like that. Just click it once.

355
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,654
I don't need to be told
how to unlock my damn car.

356
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,197
Okay.

357
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,703
What? Come on. Harper!

358
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,080
Come on!

359
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,041
But we gotta go to impound.

360
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,668
We gotta get the paperwork
on Dorsey's car.

361
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,796
Harper, please.

362
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,600
Harper, look. Look.

363
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,647
This is you when the night's done
and you don't have to see me anymore.

364
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,114
Thank you.

365
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:27,578
Today we claim promises
over our son Brenton.

366
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,749
We believe in the healing power
of faith and prayer

367
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:36,045
and ask you to begin your mighty work
in the life of Brenton.

368
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:42,260
Lord, your word speaks promises
of healing and restoration.

369
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,972
And we thank you for the miracles
you still perform today.

370
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,608
Is he gonna live?

371
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,570
What?

372
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,785
I'm sorry. I was in the wrong room.

373
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,414
I'm gonna turn myself in.

374
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,376
But nobody's gotta know
none of you were there.

375
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,509
Just to be clear...

376
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,472
this is what's gonna happen.

377
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,602
Well, they are gonna fuck you...

378
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,355
for Ferguson...

379
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,107
Chicago, Baltimore...

380
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,904
for every white cop
who ever killed a black kid.

381
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,699
- It was an accident.
- No one gives a shit.

382
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,536
So, before you do anything,

383
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,915
I want you to think about what kind
of father you'd be behind bars...

384
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,376
out of your son's life.

385
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,212
He ain't ever gonna know you.

386
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,052
You're a good cop, I see it.
That's why I picked you.

387
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,891
You and me? We're a dying breed.

388
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:59,397
And we take care of our own,
you understand?

389
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,707
Don't go behind my back again.

390
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,359
I need the paperwork
on my hitandrun.

391
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,610
It's Mac Dorsey's car.

392
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,697
Who's the owner of the car?
We need a signature.

393
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,075
I told you, Mac Dorsey.

394
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,373
Hey!

395
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,709
They need your John Hancock!

396
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,971
You want to wait inside?

397
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,974
It'll take about half an hour
to release the paperwork on the vehicle.

398
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,186
I'll wait in the car.

399
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,105
Why? It's just a sign off.

400
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,899
My supervisor's on break.

401
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,318
It's two in the fucking morning,
what's he doing?

402
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,361
It's out of my hands.
You can wait inside...

403
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,655
Rather freeze my balls off. Thanks.

404
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,114
Hey.

405
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,619
Well, you gotta use the tape
on the diaper, I told you that.

406
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,944
Or he's gonna be dropping shit bombs
all over the place.

407
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,873
Well, use your head.

408
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,293
How's Lizzie doing?
Give her the hamburger yet?

409
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,968
That's good.

410
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,428
And the twins?

411
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,265
What do you mean what about them?
They've been depressed all week.

412
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,854
All right, well, about another half hour.

413
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,439
I'll call you from the road.

414
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,369
You gonna hit that?

415
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,371
Because there's a cream.

416
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,372
What?

417
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:24,500
I'm telling you, hobo herpes,
it's a thing. I swear to God.

418
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,377
Did you see Dorsey's face?

419
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,228
That pastor of yours
found a chapel downstairs.

420
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,855
Wants you to head down
for some holy rolling with Jesus.

421
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,899
Seth. Enough.

422
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,670
Why'd you tell the police
we bought Brenton that bike?

423
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,632
You saw his face.

424
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,760
He already had his mind made up
that he was in a gang.

425
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,263
Because of what? The bike?

426
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,266
Where'd he get it from?

427
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,394
What was he doing in that park?

428
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,109
I won't tolerate
you covering up for him anymore.

429
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,614
I know he'd been going back
to the projects, and that park,

430
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,907
after I explicitly told him not to go.

431
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,328
'Saiah, he misses his friends.

432
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,204
He misses his home.

433
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,539
That's not his home.

434
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,501
Not anymore.

435
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,469
I don't know where he got it.

436
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,486
You ought to go with him.

437
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,490
Go on, Tricey. I'll stay here with B.

438
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:23,160
He's gonna suffocate Brenton
with all of his worries.

439
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,332
Just like he did you.

440
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,678
Kid must've been conscious for a while.

441
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,599
He's stuck
between these two snowbanks here.

442
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:47,976
Crawling around,

443
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,896
trying to find a way out,
probably screaming for his mama.

444
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,695
Crime scene photos
give you the heebiejeebies?

445
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,073
I don't need to look at them.

446
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,329
Isn't that, like, your job?

447
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:11,959
Nope. My job is to file paperwork.

448
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:17,172
File paperwork? You could file paperwork
at any fuckface firm down on the water.

449
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:18,966
I'm sick of their eyes.

450
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:21,926
What?

451
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,265
Even when they're dead, it's...

452
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,730
They're looking at you, wanting answers.

453
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,190
You worked Homicide before?

454
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,197
How'd you get bumped to car crimes?

455
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,868
Car crimes. Heh... right.

456
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,330
Paralyzing a kid
gets you three to five years,

457
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,791
but it's guaranteed
you won't do most of that time.

458
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,545
It's the greatest show on Earth,
this shit.

459
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,217
Did you see the driver's seat
in Dorsey's car?

460
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:08,182
That narc cop said
he had to chase him down,

461
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,905
driving around outside the park, right?
That's how they caught him.

462
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,811
So?

463
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,105
So, how do you drive lying down?

464
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,240
Here comes asshat. Finally.

465
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,790
- Have a good night.
- Whatever. Go fuck yourself.

466
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,462
Okay.

467
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,675
I'm gonna write up the kid's belongings
in the morning.

468
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,386
- Okay.
- You know, I can get an Uber from here.

469
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,388
But, yo, it was good working with you.

470
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,932
Yeah. You too.

471
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:55,771
And um...

472
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,109
Listen, the dead don't need answers.

473
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,447
They're dead. Okay?

474
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,828
See you at trial in the morning.
Don't forget about those mints?

475
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:18,752
Asshole.

476
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,439
Fuck!

477
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,209
Excuse me.

478
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,835
Are you family?

479
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,093
I'm his attorney.

480
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,383
Complaint number 39012,
the State versus Mac Henry Dorsey.

481
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,137
The counselor's appearance
for the record.

482
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,225
Is the State gonna talk?

483
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,644
Judge, it's not my complaint number.

484
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,563
Then where the hell is my prosecutor?

485
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,857
I'm sorry, Judge. I don't know.

486
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,400
Next case.

487
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:35,115
Complaint number 39013,
the State versus Lonny Mendoza.

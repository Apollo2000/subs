1
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,440
Where are you, Nadine?

2
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,376
The witness has a history of running away,
but we're confident we'll locate her.

3
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,919
I just need an adjournment.

4
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,673
I'm sorry, given the public turmoil
this whole situation has stirred up,

5
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,134
I think it's best we proceed as scheduled.

6
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,237
I'd like to read the witness' testimony
into the record...

7
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,431
Your Honor, that is a clear violation
of my clients' Crawford rights.

8
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,976
I'm not about to subvert due process
because the State misplaced its witness.

9
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,895
Find her, Counselor.

10
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,397
Trial will begin as scheduled.

11
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,734
Needless to say,

12
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,153
I'll move to have the case dismissed
as soon as possible.

13
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,280
I think Dolan will grant it.

14
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:16,159
As long as your witness doesn't show up,
you three are in the clear.

15
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,368
Lucky you.

16
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,039
And what about my case?

17
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,667
Without aggravated manslaughter,

18
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,461
you're still on the hook
for death by auto.

19
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,755
But the State's case
is all circumstantial.

20
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,092
Trial will come down to a choice
between two narratives,

21
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,387
hero cop versus a prosecutor
playing the race card.

22
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,604
Teresa Tonelli's
on the prosecution's witness list.

23
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,272
Your wife's cousin?

24
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,192
Yeah.

25
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,197
In an ideal world,
she would say nothing...

26
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,616
about the truck...

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,620
or whatever transpired between
the two of you when she borrowed it.

28
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,457
That would be ideal.

29
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,212
So, what we need to do...

30
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,050
I need to see Pete alone.

31
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,887
Given the circumstances...

32
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,890
he might become my sole client.

33
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,393
So, we need some privacy.

34
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,900
You're in good hands.

35
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:41,411
- I want you to know, I got nothing to do...
- You want absolution?

36
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,746
Find a priest.

37
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,832
I don't fucking care.

38
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,377
All I care about is clearing a cop's name

39
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,700
so that people don't grab
for their fucking camera phones

40
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,423
every time they spot a badge.

41
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,931
Hey.

42
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,101
Osorio.

43
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,984
We're in the homestretch, okay?

44
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,029
We gotta keep the kid calm.

45
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,700
He gets nervous, makes a deal,
it all falls apart.

46
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,120
You gotta keep it together, all right?

47
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,372
I already did my part.

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,625
- Hey!
- Don't tell me what to do.

49
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,668
Crazy running into you kids here.

50
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,795
Yeah, funny.

51
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,089
My dentist is in this building.

52
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,800
Good guy, great drill work.
If y'all ever need a, root canal,

53
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,801
you let me know, okay?

54
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,762
Let's bounce.
Game's on, gonna miss the tip.

55
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,015
No, hold up, hold up. Um,
I need a little help finding a witness.

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,686
Fifteenyearold kid, junkie,
purple streak in her hair.

57
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,789
I know you know her.
Remember that picture I showed you?

58
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,483
Why don't you get a canine
search and rescue on it?

59
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,461
Wait, what am I talking about?
You got all those dogs,

60
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,696
so, why don't you give them
one of her panties to sniff?

61
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,906
Aah.

62
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,658
Nah, I'll let that one slide, D.

63
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,620
But when I find my witness, if she
tells me you so much as looked at her...

64
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,664
What are you gonna fucking do, Fish?

65
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,087
You lost your witness.

66
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,756
Don't come at me
'cause you're shit police.

67
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,719
Hey, Fish, you like birds?

68
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,389
See you guys later.

69
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:32,730
Perception will be key,
so I need you to sit together in court.

70
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,525
The jury will notice.
I hope that's not a problem.

71
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,025
It isn't.

72
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:42,156
Good. As Brenton's mother,
your testimony is so critical.

73
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,661
The jury needs to see your son
through your eyes.

74
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:50,290
Let them feel your love and your pain.

75
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,793
Half of them have children,
so if you feel emotional,

76
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,295
if you need to cry,

77
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,463
don't be afraid to let them see that.

78
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,759
The defense will come at you hard.

79
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,972
She'll claim Brenton was a gang member,
she'll paint you as a clueless parent.

80
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,224
But I know who my child is.

81
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,519
She'll mention the Port Authority arrest
last summer

82
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:15,189
since you were the one to pick Brenton up
and pay the DEDR penalty.

83
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,816
And that's why you needed that $500.

84
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,579
- Brenton...
- You said it was for the car.

85
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,170
Brenton begged me not to say anything...

86
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,864
- You should've told me!
- Mr. Butler, we need to focus.

87
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,035
We have just one day before trial.

88
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,078
We need to be on the same side.

89
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,842
We can't afford
to let the jury see this...

90
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,375
whatever this is going on
between you two.

91
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,377
You don't have to worry about me.

92
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,296
Okay.

93
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,759
We need to talk about Seth.
I know how much Brenton meant to him,

94
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,344
but his ties to the Five Kings
only hurt us.

95
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,598
So, the best thing that he can do
is stay away.

96
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,587
Marcelle's out with the kids.

97
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,005
I came to see you.

98
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,804
About the trial.

99
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,140
The prosecutor
doesn't want you to testify.

100
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,853
What with your Five Kings, your past.

101
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,313
Yeah, I figured as much.

102
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,399
Um...

103
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,986
She also doesn't want you
to be at the trial.

104
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,239
Said it won't look good.

105
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,578
Whatever it takes.

106
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,832
Whatever it takes
to get justice for little man.

107
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,626
- Okay.
- I won't make no trouble.

108
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,043
Good.

109
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,512
Going back already?

110
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,726
Thought all you wanted
was to be home again.

111
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,356
Home ain't here.

112
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,026
Not no more.

113
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,372
Respond to Lindenhurst
marshlands to assist other officers.

114
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,750
911 call received about female victim,
Caucasian,

115
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,377
14 to 18 years old.

116
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,920
EMT units en route.

117
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,543
Fish.

118
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,426
It's not her.
There's no purple in her hair.

119
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,513
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,396
That can't be her.

121
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,407
Fish!

122
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,580
The State's case
against three of my clients

123
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,625
rests entirely
on this witness's testimony.

124
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,044
I move to dismiss the charges
against them.

125
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,712
Counselor, any response to that?

126
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:11,384
My witness turns up dead
the day before trial.

127
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,011
That doesn't bother anyone?

128
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,224
She was a heroin addict who...

129
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,269
in my understanding, overdosed.

130
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,438
It's a tragedy, but not a crime.

131
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:29,819
Your Honor, if you dismiss,
without prejudice, please.

132
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,947
In case any further evidence
comes to light.

133
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,702
Preliminary rapid tox
came back positive for heroin.

134
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,038
That plus the needle mark
at the right interior forearm

135
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,915
with the discoloration around it.

136
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,919
Preliminary cause of death
looks like acute heroin toxicity.

137
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:51,007
Pending final tox results,
I'm gonna call MOD an accident.

138
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,926
You're saying she OD'd?

139
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,265
You're wrong. That's wrong.

140
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,767
Rinaldi.

141
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,851
Hey.

142
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,105
The kid's a junkie.
Come on, you said it yourself.

143
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,217
No.

144
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,222
No.

145
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,771
But she said she saw them.

146
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,357
She made a statement, didn't she?

147
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,859
- Why can't the jury know that?
- It's not admissible.

148
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,529
A defendant has a constitutional right
to confront an accuser in court.

149
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,282
What about Brenton's rights?

150
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:02,078
They weren't thinking about his rights
when they left him to die in that ditch.

151
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,496
We lost our son.

152
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,290
We lost everything.

153
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,796
And now you're telling me
he'll only get five years?

154
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,798
Without the conspiracy charges,

155
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,094
auto death carries a sentence
of five to ten years.

156
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,598
But as the defendant is a police officer,
he has certain protections.

157
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:32,942
In similar cases, I've never seen
a sentence of more than five years.

158
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,529
And it is likely
that he will serve less than that.

159
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,536
I will do everything in my power...

160
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,497
to ensure he serves more.

161
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,221
I'll do everything I can.

162
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,974
I promise. I...

163
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,435
Yeah.

164
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,273
Everybody promises.

165
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,278
You know, when I was growing up,
I always thought that...

166
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,697
I was different.

167
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,157
And I believed.

168
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,243
And I had faith.

169
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,080
So, you're always thinking
you're protected, you know,

170
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,582
nothing's gonna touch me.

171
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,836
Nothing gonna touch my family.

172
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,466
And then something happens.

173
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,259
And then you realize.

174
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,387
Because it ain't just happening to me.

175
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,599
It ain't just happen to my son.

176
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,561
It's happening to black boys all over.

177
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:55,274
I'll do everything in my power
to ensure he serves more than that.

178
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,943
He will pay for what he did.

179
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,612
Really?

180
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,244
A hate crime?

181
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,122
And what does that mean?

182
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:14,793
The assistant prosecutor is alleging
that you left Brenton Butler for dead

183
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,961
because of his race.

184
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,881
He didn't know his race,
he didn't even see him.

185
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,801
If she can prove it's a hate crime,
and you're convicted of auto death,

186
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,429
your sentence will be enhanced,
substantially.

187
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,473
And what are we talking?

188
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,183
Auto death is five to ten years.

189
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,771
With this particular enhancement,
you're looking at 20 to 30 years.

190
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,898
Jesus Christ.

191
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:42,404
She'll go after character, your history,
any sort of racial bias in your past.

192
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,659
Let's get to work.
We don't have a lot of time.

193
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,410
Can you put coffee on?

194
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,538
I take mine black.

195
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,920
Marie.

196
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,059
I want you in court tomorrow
with that baby.

197
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,470
Every day, bring that baby. Understood?

198
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:13,936
Killer!

199
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,419
All rise.

200
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,797
The honorable Judge Robert Dolan
presiding.

201
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,433
Case Number 8244032017,

202
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,519
the State of New Jersey
v. Peter Jablonski.

203
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,522
Is the State ready to give
its opening statements, Ms. Harper?

204
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,607
Yes, Your Honor.

205
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,575
This case is clear and simple.

206
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:15,122
On the morning of February 15, 2017,

207
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,167
as he drove through Liberty Park,

208
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,128
Officer Peter Jablonski...

209
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,298
hit 15yearold Brenton Butler...

210
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,176
and fled the scene of his crime.

211
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,387
Cell records place Officer Jablonski
in the park,

212
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,516
and blue paint chips
recovered from Brenton's body

213
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,937
match the blue Ford Escape
registered to the defendant's wife,

214
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,064
a car which is now mysteriously missing.

215
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,691
After he hit Brenton,

216
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:47,655
Officer Jablonski did not stop
and render aid,

217
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:51,033
as was his duty as an officer of the law.

218
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,994
Instead, he made the heartless calculation

219
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,332
that this young black boy's life
mattered less than his own future.

220
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,461
And he left Brenton in that ditch

221
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,965
as a blizzard blanketed this city.

222
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,343
Brenton lay there for 12 hours.

223
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,263
But it took Officer Jablonski
only a moment,

224
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,057
a few seconds maybe,

225
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,352
to deny a boy his life

226
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,814
and ruin the lives
of everyone who loved him.

227
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,777
The reason the State
has characterized this as a hate crime

228
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,571
is that when Officer Jablonski
made that decision,

229
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,576
he acted under the biased belief
that this young black child's life

230
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,995
was disposable.

231
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,916
As we will demonstrate from his record
and his personal history,

232
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,839
Officer Jablonski's prejudices led him
to believe that no one would care enough

233
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,299
to properly investigate Brenton's death.

234
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:54,013
And no one would be willing
to convict him for killing this child.

235
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,434
You have the power to prove him wrong.

236
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:17,369
The State would like you to believe
its case is simple and straightforward.

237
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:23,459
If they believe it's simple,
it's because their facts are slight.

238
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,062
If they tell you it's straightforward,

239
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,297
that's because they don't want you
to notice the holes.

240
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,051
They have built a circumstantial case

241
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:36,138
selectively assembled
to cast guilt on my client,

242
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,059
a young officer with a new family,

243
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,560
a stellar record,

244
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,979
and a profound sense of integrity.

245
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,567
The only reason the State
can tie him to that park at all

246
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,986
is because he was doing his job.

247
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:55,532
Someone hit Brenton Butler,
and it is a tragedy.

248
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:01,330
But this was in all likelihood
a gangrelated death,

249
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,207
not a hate crime.

250
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:07,461
The very fact that the State
has brought this charge at all

251
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:11,548
tells you that this trial
is a politically motivated stunt

252
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,926
designed to placate a city

253
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,221
that has been torn apart
by the death of this young boy.

254
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:23,102
Yes, race is a painful issue
in this country.

255
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:28,982
And yes, prejudice and bias
are despicable realities.

256
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:34,196
But the law is blind to all but the facts,
and so must you be.

257
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,874
You may proceed, Counselor.

258
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,463
The State would like to call to the stand
Sergeant Michael DiAngelo.

259
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,620
Swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

260
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,688
- so help you God?
- I do.

261
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,157
Can you state your name and rank
for the record?

262
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,451
Michael DiAngelo.
Sergeant, Special Investigations,

263
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,453
AntiGang and Drug Unit,

264
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,330
Jersey City Police Department.

265
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,667
And what exactly does your job entail?

266
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,045
I investigate the possession
and distribution of narcotics

267
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:36,466
and the criminal street gangs
associated with the city's drug trade.

268
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,095
And do you arrest these criminals
or do you just investigate them?

269
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,764
Objection. Your Honor,
she's badgering her own witness.

270
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,391
Ms. Harper, keep to the point.

271
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:54,610
I'd like to mark this report
dated February 15th, 2017 as Exhibit S1.

272
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:59,323
It says you and Officer Wilcox
were executing a controlled buy

273
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:03,202
at the Riverside Projects
on the morning of February 15th

274
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,205
from approximately
6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.

275
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,289
Is that correct?

276
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,458
- If that's what I wrote.
- It is.

277
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,881
Officer Jablonski wasn't present?
Or Officer Osorio?

278
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,174
They were both there.

279
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,802
Jablonski wasn't an official member
of my team yet,

280
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,472
and Osorio I left off by mistake.

281
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,563
Can the clerk please mark tower records

282
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,191
from American Telephone and Telegraph,

283
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,738
tower NJ148NJC as Exhibit S2.

284
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,698
Sergeant, according to these records,

285
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,451
at the times indicated in your report,

286
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,079
your cell phone made several calls...

287
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,373
from a tower serving Liberty Park,

288
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:53,335
placing you either within the park
or very close to its boundary.

289
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,255
Well, most arrests don't happen
at an exact address.

290
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,173
They happen in the general vicinity.

291
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,510
Criminals tend to...
They... They move around.

292
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:07,975
Your phone placed a sixminute call
to Officer Jablonski's phone at 6:45 a.m.

293
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,936
According to Bayonne Hospital
security footage,

294
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:15,190
Officer Jablonski didn't arrive
until 7:33 a.m.

295
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,860
Can you account for his whereabouts
during those 42 minutes?

296
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,320
Me personally? No.

297
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,157
From the location
you were actually at to Bayonne Hospital

298
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,077
is routinely a 15minute drive
at 7:00 a.m.

299
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,831
- If you say so.
- Google Maps says so.

300
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,628
That leaves 27 minutes
you can't account for.

301
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,090
Twentyseven minutes
during which Officer Jablonski

302
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,426
could have been driving
through Liberty Park.

303
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,514
- That's possible, I suppose.
- It is.

304
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:51,560
And isn't it also possible
that during that 27 minutes.

305
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:55,480
Officer Jablonski hit Brenton Butler
and drove away?

306
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,564
No.

307
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,526
Petey did not kill that kid.

308
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,279
But you can't know that, Sergeant.

309
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,657
Well, unless you were there
in the park with him.

310
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,492
Can you?

311
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:20,464
I understand today in court is not
your first encounter with Ms. Harper.

312
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,676
My unit interacts with prosecutors a lot.

313
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,721
I've met Ms. Harper before.

314
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:32,017
Can you tell me about your interaction
with Ms. Harper on March 8th?

315
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:38,231
She didn't agree with my tactics
in an investigation.

316
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,984
She...
She called me a "son of a bitch."

317
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,237
- So, clearly, she has an ax to grind.
- Objection! Relevance.

318
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,947
Well, it goes to motivation.

319
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,784
Prosecutor's bias led to these charges.

320
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,993
Sustained.

321
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,746
How the AP does her job
is not on trial here.

322
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,706
Sergeant, in your experience,

323
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,000
is Liberty Park associated
with gangs and drugs?

324
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,001
It is.

325
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:02,798
In your expert opinion, could a teenager
left for dead in that park

326
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:06,802
have been the victim of gang retaliation
made to look like a hitandrun?

327
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,137
I'd say that is definitely possible.

328
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,640
Thank you, Sergeant. No further questions.

329
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,937
Officer Osorio,
are you a native Spanish speaker?

330
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,191
Yeah.

331
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,735
And have you ever personally felt
singled out on the job

332
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,819
when you spoke Spanish?

333
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,574
- We don't see color, we see blue.
- That's department policy, isn't it?

334
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,828
Not to discriminate
based on race or creed?

335
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,414
Yeah. You know that.

336
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,334
Have any of your coworkers
in the Jersey City Police Department

337
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,002
ever used racial epithets?

338
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,176
- No.
- Really?

339
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,387
Objection.
Your Honor, the State is fishing.

340
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,431
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish
a culture of racial attitudes

341
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,451
that may have affected
the defendant's state of mind.

342
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:59,938
I'll allow it, but get to the point
with the next question, Counselor.

343
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,190
In Officer Jablonski's arrest record,

344
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:06,194
both while in your unit
and in the East District,

345
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,241
there are disproportionate arrests
of individuals of color.

346
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,952
As a Puerto Rican officer,

347
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,664
are you really telling me
that race doesn't matter?

348
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,504
Not in my experience.

349
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,424
Are you lying to protect
your fellow officer?

350
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,758
Objection! Your Honor.

351
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,136
Apologies, Your Honor.

352
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,598
That's all I have.

353
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,811
Can you state your name, please?

354
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,397
Peter Matthew Jablonski.

355
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,775
And what is your relationship
to the defendant?

356
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,860
I'm his father.

357
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,780
I understand you
and Mr. Jablonski's mother separated

358
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,157
when he was a child.

359
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,285
Were you involved at all
in his upbringing?

360
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,088
Well, just because she and I
called it quits

361
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,015
doesn't mean I was gonna leave him
in the lurch.

362
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,624
I had him weekends, some weekends,

363
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:04,753
and, you know, I tried to teach him stuff
that I learned the hard way,

364
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,046
so he didn't have to.

365
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:11,218
Were you with him during the incident
that occurred on July 30th, 2004?

366
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,512
Yeah, I was there.

367
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:21,686
I'd like to mark Exhibits S4A and S4B
at this time.

368
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,521
Proceed.

369
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,963
- Can you tell us what happened?
- Sure.

370
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,800
Petey was kind of a runt in high school,
and this...

371
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,803
corner kid was always picking on him.

372
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:58,014
One time Pete saved up
for some Jordans,

373
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,726
and sure enough,
that little thug jumped him. Stole them.

374
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,104
Now I don't know about you,
but no son of mine's

375
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:08,358
gonna leave a beating unanswered,
so I showed him a couple of moves,

376
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,069
and then I marched him
right on down back there.

377
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,113
Petey destroyed that kid.

378
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,116
Taught that animal a lesson.

379
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,619
And do you think this incident
might have left your son

380
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,663
with any reason for racial animus?

381
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,545
Yeah, okay. You're black, I'm white,
bottom line. I got eyes.

382
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,755
You know, the trouble comes when...

383
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,300
When we pretend like people
aren't who they are.

384
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,097
No further questions, Your Honor.

385
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:57,198
Isn't it true you haven't spoken
to your son since he was 18?

386
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,577
That is until February 23rd,

387
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,121
when he continued to insist
on no contact.

388
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,206
That sounds like his mother talking.

389
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,208
Would it have anything to do
with the abuse

390
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,210
he and his mother suffered at your hands?

391
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,970
Your Honor, I'd like to mark
this Jersey City Hospital report

392
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:23,558
from August 28th, 1995 Exhibit D1.

393
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,404
Broken arm.

394
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,908
Dislocated shoulder.

395
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,786
Two broken ribs,

396
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:47,791
extensive bruising on arms,
back, neck, and face.

397
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,752
How old was your son
when you did this to him?

398
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,422
I don't remember exactly.
This was an accident.

399
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,676
He was six, Mr. Jablonski.

400
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,179
Your son was six years old.

401
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,403
You okay?

402
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,199
Osorio looked like shit up there.

403
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,868
You talk to him lately?

404
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,955
I figure we'll give him some space.

405
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,125
He'll talk when he's ready. All right?

406
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,501
- All right.
- Okay.

407
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,837
- Ms. Harper, can we get a statement?
- Ms. Harper!

408
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,966
Is Officer's Jablonski's alleged crime
part of a larger culture at the JCPD?

409
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:43,054
One can't help but wonder why
an officer of the law like Mr. Jablonski

410
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,807
chose to leave a young black child
to die in a ditch.

411
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,016
You fucked up.

412
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,137
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, Fish.

413
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,647
Medical examiner said she shot up.
She didn't use needles.

414
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,524
Okay.

415
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,569
A heroin junkie who's health conscious,
that's nice.

416
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,029
- Hey!
- You fucked up, motherfucker!

417
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
Yeah, you did!

418
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,492
I fucking got you, you piece of shit!

419
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,411
Got nothing, motherfucker.
You got nothing!

420
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,706
Get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off.

421
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,460
Ms. Harper, what do you think of that?

422
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,264
Hey.

423
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,475
Welcome...

424
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,103
to my home.

425
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,942
I talked to Connelly.

426
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,155
He's gonna make sure
you only get yelled at.

427
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,740
A little.

428
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:51,790
I'm sorry.

429
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,291
Do not apologize.

430
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,335
He deserved it.

431
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,175
God.

432
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,812
We can still get them.

433
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,189
If I can flip Jablonski, then...

434
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,624
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

435
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:38,795
Support our cops!
Support our cops!

436
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,053
They subpoenaed me.
Said I had to be here.

437
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,264
Whatever you say up there, don't hurt us.

438
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,015
Are you asking me to lie?

439
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,018
Better take care of your girl.

440
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,615
You got it?

441
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,451
Come on.

442
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,872
Look at this guy?

443
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,332
What's going on with this hat?

444
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,876
What's going on with the hat?

445
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,461
Know what I mean?
What's this? What is this?

446
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,132
Tell me about the seagulls.

447
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,427
Brenton loved them.

448
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,638
I don't know how it started,

449
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:34,017
but they were everywhere. On...

450
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,145
napkins, notebooks,

451
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,690
the wall in his bedroom.

452
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:45,570
And he would make
these little papiermâché ones too.

453
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,281
He gave those to the people he loved.

454
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:53,494
And you found one of those papiermâché
seagulls in Brenton's hospital room

455
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,913
after the accident?

456
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,415
Yes, on his bed.

457
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,418
Someone had put it there.

458
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,255
That man.

459
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,052
How do you know that?

460
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,554
Because I saw him the night before
in Brenton's room.

461
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,683
I went to pray with my husband
and our church.

462
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,436
And when I came back, he was there,

463
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,688
standing over Brenton.

464
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,900
He asked me if...

465
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,195
if he was gonna live.

466
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:34,661
And then he claimed
he was in the wrong room and ran out.

467
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,040
I'd like to present these photos,

468
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,834
previously marked as Exhibits S5A

469
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,377
and S5B.

470
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,888
This is the seagull from Brenton's bike.

471
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,567
Is that the seagull that you recovered
from Brenton's room

472
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,444
after your encounter with the defendant?

473
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,030
Yes, it is.

474
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,533
Mrs. Butler, why do you think

475
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:17,829
that Officer Jablonski would remove
evidence from the crime scene,

476
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,040
and then leave it
in the hospital room of the victim?

477
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,084
Because he felt guilty.

478
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,462
He knew what he did to my son.

479
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,257
He knew...

480
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,844
He knew.

481
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,511
Thank you.

482
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,639
No further questions.

483
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:59,871
Mrs. Butler, please let me convey
my deepest sympathy for your loss.

484
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,290
I know this must be very hard for you.

485
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,793
It's never hard to talk about my son.

486
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:10,631
And I understand you must have
wanted answers after this tragedy.

487
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,883
Who did this?

488
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:15,011
Why was Brenton in that park
that morning?

489
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:18,139
Objection!
Is there a question for the witness?

490
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,766
I'll rephrase.

491
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,143
You were searching for answers,
Mrs. Butler.

492
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,937
Is that why you followed my client?

493
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,148
Why you waited outside of his house?

494
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,984
I knew he knew something.

495
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,278
How many times did you go to his house?

496
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:39,118
- I don't remember exactly.
- More than twice?

497
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,246
- Three, four times maybe?
- Maybe.

498
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,665
Does that include the time
you accosted him

499
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,501
at the Greenplace Market in Bayonne?

500
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,169
He was avoiding me.

501
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,800
This is what I'm struggling to understand,
Mrs. Butler.

502
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:58,930
My client could have brought that seagull
out of sympathy, no?

503
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,433
Why did you assume
it meant he killed your son?

504
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,893
I didn't at first.

505
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,395
Is it possible you had answers,

506
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,066
Mrs. Butler, just not the ones you wanted?

507
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:16,781
- I don't understand the question.
- Let me give you a concrete example.

508
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:22,662
Why did you pick up Brenton
at Port Authority on August 4th, 2016?

509
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,831
- Objection!
- Overruled.

510
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,833
The issue has already been decided.

511
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,710
Answer the question.

512
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,299
He had been arrested.

513
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,675
Right.

514
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,054
In the company of Kadeuce Porter,

515
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,641
for criminal possession of narcotics
with the intent to distribute.

516
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,393
It was two joints.

517
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,145
I worked at St. Peter's school.

518
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,773
Half those kids had ten times that amount
in their locker.

519
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,257
How many of them have been arrested

520
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,861
with a known member
of the largest street gang in Jersey...

521
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,445
Brenton wasn't in a gang.

522
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,031
- How can you be so sure?
- Because I'm his mother.

523
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:04,287
Isn't it possible he might have kept
his gang affiliation from you

524
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,414
precisely because you're his mother?

525
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,498
No!

526
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,084
I know my son.

527
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,420
I would've known.

528
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:16,507
Do you know why he was in Liberty Park
that morning?

529
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,099
No.

530
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,947
Are you still employed
at St. Peter's Prep?

531
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,034
Not currently.

532
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,537
I understand it's been hard
since Brenton's death.

533
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,915
You and your husband both lost your jobs.

534
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,168
You have a mortgage on a new house.

535
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,002
What...

536
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,547
What does this have to do with Brenton?

537
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,925
Have you ever met Jay Sterling?

538
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,343
Yes.

539
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,803
Jay's an accomplished civil litigator.

540
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,932
He has a lot of experience
with wrongful death suits

541
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,475
against municipalities.

542
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,935
Is that why you sought him?

543
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:14,023
No, he... he... he said that he could help
get justice for Brenton.

544
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,609
You mean with a civil suit.

545
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,612
- No.
- That's how it works, right?

546
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,823
You get a criminal conviction

547
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,160
and the city almost guarantees you
a generous offer.

548
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:30,081
It wasn't about the money,
it was about making him tell the truth.

549
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,165
Of course.

550
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,584
But the money would help.

551
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,007
No further questions, Your Honor.

552
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,767
I failed him.

553
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,188
I failed Brenton.

554
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,899
You showed them who Brenton was.

555
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:00,861
- And the jury won't forget that.
- No. The money.

556
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,322
That's all they'll remember is the money.

557
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,326
It's like they killed Brenton
all over again.

558
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,622
I need to testify.

559
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,712
Mr. Butler, she's gonna try
and do the exact same thing to you,

560
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,880
- and if you waver at all...
- I won't.

561
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,843
I won't.

562
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,893
Why did you move, Mr. Butler?

563
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,062
Grew up all my life
in those projects.

564
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,772
I promised myself one thing:

565
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,693
When I had a family, I was gonna get them
out of there as soon as I could.

566
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,739
So you saved up for this house?

567
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,075
Took me near on ten years. But yes, I did.

568
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:54,540
And I don't need any settlement
from the city to pay my mortgage.

569
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,500
I pay my own bills, always have.

570
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:04,425
And was part of the reason you moved
to get Brenton out of the projects?

571
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,508
Yes.

572
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,888
When a boy reaches a certain age,

573
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,184
the world has a way of asserting itself.

574
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,561
I don't want that for Brenton.

575
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,522
He wasn't built for that.
He was different.

576
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:22,026
Mr. Butler, did you see any evidence

577
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:26,072
that Brenton was involved in gang activity
of any kind?

578
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,325
No. He was not in a gang.

579
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,370
And that bike he was on,
the one the Kings ride?

580
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,663
It wasn't his.

581
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,128
You mean the bike Brenton was riding
when he was hit?

582
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,046
Yeah.

583
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,507
A friend loaned it to him.

584
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,472
And what makes you so certain
that your son wasn't in the Five Kings?

585
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,392
When you're a King, you gotta front,

586
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,727
act hard,

587
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,897
be ready to throw down at any time.

588
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,692
My son wasn't hard.

589
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,530
He was kind and good.

590
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,448
Sweet.

591
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,536
Still wore the clothes
his mama bought for him.

592
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,920
No further questions, Your Honor.

593
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,137
Whose bike was it, Mr. Butler?

594
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,472
It was his friend, Kadeuce Porter.

595
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,934
The same Kadeuce Porter
that Brenton was arrested with?

596
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,810
Yes.

597
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,939
Isn't it possible, or even likely,

598
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,983
that Kadeuce loaned Brenton that bike,

599
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,527
that expensive, highstatus bike,

600
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,613
because Brenton was, in fact,
a member of the Five Kings?

601
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,241
No, I asked Kadeuce.
He said the bike was his.

602
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,827
You believe a known gang member?

603
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,746
I believe a boy I've known
since he was a child.

604
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,791
Do you have any family members
who were involved with the Kings?

605
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,882
Your youngest brother, Seth.

606
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,301
He was a known member.

607
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,178
Isn't that true?

608
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,471
Seth got out,

609
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,849
enlisted in the Air Force,
served his country.

610
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:19,143
He never would've involved Brenton
in any of that.

611
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:22,104
Still, with so many
gang members in his life,

612
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:26,150
you must've been afraid
that he'd get caught up in that world.

613
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,404
Can you tell me about an incident
involving Social Services

614
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,573
from September 2016?

615
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:44,543
Apparently, Brenton went to class
with a mark across his calves.

616
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,587
I, um...

617
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,422
I had disciplined him with a belt.

618
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,218
He hadn't come home that night.

619
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,430
And I used the belt just that one time,
never again.

620
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,435
My son was an upstanding young man.

621
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:06,524
And yet, the teacher called
Social Services.

622
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:10,444
- She was that alarmed by the bruising.
- Objection, hearsay.

623
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,364
Your Honor, I'd like to submit
these records

624
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,282
from Child Protective Services

625
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:19,119
dated September 5th, 2016,

626
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,121
Exhibit D2.

627
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,385
Mr. Butler, you were scared,

628
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,138
because you didn't know
where Brenton had been that night.

629
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,182
Is that correct?

630
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:42,934
Yes.

631
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:48,732
And you don't know if Kadeuce
had recruited him into the Kings.

632
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,192
He didn't belong...

633
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:54,071
And you don't know
why he was in Liberty Park that morning.

634
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,406
I do know why.

635
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,244
He was cutting through the park
to go to school.

636
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,620
"Cutting through"?

637
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:05,165
That park is halfway across the city
from his home, his school.

638
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,502
Why would he bike there to get to school?

639
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,006
No further questions.

640
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,466
He was with another boy.

641
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,801
Speak up, Mr. Butler.

642
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,768
He was with another boy.

643
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,318
He spent that night with him.

644
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:39,241
And then Brenton went on to school
that morning after.

645
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,663
And that boy...

646
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,126
he was my son's...

647
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,839
friend.

648
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:04,099
I'd like to move that last statement
be stricken from the record.

649
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,477
- Your Honor, on what grounds?
- Hearsay.

650
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,063
The witness will say anything
to protect his son.

651
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,731
She can't just assume that he's lying!

652
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,149
Sustained.

653
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,401
Counselor, tone.

654
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,784
That portion of the testimony
will be stricken from the record and...

655
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,035
Your Honor.

656
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,579
I know who the boyfriend is.

657
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,374
I'd like to add him as a witness,

658
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,251
and I request that he be allowed
to testify in camera

659
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,045
to protect his identity.

660
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,224
Thank you, Officers.

661
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,395
Young man, please have a seat over here.

662
00:44:57,694 --> 00:45:00,030
I want a lawyer. I know my rights.

663
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,395
You don't need a lawyer.
You're being called as a witness.

664
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,449
About what?

665
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,787
And this court can compel you to testify.

666
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:11,291
Testimony was given today about
your relationship with Brenton Butler.

667
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,960
Look, Brenton wasn't no King.

668
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,420
- So can I go now?
- No.

669
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,422
That's not what we're asking.

670
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,299
Counselor, your witness.

671
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,431
- Kadeuce, I know this is hard.
- You do?

672
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,475
You know how it look,
cops pulling up on the corner,

673
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,852
bringing me in here?

674
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,979
Your testimony will be sealed.

675
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:38,652
What we need to know is the nature
of your relationship with Brenton.

676
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:39,945
My relationship?

677
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:49,788
What was the exact nature
of your relationship with Brenton Butler?

678
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,875
I don't know what you talking about.

679
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,961
I know this is difficult,
but please, if you can tell us...

680
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:59,673
- Objection. He's already given his answer.
- Who the fuck is she?

681
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:02,342
You will watch your language
in my presence, young man.

682
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,845
Your Honor, this is a delicate matter.

683
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,598
Some leeway, please.

684
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,516
Overruled.

685
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:11,685
For the moment.

686
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,270
Mr. Butler claims...

687
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,107
you told him that you know
where Brenton was

688
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,692
the night before the accident.

689
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,528
Can you tell us?

690
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,157
And also, who he was with, if anyone?

691
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:46,928
Brenton...

692
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,017
he and me...

693
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,233
were together that night.

694
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:11,662
I ain't never had no home
where I felt like I belonged.

695
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,750
Like I wasn't a burden on folks.

696
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,131
I was a burden on everybody.

697
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,929
But not to Brenton.

698
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:36,603
Not to him.

699
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,035
Mr. Butler's testimony
will remain in the record

700
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,537
and the court will provide the jury

701
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,165
with transcripts of supporting testimony
given in camera,

702
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,376
which will otherwise remain sealed.

703
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,129
We've accomplished enough for one day.

704
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,381
Court is adjourned until 10:00 a.m.

705
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,425
This way.

706
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,904
You had a good day today. Congratulations.

707
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,575
You should celebrate, have a drink.

708
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,469
Thank you.

709
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,683
- I did it for Brenton.
- I know.

710
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:01,188
But if you ever need a place to lie low,
come see me, you understand?

711
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,900
I got a lot more room these days.

712
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,861
I been surviving this place my whole life.

713
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,781
I ain't need nothing from you then,

714
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,658
and I don't need it now.

715
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,799
What you looking at?

716
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,510
Go back to work.

717
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:41,728
I do so solemnly swear
that I will support and defend...

718
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:45,023
I do solemnly swear
that I will support and defend...

719
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,150
The Constitution
of the United States...

720
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,277
The Constitution
of the United States...

721
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:52,322
Against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

722
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,283
Against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

723
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,911
Congratulations.
You made a great decision.

724
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:21,017
Marcelle told me
that you wouldn't even let her come,

725
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:26,273
and I said there's no way I was gonna
let you ship off without saying bye.

726
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,817
No, I already put y'all through it once,
so...

727
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,291
Figured you didn't need a repeat of that.

728
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,780
Are you sure about this?

729
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,534
I ain't got nowhere else to go.

730
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,289
Come home.

731
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:47,127
Least over there,
I know who the enemy's supposed to be.

732
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,880
That gun that I got from Vontrell
to kill Jablonski?

733
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,923
It was greenlit by another cop.

734
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,675
His higherup.

735
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,217
Di...

736
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,719
DiAngelo.

737
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:02,851
These motherfuckers are making bank
off our people's blood.

738
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,521
I should have never put that on you.

739
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,194
- I gotta go.
- Please, Seth.

740
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,154
- I...
- Stay.

741
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,989
- Tricey.
- Stay for me.

742
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,867
Stay for your brother. Please.

743
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,661
I gotta go.

744
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:33,965
Bye, Trice.

745
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,092
Bye, Tricey.

746
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,309
Petey.

747
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,187
Petey.

748
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,106
There's someone out back.

749
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,130
Fuck.

750
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:23,974
Can't sleep.

751
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,854
You too?

752
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,815
No, what are you doing here?

753
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,989
Worst part about this shit
is you can't talk to nobody.

754
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,158
Who'd understand?

755
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:48,039
Please, Petey, tell me.
You gotta tell me the truth.

756
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:51,376
Did you see that kid
before you killed him?

757
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,005
You ever hear him...

758
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:58,799
in your head?

759
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,851
It was an accident.

760
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,605
And whatever you did...

761
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,356
was not the same.

762
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,984
No, not even close.

763
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,008
How do you sleep?

764
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:44,887
I can't.

765
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,974
I can't sleep.

766
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,385
What are you doing in my house?

767
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,179
Get out.

768
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,348
I ain't gonna hurt you.

769
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:32,936
This shit's gonna end, T.
Where you gonna be at?

770
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:34,729
Think about it.

771
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,358
Your cousin, me, all gone.

772
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,695
If you get on that stand
and testify against family...

773
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,154
He's not my family.

774
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:45,781
Okay.

775
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,160
What about your kid?

776
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,591
Is the baby mine?

777
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,939
You Catholics and your rhythm method,

778
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,441
Stay away from me.

779
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:22,235
Come on, T, I ain't gonna hurt
the mother of my child.

780
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,740
Come on.

781
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,791
How could he leave him out there to die?

782
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,753
He didn't.

783
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,715
He thought the kid was dead.

784
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,511
Petey's a good guy, okay?

785
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,765
You and me, we got our differences
with him, but he's family.

786
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,559
And you gotta accept family.

787
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:00,065
Severe hypothermia,
cardiac arrhythmia, massive blood loss.

788
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,358
And a concave fracture to his skull.

789
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,528
I immediately moved Mr. Butler
to an operating room

790
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,323
to more safely assess the injuries
to his head.

791
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,034
How severe were Brenton's injuries?

792
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,202
Severe.

793
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,121
I had to cut away his jacket and hood.

794
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:19,626
The hood itself was tightly cinched,
and therefore...

795
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,253
keeping parts of his skull intact,

796
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:25,465
I had to be careful
not to displace the fragments.

797
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,548
Why is that?

798
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,929
If I had just removed the hood,
skull shards would've dug into the brain

799
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,430
and caused further damage.

800
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:36,434
Despite all this,
you testified before the grand jury

801
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,729
that Brenton could've lived
had he been found earlier.

802
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:44,234
Yes, but ultimately the damage
due to blood loss was too great.

803
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,319
It caused organ failure,

804
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:49,864
necrotizing tissue,
and further brain damage.

805
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,075
His body just gave out.

806
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,873
No more questions, Your Honor.

807
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,296
Does the defense wish to cross?

808
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,173
No, Your Honor.

809
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:13,930
Brenton's injuries were consistent
with impact from an SUV

810
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,850
weighing approximately 4,100 pounds,

811
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,310
traveling at no less
than 60 miles per hour.

812
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:24,399
Does the 2014 Ford Escape
registered to Marie Jablonski,

813
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,776
Officer Peter Jablonski's wife,

814
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,611
match the vehicle that hit Brenton?

815
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,695
Yes.

816
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,407
And is the match, and make, and model

817
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,994
the only thing that links
the Jablonski's car to the accident?

818
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:38,621
No, we recovered paint chips
from the victim's hair.

819
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,249
We conducted a type match analysis

820
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:45,753
and confirmed it was OF4D92, Yale Blue.

821
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,673
What color was the defendant's car,
according to purchase records?

822
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:51,718
OF4D92, Yale Blue.

823
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,637
Your Honor, objection.
This is all speculation.

824
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:58,016
I'll allow Ms. Harper
to continue her line of questioning.

825
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:02,228
Now, an SUV driver sits high
above the undercarriage.

826
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,982
Is it possible
Officer Jablonski hit Brenton

827
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,859
without realizing
that he was a human being?

828
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:11,738
Brenton was moving perpendicular
to the defendant's direction of motion.

829
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:15,909
And on a bike, the driver should have had
a clear profile of the victim.

830
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,786
If I were Brenton,

831
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:24,000
the driver would've seen me
cross his field of vision, like this,

832
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,002
as he hit me with his car.

833
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:28,129
- Is that a fair assessment?
- It is.

834
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:33,384
So Officer Jablonski
had every reason to stop after impact

835
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:37,430
and no reason to doubt
that he hit a young black boy.

836
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,598
None whatsoever.

837
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:42,060
No further questions, Your Honor.

838
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:54,697
Is it unusual such a small amount of paint
was recovered from Brenton's body

839
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,950
- and none was found on the bike?
- Not really.

840
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,411
Since Brenton was washed in the ER,
we were lucky to recover anything.

841
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,914
As for the bike, you might expect
to see more paint,

842
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,083
but that depends
on where the car made impact.

843
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:09,963
But absent finding the car
that hit Brenton,

844
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:13,007
you can't definitively link any vehicle
to Brenton's death?

845
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:16,928
No, not definitively.
However, the paint is a match

846
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:19,681
for the factory job
on the defendant's car.

847
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:22,058
That's as good a match as you'll get.

848
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:28,147
Your Honor, I'm trying to understand
this moment of impact.

849
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:32,819
I'd like to use Exhibit S8
for demonstrative purposes.

850
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:33,778
I'll allow it.

851
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,406
You said that Brenton
crossed perpendicular

852
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,116
to the driver's line of sight.

853
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:41,077
Are you confident in that assessment?

854
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,287
Yes, I am.

855
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,331
So...

856
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:50,003
imagining that you're the driver,

857
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,798
this is approximately what you would see
through the windshield?

858
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,133
That's correct.

859
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:09,188
If you recall, the surgeon testified

860
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:13,443
that Brenton's hood was cinched
tightly around his face.

861
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,361
She had to cut it off.

862
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,991
Can you tell the race of the rider now?

863
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:22,076
I can't see his face.

864
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:31,586
I'd like the members of the jury
to imagine that they are the driver.

865
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,717
Can you see this person's face?

866
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:43,222
And remember, your line of vision
is not obstructed by a windshield,

867
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,891
or the falling snow,

868
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,976
and you're not going 60 miles an hour.

869
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:04,869
How can an accident be a hate crime...

870
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,456
if you can't tell the race of the victim?

871
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,460
My client did not hit this young man,

872
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:16,756
but regardless, whoever did
did not commit a hate crime.

873
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:23,096
No further questions, Your Honor.

874
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,062
Ms. Harper. Redirect?

875
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,694
Given this witness's testimony,

876
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:41,114
I move to vacate the hate crime charges
against my client.

877
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,370
Order in the court!

878
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,707
Order!

1
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,855
- Ms. Harper!
- KJ! Can we get a comment?

2
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,524
Look this way, please!

3
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,070
- Right here!
- Ms. Harper!

4
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,365
Ms. Harper!

5
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,511
Yeah! All right, baby!

6
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,096
You're almost there. Almost there.

7
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,516
- Almost out of the woods, baby.
- I told you we'd get past this.

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,394
Three down, one to go.
Fuck that prosecutor.

9
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,356
And that's thanks to you.
You and your brass fucking balls.

10
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,362
We need to make a statement,
press our advantage.

11
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,823
Stand behind me, keep your mouth shut.

12
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,579
It is over.

13
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,293
Let's go.

14
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,005
My client is a victim
of a hatefueled campaign

15
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,591
by a racebaiting zealot of a prosecutor.

16
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,676
Ms. Harper is making a name for herself,

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,972
but police officers who risk their lives
every day for us are paying the price.

18
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,658
Officer Jablonski,
a number of your colleagues

19
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,893
have been calling in sick,
not reporting for duty,

20
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,062
and now the city's facing
a surge of violent crime.

21
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,273
As far as what's going to stop
the unrest, who knows?

22
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,484
The governor calling in
the National Guard?

23
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,693
Another dead cop?

24
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,114
There were 64 police officers killed
in the line of duty this past year.

25
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,491
Well, our son was murdered this year.

26
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,536
Along with too many black boys
to even count. So you do that math.

27
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,664
- Okay, thank you for your time.
- Well, where's your outrage for them?

28
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,083
Where's the outrage for my son?

29
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,836
What if it was your child?

30
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,712
Where are our children in all of this?

31
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,673
Mrs. Butler, how can this be a hate crime

32
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,967
if the officer didn't know
your son was black?

33
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,928
We're simple people, we don't have money
for fancy lawyers like you.

34
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,851
- But we work hard.
- Was your son in a gang...

35
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,932
We live life right,
we just want what's fair.

36
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,060
We deserve justice!

37
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,229
Our son deserves justice!

38
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,357
In a surprising development today

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,817
in the Brenton Butler trial,

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,111
Prosecutor KJ Harper's mistake in court

41
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,904
may have cost her the case.

42
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,656
It was a stunning mistake

43
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,408
for her to make in the courtroom.

44
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,702
And as you can see,
the response from the public,

45
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,746
as in the courtroom,
has really been quite dramatic.

46
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,749
Get up!

47
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,960
We got work to do!

48
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,295
I know you've got a "Fuck off" in there,
so let it out now, save some time.

49
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,338
Gonna make coffee.

50
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,008
I'm out of coffee.

51
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:59,012
- I want to watch TV.
- I fucked up.

52
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,431
I let that kid die. Now get up.

53
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,433
- I can't.
- You do it.

54
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,767
God!

55
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,230
Pull yourself together. Come on. Jesus!

56
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,314
Whoa.

57
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,861
No, I...

58
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,698
I walked right into it.

59
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:23,661
I just handed her this prop
for her goddamned showandtell.

60
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,373
- I fucking blew it.
- Join the fucking club.

61
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,918
Doesn't mean you get to take your ball
and go home.

62
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,962
It doesn't matter. He's not going away.

63
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,382
You do realize
he's not gonna do any real time.

64
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,676
- We still have death by auto.
- We have shit.

65
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,012
- And get off of me! I can walk!
- Okay, then...

66
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,599
Really?

67
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,394
I picked up the purchase report
from Jablonski's blue SUV.

68
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,523
Jesus.
We looked at that a million fucking times.

69
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,860
Yeah, but we never looked
for the grille guard.

70
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,820
Look.

71
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,156
It was there
when Marie Jablonski bought the car,

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,551
but not when he drove to the hospital
the morning of the hitandrun.

73
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,826
See? It's gone.

74
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,497
And I checked the hospital footage
for the day before the accident.

75
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,083
They had a visit with the doctor
and it was there.

76
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,045
- So?
- So, it could be direct evidence

77
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,381
linking Jablonski to the accident.

78
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,304
Forensics can match it
with Brenton's injuries.

79
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,594
You can make the case
that this specific car hit Brenton.

80
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,932
It's gone, with the car,
with every fucking thing, and...

81
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,435
You crawl back in that bottle and you die,

82
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,939
or you get up off your ass
and do your job.

83
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,233
We broke a lot of promises.

84
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,696
Pretty fucking epic ones.

85
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,864
We don't get to quit.

86
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,037
Bring up the grille guard in court
and see who flinches.

87
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,837
Ain't nobody tryin' to see him
play the black papa.

88
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,464
Ciao.

89
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,842
Wow, Daryll, was that really...

90
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,219
Your mom's gone, God rest her soul,

91
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,222
and you still sucking them
fucking cancer sticks.

92
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,641
One of my vices. We all got 'em.

93
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,853
Like you with that cop Jablonski.

94
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,481
The advice was free, my time isn't.
I came here to talk business.

95
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,858
Business?

96
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,320
What, with all the trouble
your boy caused? Please.

97
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,613
Time for me to find a new partner.

98
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,533
One of you bitches
under every rock in the pond, man.

99
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,493
The pond you refer to...

100
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,996
is the size of a Dixie cup.

101
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,042
You better be grateful for what you got
and you watch your fucking tone with me.

102
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,627
I wonder what your boy Jablonski
would think

103
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,590
when he finds out that you're the one
that put the nine mil in the uncle's hand?

104
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,927
He won't. 'Cause you're
the only one privy. Ain't that right?

105
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,432
Blaze don't know.

106
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,850
Nigga don't even fucking talk.

107
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,602
But me?

108
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,522
I'm a born conversationalist.
Fucking soliloquies and shit.

109
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,359
You threatening me,
you cripple motherfucker?

110
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,903
Look at you, man.

111
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,740
You so soft for that boy,
it makes me wonder,

112
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,203
that prosecutor drag my ass into court,
you gonna be soft then too?

113
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,332
Throw me under the fucking bus?

114
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,552
You should've fucked that little white boy
when you had the chance, man.

115
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,266
What the fuck?

116
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,280
You still good with 14 percent?

117
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,201
- I'll make it work.
- Yeah, you will.

118
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,913
Throw this piece of shit in the river.

119
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,151
Father God,

120
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,778
I come before you today to...

121
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:30,032
ask for your help and your guidance
in Brenton's case.

122
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,795
Why did you let this happen
to an innocent child?

123
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,798
Where was your mercy?

124
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,304
I can't even close my eyes
without seeing his...

125
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,598
last seconds.

126
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,476
How alone he must have been.

127
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,021
Show me something.

128
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,900
Show me something...

129
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,570
besides what's in my head. Please.

130
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,659
'Cause I can't see past it right now.

131
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,503
Show me that you were there with him.

132
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,713
Please.

133
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,603
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

134
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,022
Blue lives matter!
Blue lives matter!

135
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,650
Blue lives matter! Blue lives matter!

136
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,419
She's gonna push to have
all charges dismissed,

137
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,922
so you have to convince the judge
on this grille guard business.

138
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,906
- Yeah, I know.
- Emphasize, use the actual words,

139
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,709
- see if one of them cracks.
- Will you give me some space here, okay?

140
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,050
I thought she was the one
with the conscience.

141
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,136
She was.

142
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,265
All rise.

143
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,477
Court is now in session. The honorable
Judge Robert Dolan presiding.

144
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,812
Please be seated.

145
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,148
Outbursts like the one yesterday
will not be tolerated.

146
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,067
I hope I am making myself very clear.

147
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,153
Ms. Hennessy, before I recall the jury,

148
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,656
I'll hear arguments
on your motion to dismiss.

149
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,739
Yes, Your Honor.

150
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,244
Given that we heard testimony
from the State's own witness

151
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,247
proving that the victim's race
was indeterminable,

152
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,001
I move to dismiss the hate crime charge
against my client.

153
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,338
Furthermore, the State hasn't proven
any elements of the other charges.

154
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,426
- Therefore, I move to dismiss all charges.
- This is a gross overreach, Your Honor.

155
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,012
The State is far from finished
presenting its case.

156
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,931
Upon redirect with Mr. Lee,
we will establish evidence

157
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,476
directly tying Officer Jablonski's car
to the accident.

158
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,357
The defendant's SUV originally
had a grille guard attached to the front.

159
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,278
We believe it sustained the lion's share
of the accident impact.

160
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,872
For the prosecution to introduce
new evidence at this late stage...

161
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,498
Hardly new evidence, Your Honor.

162
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,627
It's a separate line of questioning
based on evidence already in record.

163
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,256
Evidence which, even if true, is nowhere
near establishing my client's guilt.

164
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,135
I think that's for the jury to decide,
Ms. Hennessy. Not you.

165
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,865
And the State will be presenting
further evidence

166
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,599
substantiating the hate crime charge.

167
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,020
I'll give you some leeway, Ms. Harper,
but not much.

168
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,147
Defense's motion to dismiss is denied.

169
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,025
Your Honor, I still need time to prepare.

170
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,234
You have an hour.

171
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,904
Then I'll be bringing the jury back in
to hear testimony.

172
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,822
Court stands in recess until 2:00 p.m.

173
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,706
Should I be worried?

174
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,050
Right.

175
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,594
We're good.

176
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,516
Trice.

177
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,604
Did you know about Brenton?

178
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,023
I had thoughts.

179
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,443
I believed he told me everything.

180
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,155
Well, you raised him so he could.

181
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,658
I'm not sure I did.

182
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,704
Isaiah, I had no right to say that to you.

183
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,083
To say that you didn't love him.
I know you did.

184
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,475
- What the fuck is going on?
- Shut the fuck up, man.

185
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,454
- The prosecutor knows where it is?
- If she did, it'd be on display right now,

186
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,563
front and center.

187
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,152
If Jablonski cracks,
that grille guard's the only thing

188
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,904
guaranteeing this shit lands
squarely on him.

189
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:19,989
All right?

190
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,826
You think I'm gonna listen to you
of all people on strategy?

191
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,288
Yeah.

192
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:32,334
'Cause out of all of us,
my hands are the only ones stayed clean.

193
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,088
- Doing okay? Look a little queasy.
- Get outta my face.

194
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,434
If you're not feeling well,
you should go to the hospital.

195
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,077
Maybe have the doctor take a look
at those scratches on your arm.

196
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,400
Did she look you in the eye
when you shoved the needle in her?

197
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,405
You motherfucker, it was you.

198
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,034
Hey, you better believe
I'm coming right at you.

199
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,499
The presence of a grille guard
could certainly account

200
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,252
for the low number of paint samples
found in the victim's hair, yes.

201
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,631
Are Brenton Butler's injuries consistent
with this type of grille guard?

202
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,714
They are.

203
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,886
Mr. Lee, can you show the jury
which of the victim's wounds

204
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,971
match the pattern
of the defendant's grille guard?

205
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,641
These marks on the victim's scalp

206
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,310
at the anterior side of the skull

207
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,438
match the metal rod
on this particular grille guard.

208
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,274
- Objection, Your Honor.
- On what grounds?

209
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,360
Counselors, approach the bench.

210
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,821
Your Honor, this is a blatant attempt

211
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,157
to interrupt the flow
of this witness' testimony.

212
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,869
I'd like to renew my argument
the trial be continued

213
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,931
until after I have a chance
to study this new evidence.

214
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,207
Your Honor,
you already ruled on this motion.

215
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,876
That was until I understood
the scope of the State's questions.

216
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,462
The State should at least be allowed
to finish questioning.

217
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,841
Your Honor, the defense needs
ample time to study this new evidence.

218
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,177
At least over this coming weekend.

219
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,388
My God!

220
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,598
- Back up!
- T!

221
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,435
Come on, give her some room!

222
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,355
- Teresa!
- Take it easy, take it easy.

223
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,274
- She's all right.
- Easy, easy.

224
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,621
My God, you're shaking like a leaf
and you're so pale.

225
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,708
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Stop, I'm fine, I told you.

226
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,628
But you're not fine.
You just passed out in there.

227
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:44,300
You need to take her to the urgent care.
She needs to see a doctor.

228
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,718
- No.
- No, she don't.

229
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,222
We got news.

230
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,849
What news?

231
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,311
I guess she's still got that conscience.

232
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,396
- My God!
- Yeah.

233
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,110
None of the others even blinked
at the mention of the grille guard.

234
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,279
Osorio's the one that killed Nadine.

235
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,490
He's got scratch marks
up and down his arm.

236
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,760
I can get one of the office
detectives to follow Teresa.

237
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,536
You probably shouldn't be around them.

238
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,662
I'm doing this.

239
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,266
Something to keep in mind though
about this crew

240
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,917
and how they handle loose ends,

241
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,461
Messiah's missing too.

242
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,879
They're cleaning house.

243
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,938
Which means we need to be extra careful
with how we handle Teresa.

244
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,801
Look, offer her immunity,
just whatever you need.

245
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,930
I'll do some research,
dig up any skeletons if I can.

246
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,683
Just don't let her out of your sight,
okay?

247
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,103
- Mrs. Butler.
- Today went well, right?

248
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,606
The testimony today establishes damage.

249
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,441
Is it enough to put him away?

250
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,445
Probably not.
But court's in recess until Monday

251
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,907
and I have another lead.
It could be the break that we need.

252
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:54,662
That man has the cops, the press,
the entire justice system on his side.

253
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,374
I have you.

254
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,089
Get the fuck outta here.

255
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,719
We need to get you to a hospital.

256
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,721
- Don't touch me!
- All right. I won't, I won't.

257
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,474
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

258
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,895
How about...

259
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,190
I just sit here?

260
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,572
For as long as you want.

261
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,497
Seriously, you didn't have to do this.

262
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,706
Yeah, we did.

263
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,043
It's a big deal. You're having a baby.

264
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,879
You need this, especially now.

265
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,673
- Hey, come on, get off.
- You gotta have some fun.

266
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,966
Isn't that bad luck?

267
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,762
- Hey, listen up. Ladies, shut up.
- You're gonna be a great mom.

268
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:17,846
All right, get up.

269
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,975
I know it's early, but fuck it. We have
got to celebrate good news for once.

270
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,727
Watch your fucking language, babe.

271
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,146
Speech, speech, speech, speech.

272
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,773
You're one hell of a cop.

273
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,150
You're gonna be one hell of a dad.

274
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,611
The fuck is the matter with you?
¿Que te pasa, coño?

275
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,989
Yo, get the fuck off of me with that shit!
Are you serious?

276
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,325
- No! No!
- Hey, hey, hey! Get the fuck off!

277
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,452
- Walk away! Walk away!
- He's fucking drunk!

278
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,787
- He's a fucking idiot.
- Bitch!

279
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,539
Hey! Watch your fucking tone. All right?

280
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,582
Come sit down. He's an asshole.

281
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,043
Don't know what's wrong
with him. He's acting crazy.

282
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,504
- Manny, you know what's wrong?
- Nah, it's nothing.

283
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,840
- He's not sleeping.
- Forget about it.

284
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,759
- It's cute, right?
- It's so cute.

285
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,138
Our kids are gonna grow up together,
just like we did.

286
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,765
We're gonna be mommies together.

287
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,478
You're gonna do great in court.

288
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,814
I trust you.

289
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,403
All right? You drink with me.

290
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,112
Salud.

291
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,698
Here's to us.

292
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,743
To justice. Right?

293
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,252
Fuck him.

294
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,422
Fuck him.

295
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,842
Petey, I need to tell you something.

296
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,178
- DiAngelo...
- No, hey, hey.

297
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:43,515
- I need to talk to you about something.
- Let me grab you another beer. All right?

298
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,518
- I ain't going to let them hurt you.
- Hey, no.

299
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,938
No, no, no, no, no, no.

300
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,649
- You can't smoke, you're pregnant.
- Come on, stop, T.

301
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,836
- You're pregnant.
- Come on, you gotta quit that shit.

302
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,695
You want your kid to come out
with crab claws?

303
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,018
I know a girl on the shore, her kid came
out with fucking pincers, I swear to God.

304
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,993
- It's my last one. Promise.
- Come on, you don't need to do that.

305
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,120
- Promise.
- Come on, stop, stop, stop.

306
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,581
Fuck! What the fuck? What the fuck?

307
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,709
Hey.

308
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,839
I guess congratulations are in order.

309
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,009
- Little girls, man, they're the best.
- You're spying on us now?

310
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,762
First time you see that face,
it's gonna break your heart.

311
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,824
Break your kid's heart too, knowing
she's gotta visit you in the clink.

312
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,934
Get out of here. You can't be here.
It's trespassing.

313
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,936
I think it's good that you know the law.

314
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,288
It means you know what an accessory is.

315
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:17,192
So you know not talking
about those cops killing that kid

316
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,279
and crushing his head under that SUV
that you like to drive around...

317
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,090
You don't leave now,
I will call them out here.

318
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,699
Let's do it. You should do it!

319
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,200
Call them!

320
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,705
Ask them about Nadine,
the other little kid they killed.

321
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,541
What are you talking about?

322
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,298
Yeah. She was 15 years old.

323
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,049
She was gonna put 'em all away.

324
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,133
Look at her.

325
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,054
Your friends in there...

326
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,766
left her to rot in some swamp.

327
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,977
- Look at her!
- Stop it!

328
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,646
They're worse than animals,

329
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,356
those people in there.

330
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,609
And they're all lying to you.

331
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,653
Even that cousin of yours.

332
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,490
- Don't talk about my cousin, you asshole.
- No. Why? Hey.

333
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,327
You stay away from her,
you stay away from me!

334
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,610
- Okay! Hey, okay!
- Hey, guys!

335
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,079
Hey, shh.

336
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,665
Know how to reach me
if you change your mind.

337
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,500
Same place your old man works.

338
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,114
Come get breakfast.

339
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,704
Whether or not
Brenton Butler was a gang member,

340
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,583
the 15yearold did in fact have
a juvenile record for drug possession.

341
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,800
All I got is cereal.

342
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,053
That'll work.

343
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,655
What about you and Mrs. Butler?

344
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,491
Y'all ain't checking for each other
no more?

345
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,401
Just saying, Brenton would've wanted
y'all to work it out.

346
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,040
Ain't that what you want?

347
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,583
Not everything's up to me.

348
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,503
Finally made my peace with that.

349
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,885
I am thinking about starting
a new job though.

350
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,055
Doing what?

351
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,182
Painting.

352
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,477
Something I been into since I was a kid.

353
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,437
So you trying to be an artist now?

354
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,065
- Like museums and shit?
- Nah.

355
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,442
Just, you know,
painting old houses, buildings.

356
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,944
Putting some color back.

357
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,028
Some light.

358
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,238
Life.

359
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,078
I might need some help
if you're interested in a job.

360
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,788
I ain't no employee.

361
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,290
Shit.

362
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,750
If you're looking for a partner though...

363
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,627
we could talk.

364
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,213
I just might be.

365
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,593
You know, you always got a place to stay
if you need it.

366
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,986
I appreciate the offer, but...

367
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,572
I got an aunt out in Mobile.

368
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,158
She's been hitting me up for a while.

369
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,993
Everything that's been going down,

370
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,745
seems like a good idea.

371
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,416
Think I could make it
as some country Alabama boy?

372
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,418
I do.

373
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,967
Dear Heavenly Father,
may you bless this food

374
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,555
for the nourishment of our bodies,
minds, and spirits.

375
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,307
Bless all our loved ones and...

376
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,601
those who aren't here to be loved.

377
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,999
I spooked her.

378
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,169
She knows something,
but she's not talking.

379
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,756
And she's in deeper than we thought too.
She's about to have Wilcox's demon child.

380
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,174
But other than that...

381
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,051
How about you?

382
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,010
Nothing.

383
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,721
Past jobs, old boyfriends,

384
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,266
I couldn't come up with anything
to use as leverage.

385
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,517
What about the cousin, Marie?

386
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,353
One mention of her and she went nuts,
like a Pekingese on PCP.

387
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,397
They grew up on the same block together.

388
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,233
But if she's about to start a family
with Wilcox,

389
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,193
there's no way
she's turning any of them in.

390
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,695
What about the other witnesses?

391
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,155
Messiah's AWOL, she's the last one.

392
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,493
Without that grille guard,
auto death is mostly speculation.

393
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,995
And hate crime's a Hail Mary.

394
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,707
He had to have seen that blood
near the ditch.

395
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,917
And those shoes,
they were right there in plain sight.

396
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,877
Can't introduce the Timberlands
without Nadine.

397
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:28,961
I know.

398
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,630
But Jablonski must've seen them.

399
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,174
If he did, he had to have known
there was a kid in that ditch.

400
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,136
Have to do better than that.
"Must have's" are not gonna sway a jury.

401
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,889
We got a couple hours before the trial.
I'm gonna help you prep.

402
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,018
I'm gonna get some moo shu and we're
gonna do a little mock trial here.

403
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:43,977
No. No.

404
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,188
You sat on Teresa all weekend,
you did your part.

405
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,276
I just... I need to think, okay?

406
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,611
Let me do my job.

407
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,821
You sure?

408
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,865
I do a mean Jersey girl.

409
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,576
I already got the gum. See?

410
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,410
Go.

411
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,997
You're gonna do good tomorrow.

412
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,874
Goodnight, Fish.

413
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,083
Night.

414
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,224
I didn't mean to scare you.

415
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,518
You didn't.

416
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,358
You know what kind of message it sends,
you disrespecting me in public.

417
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,780
- Don't walk away from me!
- I'm walking to my car, Officer.

418
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,903
There's a time and a place
to discuss legal matters.

419
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,618
How is it you still don't get
that we're a team?

420
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,247
The N.A.P. wanted their best man
on this case,

421
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,333
and like it or not, it was me.

422
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,754
You wanna be a part of a team,
join a softball league.

423
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,131
With a little more conviction.

424
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,051
Excuse me?

425
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,595
You didn't really own it.

426
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,681
I caught a little quiver in your cheek.

427
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,893
I got something for you.

428
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,778
You want to shake her up tomorrow,
use this.

429
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,280
What is it?

430
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,117
That's a little thing called
"inherent bias."

431
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,035
It works both ways.

432
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,414
People gunning for us,

433
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,332
'cause they can't raise their own families

434
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,251
without asking us for our help.

435
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,380
At the end of the day,

436
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,759
this whole thing is one big clusterfuck
of Mommy and Daddy issues.

437
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,596
Like I said, you're gonna enjoy
what is on that.

438
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,060
And whatever you think about me...

439
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,732
he's a good kid.

440
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,483
A naive one...

441
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,986
with his own Daddy issues.

442
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:03,450
But that's how you like 'em.
Fatherless sons.

443
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,076
Do your job.

444
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,538
Get Jablonski off.

445
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:25,180
Is it...
Is it true, in fact, Ms. Tonelli, that...

446
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,433
Come on, KJ.

447
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,518
That you are...

448
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,735
Shit.

449
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,363
You ready to go?

450
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,492
- Give me a minute, I gotta change.
- We're gonna be late, giddyup.

451
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,286
Put the yellow folders in my bag.

452
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,996
- Please.
- Where are they?

453
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,207
On the couch or somewhere.

454
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,918
The city's gonna condemn this place.

455
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,878
I'm telling you,
it looks like my Uncle Joe's,

456
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,505
and that guy was a bona fide hoarder.

457
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,925
He used to use plastic bags as a toilet.

458
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,927
I'm telling you,
it's a slippery slope, KJ.

459
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,930
Ms. Harper's bias
against the police may prove her unfit

460
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,765
to try the Brenton Butler case.

461
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,185
- Like you know how to do your job.
- Excuse me?

462
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:17,273
- Agh! Now you want to act like a cop.
- What'd you say to me?

463
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:21,152
- You heard me the first time.
- So tell that

464
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:25,114
- to give me my car back!
- Calm down, ma'am.

465
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,537
Why don't you mind your business?

466
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,413
- You're all racist...
- Let's go. Come on.

467
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,082
- Let's go.
- Every one of you cops!

468
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,210
I am an assistant prosecutor.

469
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,052
Seriously. Come on.

470
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,694
Sit down. Cool your jets.

471
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,362
Sit down.

472
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,867
All rise.

473
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,161
The honorable
Judge Robert Dolan presiding.

474
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,500
Bring the jury in.

475
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,011
Everyone be seated.

476
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,600
May counsel approach?

477
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:45,069
Your Honor, we're all painfully aware
of the news cycle this morning.

478
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,362
Your point, Counselor?

479
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:51,075
Frankly, it makes these proceedings look
like an episode of the Jersey Shore.

480
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,536
The State may benefit from new counsel.

481
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,998
With all due respect, Your Honor,
that's not the court's decision to make.

482
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,877
Agreed. Now, ladies,
can we get back to the point at hand?

483
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,296
Yes? Good. Thank you.

484
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,840
Ms. Harper, you may proceed.

485
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,469
I know you did it.

486
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,889
And what are you gonna do?
Throw a punch at me too? Go ahead.

487
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,527
The State calls Teresa Tonelli.

488
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,551
Raise your right hand.

489
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,595
- It's the other hand, ma'am.
- Sorry.

490
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,930
Left hand on the Bible.

491
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,743
Swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

492
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,851
so help you God?

493
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,229
I do. Okay.

494
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,774
Ms. Tonelli,

495
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,319
when you borrowed the blue Ford Escape

496
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,447
on the morning of February 22nd,

497
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:16,160
you had an altercation
with the defendant, correct?

498
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,495
I don't remember.

499
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,081
I just, um...

500
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,541
Petey was upset, whatever.

501
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,043
Because you drove his car
seven days after the hitandrun?

502
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,920
No, 'cause Marie had been in the hospital.

503
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,548
They lost their baby girl last year.

504
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,550
She was stillborn.

505
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,759
It was terrible.

506
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,180
"You ever touch this truck again,

507
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,933
and I swear to God,
I'll fucking kill you."

508
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,022
Do you recall the defendant
saying those words to you?

509
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,500
Can the clerk please mark the interview
with the neighbor,

510
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,110
Mr. Howard Beggs, as State's Exhibit S3.

511
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,990
I'd like to direct your attention
to line ten, page five.

512
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,784
And I remind you, you're under oath.

513
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,164
Yeah, he said that.

514
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,918
Whatever. He told me to get out
of the car. It wasn't a big deal.

515
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,047
He grabbed you by the neck,
dragged you out of the car,

516
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,298
and threw you against it.

517
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,632
- Really?
- Objection.

518
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,093
- Is that a question, Your Honor?
- It is. Sit down.

519
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,138
I'll be the arbitrator of that,
not you, Ms. Harper.

520
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,432
Your objection, Ms. Hennessy,
is overruled.

521
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,228
Counselor.

522
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,525
Are you afraid of the defendant,
Ms. Tonelli?

523
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,861
No.

524
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,988
Are you afraid he might hurt your cousin?

525
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,909
He better not.

526
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,663
Yet he left a boy
out in the cold to die.

527
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,166
A child, a black child...

528
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,667
Objection, speculation.

529
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,211
Sustained.

530
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,129
Why did you go to Brenton Butler's vigil?

531
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,761
He was just a kid.

532
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,390
He shouldn't have died like that.

533
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,310
He could have lived.

534
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,688
If one person spoke up. Just one.

535
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,691
I know you're scared.

536
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,402
And I know how easy it is

537
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,489
to walk away and to say nothing,

538
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:20,243
but you know the truth,
and you know right from wrong.

539
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,494
Objection!

540
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,833
Don't leave him out in the cold, Teresa,
please.

541
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,249
Objection!
Is there a question here, Your Honor?

542
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,126
Ask the question, Counselor.

543
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,628
- Where's the blue SUV?
- I don't know.

544
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,881
You do know, that's why you went
to the park, to the vigil.

545
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,843
- I said I don't know where it is.
- This is outrageous, Your Honor.

546
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,613
- Where's the missing grille guard?
- She's harassing her own witness.

547
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,015
- Where is it, Teresa? Tell me.
- Counselors, approach now.

548
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,726
He was bleeding and screaming

549
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,105
- and dying alone. A child.
- Objection! Your Honor, please.

550
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,250
- Be that one person, Teresa...
- She is violating...

551
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,001
and tell me where
the missing grille guard is.

552
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,318
It's not missing!

553
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,992
It's in his backyard.

554
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,499
Teresa!

555
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,420
Teresa!

556
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,174
How could you do that?

557
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,383
Get Mikey. Go quick.

558
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,719
- We can go now before it's too late.
- You're crazy!

559
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:23,472
Me? How can you not see what they are?
They planted that thing in your pool.

560
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,316
- They don't care about you.
- Fucking bitch!

561
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,519
- You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!
- Get off!

562
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,770
You fucking bitch!

563
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,439
You son of a bitch!

564
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,440
The baby!

565
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,442
There won't be a baby!

566
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,945
You think I'm gonna bring your child
into this world? For what?

567
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,906
What kind of father are you gonna be?

568
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,325
You kill kids
and you're looking at me like that?

569
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,744
- Yo, stop! Stop! Come on.
- Fuck you.

570
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:49,165
Now we got something in common, Pete.
You and me.

571
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,584
We're the same.

572
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,046
Fuck!

573
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,310
Hey, hey.
I didn't have nothing to do with this.

574
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,270
I told them to get rid of it. Fuck.

575
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,231
Babe, come on, let's go, let's go.

576
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,900
You stupid fuck!

577
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:19,237
Hey! I'm talking to you!
I'm fucking talking to you!

578
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,863
Back the fuck off!

579
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,824
No one is listening to you no more!

580
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,161
You destroy everyone around you!

581
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,372
Everything you fucking touch!

582
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,166
Just look around you, man.

583
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,085
Just look.

584
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,507
Let's get the fuck out of here.

585
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,382
- What is this?
- Mrs. Butler, Mr. Butler.

586
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,408
What is this?
What does this mean for the case?

587
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,701
It means we got him.

588
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:10,663
And we can get the other three now too
by turning Jablonski against them.

589
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,665
- In exchange for a plea.
- A plea?

590
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,209
We won't agree.
He's got to pay for what he did.

591
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,128
He'll still do time, I promise you that.

592
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,839
- But we can get all of them with this.
- How much time?

593
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:24,051
I have to be reasonable
or he won't agree to it. Eight years.

594
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,306
You make him get on that stand
and say what he did.

595
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,389
Yeah.

596
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,144
You're right. He's got to.
He's got to get up on that stand, KJ.

597
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,896
I need to hear those words
come out of his mouth.

598
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,125
- I want that whole courtroom to hear it.
- I understand.

599
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,711
- I need to hear what happened to Brenton!
- He will. I understand.

600
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,696
All right, baby. It's almost over.

601
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,574
- I need to hear him say it.
- It's almost over.

602
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,176
He'll give a written statement, that's it.

603
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,054
I won't have my hands tied
if this thing goes south.

604
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,766
There's no deal if your client
doesn't testify in open court.

605
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:17,313
Okay. I know your experience is limited,
so let me break this down for you.

606
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:22,485
My client is guaranteed death by auto,
five to ten years,

607
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,029
if the jury hears him confess
to the accident.

608
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,365
Would you rather gamble with 30?

609
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,617
That's if you can prove a hate crime.

610
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,702
Which you've failed at miserably
up to now.

611
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,796
Wait, we want a plea.

612
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,923
- I ain't no rat.
- Petey.

613
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,800
They put that thing in our pool.

614
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,969
You don't have to be loyal to them.

615
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,222
Mrs. Jablonski. Please.

616
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,435
Five years max,

617
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,895
you get your confession.

618
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,730
My last offer.

619
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,565
Eight years.

620
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,071
Can we have a minute?

621
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,668
Eight years for him
and 20 each for the other three.

622
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,254
That's almost 70 years in total.

623
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,174
Think a lifetime's long enough
for the Butlers?

624
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,847
Did you see the look on the jury's faces

625
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,349
when she paraded around
those autopsy photos?

626
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,394
- They don't like you very much right now.
- Fuck them.

627
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,603
No. Fuck you.

628
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,772
Fuck your wife, fuck your kid.

629
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,859
He'll be 30 by the time
you get out of prison.

630
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:51,949
I urge you to consider eight years
and a confession your best option.

631
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,048
Hey, um, why don't you go inside?
I'll be there in a minute.

632
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,508
Okay.

633
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:36,202
I'd kill you myself,
but then I'd be no better than you are.

634
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,955
But know this...

635
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,335
you will meet your God.

636
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,380
On that you can depend.

637
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,926
You making threats?

638
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,594
No, no need for threats.

639
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,557
Prison's the one place a white man
ain't no better than the rest of us.

640
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,644
They gonna kill you in there.

641
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,359
You don't know?

642
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,196
Your boy's gonna give you up.

643
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,449
He's gonna save himself.

644
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,082
I see what you are.

645
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,128
I know what you are.

646
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,966
You ain't nothing but a coward.

647
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,347
And the whole world's
gonna see it now, too.

648
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,704
His diaper's soaked.
Just give me a minute.

649
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,038
- We gotta go now.
- What?

650
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,915
I'll get the bag. But let's go now.

651
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,438
I need to change Mikey.

652
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,109
- I'll wait out here.
- I'm fine.

653
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,945
Just... I'll meet you inside.
Hennessy might need to talk to you.

654
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,656
It's gonna be okay, babe.

655
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,702
I'm proud of you for doing this.
You're doing this for us.

656
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,121
- Okay?
- Yeah.

657
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:46,789
I love you.

658
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,761
I know what you're gonna do.

659
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,143
Do it.

660
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,482
Do it for your family, your son.

661
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,734
I understand.

662
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,035
It was me.

663
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:28,082
I made you drive away.

664
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,003
So you go in there,

665
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,006
and you tell them the truth.

666
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,678
Go on.

667
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,097
Go.

668
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,339
Mrs. Butler.

669
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,467
I'm so...

670
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,720
so sorry for your loss.

671
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,307
I can't...

672
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:34,273
I can't imagine what you're going through,
and I can't imagine losing my child.

673
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,316
I know...

674
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:41,113
there's nothing I can do
to make it up to you. I know that.

675
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,825
But it was an accident.

676
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,247
My husband is a good man.

677
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,127
Your husband drove away from my child.

678
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,672
How could you sit in that courtroom

679
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,592
knowing what you know
and say those words to me?

680
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,801
He didn't know.

681
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,721
He would've never done that if he knew.

682
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,264
He wouldn't.

683
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:10,517
There's a whole lot he doesn't know,
that you don't know.

684
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,563
That man you sit next to...

685
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,690
in court...

686
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,067
every day?

687
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,445
The one you let hold your baby?

688
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,364
He wanted your husband dead.

689
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,660
All rise.

690
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,914
The honorable
Judge Robert Dolan presiding.

691
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,341
Can you state your name and rank
for the record?

692
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:28,053
Officer Peter Michael Jablonski,
Jersey City Police Department.

693
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,181
You transferred from the East District
to the South.

694
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,559
What was the reason for this transfer?

695
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:37,604
I joined the AntiGang and Narcotics Unit,
which is based out of the South.

696
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:41,024
Your ranking officer
is Sergeant Michael DiAngelo.

697
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:44,695
And you're expected to obey his orders,
is that true?

698
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:48,156
That's correct.

699
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,701
Directing your attention
to the morning of February 15th,

700
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:55,122
can you recount the events
that transpired in Liberty Park?

701
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,875
I'd just gotten a call
from my wife's cousin.

702
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:02,212
Said Marie, my wife,

703
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,547
was in the hospital.

704
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,635
I was driving, on the phone,

705
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,637
not paying attention...

706
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,182
and I... I hit something.

707
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:15,934
Something?

708
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:21,148
What did you hit, Mr. Jablonski?

709
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,358
I didn't see.

710
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:28,071
And when I got out of my car,
I saw the grille guard hanging off.

711
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,364
And...

712
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,660
that bike underneath my wheels.

713
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:41,209
Is it true that officers found
that grille guard in your backyard

714
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,462
after executing a search warrant
last night?

715
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:49,968
Yes.

716
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,012
And this bike...

717
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,390
is it present in the courtroom today?

718
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,435
Yes. At the evidence table.

719
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:03,690
So you were fully aware
that you hit a human being?

720
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,859
Not an animal,

721
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,444
not a tree.

722
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:09,863
Maybe a black teenager?

723
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,990
Objection, conjecture.

724
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,909
I'll rephrase, Your Honor.

725
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,126
Are narcotics officers like yourself

726
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,381
aware that this particular brand of bike,
the Sarongo Series,

727
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:31,468
is used by members of the Five Kings,
a black gang in Jersey City?

728
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,348
Yeah, but I didn't look too close at it.

729
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,725
So it would be a reasonable assumption

730
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,396
that whoever had been riding this bike
could've been black?

731
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,484
I wasn't thinking about the bike.

732
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,028
Your Honor, the State agreed
that questioning

733
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,740
would be limited to the actual events
of February 15th.

734
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,326
Ms. Harper, you are aware of this.

735
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:01,665
What happened next,
after you exited your vehicle?

736
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,211
I stood there on the road
next to my car...

737
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,256
looking at the statue.

738
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,007
The Statue of Liberty.

739
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,470
I could see her, even her torch,
it was lit up.

740
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,973
How long did you stand there,
on the road?

741
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,850
- I don't know.
- Was it a few minutes?

742
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,476
- A few seconds?
- I don't know.

743
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,562
Did you go to the ditch
to see who was down there?

744
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,148
I told you, I stood on the road
looking at the statue.

745
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,234
There was blood everywhere
and you didn't think to go and look?

746
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,237
- Your Honor...
- I was thinking about the statue

747
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:34,281
and this time when I climbed the stairs
inside her torch...

748
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,783
when I was eight or nine.

749
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,704
My mother was standing on the stairs
in front of me.

750
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:44,166
And I could see the bruises
on the back of her legs.

751
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,627
- That's what I was thinking about.
- Mr. Jablonski.

752
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,089
That's why I became a cop.

753
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,592
Because of animals like my father.

754
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,678
- I was never gonna be a coward like him.
- Mr. Jablonski.

755
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:58,972
What did you do next?

756
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,228
Mr. Jablonski.

757
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,158
I drove away.

758
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,168
Let me remind you that you're under oath.

759
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,295
Your Honor,
the question's been asked and answered.

760
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,589
- What did you do next?
- I said I drove away.

761
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:35,425
- That's not what you did and you know it.
- Counselor, approach now.

762
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:38,029
- What did you do after you exited?
- Ms. Harper, that is enough!

763
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,430
- Say it. Say what you did.
- Your Honor, please.

764
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,890
Say what you did, goddamn it!

765
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,433
Remove Ms. Harper from my courtroom.

766
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,976
Say what you did.
Say what you did...

767
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,186
- Let's go.
- Don't touch me!

768
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,187
Say what you did!

769
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,357
- Arrest her for contempt of court.
- Look at them and say what you did.

770
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,526
- Get off. Get off of me.
- Stop resisting.

771
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,693
You're an asshole.

772
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,278
Stop resisting.

773
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,613
Take it easy.

774
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,865
Get the fuck off me!

775
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,984
We gotta stop meeting like this.

776
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,614
Dolan wants to move forward,
no bueno on the mistrial.

777
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,950
And he's gonna let you do
your closing tomorrow.

778
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,451
Fair guy.

779
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,788
Connelly, on the other hand,
wants your resignation after.

780
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:50,083
- And he sent you to deliver the message.
- No, he told the press that.

781
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,544
Of course he did.

782
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,715
"Sit in the box,

783
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:01,678
and see what the jury sees."
It's Trial Prep 101.

784
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,266
Today they saw

785
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,518
a brokenhearted little boy

786
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,854
gazing up at the Statue of Liberty.

787
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,023
Fucking great.

788
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,943
They don't get to see Brenton.

789
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,237
- He doesn't get to take the stand.
- Make them see him.

790
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,323
I did, no one cares!

791
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,951
I told you, no one puts cops away.

792
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,747
I wasn't ever gonna win this.
It was always about optics for Connelly,

793
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,957
a black face for the black vote.

794
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,627
It's the greatest show on earth,
this shit.

795
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,048
Wanna know something else?

796
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,716
I'm a secondrate lawyer.

797
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:42,218
I can't win. I won't win. So...

798
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,012
just go.

799
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,889
- That might be true.
- It is fucking true.

800
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,308
Okay, then it is. You suck. Now get up.

801
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:54,022
You got a dead kid to speak for.
You got two dead kids... to speak for.

802
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,942
- You're all that they've got left.
- It's over, Fish.

803
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,153
Tell that to him.

804
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,821
Not me.

805
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,491
You wanna quit?

806
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,619
But tell Brenton that.

807
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,748
I'm sick of hearing it.

808
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:35,814
This is your last call
for departure to Baton Rouge. The bus...

809
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,034
Mr. Butler told me you were leaving,
so I...

810
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,704
Can I sit down?

811
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,207
I'd like to ask you something.

812
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,628
You were the last person that Brenton saw.

813
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:03,383
- The last person he talked to...
- What do you want from me, Mrs. Butler?

814
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,013
Anything. Just anything. I just...

815
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:12,142
want to know what he...
what he said, what he was thinking.

816
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,567
I woke up that morning.
Brenton was next to me.

817
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,569
That's all.

818
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,782
Was he happy?

819
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:36,458
He was home.

820
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,172
He sprayed that stuff...

821
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,091
that cologne...

822
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,803
before he left.

823
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,098
He liked that stuff.

824
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,686
My room still smelled like it.

825
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,524
At night...

826
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,696
he used to listen to the cars
pass on the bridge.

827
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,284
Brenton said it sounded like the ocean.

828
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,040
Mobile, Alabama bus
departs from gate five.

829
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,833
Mobile, Alabama bus.

830
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,502
Kadeuce.

831
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:21,795
Kadeuce, don't go.

832
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,047
Please don't go.

833
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,466
This is home.

834
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,551
Nah.

835
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,721
Home is where your people at.

836
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:34,474
You know?

837
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:41,231
Sweetheart.

838
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,028
Thought you were gone.

839
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,867
I was... I...

840
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,994
You need a place to stay?

841
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,539
Nah.

842
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,711
I gotta find my own way.

843
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,424
There's something out there, I just...

844
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,678
I just gotta find it. You feel me?

845
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,229
It's too big for one person.

846
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,317
And Tricey ain't coming back.

847
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:12,989
I don't blame her.

848
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,118
Drove y'all away.

849
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,331
My wife, my son,

850
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:22,916
you.

851
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,837
I could've done what she said.

852
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,256
I could've just said it.

853
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:35,595
At the hospital...

854
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,432
she said, "Tell Brenton you love him."

855
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,438
Now he'll never know.

856
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,985
My son died not knowing I did.

857
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,491
That day at the ocean...

858
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,039
Yeah.

859
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,292
You remember that day?

860
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,336
You remember that?

861
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,800
Isaiah, you gotta remember.

862
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,261
You were there.

863
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,266
I was working so much
back when he was small.

864
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,520
And Tricey got sick,
there was so much to tend to.

865
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,692
Why you bring this up?

866
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,319
Why you think Brenton
loved them seagulls so much?

867
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,700
Because his father brought him there.

868
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,953
Isaiah, you took that picture.

869
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,752
Showed him the best day of his life.

870
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:53,923
That's what he said.

871
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,678
You ain't gotta say the words, 'Saiah.

872
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,179
He knew.

873
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,602
Your son...

874
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,521
knew...

875
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,356
that you loved him.

876
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,704
I'm sorry for driving you off...

877
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,999
for what I did.

878
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,254
I'm sorry.

879
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,050
You ain't gotta apologize, bro.

880
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,774
I gotta go.

881
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:54,484
Yeah. I gotta...

882
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,402
Yeah. All right.

883
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,030
You'll find it.

884
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:02,784
What you're looking for.

885
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,999
And when you do, hang on.

886
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,679
Ms. Harper, you may begin.

887
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,034
I went to the park this morning,

888
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,872
to the place where
Brenton Butler lay dying.

889
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:00,086
I wanted to imagine...

890
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,088
what he felt...

891
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,175
as he watched the first light
of the morning come,

892
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:09,470
and the last light of day fade away.

893
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:12,807
As he lay there,

894
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,351
in that ditch...

895
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,104
for 12 hours...

896
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,189
wondering what?

897
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:23,943
For his mother,

898
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,195
and for his father,

899
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:31,033
it is a terrible thing to have to imagine,

900
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,578
and not even know,

901
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:35,538
but imagine,

902
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:37,832
your child's last seconds.

903
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,878
"Did he cry out for me?"

904
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,967
"Did he wonder why I didn't come?
Why no one did?"

905
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,554
This is what we know:

906
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,599
The defendant's blue Ford Escape

907
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:58,227
collided with the victim's bike
on an icy road

908
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,354
on the morning of February 15th.

909
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:04,233
The grille guard
from Peter Jablonski's car,

910
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:07,778
in addition to his own testimony,
are proof of this.

911
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:12,950
Ladies and gentlemen, the State submits
you have no other choice

912
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:17,496
but to find the defendant guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt

913
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,831
of death by auto.

914
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,338
Peter Jablonski testified...

915
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:28,716
that after hitting Brenton Butler

916
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,260
and exiting his vehicle,

917
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:36,933
all he saw as he stood on the road
next to his car

918
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:38,434
was the Statue of Liberty.

919
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:43,356
I want you to remember how he described
that her torch was lit up

920
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,274
like a beacon in the sun.

921
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:48,819
And now I want you to think
about the crime scene photos

922
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:52,031
that I've shown you
over the course of this trial.

923
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,534
This morning...

924
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,204
I too stood on that road,

925
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:02,917
in the exact same spot
the defendant stood.

926
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:04,669
Right here.

927
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:09,840
It's impossible to see
the Statue of Liberty from the road.

928
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,759
It is completely blocked.

929
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:13,177
This...

930
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,805
is the view from the edge of the ditch.

931
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:20,851
So Peter Jablonski can only have seen
the Statue of Liberty

932
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:25,856
if he stood at the edge of the ditch,
which means he saw Brenton Butler.

933
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:34,198
How long did he stand there?

934
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,576
How many seconds...

935
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:41,247
did he look down at Brenton?

936
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,249
One second?

937
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:45,626
Two seconds?

938
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,963
Three?

939
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:53,843
Four?

940
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,137
Five?

941
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,016
Six seconds?

942
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,436
Seven seconds?

943
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:10,651
Peter Jablonski walked away.

944
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:14,947
And Brenton Butler died.

945
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,784
When he could have lived.

946
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:24,290
Would he have walked away
if Brenton were white?

947
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,044
Would you?

948
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:35,301
You must also consider this a hate crime,
because there is a bigger crime,

949
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,679
a bigger problem.

950
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,347
We have a problem,

951
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:43,434
and our country has a problem.

952
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,394
Our children are dying,

953
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,854
in plain sight,

954
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,274
left like roadkill on our playgrounds,

955
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:52,151
our streets, and our sidewalks.

956
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:53,819
Turn on the news.

957
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,280
Open a paper.

958
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:59,116
And read their names.

959
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:04,789
Each is a clear message
to every black woman, man, and child

960
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:08,667
that our lives and our bodies
have no value.

961
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,087
So how many names are enough,

962
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,715
before we, before you say,

963
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:16,717
"Enough"?

964
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:24,809
The defendant said
that he never saw Brenton Butler.

965
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,813
I'd like you to see Brenton now.

966
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,608
And not how he died,

967
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:35,569
but how he lived.

968
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:39,532
See those seconds near that icy road.

969
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:45,454
Before a car met a boy on a bike.

970
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:52,044
See the sky above and the earth below.

971
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:56,090
And in these last seconds of a life,

972
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,801
see how beautiful it is,

973
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:04,140
how endless and precious his life is.

974
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,560
Do you see him?

975
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,272
Then let Brenton know...

976
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,694
his life mattered.

977
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:04,867
Father God, look down on us today
with your mercy,

978
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,911
your great love.

979
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:09,705
Find justice for our child, your child,

980
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:11,165
- as you see fit.
- Yes.

981
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:15,336
Give his mother and father
the strength and fortitude

982
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:17,546
to bear whatever you bring to them today.

983
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:18,547
Yes, Father.

984
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,799
Your wisdom is bountiful,

985
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,928
vaster than the oceans and mountains
of your great earth.

986
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,639
- See us today, Father God.
- See us.

987
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,641
- Hear us today, Father God.
- Hear us.

988
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:30,351
- Amen.
- Amen.

989
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,995
Mr. Foreman,
do you have a verdict?

990
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:51,580
We do, Your Honor.

991
01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:06,470
Mr. Jablonski.

992
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:15,187
All right, will the clerk
please publish the verdict?

993
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:19,817
The State of New Jersey
v. Peter Michael Jablonski.

994
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:24,947
On the charge of hate crime,
the jury finds the defendant not guilty.

995
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:31,662
On the charge of death by auto,
the jury finds the defendant guilty.

996
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:38,335
Based on the outstanding record
of the defendant as an officer of the law,

997
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:42,506
Mr. Jablonski is sentenced
to 364 days in county jail,

998
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:45,175
eligible for parole in 30 days time.

999
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,177
- My God.
- That ain't right.

1000
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,429
You can do it, Pete.

1001
01:11:48,887 --> 01:11:51,390
The defendant is remanded.

1002
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:56,894
Marie?

1003
01:11:58,063 --> 01:11:59,064
Marie!

1004
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:04,069
Ladies and gentleman, thank you
for your service. You are dismissed.

1005
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:07,323
All rise.

1006
01:13:56,473 --> 01:13:58,559
Today, justice was served.

1007
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:02,104
We were given proof
that no one is above the law.

1008
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:04,648
And everyone, including the police,

1009
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:06,859
will be held accountable
for their actions.

1010
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:11,405
Now this victory may not lessen
the tragedy of a young life cut short,

1011
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:15,451
nor heal the hearts of a family
who suffered unspeakable loss.

1012
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:17,536
But we must move forward.

1013
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:34,339
I once thought that blindfold
was a good thing.

1014
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:39,136
Her back's turned to us, too.

1015
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:41,722
Unless that's her...

1016
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:44,933
- Say it.
- I wasn't gonna.

1017
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,563
Then you've really changed.

1018
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:51,690
Yeah, you have too.

1019
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:06,955
We failed him.

1020
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:09,833
Maybe we all did.

1021
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:17,758
It was good working with you, KJ Harper.

1022
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:23,180
Yeah. You too, Fish.

1023
01:17:26,683 --> 01:17:28,310
- See ya around.
- Yep.

1024
01:17:28,852 --> 01:17:30,812
- Don't forget about those mints.
- Yeah.

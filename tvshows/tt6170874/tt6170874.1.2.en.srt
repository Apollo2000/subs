1
00:00:01,572 --> 00:00:04,621
Ladies and gentlemen,
tech pioneer Darius Tanz.

2
00:00:04,624 --> 00:00:06,223
Sir, my name's Liam Cole.

3
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:07,320
I'm a student at MIT.

4
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:09,926
In 186 days, an asteroid's
gonna collide with Earth,

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,085
and we're all gonna die.

6
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:13,830
Previously on Salvation...

7
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,166
What about you? What important

8
00:00:15,168 --> 00:00:17,668
savetheworld work
are you doing at MIT?

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,270
I'm creating a map of space.

10
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,683
Professor Croft, it's Liam.

11
00:00:22,685 --> 00:00:23,920
There's something there that was

12
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:25,164
- not there three months ago.
- Really?

13
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,734
People need to see this immediately.

14
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:28,736
911? My professor, he disappeared.

15
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:30,460
I'm onto something
that someone, somewhere

16
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:31,396
doesn't want public.

17
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,850
The sky is falling,

18
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:33,951
and you may be the only person

19
00:00:33,953 --> 00:00:35,219
that can do something about it.

20
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:36,375
You run DOD point

21
00:00:36,378 --> 00:00:38,055
- for all things NASA.
- Is there a problem?

22
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:39,587
Depends on whether a
planetkilling asteroid

23
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:40,524
is heading our way.

24
00:00:40,526 --> 00:00:42,326
Grace Barrows, DOD Public Affairs.

25
00:00:42,328 --> 00:00:43,375
You wanted to see me?

26
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:45,578
Dr. Eduard Acosta discovered an asteroid

27
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:48,348
large enough to cause an
extinctionlevel event.

28
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:49,584
So what is the plan?

29
00:00:49,587 --> 00:00:50,630
A gravity tractor.

30
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,537
That would deflect the asteroid
through gravitational pull.

31
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:56,007
I'm sorry. I never wanted
to burden you with this.

32
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:57,908
You're confident this will work?

33
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,477
Yes. You don't have to stay.

34
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,620
I can't leave, but if I stay,

35
00:01:01,623 --> 00:01:02,789
no more secrets.

36
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:04,024
There was a burn test today.

37
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:05,300
- And how'd it go?
- Perfect.

38
00:01:05,303 --> 00:01:07,376
Not sure what they were
testing, but they failed.

39
00:01:07,378 --> 00:01:09,057
What the...?

40
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,514
You're right, Darius. The
government's plan won't work.

41
00:01:11,516 --> 00:01:13,549
You said the technology
doesn't exist yet.

42
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:15,317
If you're so damn smart, invent it.

43
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,284
Come work with us.

44
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:17,854
Hi. Where can I put my stuff?

45
00:01:27,598 --> 00:01:29,732
Okay. Passport,

46
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:31,667
antibiotics, cell phone charger... ooh,

47
00:01:31,669 --> 00:01:33,669
and the ambassador's cell number.

48
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:35,604
If you have any problems,
he's a personal friend.

49
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:37,306
Mom, it's Africa, not Jupiter.

50
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:38,807
But I'm just a Skype away.

51
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:40,242
Okay.

52
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:46,115
What's happening?

53
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:47,650
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

54
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:49,118
Told me what?

55
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:54,089
Happy birthday.

56
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:55,524
Okay. Whoa, hey, there's fire here.

57
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:57,927
Sorry.

58
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:00,429
Sorry.

59
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:01,997
- Bad dream.
- Yeah.

60
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,299
Bad night, apparently.

61
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:04,567
You all right?

62
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:06,235
Yeah, yeah.

63
00:02:07,305 --> 00:02:10,806
Yeah, I must have just
conked out on the couch.

64
00:02:10,808 --> 00:02:13,208
I'm still working on your birthday gift.

65
00:02:14,545 --> 00:02:16,245
But in the meantime,

66
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:19,348
gluten and dairyfree for the woman

67
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,050
that likes to live on the edge.

68
00:02:21,052 --> 00:02:22,918
Thank you, baby.

69
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,820
Make a wish.

70
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,530
So Darius Tanz

71
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:36,665
left the embassy ball
with a Pentagon flack

72
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:39,568
and a kid from MIT, and
you think that's a story?

73
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,420
They had a secret
meeting in his compound

74
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:43,639
in the middle of the night.

75
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,374
Amanda, this is CapitolEyesNews.com,

76
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,875
not The Washington Post.

77
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:49,211
We do not have the money
to fund goose chases.

78
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:52,006
A Pentagon employee was
murdered the next day.

79
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,909
My guy at Metro Police
slipped me the file.

80
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:56,585
His name's Walter Carnahan,
he was in satellite operations

81
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:58,745
with top security clearance.

82
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:01,873
- So what's the autopsy say?
- There was none.

83
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,613
Someone's trying to keep this quiet.

84
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,794
The question is why?

85
00:03:16,474 --> 00:03:18,007
Happy birthday, boss.

86
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:19,441
Thanks.

87
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:21,377
Older but not wiser.

88
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:23,746
Delivery just came for
you, but there was no card.

89
00:03:23,748 --> 00:03:25,080
Secret admirer?

90
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:26,982
Yeah. You know me,

91
00:03:26,984 --> 00:03:29,400
got them lining up out the door.

92
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:46,669
Thank you for the flowers.

93
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:48,337
What flowers?

94
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,942
Hey, I, I also got
you a little something.

95
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:55,444
You didn't need to...

96
00:03:55,446 --> 00:03:56,779
No.

97
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:58,947
I did.

98
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:03,285
A4 security badge.

99
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,521
The way to a woman's heart.

100
00:04:05,523 --> 00:04:06,955
If you're gonna be on the task force,

101
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:09,158
you need the highest level clearance.

102
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,026
So I can tell you everything.

103
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:16,231
The rocket test failed, Grace.

104
00:04:19,804 --> 00:04:22,371
I couldn't tell you before,

105
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:24,940
but now...

106
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:29,812
No more secrets.

107
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:32,314
No more secrets?

108
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:34,216
So...

109
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:36,752
Your birthday dinner.

110
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,921
You know, once upon
a time, we had plans.

111
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:42,057
Well, you just gave me
the highest level clearance.

112
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:45,327
What would it look like if
anyone thought we were...?

113
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:46,762
Yeah, I know, I know.

114
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:49,067
We need to keep this professional, but...

115
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,999
We could have a professional dinner.

116
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,601
Could we? Really?

117
00:04:52,603 --> 00:04:55,104
Yeah.

118
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:57,639
Come on, I don't want you
to be alone on your birthday.

119
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,374
Me, neither.

120
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:04,513
Yeah?

121
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:06,682
They're ready for you.

122
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:14,056
As we're all aware,
the rocket test failed.

123
00:05:14,058 --> 00:05:16,058
We can't launch a gravity tractor

124
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,727
up to the asteroid in time
to divert it off its path.

125
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:22,276
But our planetary
defense team has a viable

126
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,699
alternative plan.

127
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:24,833
Dr. Strauss.

128
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:26,602
Thank you, Deputy Secretary.

129
00:05:26,604 --> 00:05:28,437
After reviewing the alternatives,

130
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,206
we believe that this
is the next best option.

131
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,075
The IO Probe.

132
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:34,676
A NASA spacecraft

133
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:35,978
currently orbiting Jupiter.

134
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,212
The plan would be

135
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:39,381
to redirect it from Jupiter's orbit,

136
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:40,749
and propel it into the asteroid.

137
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:41,884
The impact

138
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:44,407
could alter its trajectory just enough

139
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,977
for it to miss Earth.

140
00:05:49,193 --> 00:05:50,325
Throwing rocks

141
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:51,827
at an oncoming train, a bold strategy.

142
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,295
I'll be right behind you.

143
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:54,963
You have an issue with this plan?

144
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:56,632
Yes. In a word,

145
00:05:56,634 --> 00:05:58,700
it stinks... That's two words, actually.

146
00:05:58,702 --> 00:06:00,035
What Captain Planet here

147
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:02,137
fails to mention is
that a highvelocity

148
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:04,006
kinetic impact could just as easily

149
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:06,508
smash our asteroid friend
into several pieces...

150
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,396
Now you've turned one problem into ten.

151
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,814
It's raining asteroids, each of which

152
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:13,482
may cause cataclysmic damage.

153
00:06:13,484 --> 00:06:15,050
I take it that you have a better idea?

154
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:16,552
You had it right the first time:

155
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:17,853
The gravity tractor.

156
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,188
Send it up, do a flyby,

157
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,824
the mass of the GT pulls the
asteroid off its trajectory.

158
00:06:22,827 --> 00:06:24,560
No muss, no fuss,

159
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:26,199
- no loss of life.
- Darius,

160
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:27,663
I just said, we don't have

161
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,348
- the technology...
- Not yet.

162
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:32,534
All we need is a working EM drive,

163
00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:34,036
and I can build it.

164
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:36,104
An electromagnetic drive?

165
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:37,573
You're insane.

166
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:39,062
You're not the first to say so.

167
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,742
What exactly is an EM drive?

168
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:42,511
Liam?

169
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:44,479
A rocket can only carry

170
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:45,848
so much fuel.

171
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,082
Right? So you get one big initial

172
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:48,650
push from the thrust, and that's as fast

173
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:50,216
as it's ever gonna go.

174
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:51,587
But with an EM drive,

175
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:53,388
the force is small but it's constant,

176
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,690
so it keeps accelerating,

177
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:56,258
getting faster and faster as it goes.

178
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,826
With an EM drive, we can get to the moon

179
00:06:57,828 --> 00:06:58,894
in hours instead of days,

180
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,662
to Mars in a few weeks
instead of months,

181
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:02,231
and to our asteroid friend here,

182
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:03,999
with just enough time
for a gravity tractor...

183
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:05,570
You had it right the first time...

184
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:07,803
To save us all from extinction.

185
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:11,006
No one has ever built
a working EM drive.

186
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:13,609
It violates the laws
of Newtonian physics.

187
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:16,044
Andand Newtonian physics
violated Aristotelian physics

188
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:18,547
back in the day, you know,
laws were made to be broken.

189
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:20,343
II could drone on about

190
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:22,885
pilot wave theory and
quantum vacuum fluctuations,

191
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:25,420
but seeing as we have
approximately 181 days

192
00:07:25,422 --> 00:07:28,056
left to live, I'd rather just
go off and build the damn thing,

193
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:28,981
if you don't mind.

194
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:31,497
And what would it take to
“build the damn thing”?

195
00:07:33,063 --> 00:07:34,396
$2 billion.

196
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:39,167
To start.

197
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,003
Okay, a request that large
would have to go through

198
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:42,237
congressional oversight.

199
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:43,472
The White House doesn't want us

200
00:07:43,474 --> 00:07:45,340
raising any red flags in Congress.

201
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:47,474
Any leak, at all,

202
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:49,378
could cause widespread panic, anarchy.

203
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,081
Especially when there's no proof
that this thing actually works.

204
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,250
They said the Manhattan
Project would take ten years.

205
00:07:55,252 --> 00:07:57,219
They did it in two.

206
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:59,855
They got together the
greatest minds on Earth,

207
00:07:59,857 --> 00:08:02,124
and they did it because they had to.

208
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:04,860
I'm sorry, but this is
no time for bureaucracy.

209
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:07,062
Darius is saying he has
a plan to save us all,

210
00:08:07,064 --> 00:08:08,597
so let him do it.

211
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:10,866
Or at least try.

212
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:18,707
All right.

213
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,475
Half.

214
00:08:20,477 --> 00:08:22,544
I'll get you half.

215
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,583
The world's going to be
reduced to a ball of ash

216
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:30,285
in six months, but no,
let's all play but the rules.

217
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:31,379
- Darius, stop.
- Yeah, well, I agreed

218
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:32,220
to work with the Pentagon.

219
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:33,355
I thought it'd be a twoway street.

220
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:34,823
He just got you a
billion dollars in there.

221
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:36,158
- That's something.
- You told me you'd do whatever it takes.

222
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,192
Get me what I need.

223
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:39,761
Fine, what else do you need?

224
00:08:41,632 --> 00:08:43,532
100 kilos of enriched uranium.

225
00:08:43,534 --> 00:08:46,568
Let's make it 1,000
while we're asking.

226
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:49,271
You're insane.

227
00:08:49,273 --> 00:08:50,505
Why does everyone keep saying that?

228
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:52,007
- It's kinda true.
- No one is going to approve

229
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:54,576
the transfer of radioactive
bombmaking materials to you

230
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:56,178
without asking questions
that we can't answer.

231
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,180
Exactly. Grace, bureaucratic red tape

232
00:08:58,182 --> 00:08:59,982
will kill us before the
asteroid ever gets here.

233
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:01,750
We need to think bigger
than the government does

234
00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:03,952
and move a hell of a lot faster.

235
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:05,153
So what are you suggesting?

236
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:07,689
We both know Harris is
one of a handful of people

237
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:09,124
with access codes that would allow

238
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:10,425
for the transfer of nuclear material.

239
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:11,626
No, he'll never agree to this.

240
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:12,761
I know.

241
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:15,097
So you want me to go behind his back.

242
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:16,527
Betray my boss.

243
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,066
Your "boss"?

244
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,736
It's treason.

245
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:23,418
This is where rubber meets road, Grace.

246
00:09:23,421 --> 00:09:26,475
You want to help me save
the human race or don't you?

247
00:09:44,728 --> 00:09:47,162
So, in order to save the world

248
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:48,764
we need a billion dollars we don't have,

249
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:49,918
uranium we can't get,

250
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,000
and technology that doesn't even exist?

251
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:53,635
So far, so good.

252
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:56,038
If Superman caught the
villain on page two,

253
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,305
what fun would that be?

254
00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:58,573
Fun? That's what this is?

255
00:09:58,575 --> 00:10:00,075
Darius, the satellite
team needs five minutes

256
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:01,877
and the telecom group sent design specs.

257
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,545
Push everything. You have the TID?

258
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:05,547
This opens up any door at Tanz.

259
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:07,210
Almost any door.

260
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:09,518
Hey, so about

261
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,786
those three impossible tasks...

262
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:12,226
You see roadblocks, I see challenges.

263
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:13,494
Well, no, Newton's third law

264
00:10:13,497 --> 00:10:14,797
isn't a roadblock, it's a brick wall.

265
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,758
I've had a team working on
EM drive for three years.

266
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,493
We've made progress, I just need help

267
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,828
to expedite it over the finish line.

268
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,930
- What kind of help?
- Malcolm Croft.

269
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:23,098
My professor?

270
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,067
He's been experimenting
with EM drive theory.

271
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:26,935
Yeah, I know, but he's
gone, he's gone AWOL.

272
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:28,737
It's not so much him
we need as his research.

273
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:30,839
It may be the missing piece.

274
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:32,374
Well, my buddy Diego was Croft's T.A.

275
00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:34,009
I can call him and see what he knows.

276
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:35,343
You'll do better than that.

277
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:36,912
- You're going to Boston.
- I am?

278
00:10:36,914 --> 00:10:38,346
Helicopter's waiting out back.

279
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:41,119
- Helicopter? But I...
- Hate airplanes. Yeah.

280
00:10:41,122 --> 00:10:42,984
- Helicopter.
- No, I hate sky.

281
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:45,053
You know, and the potential to
fall out of it. I like trains.

282
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:46,822
Yeah, why don't you
just saddle up a snail?

283
00:10:46,824 --> 00:10:49,691
It's not like the fate of the
world's hanging in the balance.

284
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:51,416
- This is...
- Some walkingaround money.

285
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:53,862
You never know when
it's gonna come in handy.

286
00:10:53,864 --> 00:10:57,232
- Where are you going?
- To find a billion dollars.

287
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:16,884
Why bring Darius in if
you're not gonna give him

288
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:18,629
everything he needs to get the job done?

289
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:20,265
Two billion dollars?

290
00:11:20,268 --> 00:11:22,978
What else has he got on his
shopping list... nuclear weapons?

291
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,748
- And if he did?
- I'd say no.

292
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,552
Grace, I want Darius
to succeed. We all do.

293
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:31,086
But this is a governmentrun operation

294
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:32,621
under the tightest veil of secrecy.

295
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:33,912
There's protocol here.

296
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:36,717
What good is protocol if
we're all dead in six months?

297
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:43,432
Harris.

298
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,701
Okay, send it in.

299
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:47,937
I got to take this.

300
00:11:49,753 --> 00:11:52,374
Yes, Mr. Vice President.

301
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:09,063
Catherine.

302
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:11,411
Darius.

303
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:14,302
What's so pressing it couldn't wait?

304
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:16,304
Let me guess. You're busy saving

305
00:12:16,306 --> 00:12:17,739
the world again.

306
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:19,374
Someone has to.

307
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:20,875
Yeah, still amazes me.

308
00:12:20,877 --> 00:12:22,243
All you've built.

309
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,978
We built.

310
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:26,340
To think it all started with a deal

311
00:12:26,343 --> 00:12:27,809
signed on a cocktail napkin.

312
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:29,645
And a weekend in Fiji.

313
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:35,321
But you didn't ask me here
to walk down memory lane.

314
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:39,193
What if I told you I'm embarking

315
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:42,030
on the biggest project
I've ever undertaken?

316
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:44,732
One that could pay financial dividends

317
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:46,153
for centuries?

318
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:47,589
How much do you need?

319
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:50,026
A billion, to start. You'd get

320
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:51,692
one of the first seats to Mars.

321
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:54,463
Why don't you just come
up with the money yourself?

322
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:56,608
I've already emptied my
own pockets for this one.

323
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,486
Your passion gets in the
way of your business sense.

324
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:00,889
Nothing's worth doing

325
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:02,914
unless you're willing
to lose everything.

326
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,017
And you have. Twice.

327
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:09,415
But I'm not willing to lose everything,

328
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:13,119
so perhaps you should
show me what you got.

329
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:15,655
That can be arranged.

330
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,266
Diego?

331
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:29,402
Dude, I thought you went
to work for Darius Tanz.

332
00:13:29,404 --> 00:13:31,537
- II did. I am.
- You lucky sack.

333
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:33,806
You know you're the envy
of every student on campus.

334
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:35,641
- Is it epic?
- Epic does not capture.

335
00:13:35,643 --> 00:13:37,310
Look, I can't explain, but have

336
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:39,011
- you heard from Croft?
- No, man. I guess

337
00:13:39,013 --> 00:13:40,871
that, sabbatical thing was real.

338
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:42,887
He bounced. Don't
think he's coming back.

339
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,021
- Did he leave behind any of his research?
- Cleaned out his office.

340
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:46,322
You know how paranoid he was.

341
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,691
He'd never leave anything behind.

342
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:50,034
The EM drive... did you
work with him on that?

343
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,291
Yeah, for, like, ten
minutes. It was a dead end.

344
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:54,093
Croft said it was kind
of like trying to fly

345
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:55,795
by pulling yourself up by your hair.

346
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:57,941
- Only works in cartoons.
- Crap.

347
00:13:57,944 --> 00:13:59,465
Although, there was this one time

348
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:01,300
he took all his T.A.s out for dinner,

349
00:14:01,302 --> 00:14:03,369
and had a little too much to
drink, and started rambling

350
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:07,126
about having a super secret
backup hidden at his place.

351
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:08,174
Backup drive?

352
00:14:08,176 --> 00:14:11,377
Like I said, paranoid.

353
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:13,532
Dude, you rock. Thank you.

354
00:14:13,535 --> 00:14:15,148
Hey,

355
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,682
whatever happened to that
girl with the notebook?

356
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:18,518
- What's her name?
- Jillian.

357
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,686
What if no one

358
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:22,155
comes?

359
00:14:22,157 --> 00:14:24,540
You finished a novel.

360
00:14:24,543 --> 00:14:26,392
That's an accomplishment.

361
00:14:26,394 --> 00:14:28,161
You got to get used
to sharing your work.

362
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:31,097
Yeah, my selfpublished
work, 'cause no one wanted it.

363
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:35,329
And I'm reading it in
my parents' bookstore.

364
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,337
Hey, what about that boy
from, from MIT you met?

365
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,739
You could invite him.

366
00:14:39,741 --> 00:14:41,140
He moved to D.C.

367
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:44,510
That's too bad.

368
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:46,272
Yeah.

369
00:15:30,736 --> 00:15:33,426
Grace, press briefing in ten.

370
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:35,962
Thank you.

371
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:40,499
Setting the table for
renewed military cooperation

372
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:42,201
between the United States and India.

373
00:15:42,203 --> 00:15:44,203
Any other questions?

374
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:45,838
Hey, Frank. New tie?

375
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,575
Your wife has good taste.
Thank you, everyone.

376
00:15:49,577 --> 00:15:52,812
Ms. Barrows, can you comment
on the recent murder of DOD

377
00:15:52,814 --> 00:15:55,414
employee Walter Carnahan at his home?

378
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:03,389
For reasons of privacy,
we cannot comment

379
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:05,491
on personal employee matters.

380
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:06,659
Thank you.

381
00:16:22,577 --> 00:16:24,911
Professor Croft?

382
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:42,194
I can't believe... this is my life.

383
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:56,542
911? My professor...
His place is trashed,

384
00:16:56,544 --> 00:16:58,754
and he didn't show up for class.

385
00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:35,181
Damn.

386
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:40,253
Hello?

387
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:11,465
What are we looking at?

388
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:13,219
The Tanz Goliath 2 rocket.

389
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:14,887
- They failed.
- Shut it down, Carn.

390
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:16,088
Shut it down!

391
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,792
Excuse me. I'm looking for Carnahan?

392
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:22,028
- Who?
- Walter Carnahan. This is his station.

393
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:24,284
DDo you know what happened to him?

394
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:25,398
Beats me, I'm the new guy.

395
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,333
Pete.

396
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:32,571
Grace?

397
00:18:32,573 --> 00:18:34,540
Did we kill Walter Carnahan?

398
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:36,526
Harris.

399
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:46,469
Grace, listen to yourself.
You really believe

400
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:48,473
the U.S. government carries
out hits on its own people?

401
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:49,917
I don't know what I believe.

402
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,753
I just know my friend is dead.

403
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,990
Why would the government want
to kill a lowlevel sat tech?

404
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:58,092
Maybe he accessed files

405
00:18:58,094 --> 00:18:59,594
he wasn't supposed to.

406
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,396
What files?

407
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:04,332
I don't...

408
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:06,934
Hey, hey, Grace.

409
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:11,406
Look, with everything we know,
it's easy to get paranoid.

410
00:19:11,408 --> 00:19:15,009
But there's nothing here.

411
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,480
Maybe you're right.

412
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:05,442
Grace.

413
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,596
I, I'm so sorry,

414
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:10,442
your assistant sent me up.

415
00:20:10,445 --> 00:20:12,178
She said you were
finishing up a meeting.

416
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:15,135
And we are. Grace
Barrows, Catherine Adams.

417
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:17,939
Grace is my government
liaison for the Mars project

418
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:19,941
- I was telling you about.
- Yes.

419
00:20:19,943 --> 00:20:22,212
- Nice to meet you.
- Catherine and I

420
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:24,611
have been intertwined for many years.

421
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:26,214
She funded my very first creation

422
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:28,216
and possibly my next.

423
00:20:28,218 --> 00:20:30,218
Good to see you again, Darius.

424
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,787
- I'll be in touch.
- Soon, I hope. Um...

425
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:34,809
I'm meeting Mark Cuban tomorrow
and you know he doesn't like

426
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:35,952
to share the wealth.

427
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:38,658
You didn't tell me there
was any competition.

428
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:40,461
There's always competition.

429
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:46,067
Lucky for me, I always win.

430
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:50,958
I'm not even gonna ask.

431
00:20:50,961 --> 00:20:52,427
Good, 'cause I'm not gonna tell.

432
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,642
Now, I assume you're here for a reason.

433
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:56,744
You were right.

434
00:20:56,746 --> 00:20:58,713
We can't trust the government.

435
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,482
We have to do this ourselves.

436
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:02,817
Uranium.

437
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:05,386
I know where to get it.

438
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:06,921
She tried to cover, but I could tell

439
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:08,956
she was rattled by the Carnahan thing.

440
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,926
If I could just talk to her in
person, just the two of us...

441
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:14,262
Yeah, I'm sure she'll go for that.

442
00:21:14,264 --> 00:21:16,998
Maybe Ms. Barrows needs
a little motivation.

443
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,332
Okay, we both just got promoted.

444
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:20,334
Please do not do anything stupid.

445
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:21,469
Are you kidding me?

446
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:23,104
I'm gonna put us on the map.

447
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:25,273
Don't screw this up.

448
00:21:48,031 --> 00:21:50,298
This is grim.

449
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,800
Well.

450
00:21:52,802 --> 00:21:54,001
It's all right.

451
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:55,636
Today, there's four people.

452
00:21:55,638 --> 00:21:58,206
Next time, there will be eight.

453
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:01,609
Get 'em.

454
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,078
Okay...

455
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:26,334
Hi there.

456
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:27,751
Thank you all for coming.

457
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:29,570
I'm Jillian Hayes

458
00:22:29,572 --> 00:22:32,707
and this is Shadow Side.

459
00:22:34,177 --> 00:22:36,210
Thanks, Dad.

460
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:40,760
Hey, guys.

461
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:42,016
Do you want to make some quick cash?

462
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:43,217
What you talking about, man?

463
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:45,119
"Vel Durok had been stranded before."

464
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:47,855
Once in Yosemite, when
a freak snowstorm hit.

465
00:22:47,857 --> 00:22:49,891
Another time when she was

466
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:52,059
"in the Gobi Desert when her camel died."

467
00:22:56,248 --> 00:23:00,334
"She always managed to
outrun fate, to cheat death."

468
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:03,604
But now she was over two
lightyears from home,

469
00:23:03,606 --> 00:23:06,374
trapped alone on the
shadow side of a planet

470
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:08,776
"that as yet had no name."

471
00:23:29,232 --> 00:23:32,033
I wasn't sure you were game
after our last conversation.

472
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,001
Neither was I.

473
00:23:36,057 --> 00:23:37,554
What changed your mind?

474
00:23:37,557 --> 00:23:39,307
Things.

475
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,442
You sure the government can't track

476
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:42,576
what we're doing here?

477
00:23:42,578 --> 00:23:44,979
This computer, this room,
is surveillance proof.

478
00:23:44,981 --> 00:23:47,148
I should knowб I built it myself.

479
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,051
Okay.

480
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,986
There are a handful of
uranium storage facilities

481
00:23:51,988 --> 00:23:53,454
around the country.

482
00:23:53,456 --> 00:23:55,491
This one's our best bet.

483
00:23:55,494 --> 00:23:56,924
The WIPP.

484
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:58,859
A Waste Isolation Pilot Plant.

485
00:23:58,861 --> 00:24:00,094
Out near Wallops.

486
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:01,435
20 miles from here.

487
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:04,245
They store radioactive waste
from nuclear weapons processing.

488
00:24:04,248 --> 00:24:06,600
So, you've enlisted Harris to help?

489
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:08,836
No, his hands are tied.

490
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,271
But mine aren't.

491
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:12,440
You're stealing the code.

492
00:24:12,442 --> 00:24:15,710
Every day Harris is issued
a new authorization code,

493
00:24:15,712 --> 00:24:18,913
allowing him to approve the
transfer of nuclear material.

494
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,955
Now, I can get into the WIPP facility,

495
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,084
but I can't get the
uranium without that code

496
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,785
and it expires at midnight.

497
00:24:24,787 --> 00:24:27,755
And he keeps it in his briefcase
secured with a biometric lock.

498
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:28,875
Yes.

499
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:30,511
How are you gonna access it?

500
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:33,627
We're having dinner tonight.

501
00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:35,963
Look, this is a complex plan.

502
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:37,498
There's no guarantees.

503
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,699
But you wouldn't be
here if you didn't think

504
00:24:38,701 --> 00:24:40,146
you could pull it off, would you?

505
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:43,304
Darius, I don't want
Harris implicated. Okay?

506
00:24:43,306 --> 00:24:45,573
If anything goes wrong, I take the fall.

507
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:47,608
You sure about this?

508
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,643
Am I sure?

509
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:52,646
I've been a rulefollower
my whole life.

510
00:24:52,648 --> 00:24:54,482
I never drive alone in the carpool lane.

511
00:24:54,484 --> 00:24:56,851
If it says ten items
or less, I have less.

512
00:24:56,853 --> 00:24:58,795
And now I'm considering stealing uranium

513
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:00,397
from the United States government.

514
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,033
And betraying a man you love.

515
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:08,608
Am I sure?

516
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:10,631
Absolutely not.

517
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:14,854
But like you said, we're talking
about the fate of the world.

518
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:19,507
The rule book just went out the window.

519
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,747
This just came for you, handdelivered.

520
00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:28,883
Thanks.

521
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:01,816
So glad you could join me.

522
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:04,885
You have the subtlety of a hand grenade.

523
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:07,621
You know there's nothing going
on between me and Darius Tanz.

524
00:26:07,623 --> 00:26:08,856
What do you want?

525
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,791
- The real story.
- Okay.

526
00:26:10,793 --> 00:26:13,527
Amanda, you've been a
journalist for, what...

527
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:14,995
five minutes?

528
00:26:14,997 --> 00:26:17,031
And I hesitate to use
the word "journalist."

529
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,537
I have a master's in
Journalism from Columbia.

530
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,402
- I interned at the Post.
- Well, then

531
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:24,238
you should know real reporters
don't publish fake news.

532
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,441
A DOD employee with high
security clearance was murdered.

533
00:26:27,443 --> 00:26:28,542
That's not fake.

534
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:30,811
Yes. A robbery gone wrong.

535
00:26:30,813 --> 00:26:34,248
Yeah, so wrong that his body
was released to his family

536
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,117
without a formal autopsy?

537
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,418
That's at the M.E.'s discretion.

538
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,753
Happens under the
rarest of circumstances.

539
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:41,722
This falls way outside normal protocol.

540
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:45,092
I bet you could find a
conspiracy in a game of solitaire.

541
00:26:45,094 --> 00:26:48,629
I spoke with Walt Carnahan's sister.

542
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:51,056
She said he was troubled

543
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,134
about something that happened at work.

544
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:54,568
Troubled how?

545
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,338
He saw a file he wasn't
supposed to see, apparently.

546
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,606
Project Atlas.

547
00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:00,274
Atlas? I've never heard of it.

548
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:03,010
She said if anything happened to him,

549
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:04,645
that it wasn't an accident.

550
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:09,617
Look, Amanda, I've never heard of Atlas.

551
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:12,286
And what happened to
Walt Carnahan is tragic,

552
00:27:12,288 --> 00:27:13,687
but it's not a conspiracy.

553
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,325
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to be somewhere.

554
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:20,826
And feel free to
publish those photos.

555
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:22,362
Red's my color.

556
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:39,647
Yeah, right here is fine.

557
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:42,349
- Thanks. Keep the change.
- Hey, thanks.

558
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,633
- Professor Croft.
- Shh, shh, shh.

559
00:27:59,635 --> 00:28:01,669
It's not safe. Come on.

560
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:09,712
When you left,

561
00:28:09,714 --> 00:28:11,313
I called my friend at NASA

562
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,816
just to check your math
and about two hours later,

563
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:16,986
these spooks show up,
no warrant, no nothing.

564
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:20,156
Tossed everything and I
escaped out the back door.

565
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:21,991
Your discovery has
rattled someone, Liam.

566
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:24,077
How did you know I was in your house?

567
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,408
A remote security camera.

568
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:27,795
Jesus, you really are paranoid.

569
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:29,565
Well, it turns out I have reason to be.

570
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:32,635
I have a way to protect us both,

571
00:28:32,637 --> 00:28:34,905
but I need to know
where your research is

572
00:28:34,908 --> 00:28:36,505
on the EM drive.

573
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,941
- The EM drive?
- Please, tell me you have

574
00:28:38,943 --> 00:28:41,877
that research saved
to a cloud somewhere.

575
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:43,279
No, the cloud's not safe.

576
00:28:44,248 --> 00:28:45,848
But this is.

577
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,249
What's on this?

578
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:49,084
Everything.

579
00:28:55,326 --> 00:28:57,226
Professor.

580
00:28:57,228 --> 00:28:58,561
We need to go.

581
00:28:58,563 --> 00:29:00,262
Right now. Back door.

582
00:29:01,632 --> 00:29:03,599
Here's to you...

583
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:06,468
and another trip around the sun.

584
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:09,572
Hopefully not our last.

585
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,321
Harris.

586
00:29:25,323 --> 00:29:26,555
What's Atlas?

587
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:32,795
Where did you hear that name?

588
00:29:32,797 --> 00:29:35,798
A reporter from Capitol Eyes.

589
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,399
Carnahan told his sister

590
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:40,936
if anything happened to
him, it was because of Atlas.

591
00:29:40,938 --> 00:29:45,307
Grace, don't say that word to anybody...

592
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:46,990
ever.

593
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:52,266
Okay, I... I'm sorry. Itit's...

594
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:55,084
There are still things

595
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:57,152
above your clearance level.

596
00:29:57,154 --> 00:29:58,797
You understand?

597
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,487
Yeah, yeah, of course.

598
00:30:06,397 --> 00:30:08,163
My God.

599
00:30:08,165 --> 00:30:09,732
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

600
00:30:09,734 --> 00:30:12,101
It's okay.

601
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:14,069
You know what, let
me, let me go change.

602
00:30:14,071 --> 00:30:15,671
Okay.

603
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:16,905
Just give me a minute.

604
00:30:16,907 --> 00:30:19,208
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

605
00:30:48,356 --> 00:30:50,256
What gets red wine out?

606
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:51,707
Was it salt or peroxide?

607
00:30:53,544 --> 00:30:56,945
Hydrogen peroxide mixed
with dishwashing soap.

608
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:21,036
No, no, no, no, no.

609
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:37,666
You know, if you wanted my pants off,

610
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:38,901
you could've just asked.

611
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:43,792
Hey.

612
00:31:43,794 --> 00:31:45,327
Grace, you're shaking.

613
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:47,496
Look, I'm sorry.

614
00:31:47,498 --> 00:31:48,831
I didn't mean to scare you.

615
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:53,268
You know, it's just
thisthis job, you know...

616
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,181
the things we know.

617
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,080
Darius?

618
00:32:05,082 --> 00:32:06,382
Right now?

619
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:08,317
It's almost 10:00.

620
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:12,704
Yeah.

621
00:32:12,707 --> 00:32:16,291
Okay. Okay. I'll be there.

622
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:18,560
Darius has the money on the hook.

623
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,035
He needs me to sell our
collaboration to an investor.

624
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,033
Go, go. That's what's most important.

625
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,537
I wish I didn't have to
leave you on your birthday.

626
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:32,007
There's a lot of things we
wish we didn't have to do.

627
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:34,109
You go. I'll lock up.

628
00:32:53,998 --> 00:32:57,166
Code 95723. Charlie, Victor.

629
00:32:57,168 --> 00:33:00,803
Authorizing transfer of four
P9 barrels of Uranium235

630
00:33:00,805 --> 00:33:02,689
from the WIPP facility in Maryland.

631
00:33:02,692 --> 00:33:05,340
This had to be tonight?

632
00:33:05,342 --> 00:33:08,143
I'm just doing my
share, Deputy Secretary,

633
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:11,280
by selling my investor
on the Mars project.

634
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:13,114
And you don't mind lying to her

635
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:14,883
about where her money is really going?

636
00:33:14,885 --> 00:33:17,686
If we beat this thing,
then Mars is a go.

637
00:33:17,688 --> 00:33:19,988
If we don't, then...

638
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,124
a lie's a bit inconsequential,
don't you think?

639
00:33:25,095 --> 00:33:26,628
Good evening, gentlemen.

640
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,665
I understand you have a proposal for me.

641
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:47,683
A4 clearance.

642
00:33:47,685 --> 00:33:49,885
Yes, ma'am, what can I
do for you, Ms. Barrows?

643
00:33:52,189 --> 00:33:54,490
95723 Charlie, Victor.

644
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:56,925
Your authorization code is
verified, looks in order.

645
00:33:56,927 --> 00:33:58,026
Hope so.

646
00:33:58,028 --> 00:34:01,096
Dragged my ass out of bed for this.

647
00:34:01,098 --> 00:34:02,431
You just need to wait 20 minutes

648
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:04,233
until my supervisor can sign off.

649
00:34:04,235 --> 00:34:06,000
I don't have 20 minutes.

650
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:07,911
Sorry, ma'am, but that's not...

651
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:09,505
Corporal Nevins,

652
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,673
I know you've got your
orders... I appreciate that.

653
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,941
But I've got my orders as well.

654
00:34:12,943 --> 00:34:15,310
It's now ten minutes to midnight,

655
00:34:15,312 --> 00:34:17,312
and my authorization
code's about to expire.

656
00:34:17,314 --> 00:34:18,914
You saw my clearance level, correct?

657
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:20,682
- Yes, ma'am.
- Then you know my supervisor

658
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,484
is Deputy Secretary of Defense.

659
00:34:22,486 --> 00:34:24,987
Not the world's most patient man.

660
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,688
If I go back to the
Pentagon emptyhanded,

661
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,090
you know the first thing he'll ask?

662
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:30,158
"What was the stumbling
block, Ms. Barrows?"

663
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,828
I'm gonna have to tell him
the stumbling block was you.

664
00:34:34,732 --> 00:34:37,500
Now, can we get on with this?

665
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:53,215
The United States wants
to see an American flag

666
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:56,451
on the surface of Mars
just as much as Mr. Tanz.

667
00:34:56,453 --> 00:34:58,852
Tanz Industries will have full access

668
00:34:58,855 --> 00:35:00,756
to previously classified
defense technologies

669
00:35:00,758 --> 00:35:02,677
that could save tens if not hundreds

670
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,426
of millions of dollars in R&D.

671
00:35:04,428 --> 00:35:06,428
We're talking advanced radar,

672
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,729
hyperlight composites,

673
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,365
and nextgen manufacturing techniques.

674
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:12,334
Imagine what we could
do with DARPA's toy box

675
00:35:12,336 --> 00:35:15,504
at our disposal... you'd
get a piece of everything.

676
00:35:15,506 --> 00:35:18,106
Ticket sales, patents on
the scientific research.

677
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:21,009
Evolving fields of
medicine, energy, physics.

678
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:22,945
Small contribution to
change the course of history,

679
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:23,940
don't you think?

680
00:35:23,943 --> 00:35:25,847
Why the sudden spirit of collaboration

681
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:27,816
between Darius and the government?

682
00:35:27,818 --> 00:35:29,184
Not to be cynical, but...

683
00:35:29,186 --> 00:35:32,254
your relationship hasn't
always been so amicable.

684
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:35,123
Politics makes strange bedfellows.

685
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:39,661
We don't want anyone else
getting there first, do we?

686
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:43,532
And all you need from
me is a billion dollars.

687
00:35:50,374 --> 00:35:51,740
Load it up, guys.

688
00:35:51,742 --> 00:35:53,875
Yes, ma'am.

689
00:36:27,447 --> 00:36:29,211
That's the last one, ma'am.

690
00:36:29,213 --> 00:36:30,779
Let's move out.

691
00:36:34,718 --> 00:36:37,419
Stop right there!

692
00:36:39,186 --> 00:36:41,423
Ma'am, you're not authorized

693
00:36:41,425 --> 00:36:43,525
to be inside this facility
without my approval.

694
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:45,727
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, we
were on a tight timeline.

695
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:47,863
This is not proper protocol.

696
00:36:47,865 --> 00:36:49,831
I'm gonna need to call your supervisor.

697
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,266
Supervisor?

698
00:36:51,268 --> 00:36:54,102
Deputy Secretary Harris Edwards.

699
00:37:14,038 --> 00:37:16,438
So this is what billionaire
scotch tastes like.

700
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:18,975
Between us, that's
hundredmillionaire scotch at best.

701
00:37:18,978 --> 00:37:20,550
Come back after we save the planet,

702
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:22,485
I'll break out the really good stuff.

703
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,937
- Could have sworn that was me.
- No, that's me.

704
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,774
Sorry, I should actually take this.

705
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:35,718
Thanks for the drink.

706
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:44,440
Yes...

707
00:37:45,836 --> 00:37:47,469
this is Harris Edwards.

708
00:37:53,997 --> 00:37:55,396
Yes, sir.

709
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:01,824
Sorry for the delay.

710
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:03,793
You're all clear.

711
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:23,887
Just tell me we're one step closer

712
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,748
to saving the world.

713
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,050
The entire human race.

714
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:30,987
You were able to clone Harris' phone?

715
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:33,924
It's a Tanz phone, like all
governmentissued phones.

716
00:38:33,926 --> 00:38:36,326
One of my first big
contracts with the U.S. of A.

717
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:39,390
And you're sure there'll
be no blowback on him?

718
00:38:39,393 --> 00:38:42,094
All communications related
to this endeavor have been

719
00:38:42,097 --> 00:38:44,000
erased from existence.

720
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:46,536
Just one of the perks from
owning your own satellite fleet.

721
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:51,441
You really care for him, don't you?

722
00:38:53,445 --> 00:38:55,412
Good night, Darius.

723
00:38:55,414 --> 00:38:59,149
And Grace...

724
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:01,485
happy birthday.

725
00:39:06,622 --> 00:39:08,725
And many more.

726
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:09,686
You got it? Croft's research?

727
00:40:09,688 --> 00:40:11,021
I got you more than that.

728
00:40:14,508 --> 00:40:16,326
Malcolm Croft.

729
00:40:16,328 --> 00:40:17,758
Darius Tanz.

730
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:19,595
For a "C" student,

731
00:40:19,598 --> 00:40:22,299
- you've certainly done all right for yourself.
- I get by.

732
00:40:22,301 --> 00:40:24,425
I've been trying to crack
the EM drive for years.

733
00:40:24,427 --> 00:40:25,802
And I'm not the only one.

734
00:40:25,804 --> 00:40:27,471
Then let's compare
notes, see if together

735
00:40:27,473 --> 00:40:28,939
we can't do the impossible.

736
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:32,175
Hey, what the hell, Darius?

737
00:40:32,177 --> 00:40:34,979
This is Lazlo Simms,
my chief of security.

738
00:40:34,982 --> 00:40:36,645
You put a tail on me?

739
00:40:36,648 --> 00:40:38,048
Next time a headsup would be nice,

740
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,924
so you don't scare the
living crap out of me.

741
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:41,940
A good businessman always
protects his assets.

742
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:43,909
Professor, you'll be
comfortable here, and safe.

743
00:40:43,912 --> 00:40:45,539
Karissa, my assistant, she's downstairs.

744
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,349
- She'll... She'll show you to your room.
- All right.

745
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:50,227
Liam, what happened to the money?

746
00:40:50,229 --> 00:40:53,156
You were right, it came in handy.

747
00:41:01,874 --> 00:41:02,906
The girl?

748
00:41:02,908 --> 00:41:05,208
He went to see her.

749
00:41:07,946 --> 00:41:11,581
She's gonna be more of
a problem than I thought.

750
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:19,222
I don't care about the rules.

751
00:41:19,224 --> 00:41:21,558
If this is all the time we have left...

752
00:42:12,477 --> 00:42:14,699
Come on, earring, please be in here.

753
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:32,729
Looks like I got a real story now.

754
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:52,062

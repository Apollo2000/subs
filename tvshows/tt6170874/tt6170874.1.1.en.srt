or should I wear a dunce cap
so people know?

171

I haven't seen you around.

172

181

the future of mankind,

186

"Ideas Die Hard"?

187
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,898
I extrapolated from a set
of known facts and got lucky.

188
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,334
Honestly.

189

You are quite an observant guy.

190
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,371

191

cross paths, it can, uh...

Sir, that hurts.

245
00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:18,745
Well, last month,
you woke me up with this theory

246
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:20,313
that we're all living
in a fractal holographic matrix.

247
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:21,481

248

Yeah, well, I-I may have had a few

that night, Sir, but
this is different. Mm.

250
00:10:24,153 --> 00:10:25,985
There's a significant perturbation.

251
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:27,720
Really? I've been running continual

252

253
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:30,990
that was not there three months ago.
Well, you know,

254
00:10:30,992 --> 00:10:32,392
a slight miscalculation
could taint the results.

255
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:34,193
Why don't you give me the data?
I'll take a look.

some reports in the press

are completely unfounded?

from the Utah desert to Florida?

00:14:39,475 --> 00:14:40,875
I've been running simulations,

326
00:14:40,877 --> 00:14:42,476
trying to solve the N-body problem.

327
00:14:42,478 --> 00:14:44,112
How asteroids, comets interact
with each other.

328
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:47,215
Everybody at NASA is studying
NEOs we already know.

329
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:50,484
I've been looking for the ones
we've missed, and I found one.

330
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:56,424
I got the visuals here
if you want to take a look.

331
00:14:57,193 --> 00:14:58,693
(Chirping) Whoa.

332
00:14:58,695 --> 00:15:00,127
That's a holographic projector.

333
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:02,230
Yeah, it's a little toy
I've been working on.

334
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:05,466
Hope to have it in stores
by, um, Christmas 2020.

335
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:07,935
If the world still exists.

336
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:10,403
(Trilling)

337
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:12,906
Let's hear it. I'm listening.

338
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:16,176
Okay, yeah, well, uh,
this is the solar system today.

339
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:18,011
And, uh, excuse me. If you don't mind...

340
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:20,313
- I do.
- Um, and this...

341
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:22,950
is the asteroid. Let's call it "Rocky."

342
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:24,284
It's about 300 million miles out.

343
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:25,719
Now, my software,

344
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:27,520
which I'm happy to sell to you,
by the way,

345
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:30,223
predicts a trajectory for this
asteroid to collide with Earth,

346
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:32,859
like I said, in 186 days.

347
00:15:35,163 --> 00:15:37,364
Given its location and
its orbital configuration,

348
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:42,869
there is a 97.2% probability
that this is a planet killer.

349
00:15:42,871 --> 00:15:45,504
Okay.

350
00:15:45,506 --> 00:15:46,839
That's your supposition... hardly proof

351
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:48,474
that you or your data are correct.

352
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:49,942
No, I-I rechecked

353
00:15:49,944 --> 00:15:51,710
all my calculations last night.
They're solid.

354
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:53,880
And I showed the numbers
to my advisor, Professor Croft.

355
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:55,614
Five hours later, he disappeared,

356
00:15:55,616 --> 00:15:57,016
and didn't show up for class.

357
00:15:57,018 --> 00:15:58,817
His place was trashed. Trashed?

358
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:00,419
There were big, scary goons
staking out his house.

359
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:02,053
They chased my ass across campus.

360
00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:03,389
Now either this is
an amazing coincidence,

361
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:04,690
or I'm onto something

362
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:06,592
that someone, somewhere,
doesn't want public.

363
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:09,161
I'm telling you, Mr. Tanz,
the sky is falling.

364
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:12,464
And you may be the only person
that can do something about it.

365
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,134
Karissa, bring a car and fuel the jet.

366
00:16:16,136 --> 00:16:19,204
Where are you going?
<i>We're</i> going. To Washington.

367
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:27,879
(Elevator Bell Dings)

368
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:30,215
Okay, this is the Pentagon.

369
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:34,118
Wow. MIT is admitting
some big brains these days.

370
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,125
He's expecting you,

371
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:42,893
Mr. Tanz. Sit. Wait.

372
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:44,796
- But...
- Trust.

373
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:50,968
HARRIS: Darius.

374
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,304
They told me you were on your way over.

375
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:54,571
Is there a problem?

376
00:16:54,573 --> 00:16:56,006
Well, I'm not sure, Harris.

377
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:57,507
It depends on whether

378
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:59,043
a planet-killing asteroid
is heading our way.

379
00:16:59,045 --> 00:17:01,879
What are you talking about?

380
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:03,247
Asteroid, Earth.

381
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,014
(Imitates Explosion) Boom!

382
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:07,584
You run DOD point for all things NASA.

383
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:09,919
Okay, where are you getting
this science fiction from?

384
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:10,854
So it's not true?

385
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:12,422
No.

386
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:15,258
Okay, then you won't mind me

387
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,494
tweeting about an asteroid
poised to slam into Earth

388
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:19,396
in, say, 186 days

389
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:20,997
to my 20 million Twitter followers?

390
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,233
- (Phone Buzzes)
- Oh. Make that 21 million.

391
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:24,868
Okay, Darius...

392
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,469
So which is it?

393
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:28,872
Science or fiction?

394
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:32,075
(Sighs)

395
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:34,577
So those Goliath 2 rocket
engines you ordered from me

396
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:36,479
on an accelerated timeline, not exactly

397
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,313
for communication satellites, I take it.

398
00:17:38,315 --> 00:17:40,015
We have the brightest minds
working the problem...

399
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,351
No, you don't,
because you're not using me.

400
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,487
Oh, so what?
Without the great Darius Tanz,

401
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,255
we're all doomed? Is that it?

402
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:48,357
The way I see it,
you've got two choices:

403
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,159
Tell me or kill me.

404
00:17:52,797 --> 00:17:54,562
(Door Opens)

405
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:56,899
I'm going down to Joint Task Force.

406
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,267
Have Grace Barrows meet me there.

407
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:00,202
Who are you?

408
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,737
Liam Cole, MIT grad student, Sir.

409
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:04,172
TANZ: He arrived at the same

410
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:06,474
conclusion as NASA, but his
computer did it autonomously

411
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:08,643
while he was getting laid.

412
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:15,016
Get Mr. Cole clearance. Now.

413
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,756
You wanted to see me?

414
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:24,826
Darius Tanz, Grace Barrows,
DOD Public Affairs.

415
00:18:24,828 --> 00:18:26,360
Pleasure. We've met before.

416
00:18:26,362 --> 00:18:28,129
- Croatian Embassy.
- Good memory.

417
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:29,797
Photographic. It's a curse, trust me.

418
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,232
- (Elevator Bell Dings)
- Liam Cole.

419
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:33,100
- He works for me.
- I... I do.

420
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:34,701
I work for him.

421
00:18:34,703 --> 00:18:36,837
Shall we?

422
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:48,549
(Elevator Bell Dings)

423
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:06,899
(Beeps, Trills)

424
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:14,007
HARRIS: This is the command
center for Project Samson.

425
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:16,576
Of the 30,000 people
who work in the Pentagon,

426
00:19:16,578 --> 00:19:18,310
fewer than 40 have clearance.

427
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:21,524
COMPUTERIZED MALE VOICE:
<i>Security and soundproof measures activated.</i>

428
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:23,916
HARRIS: Three months ago,
through the Safeguard Survey System

429
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:26,919
that catalogues Near Earth
Objects, NASA astronomer

430
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:30,222
Dr. Eduard Acosta discovered
an asteroid, Samson,

431
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:32,658
seven kilometers wide, out near Jupiter.

432
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,461
Large enough to cause an
extinction-level event.

433
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:38,130
Trajectory data has now been firmed up,

434
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:40,165
and the latest calculations
show that Samson has

435
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:44,003
the potential to collide
with Earth in 186 days.

436
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:46,238
Our simulations give
it a high probability of

437
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,840
impact off the East Coast
of the United States.

438
00:19:48,842 --> 00:19:50,208
So that's why you're moving those nukes.

439
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,977
You think you're gonna
blow this fellow out of the sky.

440
00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:53,578
Well, nukes won't work.

441
00:19:54,615 --> 00:19:57,549
Sorry, but even if a nuclear explosion

442
00:19:57,551 --> 00:20:00,819
broke up the asteroid, it would
create thousands of meteors

443
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:02,286
that would rain down on Earth,

444
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:04,723
setting in motion cataclysmic
events all over the world.

445
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:05,557
Thank you, Liam.

446
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,991
No. He's right.

447
00:20:06,993 --> 00:20:08,859
It was explored, but
deemed too dangerous.

448
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:11,795
We've been working on impact prevention

449
00:20:11,797 --> 00:20:13,964
since Chelyabinsk, back in 2013.

450
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:16,234
That process has now been expedited.

451
00:20:16,236 --> 00:20:19,103
So what is the plan,
if you don't mind me asking?

452
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:22,540
This.

453
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:23,974
A gravity tractor.

454
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:25,676
(Beeps)

455
00:20:25,678 --> 00:20:26,710
LIAM: Oh, that would
deflect the asteroid

456
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:28,412
using gravitational pull.

457
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:31,348
Sorry.

458
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,417
We position a probe

459
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,052
next to the asteroid.
Even though its mass

460
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:37,755
is small, the probe generates
its own gravitational field.

461
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:40,057
Diverting the asteroid's path
just enough to miss Earth.

462
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,824
But you need a rocket powerful enough

463
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:45,028
to get it there in time, and
that rocket doesn't exist yet.

464
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,996
Well, actually, it does.

465
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:48,698
We've modified one of your rockets,

466
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,966
the Goliath 2.

467
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:52,369
The test phase is almost
complete. We launch next week.

468
00:20:52,371 --> 00:20:55,572
We have full confidence this
will take care of the problem,

469
00:20:55,574 --> 00:20:57,339
and no one will be the wiser.

470
00:20:59,377 --> 00:21:01,310
(Elevator Bell Dings)

471
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:04,346
I'm sure you understand why
this needs to remain classified.

472
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:05,615
If the public were to find out...

473
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:07,349
Of course. Anything you need.

474
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,686
My entire company stands at
your disposal, ready to help.

475
00:21:09,688 --> 00:21:11,788
Ah, we'll take that under advisement.

476
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,457
Most important thing right now
is that we carry on

477
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:16,192
business as usual.

478
00:21:17,328 --> 00:21:19,295
Liam.

479
00:21:20,198 --> 00:21:22,064
Will I see you tonight

480
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:23,365
at the Embassy Ball?

481
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,866
Absolutely. How about you, Grace?

482
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:27,002
Yes.

483
00:21:27,004 --> 00:21:28,237
Wouldn't miss it.

484
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:29,938
Tonight, then.

LIAM: Business as usual?

486
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,345
Do you own a tux?
No. Of course you don't.

487

My professor is missing,
an asteroid is coming,

and you're talking
about going to a party.

489
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:43,118
Did you believe
anything he said in there

490
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,552
about having it under control?

491
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,787
Oh, we're not gonna wait
for the government to save us.

492
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:48,598
We're gonna save ourselves.

493
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:00,158
I know.

494
00:22:00,976 --> 00:22:02,642
It's a lot to take in.

495
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,939
How long have you been carrying this?

496
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:09,308
Three months.

497
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:13,212
So the nukes aren't undergoing
routine maintenance.

498
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:14,580
If the gravity tractor fails,

499
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:16,882
they're the last line of defense.

500
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:18,918
But you're confident this will work?

501
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,452
Yes.

502
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:22,187
Yes, Grace.

503
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:27,826
Why are you telling me
this now? Why bring me in?

504
00:22:27,828 --> 00:22:29,862
Because the playing field just changed.

505
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:31,463
Information got into the wild.

506
00:22:31,465 --> 00:22:33,799
And you need me to contain it.

You don't have to stay.

I can't leave.

Not now.

513
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:04,295

00:23:35,628 --> 00:23:37,628
Zoe, I just got a text from your father

522
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,862
about a gap year?

523
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:41,498
Uh...

524
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,133
I was gonna tell you.

525
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:45,034
Tell me what?

526
00:23:45,036 --> 00:23:47,803
I applied to a community
outreach program in Kenya.

527
00:23:47,805 --> 00:23:49,839
It starts in September.

528
00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:51,707
Africa? Uh, whoa-whoa...

529
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:54,644
Okay. Wh-What about Duke? They
said I could defer for a year.

530
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:56,212
They were really cool about it. Do you
know how many Americans were kidnapped

531
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:58,247
- last year abroad?
- Oh, I knew you were gonna say that.

532
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:00,683
Mom, it's more dangerous to
drive a car than go to Africa.

533
00:24:00,685 --> 00:24:02,952
Honey, now is not the time. You are
the one who's always telling me

534
00:24:02,954 --> 00:24:04,887
- it's my responsibility to contribute...
- Yes. Yes.

535
00:24:04,889 --> 00:24:06,455
To help those less fortunate.
Yes. But not now!

536
00:24:06,457 --> 00:24:08,590
Mom. Look, I know that this is scary

537
00:24:08,592 --> 00:24:11,027
for you... letting go. But...

538
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:13,562
you're not gonna be able to
make the world safe for me,

539
00:24:13,564 --> 00:24:15,730

you can dream up,

00:28:43,158 --> 00:28:45,358
you can design and build it here.

648
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,127

649
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:49,596
Willy Wonka, without the Oompa-Loompas.

650
00:28:49,598 --> 00:28:52,966
Okay, you win man cave
of the universe award.

THIS IS RIVA: My Reusable
Interplanetary Vehicle,

657
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:08,915
designed to be a cargo
transport to Mars.

658

How is that gonna stop a meteor?

659
00:29:11,453 --> 00:29:13,252
It's not.

660
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:16,656
We're re-purposing it...

661
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:19,492
as a lifeboat... this is an ark, Grace.

662
00:29:19,494 --> 00:29:23,763
It's gonna save the human race
from... extinction.

663
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:36,527
You're planning for the
extinction of the human race?

664
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:40,117
No, I'm planning for the
continuation of the human race.

665
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:42,386
Have you ever heard
of the concept "MVP"...

666
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:43,754
minimal viable population?

667
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:45,456
Each species has a threshold.

668
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,258
The minimum number
of individuals required

669
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,993
- to prevent extinction.
- TANZ: Exactly.

670
00:29:49,995 --> 00:29:52,996
For humans, that number is 160 saved.

671
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:55,298
Just 160 well-chosen souls

672
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,833
save the species.

673
00:29:56,835 --> 00:29:58,701
So your plan is to make a getaway

674
00:29:58,703 --> 00:30:02,372
on a spaceship with 160 of your besties

675
00:30:02,374 --> 00:30:03,907
and fly to Mars?

676
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:05,575
Well, we might have to orbit for a while

677
00:30:05,577 --> 00:30:06,709
until we set up shop.

678
00:30:06,711 --> 00:30:08,544
This was supposed to be
a seven-year plan.

679
00:30:08,546 --> 00:30:09,812
I'm accelerating it.

680
00:30:09,814 --> 00:30:11,714
- I'm sorry, this is...
- Nuts.

681
00:30:11,716 --> 00:30:12,948
GRACE: You're betting on
the government to fail.

682
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,450
- I'm not.
- I don't make bets.

683
00:30:14,452 --> 00:30:17,019
I make calculated decisions
based on facts,

684
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:18,954
and the fact is the government's
plan won't work.

685
00:30:18,956 --> 00:30:21,658
They need technology that
hasn't been invented yet.

686
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,058
They won't tell you that, of course.

687
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,860
Or maybe they haven't even
figured that part out yet.

688
00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:27,096
Why did you bring me here, Darius?

689
00:30:27,098 --> 00:30:32,034
If I can expedite production,
make a dozen RIVAs or more,

690
00:30:32,036 --> 00:30:34,937
instead of 160 people,
maybe I can save thousands.

691
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:37,907
But I need access to
information and resources

692
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:39,574
that only a few people
in the government have.

693
00:30:39,576 --> 00:30:41,743
I need an inside man.

694
00:30:41,745 --> 00:30:43,578
Or woman, as they say.

695
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,881
You're asking me to divert resources,

696
00:30:46,883 --> 00:30:51,152
spy on my government,
commit treason for some

697
00:30:51,154 --> 00:30:53,722
insane narcissistic suicide mission?

698

is wearing blinders, Grace.

Harris will trot you out
to deliver his lies,

701

the masses will believe you,

702
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:05,333
and no one will be prepared
for what's coming

00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,657
Zoe.

808
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,394
I'm sorry.

809
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:17,966
You're right. I can't make
the world safe for you.

810
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:24,072
It's your life.

811
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:27,442
I want you to live it.

812
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:29,143
Mom, are you all right?

813
00:37:29,145 --> 00:37:31,646
Yeah. Yeah.

814
00:37:33,149 --> 00:37:34,649
I just love you.

815
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:37,452
I know.

816
00:37:52,135 --> 00:37:54,702
Thank you.

817
00:37:58,574 --> 00:38:00,874
You see that?

818
00:38:00,876 --> 00:38:03,711
That is Mars at perigee.

819
00:38:03,713 --> 00:38:07,347
It's as close
as it's gonna get all year.

820
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:10,918
I don't usually drink like that.

821
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,820
Then why did you?

822
00:38:16,725 --> 00:38:18,191
Can I ask you something?

823
00:38:18,193 --> 00:38:19,626
Mm-hmm.

824
00:38:19,628 --> 00:38:22,061
If you were writing a story about a...

825
00:38:22,063 --> 00:38:25,565
a guy who knew the world
was coming to an end,

826
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:28,701
and he could either
save a couple thousand people

827
00:38:28,703 --> 00:38:32,605
or live the rest of his days
with a beautiful woman,

828
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:34,974
what would you have him do?

829
00:38:34,976 --> 00:38:36,743
It depends.

830
00:38:36,745 --> 00:38:39,478
Is the character supposed to be a hero

831
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,681
or a loser? (Chuckles)

832
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:43,249
Ow.

833
00:38:43,251 --> 00:38:46,318
Uh...

834
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,487
a hero.

835
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:52,424
Well, then he has to
sacrifice his happiness

836
00:38:52,426 --> 00:38:54,726
for the sake of humanity.

837
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:00,932
Even if he thinks
he's in love with the woman?

838
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:04,136
Mm, especially if he is.

839
00:39:04,138 --> 00:39:06,471
Then it's a true sacrifice.

840
00:39:14,281 --> 00:39:16,982
Tell me more about the stars.

841
00:39:16,984 --> 00:39:20,218
(Chuckles Softly)

842
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,553
The stars, okay.

843
00:39:21,555 --> 00:39:24,088
Uh... (Grunts)

844
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:28,693
That's Sirius, aka the dog star.

845
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:33,198
It's the brightest star in the sky.

846
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,000
And then up here, see this one up here?

847
00:39:38,437 --> 00:39:41,706
Class of 2017, it is an honor

848
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:43,974
to be able to address you all
here today.

849
00:39:43,976 --> 00:39:47,578
The future is not just handed to us.

850
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,447
We create it.

851
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,794
<i>Life is filled with possibilities.</i>

852
00:40:04,796 --> 00:40:09,065
<i>There is no tomorrow without us.</i>

853
00:40:09,067 --> 00:40:13,569
<i>My mother taught me at a young age</i>

854
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:18,074
<i>that, as individuals, we are powerful.</i>

855
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,748
<i>How we use that power is up to us.</i>

856
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:36,359
<i>I dreaded all the emotion of
saying good-bye to my friends,</i>

857
00:40:36,361 --> 00:40:37,693
<i>my family.</i>

858
00:40:37,695 --> 00:40:39,862
<i>As exciting as the future is...</i>

859
00:40:39,864 --> 00:40:41,764
(Distant Clatter)

860
00:40:41,766 --> 00:40:43,999
<i>it's also scary.</i>

861
00:40:46,804 --> 00:40:49,004
<i>It's the unknown.</i>

862
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,374
Hello?

863
00:40:52,376 --> 00:40:56,511
<i>But then I started realizing
this isn't the end,</i>

864
00:40:56,513 --> 00:40:58,546
<i>this is just the beginning.</i>

865
00:40:58,548 --> 00:40:59,748
(Silenced Gunshot)

866
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:03,885
My challenge for the class of 2017?

867
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:05,587
Make a difference.

868
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:08,856
There are problems big and small
that need to be solved,

869
00:41:08,858 --> 00:41:13,261
and we can't wait
for someone else to solve them.

870
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,296
It's up to us now.

871
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:17,498
(Elevator Doors Open)

872
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:23,938
Screw you and your ark.

873
00:41:25,374 --> 00:41:27,441
Nice to see you, too.

874
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,644
You're right, Darius.

875
00:41:30,646 --> 00:41:32,112
The government's plan won't work.

876
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,980
They need you.

877
00:41:33,982 --> 00:41:36,583
You said the technology
doesn't exist yet.

878
00:41:36,585 --> 00:41:38,885
If you're so damn smart, invent it.

879
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:41,455
You've got the resources,
the talent, the money.

880
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,124
Don't save 160 people, save them all.

881
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,293
Every last one.

882
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,829
Come work with us.

883
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:51,832
Let's do this together.

884
00:41:51,834 --> 00:41:54,434
I will do whatever it takes.

885
00:41:54,436 --> 00:41:56,803
I'll roll through red tape,
whatever you need from me,

886
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,572
but, damn it, my daughter
deserves a future.

887
00:41:59,574 --> 00:42:01,041
They all do.

888
00:42:03,177 --> 00:42:05,077
And I'm not ready
for all of this to end.

889
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:08,080
Grace...

890
00:42:08,082 --> 00:42:11,384
y-you had me at "screw you."

891
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,223
Hi.

892
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:22,127
Where can I put my stuff?

893
00:42:27,222 --> 00:42:29,935
ZOE: <i>In the words of the great
humanitarian Mother Teresa:</i>

894
00:42:29,937 --> 00:42:31,971
"Yesterday is gone.

895
00:42:31,973 --> 00:42:34,639
"Tomorrow has not yet come.

896
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:35,940
"We have only today.

897
00:42:35,942 --> 00:42:39,310
So, let us begin."

898
00:42:39,312 --> 00:42:41,446
(Applause)

1
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,900
Sir, this isn't a bank card.

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,960
Ah, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:14,305
It's my I.D. I'm a private investigator.

4
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,377
Not a very private one, apparently.

5
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:19,567
- You still take cash?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:23,205
- You did that on purpose.
- Come on, honey.

7
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:25,608
I just got this bad boy yesterday,

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,610
- so what if I'm a little excited?
- Could you ease it up a bit?

9
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:30,446
My study partner's gonna be here
any second and I'd appreciate it

10
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,982
- if you turn down the weird.
- Most kids would be proud

11
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:36,886
to have a P.I. for a father. Think
of me as a modern day Thomas Magnum.

12
00:00:36,888 --> 00:00:38,788
- Who?
- Thomas Magnum?

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,724
Oceanfront estate, red
Ferrari, epic moustache?

14
00:00:41,844 --> 00:00:44,971
Nothing? Fine, Jim Rockford.

15
00:00:44,984 --> 00:00:47,530
- That name just sounds made up.
- My name sounds made up.

16
00:00:47,532 --> 00:00:50,286
- Phillip Marlowe. Sam Spade?
- (Angie): Veronica Mars.

17
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:52,343
- Oh, now I get it.
- Well, well, well.

18
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:55,237
If it isn't Angie Everett,
my partner. Partner.

19
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:57,740
It still sounds strange
when I say it out loud.

20
00:00:57,742 --> 00:01:00,009
That's because you're my employee.

21
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:02,077
- Right.
- Hi, Jules.

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,880
Hi, Angie. Did you know my
dad's a private investigator?

23
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:07,190
- No way.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:07,203 --> 00:01:10,988
- Is your study buddy a dude?
- OK, don't say anything stupid.

25
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:12,488
Or you know what? Just don't
say anything at all. Thanks.

26
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,890
- Hey, Jules.
- Hey. Liam, Dad.

27
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:17,396
Dad, Liam. And Angie.
She's my dad's boss.

28
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:19,859
Woman's in charge. Right on.

29
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:23,232
- Oh, I got your bag.
- Thanks.

30
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:25,233
No problem.

31
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:28,838
- So how are you doing?
- "Woman's in charge"?

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,773
Isn't he a little
slick for a 14-year-old?

33
00:01:30,775 --> 00:01:34,510
I think he's cute! If I was 14.

34
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:38,948
- (cell ringing)
- Everett Investigations.

35
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,263
Yes, Mr. King. I know who you are.

36
00:01:41,544 --> 00:01:43,394
Oh, my goodness.

37
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,957
- Of course, we'll be right there.
- What? What's going on?

38
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,123
That was Thomas King, the author.
Frank Garrison's in the hospital.

39
00:01:51,243 --> 00:01:53,229
- Who?
- I'll do the talking.

40
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:56,265
- OK.
- Yeah. Come on!

41
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:58,267
- Mm
- Hmm.

42
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:01,136
(engine revving)

43
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:09,078
You know, once, Frank
tried to wrestle a bear.

44
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,747
It was in a bar in St. Petersburg.

45
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:14,884
Remember that? We were
at a writer's conference.

46
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,821
I'm not gonna lie.
There was vodka involved.

47
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,057
- (heart monitor beeping)
- It's hard to see him like this.

48
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,527
He's one of the great
writers of our generation.

49
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:26,413
A true genius.

50
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,966
When did he first reach
out to you, Mr. King?

51
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:35,037
Call me Tom. I haven't
spoken to Frank in years.

52
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,439
I think he was pissed after I won

53
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:41,249
the Governor General's Award. He could
be a mean-spirited son of a bitch.

54
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:43,846
Last week, this arrived in the mail.

55
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,451
"In the event of my death,
or that I have been rendered

56
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:52,254
incapacitated, please
press the play button."

57
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,024
I thought it was a
joke at first. I mean,

58
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:58,260
Frank's a notorious
technophobe, holed up in his

59
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:01,078
little shack on Ward's
Island. And then this morning

60
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:04,166
I hear that his house had burned down.

61
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:08,103
<i>Hi, Tom. I guess if you're watching this</i>

62
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,106
<i>I'm either dead or
I'm in a coma near death,</i>

63
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,909
<i>or you've just chosen
to ignore my note,</i>

64
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:17,046
in which case I should've
gone with Michael Ondaatje.

65
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:19,982
- Son of a bitch.
- <i>All I want you to do here</i>

66
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:23,819
is find the most impressive <i>private
investigators in the city</i>

67
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:27,489
and then I want you to get
them to look into what the heck

68
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,959
<i>is happening here.
There's two envelopes.</i>

69
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:32,161
Open up the blue envelope.

70
00:03:32,163 --> 00:03:37,066
<i>Alright. That should be
enough to pay their expenses.</i>

71
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:41,136
<i>OK. Open up the other
envelope, the red one.</i>

72
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:44,139
<i>I found these on my
windowsill last night.</i>

73
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,508
There they were, lined up there,

74
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,510
<i>like five little brass tombstones.</i>

75
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:52,881
Somebody on this crazy little
island's trying to kill me.

76
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:56,151

90
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:42,931
Why are you so excited about
this old hack writer anyhow?

91
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:45,534
Frank Garrison is not a hack.
This is the man who wrote

92
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,803
The Devil's Playground, one
of the most important books

93
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:49,805
- of the last hundred years.
- I Googled him.

94
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:51,907
He wrote one book 25
years ago and gave up.

95
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,942
Can you blame him, after
the Lovegrove incident?

96
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:58,414
- Didn't you take English Lit?
- Take, or pass?

97
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,316
<i>The Devil's Playground
was set in the 19th century,</i>

98
00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:04,153
but really it's an allegory
for dirty political dealings

99
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:06,855
in the 1990s. The uncle
character was based

100
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:09,124
on a Conservative senator
named Christopher Lovegrove.

101
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:11,727
Oh, I remember that guy.
He killed himself, didn't he?

102
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,029
Senator Lovegrove did
everything he could to trample

103
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:16,498
gay rights, yet he was
deep in the closet himself.

104
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,101
When the media found out who
the uncle character was based on,

105
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:21,003
his secret was revealed.

106
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:22,905
Lovegrove killed himself a
week after it was published,

107
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:24,907
the novel on his lap.

108
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:27,342
Well, that's why I didn't
read the book. It's bad luck.

109
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:30,112
It's also a masterpiece. I
read it every couple of years.

110
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:33,649
Andre Agassi's biography is a
masterpiece and I only read that once.

111
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:36,085
Did you manage to
colour between the lines?

112
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:39,621
♪

113
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:42,491
Frank's house is a
10-minute walk. Let's go.

114
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:47,196
- This place gives me the creeps.
- Are you kidding?

115
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:49,832
This place is fantastic!
My dad brought me here

116
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,201
when I was a kid. I wanted to
pitch a tent and stay forever.

117
00:05:52,203 --> 00:05:55,537
- Makes sense when you're eight.
- This island has everything:

118
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:58,440
the best views of the
city, a haunted lighthouse,

119
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,642
rumours of mobsters in hiding.

120
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:02,444
Did you know that Babe Ruth

121
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,446
hit his very first professional home run

122
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,915
- into those waters right there?
- I was standing next to you

123
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:08,458
when you were reading
the historical plaques.

124
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:10,715
So we're finally reading the same things!

125
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,491
- Wow. That was some fire.
- Yeah.

126
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:17,760
Let's get to work. You get
some snaps of the house,

127
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:20,362
I'll go see if I can learn
anything from the firemen.

128
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:22,131
Really? You're going
to go talk to the firemen?

129
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:25,033
Isn't that a bit of a cliché?
Women and firemen?

130
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:27,402
Sounds like a real bodice
ripper. A potboiler.

131
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,848
Who's the literary one now?

132
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:34,376
(camera shutter sounds)

133
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:41,241
OK. Looks like the fire
happened between 1 and 2 A.M.

134
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:44,186
I'm gonna check if Mazhari
can pull up the CCTV footage

135
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:46,922
of the harbour. Ferries don't
run between 10 p.m. and dawn,

136
00:06:46,924 --> 00:06:49,057
so if there are no personal
watercraft leaving the island,

137
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:51,004
it's likely the arsonist lives here.

138
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:54,096
Or there is no arsonist and
that's the reason for the fire.

139
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:56,732
- Lotta hard liquor for one man.
- He's a writer. Sometimes

140
00:06:56,734 --> 00:06:59,496
- it comes with the territory.
- It also makes a great accelerant.

141
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:01,170
I once made a Molotov cocktail

142
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:02,524
out of a cheap bottle of bourbon.

143
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:04,499
Really? I didn't find that
in the background check.

144
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,776
Time for you to up your game.

145
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:09,178
Come on, think about it.
Garrison gets drunk,

146
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,613
decides to light up a smoke, and poof!

147
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,882
We've been hired to find a
would-be killer, not speculate

148
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:16,451
on accidents. Frank said
this island is full of crazy,

149
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:19,855
- and I believe him.
- I'm starting to come around.

150
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:23,525
Don't look now: peeping Tom, 5 o'clock.

151
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:29,364
Beginning to feel like
we're in a Coen Brothers movie.

152
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,234
You take the high
road, I'll take the low.

153
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:38,307
There's a lot of suspects,
but we're honing in on one.

154
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:40,776
You're not gonna believe
who the culprit is...

155
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:43,345
She does drone on, doesn't she?

156
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:47,649
Uh, I...

157
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:49,818
Who are you?

158
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,787
Larry Fleishman.

159
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:53,789
This is not what it looks like.

160
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:57,163
You mean you weren't recording my
partner pretending to talk on the phone?

161
00:07:57,164 --> 00:08:00,062
OK, it is what it looks like.
This is what I do for a living.

162
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:02,865
- And that makes it all right?
- I'm a composer.

163
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,434
I make ambient soundscapes for spas.

164
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:07,836
I was trying to catch
a rare piping plover.

165
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:09,838
She makes the sweetest little cheeps.

166
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,845
And this plover resides in the
remains of Frank Garrison's house?

167
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:15,944
I wanted to know what was going on.

168
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:17,946
Where were you between 1
a.m. and 2 a.m. this morning?

169
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:20,015
At the south end of the
island, atop the lighthouse.

170
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:22,784
All my sound logs are
digitally timestamped. Um...

171
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:27,789
41.3163 north, 79.3853 west.

172
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,491
Here, see for yourself.

173
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:33,574
So you record sounds.

174
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:36,331
- Did you hear anything strange?
- Actually, yeah.

175
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,601
At first I thought it was
a black-crowned night heron,

176
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,304
but you know, it's too
late in the season for that.

177
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:44,773
Here, you can listen.

178
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:50,212
(muffled sounds)

179
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:52,814
I can't make heads or tails
of this. Got anything else?

180
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:55,984
Oh, yes. Four hours of
raw, unadulterated wind.

181
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:59,588
That's the sound of the island's soul.

182
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,859
Larry, do you know anyone on
this island who dislikes Frank?

183
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:06,929
I'd check with the Schmidts.
They know him as well as anyone,

184
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,264
and they do like to dish.

185
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:14,743
- Will and Gil Schmidt?
- Oh, my goodness!

186
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:16,838
I'm such a big fan of your show!

187
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,408
Is this a bad time to
mention I don't have cable?

188
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,877
These guys are the hosts of
<i>A Tale of Two Schmidty's,</i>

189
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,179
one of the top design
shows on The Accent Network.

190
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:26,648
Number one in our time slot,
three seasons and counting.

191
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,784
But who keeps track of that, right?

192
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:31,086
Do you mind if we ask a few
questions about your neighbour?

193
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:34,022
- Yes, poor Frank. How is he?
- He's gonna pull through.

194
00:09:34,024 --> 00:09:36,024
Oh, thank God. I just
want to get back to the days

195
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:38,260
when the only thing I need to
worry about is his wardrobe.

196
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:41,463
Seriously, Hawaiian
shirts and striped pants?

197
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:44,833
He makes Don Cherry look
like Oscar De La Renta.

198
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:48,036
- (all laughing)
- Can you think of anyone

199
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:50,672
- who has a beef with Frank?
- Frank's harmless.

200
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,408
Most people here just
pity him. I mean, come on.

201
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,883
The man's spent a quarter
century procrastinating.

202
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:59,014
Does he have drinking buddies?
Someone he's friendly with?

203
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,016
Or not so friendly with?

204
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,188
The last few months, this
gorgeous woman started showing up.

205
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,091
Blonde, wavy hair, geek-chic glasses.

206
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:11,226
Vintage cat-eyes. Very stylish.

207
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:13,095
Every couple of weeks, like clockwork.

208
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:15,097
Frank said it was his daughter.

209
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:17,599
The last time, it did not end
well. They had quite the row.

210
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:21,103
- Any idea what it was about?
- I'm not one to spread rumours.

211
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:23,905
Oh, who am I kidding? Of course I am.

212
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:27,109
I heard "money," and then eventually

213
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:29,444
he was screaming at her to get out.

214
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:32,314
Sounded like daddy was
gonna turn off the royalty tap.

215
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:40,055
Mr. Powers, you're Frank's publisher.
Did he mention any

216
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,557
- meetings with his daughter?
- Meetings that didn't go well?

217
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,893
I'm more surprised to
hear Eliza's back in his life

218
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,762
than that they're fighting. Again.

219
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:48,997
- Care to elaborate?
- She sued him

220
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:51,066
for financial support years ago.

221
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,635
Got accepted into some fancy arts school

222
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:56,605
and needed another slice
of the Garrison pie.

223
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:59,574
He only wrote one book.
How big can the pie be?

224
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,011
<i>The Devil's Playground?</i> is on
practically every university curriculum.

225
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:05,781
It sells almost 100000 copies a year.

226
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:08,832
How is Frank, anyways?

227
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:11,019
- Touch and go.
- What a tragedy.

228
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:13,978
Is it selfish of me to wish that
he had left us one more book?

229
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,900
So Frank never did write a follow-up
to <i>The Devil's Playground?</i>

230
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:20,028
He's been promising one for
20 years. Says he's deep into it,

231
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:23,331
that it's the next Animal Farm.
I've stopped holding my breath.

232
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,267
Think that has to do with Lovegrove?

233
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,939
It's Lovegrove, it's bourbon,

234
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:29,738
it's fear of not living
up to himself. I tell him,

235
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,774
it doesn't need to be good.
I'd publish his grocery list

236
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,777
if he let me, it'd still sell a
million five in the first week.

237
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,580
No, no! More red in the title,

238
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:41,516
those words need to pop.

239
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:44,184
Could you at least wait
until the body's cold?

240
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:46,755
Look, I know it sounds
crazy, but I do this

241
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:49,257
out of my love for his work.
Sales of <i>Playground</i>

242
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:53,595
are down 20%. I'd be an idiot
not to capitalize on this media.

243
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:56,146
The publicity gets much
bigger if Frank doesn't make it.

244
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,801
I was nowhere near
the island last night,

245
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,713
if that's what you're asking.

246
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:05,656
I love the man, and
what we're doing here,

247
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:07,809
it makes me queasy.

248
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,753
But nothing sells like tragedy.

249
00:12:09,873 --> 00:12:13,074
Is that how you'd describe his
relationship with his daughter?

250
00:12:13,194 --> 00:12:15,350
My correspondence with
Eliza starts and ends

251
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:17,567
with the annual Christmas
card I sign from Fosset-Powers.

252
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:19,821
So I'm guessing you have her address?

253
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,658
(rock music plays)

254
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,927
Closer. There you go.

255
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:29,431
Yeah, just like that. Perfect.

256
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:31,767
Great. Lift it?

257
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,757
- That's it. Thank you.
- (clapping)

258
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,936
Thank you.

259
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:48,850
- (music stops)
- Eliza, nice studio.

260
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,181
We've heard so much about you.

261
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:51,788
You mind if we ask you a few questions?

262
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:54,089
Sure. You guys interested
in nudes, or something

263
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:56,744
more traditional?
I'd love to shoot you guys.

264
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,428
- How's your dad?
- Oh, you're one of those.

265
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,883
A very special "one of those."

266
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:04,133
I'm interested in learning about
your visit with Frank yesterday.

267
00:13:04,134 --> 00:13:07,294
- The one that ended in a screaming match?
- There was no screaming match.

268
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:09,905
- Two witnesses say otherwise.
- No, you don't understand.

269
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:11,907
I believe someone was screaming at him,

270
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:14,309
but that someone wasn't me.
I haven't seen my father

271
00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:17,679
in 10 years.

272
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:19,748
When dad's book became a best-seller,

273
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,350
it was the happiest I'd ever
seen him. Our family lived

274
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:24,686
in bliss for a week. And
then everything changed.

275
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:26,820
Senator Lovegrove killed himself.

276
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,765
He was devastated.

277
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:31,459
Suddenly his shining
diamond wasn't so shiny.

278
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:35,597
So he started to drink... and
then he really started to drink.

279
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:38,366
- That's when he moved to the island?
- I was just a kid,

280
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:40,669
but even I could see he
was trying to run away.

281
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:43,605
- He's done it his whole life.
- You never visited?

282
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:47,075
My mother would take me there
for Christmas, or my birthday.

283
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,778
But it became increasingly
clear we weren't wanted.

284
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,347
So when my mother died, I stayed away.

285
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:54,184
I'm not even sure he knows
what I do for a living.

286
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:55,298
Must have been hard.

287
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:59,955
"There's iron in the human soul."
My dad wrote that.

288
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:01,752
It's one of my favourite lines.

289
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:06,294
We talked to Elliot Powers. He
said you guys fought over royalties?

290
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:09,564
That was 10 years ago,
the last time I saw my dad.

291
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:12,269
I was unemployed and
trying to re-invent myself.

292
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,955
- Looks like you gone successful
- Look, if you're worried,

293
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:17,973
I can prove where I was
last night. I did a session

294
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:20,375
with a corporate client that ran
late. I'll get you their names.

295
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:23,111
We're looking for a woman

296
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,280
who was hanging out with your father

297
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:28,350
for the last couple of
months. Blonde hair, glasses.

298
00:14:28,352 --> 00:14:30,452
- Any idea who she is?
- There's a Frank Garrison

299
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,954
fan club that's run by the university.

300
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,657
My dad maintains enough contact
to ensure a steady stream

301
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:37,926

I remember this photo.
It ran in every newspaper

378
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:01,996
after the discovery of
Christopher Lovegrove's body.

379
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,432
That is Christopher Lovegrove.

380
00:18:04,434 --> 00:18:07,302
And that's his daughter,
Sarah Lovegrove.

- That's you.

but it's not what you think.

383
00:18:18,274 --> 00:18:21,603
After Dad died, we took
on Mom's maiden name.

384
00:18:21,604 --> 00:18:24,981
There was a time when I wanted
Frank Garrison dead, I'll admit.

385
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:29,533
Then I went to university and
his book was on the curriculum.

386
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:32,302
I loved it, which
only made things worse.

387
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:34,550
So one day, I sought him out.

388
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,492
You tracked him to the island?

389
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:40,886
I had to confront him.
Then when I finally saw him,

390
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:43,820
he seemed so sad.

391
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,948
I realized he was hurting
just as much as I was.

392
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:49,962
And when I told him I
wanted to be a writer,

393
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:51,824
he offered to help me.

394
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:54,844
The man responsible for your
father's death is your mentor?

395
00:18:54,964 --> 00:18:57,480
Yes, he's a great teacher.
Frank believes technology

396
00:18:57,482 --> 00:19:00,665
kills the creative process.
He refuses to go on the cloud,

397
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:03,353
he only writes on a vintage Olympia SM3,

398
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:05,955
and he keeps his backups in a shoebox.

399
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:08,452
Getting off the grid
really helped me focus

400
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:11,194
and overcome my social media addiction.

401
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:13,953
You're tweeting right now.

402
00:19:14,224 --> 00:19:16,966
Witnesses saw you fighting
with Frank two days ago,

403
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:18,905
shortly before the
house went up in flames.

404
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,532
I just finished a book.
Not a real book like Frank's,

405
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:25,536
just an exercise. Frank got upset that
I didn't take the process seriously.

406
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:27,004
And that's why he was yelling at you?

407
00:19:27,005 --> 00:19:30,880
He said some hurtful
things and I got angry.

408
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:33,544
Do you think it's possible
that Frank lit the fire himself?

409
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:36,252
No. This process was
healing for us both.

410
00:19:36,372 --> 00:19:38,151
It even inspired Frank to write again.

411
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:40,294
Wait a sec. Frank's writing again?

412
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:41,194
Yeah.

413
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:45,727
The Schmidty's went out of their way

414
00:19:45,729 --> 00:19:47,414
to point out that Frank wasn't writing.

415
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:48,573
Don't you think that's weird?

416
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:50,238
You think they're hiding something?

417
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:53,250
I think they knew. And if
so, everybody knew, which gives

418
00:19:53,264 --> 00:19:55,569
- everyone on the island motive.
- Just because Frank's first

419
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,140
novel exposed deadly secrets
doesn't mean his second will.

420
00:19:58,142 --> 00:20:00,142
Let's go see if he can tell us.

We're the private
investigators you hired.

423
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,546
We know you're writing again Frank.
We met with Sarah Lovegrove

424
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:13,274
and she told us everything.
She told us you were upset

425
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:15,655
that she was downplaying her talents.
Is that why you guys were fighting?

426
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:19,774
That's partially right. It had more
to do with a phone call that I received.

427
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:20,876
A call?

428
00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:22,945
From my publisher, Elliot Powers.

429
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:26,238
He turned her book down
flat for publication.

430
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,714
I was really pissed
'cause it was a fine work

431
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:30,740
called <i>Dancing in the Labyrinth.</i>

432
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,778
Unfortunately, I took it out on Sarah.

433
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:36,697
- So you started drinking?
- Yeah, one bourbon,

434
00:20:36,698 --> 00:20:39,614
then another, then another,
and then I blacked out.

435
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:41,856
The next thing I knew, I woke
up and I was smelling smoke.

436
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:44,751
- Who do you think did this?
- Could be anyone.

437
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:47,489
But I'd put my money on the Schmidty's.

438
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:50,759
They sent me a cease and
desist letter. They think

439
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:53,122
- I'm writing about them.
- So you are writing a second book?

440
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:55,525
Yes. And it's all up
in smoke, just like that.

441
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:56,570
You don't have a backup?

442
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,900
I don't trust computers.
Don't like them.

443
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:01,366
The fire inspector said the
blaze started in your study.

444
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:03,763
- Is that where you kept your work?
- What are you implying now?

445
00:21:03,883 --> 00:21:07,024
- That I did it myself?
- No. But someone targeted you

446
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:08,710
or your book and we're
trying to figure out which.

447
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:11,362
If there were secrets in your
book that were worth killing for,

448
00:21:11,363 --> 00:21:12,608
it would help to know what they were.

449
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:14,632
I don't really get what's going on here.

450

like all the rest of them,

451
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:20,122
just coming in here,
squeezing me like a lemon.

452
00:21:20,242 --> 00:21:22,811
Hey, hey. Hey, hey. You hired
us. We're just here to help.

00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:26,661
If I wanted help, I'd ask the
nurse to increase my morphine.

454
00:21:26,663 --> 00:21:28,545
Look, I know exactly who you are.

455
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:31,219
You're a long-time-retired
hockey player.

456
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:33,035
And this investigation is pathetic.

457
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:36,038
Even more pathetic than your last stint

458
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,558
- with the Saskatoon Sasquatches!
- Hey. I was rehabbing

459
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,411
a groin injury! And you
of all people should know

460
00:21:40,531 --> 00:21:42,393
not to judge a book
by its cover, old man!

461
00:21:42,406 --> 00:21:44,367
You're not a book, are you?
You know what?

462
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:46,512
You don't qualify as a magazine, either.

463
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,867
You're like a faded flyer, put
in the bottom of a bird cage!

464
00:21:49,886 --> 00:21:51,366
You call that guy a hero?

465
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:54,446
You'd be cranky too if someone
tried to burn your house down.

466
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:56,657
You're too close to
this to see the truth.

467
00:21:56,777 --> 00:21:59,465
Heroes are human, Angie.
They fall like the rest of us.

468
00:21:59,477 --> 00:22:01,560
- It's our job to pick him up.
- You still don't think

469
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:04,939
he did this? You said it yourself.
People hire P.I.'s all the time to take

470
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,850
- the stink off their own crimes.
- Why would he burn down his own house?

471
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:12,174
Insurance? Frustration at
his unfinished novel? Attention?

472
00:22:12,176 --> 00:22:13,529
- (buzzing)
- It's Mazhari.

473
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:16,810
He checked the CCTV footage.
No personal watercrafts

474
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:18,814
left the island before
or after the fire.

475
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:20,470
Which points directly to Frank.

476
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,254
Frank did not light that fire.
An artist doesn't destroy

477
00:22:23,374 --> 00:22:27,081
his own work for money
he doesn't need. Look.

You're either in or
you're out. What'll it be?

482

You're going back?

- He's cooler than he looks.

Not that I can verify that.

Well, I mean, how well
do you really know him?

506
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,193
There's a lot of hair product going on.

507
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:46,382
And does he ever bring up his family?

508
00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:48,137
You know his dad was involved

509
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:50,323
in the whole hedge fund scandal.

Well, it is my job.

512

Congratulations, dad.
You're officially a dick.

You seem in a mood. Something wrong?

514
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,394
I got into a fight with Jules.

515
00:24:09,395 --> 00:24:12,690
Ah, she found out you
were stalking her boyfriend.

516
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:14,824
He's not her boyfriend.

517
00:24:15,984 --> 00:24:17,796
Anyway, I gently suggested

518
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,735
that maybe she doesn't know
him as well as she thinks.

519
00:24:20,737 --> 00:24:23,723
And she gently suggested
you take a flying leap.

520

I'm so glad my sub-par
parenting gives you joy.

You're new to the job, so I'll
let you in on a little secret:

522
00:24:31,107 --> 00:24:33,726
not everybody likes
P.I.'s, especially when

523

in people's lives.

been helpful yesterday.

- The Schmidty's production office.

528

They're confirming that Will's
in a meeting on the mainland.

529
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:50,475
That means the coast is half-clear.

530

that two guys who can turn

a vintage suitcase into
an ottoman could actually

532

- do something like this.
- All I know

is they're the most
famous duo on the island,

534

and if Frank was going to
air their dirty laundry,

Frank once caught me

605
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,880
Anybody else on the island
that would be worried about

606
00:28:26,882 --> 00:28:30,384
- a tell-all book from Frank?
- Hello, only everyone?

607
00:28:30,386 --> 00:28:32,825
It's like Twin Peaks over here.

608
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:35,127
Well, if you want your secret kept,

609
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:37,520
you're gonna need to do us a favour.

610
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,208
How fast can you spread a rumour?

611
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,334
<i>Do you really think this is gonna work?</i>

612
00:28:47,336 --> 00:28:49,543
If the Schmidts are as good
at gossip as they are at design,

613
00:28:49,663 --> 00:28:52,006
everyone on this island
thinks that Frank kept a backup

614
00:28:52,008 --> 00:28:55,068
- of his second novel in his shed.
- So what, we sit here freezing

615
00:28:55,188 --> 00:28:57,311
our asses off until somebody shows up?

616
00:28:57,313 --> 00:28:59,613
Didn't you basically live
90% of your life on ice?

617
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:01,302
Yeah. Moving around.

618
00:29:01,422 --> 00:29:03,127
Staying warm. Accomplishing something.

619
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:06,086
That's the thing about
stakeouts. They're 90% waiting,

620
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:08,533
- 10% results.
- (crunching)

621
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:11,185
Less if you bring noisy snacks.

622
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:13,994
Hey. These babies are full of magnesium.

623
00:29:13,996 --> 00:29:16,795
Magnesium enhances mental acuity.
You should try them.

624
00:29:16,915 --> 00:29:19,466
I would, but apparently it doesn't work.

625
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:22,000
- (chuckling)
- Oh!

626
00:29:23,105 --> 00:29:26,707
(buzzing)

627
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:28,296
- Hey, honey.
- [Hey, dad.]

628
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:30,639
Yeah, I got your message
from earlier. I'm all set up.

629
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,106
Pizza's on its way and
Ruby and Lynn are here.

630
00:29:32,226 --> 00:29:34,770
Good, honey. Listen,
I'm glad you called.

631
00:29:34,992 --> 00:29:38,558
- I wanted to talk about earlier.
- Just "talk"?

632
00:29:38,678 --> 00:29:42,056
- (whispering): I was wrong.
- I... I was wrong.

633
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:45,174
Honey. I was wrong,
and I want to apologize.

634
00:29:45,294 --> 00:29:47,398
[What I did was unbecoming]

635
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:50,497
Of a professional investigator.
Will you forgive me?

636
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:53,650
- It'll never happen again?
- Exactly.

637
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,795
- Apology accepted.
- [Good.]

638
00:29:56,915 --> 00:29:59,540
So what movie did you guys decide on?

639
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:01,542
<i>Unfriended.
The described video</i>

640
00:30:01,544 --> 00:30:03,677
is funnier than the dialogue.

641
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,113
<i>Unfriended?</i> Classic.

642
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:07,901
(Liam): [You guys don't want
any of this popcorn, right?]

643
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:10,393
Honey? Is that a boy?

644
00:30:10,513 --> 00:30:13,858
- [Is there a boy over there?]
- Uh, yeah, Liam's here too.

645
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:16,423
- [Gotta go!]
- Honey, wait...

646
00:30:17,593 --> 00:30:19,593
Liam's there. I'm calling my dad.

647
00:30:19,595 --> 00:30:22,262
Stop it. Your daughter
did that to piss you off.

648
00:30:22,264 --> 00:30:24,312
She's a good kid, with good judgment.

649
00:30:24,432 --> 00:30:27,601
You just have to trust her. Besides,
<i>Unfriended</i> is not a bad

650
00:30:27,603 --> 00:30:30,838
- little horror flick.
- I thought it was a rom-com.

651
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,108
Did you know 55% of all horror
films are watched by women?

652
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,044
Apparently horror films have
the same physiological effects

653
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:39,781
on young girls as sex. Cool, huh?

654
00:30:41,532 --> 00:30:43,884
- That's not nice!
- (chuckling)

655
00:31:12,582 --> 00:31:14,186
_

656
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:23,192
Hey.

657
00:31:24,031 --> 00:31:26,593
Now I know why you
love this book so much.

658
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:31,529
It's not so much about the
book; it's about your dad.

659
00:31:32,826 --> 00:31:35,736
He bought that for
me for my 14th birthday.

660
00:31:35,738 --> 00:31:39,706
Wasn't much of a reader,
but that book spoke to him.

661
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:41,952
Spoke to you too, apparently.

662
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:44,578
There was this diner by our house.

663
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,713
My dad used to take me there.

664
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:49,796
We'd talk about
<i>The Devil's Playground</i> for hours.

665
00:31:51,646 --> 00:31:53,373
I miss that.

666
00:31:53,707 --> 00:31:55,545
So that's why you're re-reading it.

667
00:31:56,322 --> 00:31:58,456
You're trying to keep your father alive.

668
00:31:58,576 --> 00:32:00,762
Thanks, Sigmund. Maybe
I just like to read.

669
00:32:00,882 --> 00:32:04,097
What? The same book, the
same time, year after year?

670
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:08,747
Maybe it's time to let go
of some of those memories,

671
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:11,300
make some new ones.

672
00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:13,803
Maybe you'd learn something.

673
00:32:14,395 --> 00:32:16,516
Maybe you could learn
something if you'd put down

674
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,780
- the sports biographies.
- The Agassi bio will teach you

675
00:32:19,782 --> 00:32:22,535
more about perseverance
than 100 therapists.

676
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:25,521
It's soulful and funny and

677
00:32:25,854 --> 00:32:29,690
it taught me I wasn't the only great
athlete to fall on hard times.

678
00:32:31,693 --> 00:32:34,962
I had no idea... that
you were a great athlete.

679
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:37,397
And I had no idea

680
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:40,024
- that you talked in your sleep.
- Shut up.

681
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:43,938
Oh, the things that you talked about...

682
00:32:43,939 --> 00:32:46,506
- Shut up.
- Oh, you have no idea.

683
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:48,508
(rustling)

684
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:58,018
- (grunting)
- It's Larry, the guy with the mic!

685
00:32:58,138 --> 00:33:01,258
Who just rocketed to number
one on our suspect list.

686
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:04,344
- I was stretching my legs.
- With a crowbar?

687
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:06,605
This is how this is gonna go down.
You're going to tell us

688
00:33:06,725 --> 00:33:09,083
what you're doing here or we're going
to go the cops with everything we know.

689
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:12,032
Let's try this again. What's
the real reason you're here?

690
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:19,197
(man and woman grunting and moaning)

691
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:24,202
I think I've heard enough.

692
00:33:24,485 --> 00:33:26,659
But they're just getting started.

693
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:30,120
- Hey.
- I already told you,

694
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,576
I'm a legit composer.

695
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:34,054
The sounds I record capture
the soul of the island.

696
00:33:34,174 --> 00:33:35,647
Not the word I would have used.

697
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:38,478
Do I sometimes hear something
that I shouldn't? Sure.

698
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:41,009
Do I record it for my
own pleasure? Absolutely.

699
00:33:41,129 --> 00:33:43,315
- Does that make me a criminal?
- Yes.

700
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:44,150
(quietly): Oh.

701
00:33:44,434 --> 00:33:48,051
- So Frank knew about this?
- We had drinks together,

702
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:51,091
and one time, one time I
played him one of my 'scapes,

703
00:33:51,211 --> 00:33:54,199
with Shelley, that cute
waitress from Ellen's Cafe

704
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,460
going at it with my neighbour Bob...

705
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,270
Why didn't I keep it to myself, right?

706
00:33:58,467 --> 00:34:00,098
I had to know if Frank would spill.

707
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:03,193
If the island found out,
I'd be a pariah. But I swear

708
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:06,391
I didn't set the fire. I was
on the other side of the island.

709
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,426
Those digital logs are 100% legit.

710
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,991
This is some fancy
equipment. What does it do?

711
00:34:11,111 --> 00:34:14,172
I can do anything with these
sounds. Stretch 'em, compress,

712
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:15,487
- add reverb.
- Can you filter out

713
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:18,917
- the background noise?
- Sure. Why?

714
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:21,162
I want to have another listen
to that sound you recorded

715
00:34:21,282 --> 00:34:23,597
- the night of the fire.
- Oh, yeah.

716
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:28,400
Uh, here we are. 1:11 a.m.

717
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:31,670
(bubbling and breathing sounds)

718
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:37,367
Can you clean it up?

719
00:34:37,487 --> 00:34:39,611
Yeah, I'll try to compress it.

720
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,714
Should be better.

721
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,372
What direction did that come from?

722
00:34:45,492 --> 00:34:48,603
- My guess is Algonquin Beach.
- That makes no sense.

723
00:34:48,723 --> 00:34:51,402
I checked the CCTV cameras
and there was no record

724
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:54,793
- of any boat activity.
- That was no boat.

725
00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:58,700
I'm telling you, it's a scuba tank.

726
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,524
The sound of air being
released through a regulator.

727
00:35:02,585 --> 00:35:05,449
I used to scuba dive in St.
Lucia during the off-season.

728
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:09,244
OK. So someone scuba-ed to Ward's Island

729
00:35:09,364 --> 00:35:12,038
- underwater to avoid detection.
- Which puts our perp

730
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:14,292
off-island. We've been
looking in the wrong place.

731
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,554
Maybe it's not about
the secrets in the book.

732
00:35:16,674 --> 00:35:19,684
Maybe it's about Frank.
He's hiding something.

733
00:35:19,804 --> 00:35:21,176
Let's go find out what.

734
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:25,455
This might not have been
about your book at all, Frank.

735
00:35:25,575 --> 00:35:27,269
What do you mean? Of
course it's about my book!

736
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,292
I spent years crafting every word.

737
00:35:30,514 --> 00:35:32,597
Obviously, somebody
out there is jealous!

738
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,411
Here's what we don't get.

739
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:37,924
There are a lot of people who
gain from the publication of the book,

740
00:35:38,044 --> 00:35:39,811
but almost no one who loses.

741
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:42,941
Why destroy a book that's going
to make everyone a fortune?

742
00:35:44,395 --> 00:35:46,492
Because there was no book to destroy.

743
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:49,307
That's why you get defensive
when we talk about it.

744
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:51,082
That's why you change the subject.

745
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:53,362
There was no second book, was there?

746
00:35:54,176 --> 00:35:56,063
OK, it's writer's block.

747
00:35:57,185 --> 00:36:00,371
It's a very painful
disease, Miss Everett.

748
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,760
It's debilitating.

749
00:36:01,762 --> 00:36:04,129
It's constipation of the soul.

750
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:06,841
And I've had it for 25 years now.

751
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:09,804
- Why didn't you talk to somebody?
- Because I'm Frank Garrison,

752
00:36:09,924 --> 00:36:13,601
because I am one of the
world's greatest living writers.

753
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:15,253
Do you know what it's like to try

754
00:36:15,254 --> 00:36:19,027
- to live up to your former self?
- I'm pretty familiar with it.

755
00:36:19,508 --> 00:36:22,106
If a man can't admit it
to himself he's a failure,

756
00:36:22,226 --> 00:36:23,748
how's he going to admit
it to his daughter?

757
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:28,124
What's he going to tell her? And
I've let Eliza just drift away.

758
00:36:28,642 --> 00:36:31,489
You know, she's one of the
top photographers in this city.

759
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:33,491
So you do know what
she does for a living.

760
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:37,269
Course I do. I've been collecting
photos of hers over the years.

761
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,204
They are the most precious
things that I lost in that fire,

762
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:41,359
I promise you that.

763
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,928
And working with Sarah,
it helped you heal.

764
00:36:44,048 --> 00:36:46,132
Sarah's another one of my failures.

765
00:36:46,252 --> 00:36:48,043
I really thought
that I could help her become

766
00:36:48,163 --> 00:36:49,541
a very successful writer.

767
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:54,512
I really thought that she
had something that was fresh.

768
00:36:54,514 --> 00:36:57,018
Her book was like a new <i>Animal Farm.</i>

769
00:36:57,412 --> 00:36:58,883
Did you say <i>Animal Farm?</i>

770
00:37:00,203 --> 00:37:03,249
That's what Elliot said
about Frank's new novel.

771
00:37:03,595 --> 00:37:05,966
Remember that framed picture
on the wall of his office?

772
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:08,531
His brag wall. There was
a photo of him scuba diving.

773
00:37:08,651 --> 00:37:11,872
Frank mentored her. Her book would
have his fingerprints all over it.

774
00:37:11,992 --> 00:37:13,928
That's what this whole thing
was about: Elliot trying to scam

775
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:15,716
his way into a new Frank Garrison book.

776
00:37:15,717 --> 00:37:17,455
Because nothing sells like tragedy.

777
00:37:17,575 --> 00:37:20,896
Elliot is a bastard. He's a total...

778
00:37:21,016 --> 00:37:21,906
- (coughing):
- bastard!

779
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:23,842
- (coughing)
- (heart monitor beeping)

780
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:26,744
Nurse? Nurse!

781
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:30,181
(coughing)

782
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:35,587
(indistinct conversation)

783
00:37:37,738 --> 00:37:39,457
Ladies and gentlemen...

784
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,427
I've just been told

785
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:46,791
Frank Garrison has gone into a
coma and is unlikely to recover.

786
00:37:46,911 --> 00:37:49,100
I wish I was sharing better news.

787
00:37:49,488 --> 00:37:52,806
But when the time comes,
Fosset-Powers will be there

788
00:37:52,926 --> 00:37:56,307
to celebrate Frank Garrison's
genius in a positive manner.

789
00:37:56,889 --> 00:38:00,527
Not only will we be re-issuing
<i>The Devil's Playground,</i>

790
00:38:01,181 --> 00:38:04,614
but Frank has left us one final gift...

791
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:08,753
a new novel!

792
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:11,189
I'll take your questions
one at a time. Yeah?

793
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:14,348
Is this new novel about
the ultimate betrayal

794
00:38:14,468 --> 00:38:16,476
- of an old friend?
- No, it's a...

795
00:38:17,351 --> 00:38:19,537
It's an allegory, set in a forest.

796
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:21,273
A modern day <i>Animal Farm.</i>

797
00:38:21,606 --> 00:38:23,360
Hey, I'd like to pitch you

798
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,018
a killer idea that we've
been kicking around.

799
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,781
Feel free to fill in the gaps,

800
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:30,507
- it is based on a true story.
- You're gonna love the villain.

801
00:38:30,627 --> 00:38:32,936
He's got big cojones
and a bow tie fetish.

802
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:34,479
Not really an appropriate time for...

803
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:37,746
So he hatches a plan to kill
one of the greatest writers

804
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:40,701
of our time by burning
him alive in his house.

805
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:42,401
I haven't been to
the island in months.

806
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:44,985
- That fire happened hours after...
- Hours after the last ferry?

807
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:48,117
Clever idea, making it look like
someone on the island did it.

808
00:38:48,237 --> 00:38:50,720
- Except for one small detail.
- That cave dive

809
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,634
you did in Belize, Elliot?
Very impressive.

810
00:38:52,754 --> 00:38:54,992
- What are you talking about?
- Your Divelogger watch.

811
00:38:55,112 --> 00:38:58,124
It uploads your data to
the cloud automatically:

812
00:38:58,244 --> 00:38:59,804
biometrics, GPS...

813
00:38:59,806 --> 00:39:02,145
Places you within a
foot of your location

814
00:39:02,265 --> 00:39:05,598
and time stamps it. Like the
night of the fire, for instance.

815
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,759
You were wearing your dive watch
when you scuba-ed

816
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:10,029
across the harbour to Algonquin Beach.

817
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,449
I don't have to listen to any of this.

818
00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:14,636
No, but they're gonna want to to the
very end, because it's got everything:

819
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:19,414
murder, greed and a twist
ending you never saw coming.

820
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:22,527
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- (crowd gasping)

821
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,395
(Frank coughing)

822
00:39:24,714 --> 00:39:27,541
My name is Frank Garrison

823
00:39:27,661 --> 00:39:29,779
and I am not in a coma,

824
00:39:29,899 --> 00:39:31,878
nor did I write this book,

825
00:39:31,998 --> 00:39:34,943
<i>Dancing in the Labyrinth.
So allow me to introduce you</i>

826
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:37,680
to the real writer of
this magnificent novel.

827
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,816
She's the daughter of a man
whose death I was responsible

828
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:43,348
for years ago. This is...

829
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,079
Sarah Lovegrove.

830
00:39:46,499 --> 00:39:49,734
- What? Lovegrove?
- Yes, sir.

831
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,243
She's a Lovegrove?!

832
00:39:52,363 --> 00:39:54,171
She's a Lovegrove, Elliot.

833
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,061
- Wait, what
- Everybody stay back, please.

834
00:39:57,063 --> 00:40:00,198
(overlapping voices)

835
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:14,091
Imagine if Elliot had
known Sarah's real identity.

836
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,675
He could've saved himself
an attempted murder charge.

837
00:40:16,795 --> 00:40:20,357
Garrison mentors Lovegrove?
Talk about sales.

838
00:40:20,477 --> 00:40:23,851
That's what you call... dramatic irony.

839
00:40:24,604 --> 00:40:25,941
There we go.

840
00:40:26,061 --> 00:40:27,645
The remaining balance.

841
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:30,545
Worth every penny. Thank you.

842
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:33,558
- Do you have somewhere to stay?
- My daughter's offered a bed.

843
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:36,801
I'm going to take her up on it.
We got a lot of catching up to do.

844
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:38,937
You think when this is all done,

845
00:40:39,284 --> 00:40:42,127
- you'll get back to a typewriter?
- Ooh, now. Baby steps here.

846
00:40:42,129 --> 00:40:43,766
I don't know.

847
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:46,131
What I'm actually thinking of doing

848
00:40:46,741 --> 00:40:48,700
is something completely different.

849
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:51,069
Being a father.

850
00:40:52,353 --> 00:40:54,628
We'll see. Come to
think of it, Mr. Shade,

851
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:56,341
you know, you've managed to

852
00:40:57,242 --> 00:40:59,563
get yourself a pretty good second act.

853
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,793
Maybe I can too.

854
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:05,509

00:41:53,156 --> 00:41:54,365
What is it?

863
00:41:54,367 --> 00:41:55,786
Here.

864
00:41:58,637 --> 00:42:01,964
- <i>The Devil's Playground.
- I haven't read it myself,</i>

865
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:04,738
so I'm gonna give the
non-braille version a shot,

866
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:07,679
and when we're finished, we can
debrief over a cup of coffee.

867
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,040
- Deal.
- OK.

868
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:12,275
That's pretty cool, sir.

869
00:42:13,707 --> 00:42:15,015
(small sigh)

870
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,670
Thank you, Liam.

871
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,637
- (buzzing)
- <i>Text from Ruby.</i>

872
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:21,671
She's hosting the next movie night

873
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:23,628
and this is only her 10th text. Here.

874
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,897
Keep an eye on him. I'm
gonna make a quick call.

875
00:42:28,267 --> 00:42:30,755
Hey, Ruby, it's Jules.
Yeah, I'm on the ferry

876
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:33,871
with my dad and Liam.
I know, crazy, right?

877
00:42:34,777 --> 00:42:37,675
I'm glad you could join us today, Liam.

878
00:42:37,677 --> 00:42:40,540
I figured maybe you'd be off
dirt-biking with your buddies.

879
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,972
Little late in the year for that, sir.

880
00:42:43,092 --> 00:42:44,983
- Right.
- I don't know. I just, um...

881
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,018
I like hanging out with Jules.

882
00:42:47,252 --> 00:42:50,154
- And why is that?
- She's cool.

883
00:42:50,156 --> 00:42:53,251
You know? Interesting. Funny.

884
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,202
Surprising.

885
00:42:55,662 --> 00:42:57,795
And she's the only girl I know

886
00:42:57,797 --> 00:43:00,375
that really doesn't
just care about my looks.

887
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:02,400
You know?

888
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:08,940

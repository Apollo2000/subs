1
00:00:02,087 --> 00:00:04,756
<i>- Previously:</i>
- You're to be congratulated.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,887
Your son is now the proud owner
of River Run.

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,182
I can procure you whatever you wish.
I know an Irish seafaring gentlemen

4
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:14,808
who does business in Wilmington.

5
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:16,560
My husband's whisky venture...

6
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:19,563
Mr Bonnet doesn't do business
with people he doesn't know.

7
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:22,983
Mr Bonnet will be personally meeting
Mr Alexander Malcolm.

8
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,443
You must kill Stephen Bonnet.

9
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:26,361
Don't know
if I can take another man's life.

10
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:29,823
A plan has been put in motion
to find and kill Stephen Bonnet.

11
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:32,367
Bonnet could have the right
to take Jemmy away from us.

12
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:33,493
He attacked me.

13
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:37,080
People of this time see the child as proof
that you were a willing participant.

14
00:00:37,164 --> 00:00:38,916
I could've been brave. I could've fought.

15
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:40,584
I hate myself for what happened.

16
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:43,086
- You couldn't have stopped him.
- I could have tried harder.

17
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,421
It took courage not to fight.

18
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:46,715
If ye did, he would have killed ye.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

20
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:27,941
The time has come
to approach the magistrate with our request.

21
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:32,404
Obviously, your occupation...

22
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:36,116
makes matters a bit more difficult.

23
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,118
A gentleman has no occupation.

24
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,161
Precisely.

25
00:02:39,162 --> 00:02:41,706
And that is why, as your lawyer,

26
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:45,042
I advise you to be more discreet
with your dealings.

27
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,752
You have allies among the wealthy.

28
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:49,755
You've been exonerated for your crimes.

29
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:52,341
But for now, I recommend that you lie low.

30
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:55,594
I'd like to lay low
under my regular mare there.

31
00:02:57,637 --> 00:03:02,517
People might turn a blind eye
to smuggling tobacco or whisky,

32
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:06,021
but there have been rumblings
that you're trading commodities

33
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:07,898
of a female nature.

34
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:10,108
My business is none of their business.

35
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:12,652
Do you want custody of your son or not,
Mr Bonnet?

36
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:15,781
I've made allies
due to those very dealings, Mr Forbes.

37
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:18,784
They owe their wealth and influence
in part to me,

38
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:19,867
as do you.

39
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:24,039
So I suggest you start to behave
more as my lawyer

40
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,415
and less as my priest.

41
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:26,499
Oh, you have a priest?

42
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:32,422
I need you to consult with the magistrate.

43
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,008
When will we have his signature, sir?

44
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:39,179
I've provided him with the names
of the witnesses from the tavern,

45
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:42,933
and I've confirmed that they will attest
to the circumstances on said evening.

46
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:46,520
We should have a signature
by the end of the week,

47
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:49,064
and young Jeremiah will be with his father.

48
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,903
From your lips to God's ears, Mr Forbes.

49
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,622
If we might discuss
the matter of my compensation.

50
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,084
I'm no fortune teller...

51
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:13,004
but once I claim my son,
I foresee an unlucky accident

52
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:16,049
for Jocasta Innes and her new bridegroom.

53
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:20,053
Such a shame,
them being married for so short a time.

54
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:23,390
How she chose that old buffoon,
I'll never know.

55
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:26,977
And she humiliated me
during my courtship with her niece.

56
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,773
When River Run's mine,
you'll get your money.

57
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:33,692
The agreed-upon 20 percent.

58
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:37,988
We'll have a dram on the front porch
in celebration.

59
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:40,073
I look forward to it.

60
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:45,996
In the meantime,
Mistress Innes has asked to see me.

61
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,416
I'm intending to sail up on the <i>Sally Ann</i>
to Cross Creek tomorrow.

62
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,129
Not a word of this to anyone.

63
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:57,424
Confidentiality is my livelihood.

64
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,982
I have a really bad feeling about this.

65
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:18,737
I want Bonnet out of our lives for good.

66
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:23,033
And nowhere near you or our son.

67
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:25,452
Getting rid of Bonnet
is for the greater good.

68
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:27,162
Yes.

69
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:30,749
Though I still don't trust Philip Wylie...

70
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,045
even though he stands to make a lot of money
from this deal.

71
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:36,755
I think he'll keep his word.

72
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:38,673
But what if he doesn't?

73
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:40,842
Well, if he doesn't, I'll likely be dead.

74
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:42,260
So if ye could find the time,

75
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:45,138
I'll appreciate it
if ye'll make him suffer for it.

76
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,605
Here comes our go-between now.

77
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:56,566
Mr Alexander Malcolm.

78
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,569
Glad you could join us.

79
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,075
Well, Uncle, is this what ye had in mind?

80
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:06,159
Even better.

81
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:09,079
What about my markings?

82
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:11,373
I'll help you find some clay
to cover them up.

83
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:14,417
Though we don't have to fool them
for very long.

84
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:18,213
We must get to Wylie's Landing
before the parley. We'll leave at dawn.

85
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:22,467
If we've no' returned to Wilmington
in two days, go back to the Ridge.

86
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:25,762
If you don't return,
we're coming to find you.

87
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:27,472
I thought ye might say that.

88
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,599
Dinna fash.

89
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,768
Bonnet's only a man.

90
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:34,354
And nothing more.

91
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:41,194
It is rather small, isn't it?

92
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:44,364
Well, sometimes the smallest things in life
are the most useful.

93
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,824
What use do you have for it?

94
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:48,451
Well, it will be an instrument
for a physician.

95
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:50,870
It will hold medicinal liquid.

96
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:53,164
But it has a hole on both sides.

97
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:54,249
It's not finished yet.

98
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:56,459
The smith is going to make something
for the bottom

99
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:58,587
and a needle to put in the top.

100
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,672
It's a syringe.

101
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:04,676
I've heard of those,
usually a tube fitted with a piston.

102
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,720
Aren't syringes made of brass?

103
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,972
Well, usually, yes.

104
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,932
But I prefer when they're made of glass.

105
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:13,518
It's easier to sterilise.

106
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:14,602
Clean.

107
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:17,564
To use before you heal.

108
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:22,652
Well, I did blow a glass tube
for a thermometer last spring.

109
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:25,071
I suppose a glass tube is a glass tube.

110
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:26,698
Come back again in a few days' time.

111
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,158
I'll see what I can do.

112
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:30,076
Thank you.

113
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:34,497
Well, that's one down.
Let's hope the smith doesn't think

114
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:36,916
we're practising witchcraft,
asking for a hollow needle.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,710
No kidding.

116
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,920
When was the
hypodermic needle invented, again?

117
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:42,881
Not for a while yet.

118
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:44,883
I really need one.

119
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,968
You've seen your father.

120
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:49,346
He has a knack
for almost getting himself killed

121
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:51,014
every time he gets out of bed.

122
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:53,391
I swear that man is like a cat.

123
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:56,144
Got nine lives, if not more.

124
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:44,609
What if he doesn't come alone?

125
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:46,403
I'm sure he won't.

126
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:48,905
He'll bring his sailors wi' him.

127
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:53,410
What do ye ken about them, from yer voyage?

128
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:57,956
They sail with him
like they eat scorpion fish,

129
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,792
only when they're hungry
and have no other options.

130
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:04,254
His sailors follow his commands
out of fear, not love.

131
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:07,465
So long as we take care
not to give them reason

132
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:08,591
to think we're a threat,

133
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:11,136
I don't think they'll be much troubled
about Bonnet's fate.

134
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:14,180
Except they'll be in need of new employment.

135
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,267
Keep yer wits about ye.

136
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,685
This is our one chance.

137
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:21,646
There may not be another.

138
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:24,816
So we've got the kelp for the iodine.

139
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,317
And what else are we looking for?

140
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,027
Well, certain shells.

141
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,697
I can grind them down to use their calcium.

142
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,991
And maybe some sponges to use in surgery.

143
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:35,785
I can do shells. I'll save some for Jem.

144
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:38,955
Maybe I'll make him a mobile,
might make him sleep better.

145
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:55,013
When he comes,
I want to be the one to kill him.

146
00:09:58,016 --> 00:09:59,184
Now ye're telling me.

147
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,770
You said it yourself, he's just a man.

148
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:03,062
I ken what I said.

149
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:04,856
I know what you're thinking.

150
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:07,233
I've never killed a man or fought in battle.

151
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:10,862
I'm no marksman
and only a half-decent swordsman,

152
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,655
but he's mine.

153
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:14,657
I will take him.

154
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:19,996
Brianna's yer daughter, but she's my wife.

155
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:29,046
So.

156
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:30,965
Don't hesitate.

157
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:35,053
Dinna challenge him.
Kill him the moment you have the chance.

158
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:40,892
If you fall, Roger Mac,
know I will avenge ye.

159
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:43,812
And if you fall, I will avenge you.

160
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:48,066
A bargain, is it?

161
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:53,112
A rare bargain indeed.

162
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:09,337
Wait. Is that what I think it is?

163
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:17,679
We didn't often get to see sights like that
in our time.

164
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:21,432
There's so much here that's unspoiled.

165
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,644
There's so many of them now.

166
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:29,983
And to think by the end of the 19th century,
whalers had all but wiped them out.

167
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:33,319
I can see why Melville was inspired
to write about them.

168
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,488
God, I love <i>Moby Dick.</i>

169
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:36,823
Yeah, me too.

170
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:40,952
I remember seeing a whale fluke
off of Cape Cod once.

171
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:45,874
Remember when we used to race there
on the beach when I was little?

172
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,642
Man, that is not as easy in a corset.

173
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,562
I think I'm getting old.

174
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:11,941
All right, I'm gonna live dangerously,
dip my toes in the water.

175
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:14,485
Oh, you're braver than I am.

176
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:18,406
I think I might go search
for some more shells.

177
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:30,311
- Are you Malcolm?
- Aye.

178
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:32,355
You must be Captain Bonnet?

179
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:34,649
- Pleased to finally make your acquaintance.
- No.

180
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,067
Captain's not coming.

181
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,694
He sent us to inspect the goods.

182
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:39,904
But that wasn't the arrangement.

183
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:41,739
Arrangement's changed.

184
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,951
- Why?
- He had business elsewhere.

185
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:47,829
You want the whisky put on the ship or not?

186
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,502
Where are the barrels?

187
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:00,883
Where are the goods?

188
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:03,553
Do you know whose time you're wasting?

189
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:05,054
The barrels are in the shed.

190
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:44,844
What took you so long?

191
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,680
You were doing so well,
I didna think you needed the help.

192
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,692
Where's Stephen Bonnet?

193
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:02,152
Who wants to know?

194
00:15:02,195 --> 00:15:03,488
Where is he?

195
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,915
Answer the question.

196
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,961
Where's Stephen Bonnet?

197
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:31,974
They say the sea lives inside every shell.

198
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:37,395
Can you hear it?

199
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:40,608
The sea calling?

200
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,693
What are you doing here?

201
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:46,948
I was walking down the thoroughfare
in Wilmington when I saw you from afar.

202
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:50,076
I thought to myself,
"Doesn't she look familiar?"

203
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,079
You see, I never forget a face.

204
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,165
Neither yours nor your lovely daughter's.

205
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:01,587
She seems to have inherited your beauty.

206
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:08,136
How's my son?
Does he resemble his handsome father?

207
00:16:08,219 --> 00:16:09,720
You don't have a son.

208
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:10,930
You're misinformed.

209
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,766
Your daughter told me as much to my face.

210
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,893
I think I found...

211
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:17,061
Bree, run!

212
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:18,145
No.

213
00:16:19,981 --> 00:16:21,858
- Go!
- I am not leaving you.

214
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,113
- Let her go.
- Shoot him!

215
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:28,281
Let her go!

216
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:31,284
Put that down or I'll cut her throat
on the count of three.

217
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,580
One, two...

218
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:37,081
Wait! Wait.

219
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:42,378
I'll let your mother go...

220
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:44,881
as long as you come along with me.

221
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,261
It's my son and you I'm wanting.

222
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,422
Bree!

223
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:34,764
Brianna!

224
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,350
Would you like some tea?

225
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,395
- Where are we?
- You're safe on my island.

226
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,815
Where the hell is my mother?

227
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:29,986
I left her on the beach.
I have no quarrel with her.

228
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:36,409
- We have a quarrel with you.
- Still?

229
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,163
It's not because I couldn't remember
your name in the jail, is it?

230
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:47,378
Can't we just let bygones be bygones?

231
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:51,382
I have something for you.

232
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,702
For our son.

233
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:22,204
He's not our son.

234
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:25,166
His father is my husband, Roger MacKenzie.

235
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:28,002
I know you had to tell him
that the boy was his,

236
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,545
but you and I know the truth.

237
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,422
We made him.

238
00:19:32,423 --> 00:19:34,258
And there's no denying that.

239
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:38,179
I wanna do right by you and him.

240
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:42,183
To be a real father.

241
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:07,291
I have something for you too.

242
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,643
It's Brianna.

243
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:26,769
Where is she?

244
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,270
Bonnet has her.

245
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:43,119
You look so beautiful in your gift.

246
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:45,788
Please come in.

247
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,460
Am I supposed to pull out the chair for you?

248
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,048
Please sit down.

249
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:01,886
Please.

250
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,201
When we're at River Run,

251
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:26,787
we'll have better servants
to do this for us.

252
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:28,164
You mean slaves.

253
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:32,209
Is it the master of the house
who's supposed to do it?

254
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,591
Should I pass this with both hands?

255
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:44,638
You'll teach me.

256
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,725
I don't think anyone can teach you
a damn thing.

257
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:49,810
A damn thing, huh?

258
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:53,022
I'm surprised to hear language like that
from a lady.

259
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:58,027
You think someone lowly like me
can't better himself?

260
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:07,328
What I need is something I can't buy.

261
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:11,665
- A moral compass?
- To make sure our son knows what to do,

262
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:13,834
how to get on in the world.

263
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:17,213
You can show me how to be
in your world and in his.

264
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:22,176
Show me what to do.

265
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:27,264
How to be a worthy gentleman,
and no harm will come to you.

266
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:29,266
Why do you want to be a gentleman?

267
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:33,312
You saw something in me.

268
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:37,358
You're drawn to me.
We're drawn to each other.

269
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,818
That's why fate
has brought us together again...

270
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,571
and again.

271
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:46,200
To be parents to Jeremiah.

272
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:49,870
You know his name?

273
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:51,829
Of course I do.

274
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,709
Let's eat.

275
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:16,272
Elbows off the table in polite society.

276
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:19,858
And don't bend down to your food.

277
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,570
You bring your fork up to your mouth.

278
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:04,028
It's improper for a lady and gentleman
to be alone like this.

279
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:07,239
I can have some of my men come and join us,
if you'd prefer.

280
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:08,323
No.

281
00:24:09,158 --> 00:24:10,868
Thank you.

282
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,585
What now, then?

283
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:26,634
How do men and women of our standing...

284
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:29,011
pass the time?

285
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,263
You could read to me.

286
00:24:31,347 --> 00:24:34,391
That is something a gentleman would do.

287
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:39,855
Or if you don't know how,
then maybe I could read to you.

288
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,650
Here.

289
00:24:46,654 --> 00:24:48,322
Is that something you do for our son?

290
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:50,115
Does he like that?

291
00:24:56,664 --> 00:24:58,248
I love reading.

292
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,710
Putting yourself in other people's shoes...

293
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:06,173
living with characters,
learning what drives them.

294
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:10,302
Usually it's love, money...

295
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:13,097
revenge.

296
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:16,850
Which do you think drives me?

297
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,353
Money.

298
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:20,896
That's why I'm here, isn't it?

299
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,690
Because you want River Run.

300
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:27,069
It isn't ladylike to hurt a man's pride,
surely,

301
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:29,488
thinking me no better than a common thief.

302
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,281
Well, it isn't love, is it?

303
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:33,783
Prove me wrong.

304
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:36,578
You don't hurt the people you love.

305
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:41,709
And if it's revenge,
I have done nothing to you.

306
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:44,211
There are two sides to every story.

307
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:47,589
You don't know mine.

308
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,226
If I were to tell Jeremiah my story,
our story...

309
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,687
will he...

310
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:03,688
feel for me?

311
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:07,192
You can't make someone love you.

312
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:09,653
Well, I've heard the expression
"learn to love."

313
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:14,283
Perhaps you could learn to love me
for the sake of our son.

314
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,243
I think I could learn to love you.

315
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:35,012
When you came to me in the jail...

316
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:40,309
and told me that there'd be something
left of me on this earth...

317
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:47,107
I couldn't forget how that made me feel.

318
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:54,990
It wasn't for revenge or...

319
00:26:57,785 --> 00:26:59,453
for money.

320
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:05,709
So will you teach me how to love?

321
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:14,593
I'll read for you.

322
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:18,722
Like I read to Jeremiah.

323
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:30,692
This book is a good one.

324
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:32,778
I think you'll like it.

325
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:42,371
"The mysterious sea captain of the <i>Pequod</i>
was a man named Ahab.

326
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:46,542
He stood on two legs, one of flesh and bone.

327
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:52,089
The other one was made out of the bones
of a whale.

328
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:55,092
His leg had been taken during a voyage

329
00:27:55,175 --> 00:28:00,806
by another monstrous white whale
known as Moby Dick."

330
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:06,270
This is one of Jeremiah's favourites.

331
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:08,438
So my son likes tales of the sea.

332
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:17,281
"Captain Ahab nailed a doubloon
to the mast of his ship

333
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:22,077
and swore that there would be a great prize
for the first man to sight the whale.

334
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,747
He said they would stop at nothing
until they found him...

335
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:28,542
and killed him."

336
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,091
Please. Please keep reading.

337
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:45,225
"The beast was unpredictable,
as was the sea.

338
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:49,730
But every day, they arose thinking
that today would be the day

339
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,691
that they would look the monster
in the eye."

340
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:56,862
What happens in the end?
Does he get the whale?

341
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:59,281
Well, you don't want me to tell you now,
do you?

342
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,033
There's so much more to come.

343
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:04,202
You must be tired,
and I wanna know how this ends.

344
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:09,458
I really hope that Ahab slaughters the whale
and gets his revenge.

345
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,169
Moby Dick capsizes Ahab's boat,

346
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:15,839
destroys the ship,
and Ahab is dragged under the sea.

347
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:20,302
What, the monster prevails?

348
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:27,392
And Ahab is drowned, then?

349
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:32,606
Well, that depends on which one you think
is the monster.

350
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:39,029
The man hell-bent on revenge,
or the whale who's hunted.

351
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:46,328
The sea is a treacherous place
where creatures prey upon one another.

352
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,082
And the sea herself is...

353
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,460
hungry for souls.

354
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,171
What does that mean?

355
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,675
A nightmare.

356
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,596
The sea...

357
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:08,934
it comes for me.

358
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:13,188
Darkness closes in.

359
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,902
I cannot move.

360
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,156
No one comes.

361
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,411
No one ever comes.

362
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:34,209
It's only a dream.

363
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:36,712
So you don't think any less of me
for telling you?

364
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:39,214
No.

365
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:43,010
I could never think any less of you.

366
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:49,057
Does Jeremiah get scared?

367
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:51,351
Have nightmares and the like?

368
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,229
Sometimes.

369
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:58,650
He's only a little boy.

370
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,319
He needs his mother.

371
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:03,697
Oh, I never had a mother.

372
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:07,242
Or a father.

373
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,327
Or a...

374
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:11,204
I was an orphan.

375
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:23,050
What do you do to comfort him?

376
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:29,014
How could I comfort him?

377
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:32,517
Please.

378
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:35,771
Please tell me.

379
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,777
I would go to him...

380
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:46,156
take him in my arms...

381
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:49,910
and I would hold him there
until he feels safe.

382
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:56,916
Will you show me?

383
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,839
A lady would say "good night" now...

384
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,009
and she would go to her bed.

385
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,180
Alone.

386
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:22,692
Then I look forward to bidding you
good morning.

387
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,739
Me too.

388
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:15,745
Good morning, my lady.

389
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,543
Breakfast is served.

390
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:36,099
Tea?

391
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:47,611
So would we live here?

392
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:57,078
We could live anywhere you'd like.

393
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,208
A place in town, if it pleases you.

394
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:08,798
I was thinking I should go
and fetch Jeremiah.

395
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:10,800
I can't be away from him for too long.

396
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,470
I'll come with you.

397
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:19,977
Perhaps it would be better if I tell him
that you're going to be in his life.

398
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,311
We don't want to upset him.

399
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:24,272
He is only young.

400
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,985
We don't how my family are going to react.

401
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:31,279
My father and Roger are...

402
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,199
Well, they're not like you.

403
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:38,411
It would be more prudent if I were to go.

404
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:42,332
Then I'll come back to you.

405
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:45,585
Fate will bring me back to you.

406
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:47,796
Like it has before.

407
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:49,923
Is that what you want?

408
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:53,760
Well, it's what we both want, isn't it?

409
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:58,431
When would you go?

410
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:02,560
Should we not spend more time together
here first to bond?

411
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:07,107
I miss Jemmy so much,
and I know that you want to meet him.

412
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:14,155
The sooner I can leave,
the sooner I will return to you.

413
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:25,207
Yes.

414
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:36,970
And while you're gone,
I'll go to Wilmington and find us a place.

415
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:41,349
With a parlour and a bedchamber for us
and for our son.

416
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,313
And we'll seal our promise to one another
with a kiss.

417
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:20,055
If there's one thing
I don't need to be taught...

418
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,390
it's what a kiss is.

419
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:27,729
- That was just our first time...
- Don't.

420
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:30,482
- We should try again...
- I'm not good enough for you, eh?

421
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:33,526
- No, no. That is not...
- I'll give you a reason to despise me.

422
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,656
I hoped... I hoped you were being truthful.

423
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,740
I was. I...

424
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,911
I let my feelings cloud my judgement.

425
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:46,956
And the last time I did that,
I was a young workman,

426
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,459
and I was fooled into thinking
the other men liked me.

427
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:52,295
And they got me drunk,
and they left me for dead

428
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:55,048
in the foundations of a cellar
I'd helped them dig.

429
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:58,593
I don't need you to get Jemmy.

430
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:06,226
I'll show you what you're missing.

431
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:06,661
For a few pennies more,
you could watch me and her.

432
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:11,249
That one won't be enjoying herself today.

433
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,502
Then I'll collect my money.

434
00:38:15,753 --> 00:38:19,090
But send for me again when it suits you.

435
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:20,800
I'll fetch your coin.

436
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:26,222
But don't let her out of your sight.

437
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,186
Do you know where we are?

438
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:32,312
This place?

439
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:34,313
Ocracoke.

440
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:38,234
Do you know Mr Bonnet well?

441
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:39,444
Yes.

442
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:44,699
He sends for me when the fancy takes him,
or he brings me out on a boat with him.

443
00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:48,703
He's fond of breakfast in bed,
if you take my meaning.

444
00:38:48,786 --> 00:38:52,081
But I've never known him
to have two girls together

445
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:55,418
or to be wanting someone watch
while he's at his pleasure.

446
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:57,795
Was it to your liking?

447
00:38:57,879 --> 00:38:59,756
You don't understand.

448
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,383
He's holding me here against my will.

449
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:05,637
Well, whoever you are,
he takes what he wants

450
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,222
and you better not cross him.

451
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,268
- What's your name?
- They call me Eppie.

452
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:14,854
Eppie, I have to get away from here.

453
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:17,565
Chances are he'll tire of you in a few days.

454
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:20,193
No, you don't...
That's not what he wants from me.

455
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:22,820
- Is it money?
- No, I...

456
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:24,989
He means to ransom you?

457
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:27,742
I've never known scruples to interfere
with the man's appetite.

458
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:28,952
Here.

459
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:31,204
If I give you this, will you help me?

460
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,040
Help you do what?

461
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:35,458
Get word to my husband.

462
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:38,836
His name is Roger MacKenzie,
and he's in Wilmington,

463
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,880
as is my father, James Fraser.

464
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:43,299
You need to tell them where I am.

465
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:46,219
Rich, your family, then, are they?

466
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:47,720
Very.

467
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:51,766
I'd like to help you...

468
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:59,065
but Bonnet is a fair man,
as long as your interests run with his.

469
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:01,609
- If it doesn't, there won't be no warning.
- Please...

470
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:05,738
One moment, whisky and song,
the next, you're breathing blood,

471
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:07,282
if you're still breathing at all.

472
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:11,536
Mind your tongue, and all will be well.

473
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:13,830
I am begging you, woman to woman...

474
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:29,470
Fuck.

475
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:39,480
Mr Wylie.

476
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:42,400
Yet.

477
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,818
What is the meaning of this?

478
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:46,237
Why are you accosting me in the street?

479
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:47,947
Tell us where Bonnet is.

480
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:50,074
You said he'd come to us, but he didn't.

481
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:53,369
Did you give us up?
Did you tell him it was me?

482
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,330
No, I swear.

483
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:56,623
I don't know where he is.

484
00:40:56,706 --> 00:40:59,834
He keeps his goods at my landing,
and all I did was arrange for him

485
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:01,878
- to meet you there.
- He has my wife!

486
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:04,672
Where's his ship?
Where does he make berth?

487
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:07,216
I don't know. If I did, I'd tell you.

488
00:41:08,718 --> 00:41:10,428
He's made my life a misery,

489
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:13,598
threatening me with blackmail over business
he draws profit from.

490
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:16,768
Please.

491
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:24,567
There's a brothel he frequents,
Mistress Sylvie's.

492
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,944
He and I have had meetings there
in the past.

493
00:41:27,028 --> 00:41:30,281
I'm sure you will find someone there
who knows Bonnet.

494
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:33,117
He is a creature of habit.

495
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:36,954
And make yourself scarce, Mr Wylie.

496
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:38,581
Without a shadow of a doubt.

497
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:49,717
You two stay in the tavern

498
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:52,011
in case Bonnet or his men
come looking for us.

499
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:54,013
Dinna ken what he might do.

500
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:57,642
Claire and I will pay Mistress Sylvie
a visit.

501
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:17,787
Will ye have Mary
fetch some of her wee cakes, Ulysses?

502
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:18,996
Of course, sir.

503
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,873
There's no need, Ulysses.

504
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:22,750
This is business, not pleasure.

505
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:24,252
We can eat afterwards.

506
00:42:24,335 --> 00:42:26,379
Very good, mistress.

507
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,506
There.

508
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:30,299
I'm not invalid.

509
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:32,844
But you've been suffering
wi' yer headaches of late.

510
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:37,390
I have been looking forward to this.

511
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:42,520
You have my blessing to do as you wish,
my dear.

512
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:45,898
Mr Forbes, mistress.

513
00:42:45,982 --> 00:42:48,067
I'll leave you to it.

514
00:42:54,782 --> 00:42:56,451
I'll see you're not disturbed.

515
00:42:57,577 --> 00:43:00,913
A pleasure as always, Mistress Innes.

516
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,167
What can I do for you?

517
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:10,339
My nephew, Jamie, visited us not so long ago
with happy news from the Ridge.

518
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:14,010
My great-nephew, Ian,
has returned from the Mohawk.

519
00:43:14,093 --> 00:43:16,387
Oh, really? How interesting.

520
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:19,974
And Marsali's had another bairn, a wee girl.

521
00:43:20,057 --> 00:43:21,851
Oh, yeah, that's lovely.

522
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:26,939
So I was thinking,
we're very comfortable, Mr Innes and I,

523
00:43:27,023 --> 00:43:29,317
and we will be for the rest of our days.

524
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,068
We dinna want for much.

525
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:34,697
We canna take it with us when we...

526
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:36,032
You can't take what with you?

527
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:39,786
Our earthly belongings, Mr Forbes.

528
00:43:40,953 --> 00:43:46,292
I want you to help me bestow some gifts
upon my family.

529
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:49,253
Gifts? What kind of gifts?

530
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,964
My fortune.

531
00:44:16,322 --> 00:44:19,826
- Can I help you?
- Good afternoon.

532
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:24,747
Unusual to have husband and wife visit,
but not unheard of.

533
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,667
Mabel wouldn't mind being partial to women.

534
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:31,420
No. We're not here for that.

535
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:35,049
We would like to speak to your ladies,
urgently.

536
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:37,426
That'll be 10 shillings
for the inconvenience.

537
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,513
And what price would you put
on a girl's life?

538
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:42,431
Are you threatening me?

539
00:44:42,515 --> 00:44:44,058
No.

540
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:47,937
We're looking for someone,

541
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,483
and we have reason to believe that you
or some of your ladies

542
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:53,901
might know where he is.

543
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:56,112
We're looking for a man
named Stephen Bonnet.

544
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,127
You'll find paper and writing implements
on the table.

545
00:45:12,837 --> 00:45:13,837
Wonderful.

546
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:20,845
Now, Marsali and Fergus,
I'd like to give them 100 pounds.

547
00:45:23,097 --> 00:45:28,936
Generous. And you're certain
that Mr Innes is amenable to this?

548
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,730
He is indeed amenable.

549
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:33,941
Oh, you're fortunate to have found
such a good match.

550
00:45:34,025 --> 00:45:38,738
And 50 pounds for their son, Germain,
and of course for Joanie.

551
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:43,367
Twenty for the wee one
and perhaps 20 more for luck.

552
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,495
Are you recording this?

553
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:47,579
Of course.

554
00:45:49,165 --> 00:45:50,458
Every word.

555
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:52,376
Do stop me if I go too quickly.

556
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,003
Oh, not at all.

557
00:45:54,086 --> 00:45:59,091
Young Ian, bless him,
something to get him on his feet.

558
00:45:59,175 --> 00:46:02,470
One hun... No. Two hundred pounds.

559
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:08,643
Well, that is astonishingly kind.
You hardly know the lad.

560
00:46:08,726 --> 00:46:11,020
And he's been living with the Indians.

561
00:46:11,103 --> 00:46:13,606
Nevertheless, he is kin.

562
00:46:14,732 --> 00:46:18,945
Was it not enough to bequeath your property
to young Jeremiah MacKenzie?

563
00:46:19,028 --> 00:46:21,238
You're diminishing from his inheritance.

564
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:23,407
'Tis better to give than to receive.

565
00:46:25,451 --> 00:46:27,578
Brianna and Roger.

566
00:46:27,662 --> 00:46:30,706
I'm hoping to give them a sizeable sum.

567
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:33,501
Perhaps 1000 pounds.

568
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:39,131
Well...

569
00:46:40,132 --> 00:46:41,884
There we are.

570
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:50,142
Miss Brianna and her husband
will be quite comfortable as well.

571
00:46:50,226 --> 00:46:51,560
Gerald.

572
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:55,815
I had hoped it would be you she chose,

573
00:46:55,898 --> 00:47:00,361
but 'tis all water under the bridge by now.

574
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:01,529
Aye.

575
00:47:01,612 --> 00:47:03,906
Oh, we mustn't forget young Lizzie.

576
00:47:05,282 --> 00:47:06,367
The servant?

577
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,786
She's a poor sweet thing.

578
00:47:09,787 --> 00:47:11,414
- Twenty-five pounds?
- No.

579
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:13,415
No?

580
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:16,043
Whatever is the matter, Mr Forbes?

581
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:18,045
You can't give away my money.

582
00:47:19,046 --> 00:47:20,297
Your money?

583
00:47:20,381 --> 00:47:22,466
You've left me no choice.

584
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,304
You've robbed me of my dignity.

585
00:47:27,388 --> 00:47:31,017
I would have been a good husband to you
or Brianna!

586
00:47:32,018 --> 00:47:35,396
You won't rob me of my share
in your fortune!

587
00:47:49,618 --> 00:47:51,328
Mistress!

588
00:47:52,371 --> 00:47:53,748
Mistress.

589
00:47:55,332 --> 00:47:56,959
Mistress.

590
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:01,671
Jocasta.

591
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,230
Never heard of him.

592
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:25,278
Your hip.

593
00:48:26,113 --> 00:48:27,073
Anisomelia.

594
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:29,200
What did you call me?

595
00:48:29,283 --> 00:48:30,534
I didn't call you anything.

596
00:48:30,618 --> 00:48:33,245
I merely identified
what's causing the pain in your hip

597
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:34,997
and your back

598
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:37,500
and the pain that shoots down your leg
from time to time.

599
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:39,376
How did...?

600
00:48:40,878 --> 00:48:42,129
Are you a conjure woman?

601
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:43,964
No.

602
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:46,675
I'm a healer,

603
00:48:46,759 --> 00:48:49,345
and I can tell
that you're in a great deal of pain.

604
00:48:50,346 --> 00:48:51,889
Let me help you.

605
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:53,015
Please.

606
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:02,983
Turn around. Give me your gown.

607
00:49:05,361 --> 00:49:08,280
Here, hold on to the chair.

608
00:49:14,745 --> 00:49:17,456
Did you know that your legs are uneven?

609
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,166
Your left leg...

610
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,544
Well, it's longer than your right.

611
00:49:21,627 --> 00:49:26,257
And lift your right heel as I adjust it.

612
00:49:28,634 --> 00:49:29,969
Lift up.

613
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,973
There.

614
00:49:37,935 --> 00:49:39,645
Any half-decent cobbler

615
00:49:39,728 --> 00:49:42,064
should be able to make you a lift
about this thickness.

616
00:49:42,148 --> 00:49:44,233
It should greatly reduce your pain.

617
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:47,736
Perhaps even in time,
it'll completely disappear.

618
00:49:48,737 --> 00:49:53,367
I'm not so popular as to have spare money
going for fancy shoes.

619
00:49:54,368 --> 00:49:56,078
I'll be happy to make a contribution.

620
00:49:57,621 --> 00:50:00,249
- Why?
- Because when someone is in need

621
00:50:00,332 --> 00:50:03,002
and you can help, then you help.

622
00:50:04,336 --> 00:50:05,336
Please.

623
00:50:05,337 --> 00:50:07,548
Stephen Bonnet took my daughter.

624
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:12,428
She has a husband and a small child,
and I need to bring her home.

625
00:50:14,263 --> 00:50:17,183
If he ever learned it was me,
he'd slit my throat.

626
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:19,268
He will never find out.

627
00:50:24,023 --> 00:50:25,274
You'll need a boat.

628
00:50:30,112 --> 00:50:31,530
I found a boat from a fisherman.

629
00:50:31,614 --> 00:50:33,199
Very good. Let's go.

630
00:50:33,282 --> 00:50:34,575
What did you pay him with?

631
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:36,160
Oh, I didna need money, Auntie.

632
00:50:36,243 --> 00:50:39,371
He gladly took Mr Malcolm's new clothes
in return.

633
00:50:41,123 --> 00:50:44,001
Come and greet Captain Howard,
sweetheart.

634
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:46,420
Please, sir, I'm being held against my will.

635
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:48,005
My husband and my...

636
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:51,050
Of course you are.

637
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:54,011
I wouldn't be here to make a purchase
if you were here voluntarily.

638
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:06,273
Very lovely indeed.

639
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:08,776
But the red hair.

640
00:51:08,859 --> 00:51:10,945
I do prefer a flaxen mane.

641
00:51:19,411 --> 00:51:20,913
She's very fine.

642
00:51:22,164 --> 00:51:23,749
She's in good health.

643
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,750
The teeth...

644
00:51:29,672 --> 00:51:31,298
The teeth.

645
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:41,433
Very nice.

646
00:51:41,517 --> 00:51:43,060
Has she...

647
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,483
Wild bitch.

648
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:52,486
Captain, she's not yours yet, is she?

649
00:51:53,779 --> 00:51:58,117
Mine or not,
someone should teach her some manners.

650
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:03,956
I admit, I don't often shy away
from a challenge.

651
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:07,167
Breaking a wild mare.

652
00:52:08,168 --> 00:52:09,378
Six pounds.

653
00:52:22,141 --> 00:52:23,434
We're old friends.

654
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:27,646
You can take her for 6.

655
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,231
She's nothing but property.

656
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:31,692
She's not worth more than that.

657
00:52:32,776 --> 00:52:33,736
We're agreed, then?

658
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:35,321
Yes.

659
00:52:35,404 --> 00:52:37,781
She's yours as soon as I see the money.

660
00:52:39,033 --> 00:52:41,452
Follow me to the boat.

661
00:52:41,535 --> 00:52:43,746
Manny holds the purse.

662
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:45,247
Very well.

663
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:48,083
First, let's have another drink.

664
00:52:50,794 --> 00:52:53,380
For you, sweetheart, brandy.

665
00:52:53,464 --> 00:52:54,757
Well, you've earned it.

666
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,840
Please.

667
00:52:56,717 --> 00:52:58,510
Please, don't do this.

668
00:52:58,594 --> 00:53:00,804
Please, I am begging you.

669
00:53:00,888 --> 00:53:03,057
I can't be parted from Jemmy.

670
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,433
Please don't do this.

671
00:53:07,061 --> 00:53:10,814
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

672
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:27,081
Manny.

673
00:53:28,374 --> 00:53:30,167
My purse.

674
00:53:38,759 --> 00:53:39,968
Bree!

675
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:44,430
Manny!

676
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:47,266
Brianna!

677
00:53:52,773 --> 00:53:53,816
You're safe.

678
00:53:57,194 --> 00:53:59,113
We'll take our leave.

679
00:53:59,196 --> 00:54:00,406
To the boat, lad.

680
00:54:12,668 --> 00:54:14,128
Come on.

681
00:54:42,948 --> 00:54:45,033
Do you think his men will come for him?

682
00:54:45,117 --> 00:54:47,161
Not if they have any sense.

683
00:54:47,244 --> 00:54:48,704
They'll be rid of him soon enough.

684
00:54:48,787 --> 00:54:51,415
They'll have a ship and their freedom.

685
00:54:51,498 --> 00:54:53,625
And we saved them the bother of a mutiny.

686
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,432
You can have a drop. For your soul.

687
00:55:16,148 --> 00:55:19,693
Know that whatever happens,
the last face you'll see on this earth

688
00:55:19,776 --> 00:55:21,111
willna be that of a friend.

689
00:55:27,242 --> 00:55:29,745
I wanna take him to Wilmington.

690
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:33,081
I want him to be judged
according to the law.

691
00:55:34,082 --> 00:55:35,667
But can you trust them?

692
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:39,755
His dealings have bought a lot of influence
in Wilmington.

693
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:40,838
Tryon.

694
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:46,428
This bastard may have influence
with businessmen and landowners,

695
00:55:46,512 --> 00:55:50,098
but surely Governor Tryon outdoes them all.

696
00:55:50,182 --> 00:55:51,391
Even from New York.

697
00:55:51,475 --> 00:55:52,518
Aye.

698
00:55:52,601 --> 00:55:55,312
Tryon still owes us
for his mistake at Alamance.

699
00:55:56,313 --> 00:55:58,148
He'll see him condemned.

700
00:55:58,232 --> 00:56:00,108
That I'm sure of.

701
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:18,043
Stephen Bonnet, known pirate and smuggler,
was tried this morning

702
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:20,462
before the Wilmington Committee of Safety.

703
00:56:20,546 --> 00:56:22,381
And upon testimony of his crimes

704
00:56:22,464 --> 00:56:25,133
having been presented
by a number of persons,

705
00:56:25,217 --> 00:56:29,805
was convicted of them
and sentenced to death by drowning.

706
00:58:13,492 --> 00:58:14,826
Brianna.

707
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,955
Was that mercy?

708
00:58:20,123 --> 00:58:22,417
Or was it to make sure he's dead?

708
00:58:23,305 --> 00:59:23,699

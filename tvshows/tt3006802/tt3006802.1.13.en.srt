1
00:00:00,821 --> 00:00:01,858
Previously...

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:04,687
It's the watchmen ye pay
to protect your cattle.

3
00:00:04,688 --> 00:00:06,497
Otherwise they'll steal them themselves.

4
00:00:06,498 --> 00:00:08,198
- Where's Jamie?
- The watch would turn him over

5
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:10,116
in a minute if they thought
there was profit involved.

6
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:13,906
There's a chance I... I can get
the price lifted from my head.

7
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:15,815
As a witness, you can prove my innocence.

8
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,751
- A Redcoat deserter.
- Horrocks?

9
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:20,093
The man who shot the sergeant

10
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:21,927
is Captain Jonathan Randall himself.

11
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:23,965
I canna use Randall's name to clear my own.

12
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:26,688
Ye bargained for a name,
a name is what ye received.

13
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:29,033
Word filtered out that
the laird of Lallybroch

14
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:30,588
had returned with his new bride.

15
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:32,951
Since the laird's staying, he
should have the main bedchamber.

16
00:00:32,952 --> 00:00:34,955
I wouldn't dream of putting
you out of your room.

17
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:37,277
Seeing as it's the laird's room after all.

18
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:42,351
Oh, you stay silent as a lamb, my friend,

19
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:45,621
or this lovely lass is going to be
scrubbing yer brains off the floor.

_

37
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:26,391
I hope you kept yer powder dry.

38
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:30,228
Misfire...

39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,698
And Iâll ram my pistol down yer gullet.

40
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:39,821
Well, there's only one way to find out.

41
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:50,498
Taran, put your gun down.

42
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:52,801
I've found a scoundrel in here, Jenny.

43
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:54,419
He's lucky Iâve got a steady hand,

44
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:56,755
or he'd have a ball in his brain by now.

45
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:59,391
That's no scoundrel, ye fool.

46
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:01,760
It's my cousin Jamie.

47
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:05,430
Jamie MacTavish.

48
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:08,650
Cousin, ye say?

49
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:20,912
My pardon to you.

50
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:22,614
You'll understand my caution.

51
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:24,699
I've never laid eyes on you, MacTavish.

52
00:03:24,785 --> 00:03:27,452
Jamie came for a visit.

53
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:29,704
Walked in one fine day without warning

54
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,373
and with a wife on his arm.

55
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,376
Jenny and Ian didn't know we were married.

56
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:36,544
We surprised them.

57
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,463
<i>A sassenach?</i>

58
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:40,215
For a bride?

59
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,468
Nearly put a gun to his
head myself when I heard.

60
00:03:43,553 --> 00:03:44,886
But we've come to know Claire.

61
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:46,471
She's a decent woman.

62
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:50,442
We don't mind her English-ness so much.

63
00:03:53,814 --> 00:03:56,281
Pleased to make yer acquaintance, mistress.

64
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:01,453
I'm Taran MacQuarrie.

65
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:03,455
You'll excuse my confusion.

66
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,658
I thought yer husband was
intending to rob the place.

67
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:10,295
No, Taran, we like to
leave the robbing to you.

68
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,335
MacQuarrie.

69
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:18,837
We dinna expect ye till next month.

70
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:20,722
Aye, that was the plan.

71
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:24,259
But I was pining for Jenny's rabbit stew.

72
00:04:24,344 --> 00:04:28,346
I, uh... I took that sword
of yours to the smithy.

73
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:30,815
Had the nicks ground off the blade

74
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:33,351
and polished off the rust
with a bit of whale oil.

75
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:35,570
Ye needn't have troubled yerself.

76
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:38,573
It was no trouble.

77
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:42,778
It's better than new.

78
00:04:42,863 --> 00:04:43,945
Aye.

79
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:50,785
You're welcome.

80
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:55,757
So...

81
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:58,092
My stomach's rumbling like thunder.

82
00:04:58,178 --> 00:05:01,379
Jenny, how about ye put
some supper on the fire?

83
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:03,631
Ye know yer way to the dining room, lads.

84
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:07,602
I do indeed.

85
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,145
- MacQuarrie's come.
- Let's get supper ready.

86
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,063
Are you daft, sister?

87
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:20,698
Welcoming the watch into our home.

88
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:22,367
Agh, hold yer tongue.

89
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:24,082
It's not like we had a choice, now, is it?

90
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,570
It's only for a couple of days.

91
00:05:25,622 --> 00:05:27,622
MacQuarrie's a decent fellow.

92
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:29,407
Oh, and ye fixed his sword for him.

93
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,576
Maybe you'd like to
polish his boots as well.

94
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:34,437
I did the man a favor, that's all.

95
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:37,390
They're criminals, out
to line their own pockets.

96
00:05:37,442 --> 00:05:39,558
The money we pay is for protection

97
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:42,311
from the Redcoats and other raiding clans.

98
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:45,231
They look out for us,
Jamie, and our tenants.

99
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:46,615
And what about the price on my head?

100
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:48,484
If the watch knew, they'd turn me over

101
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:50,236
to the Redcoats in a heartbeat.

102
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:52,048
That's why we're going
to fill their bellies,

103
00:05:52,073 --> 00:05:54,073
give them a place to
sleep, and you, cousin,

104
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:55,458
are going to keep yer wits about ye

105
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:58,711
until they've moved on.

106
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:00,629
How often do these men come around?

107
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:03,299
Every few months, for
nigh on two years now.

108
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:05,134
I never would have agreed to this.

109
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:08,054
But you weren't here, now,
were you, Jamie MacTavish?

110
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:09,638
Keep your voices down.

111
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:12,725
Do you want them to hear you?

112
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:29,775
Jamie...

113
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:34,080
You think it hasn't taken
its toll on Jenny and me?

114
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:35,414
Well, it has.

115
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,535
But it was our burden to bear.

116
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,254
If you've got a better idea, let's hear it.

117
00:06:47,795 --> 00:06:50,046
- Ah!
- Jenny?

118
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,134
- Breathe, relax.
- Here, let's get you a seat.

119
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:58,521
- Is it the bairn?
- Aye.

120
00:06:58,606 --> 00:07:00,806
Kicks like a mule on fire.

121
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:05,394
Just listen to your sister.

122
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Tread lightly and don't provoke them.

123
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:20,459
Oh, burns like a torch going down, aye?

124
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:22,328
As long as it wets my thrapple.

125
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,663
Aye, Jenny hides the good
stuff away when we come.

126
00:07:24,715 --> 00:07:27,166
Along with Ian's fine tobacco.

127
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:31,053
Do ye blame me?

128
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:37,726
You're a quiet one. Where
are you from, MacTavish?

129
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:39,512
Na h-innse gall.

130
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:42,014
Aye, ye don't sound like an islander.

131
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:44,066
Well, Jamie spent time in France

132
00:07:44,152 --> 00:07:46,318
fighting with the french army with Ian.

133
00:07:46,354 --> 00:07:49,188
Perhaps that's what's
influenced his accent.

134
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:51,023
Did ye, now?

135
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:54,360
I did some soldiering myself
with the french in Austria.

136
00:07:54,445 --> 00:07:56,412
Were ye posted in Spain with Ian?

137
00:07:56,497 --> 00:07:59,081
Aye.

138
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:01,000
Aye, the border mostly.

139
00:08:01,035 --> 00:08:03,669
We got separated during a battle.

140
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:06,122
I thought he'd died on the field.

141
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:10,342
- Hmm.
- That was Silesia in '40.

142
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:15,631
He spent the next three weeks
convalescing in a brothel.

143
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:20,052
In a hospital. Thank ye, Mr. MacTavish.

144
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:25,524
Now, I was in Silesia in
'42 when they stormed Prague.

145
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,277
We took that fortress
before Francis Stephen

146
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:31,030
knew what hit him.

147
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:35,651
"Never be taken alive."

148
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:38,370
How daring.

149
00:08:38,406 --> 00:08:40,706
There's nothing like charging into the guns

150
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:43,075
after that first volley before the enemies

151
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:45,578
- get a chance to reload.
- Aye.

152
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,747
And a sword to the head puts
a good end to the second.

153
00:08:52,753 --> 00:08:56,255
So you're an old colleague.

154
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,474
Curious...

155
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,645
'Cause Iâve traded a
lot of army tales with Ian,

156
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,097
and he's never mentioned you.

157
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:14,573
- I'm sure I must have.
- No, Iâm sure you didn't.

158
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:17,443
If you two weren't so deep into the drink,

159
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:20,029
Iâm sure you'd remember.

160
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:25,951
Here's to a long life and a merry one,

161
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:29,288
a quick death and an easy one,

162
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,007
a pretty girl and an honest one,

163
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:34,126
a stiff whiskey and another one.

164
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:37,263
Aye.

165
00:09:44,305 --> 00:09:47,389
- How long are you staying?
- A few days.

166
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:56,315
I have a few more men arriving tomorrow.

167
00:09:56,367 --> 00:10:00,119
We are planning something big.

168
00:10:00,154 --> 00:10:02,788
I'll tell you about it
after if you're interested.

169
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,544
In the meantime, one of my
horses has turned up lame.

170
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:09,962
Needs shoeing.

171
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:12,131
I'll need to see the smithy in the morning.

172
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,133
I'll take a look at him for ye.

173
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:16,001
- I'm good with horses.
- Aye.

174
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:20,556
And we wouldn't want anything
to keep ye from yer travels.

175
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:23,175
I'll take ye up on yer offer.

176
00:10:23,261 --> 00:10:25,060
Our compliments to the cook.

177
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:28,013
But if I take another bite,
Iâll be sleeping in the mud pen

178
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:30,232
with the swine.

179
00:10:30,318 --> 00:10:32,651
There are extra blankets
for ye in the south cottage

180
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:36,155
and fresh hay.

181
00:11:03,718 --> 00:11:05,934
I see ye helped yerself to Ian's tobacco.

182
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,221
Fine tobacco it is...

183
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:11,724
Too fine for the likes of you.

184
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:14,143
Yeah, shh.

185
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:15,778
Rabbie.

186
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:18,564
<i>Fetch me the pincers, a bhalaich.</i>

187
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:21,567
<i>Gun dail.</i>

188
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,624
An abscess.

189
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,576
No wonder he turned up lame.

190
00:11:30,628 --> 00:11:32,077
When was the last time you had him shod?

191
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,079
Just get it mended.

192
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:47,926
Fire!

193
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:55,017
Fire!

194
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:01,573
I'll pish on it for ye.

195
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:03,942
Fire!

196
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:05,244
Fire!

197
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,863
Aye. More.

198
00:12:07,948 --> 00:12:10,616
Fire!

199
00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:23,962
This family's taken ye in,

200
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:25,798
given ye food, shelter.

201
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,800
You might want to show some gratitude.

202
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:32,054
And you might want to remember
who has the pistol here.

203
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:11,009
Stand down!

204
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:12,728
Stand down!

205
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:16,315
All of ye.

206
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,235
Go on, get out of here. Go on!

207
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:24,189
My apologies for the stramash.

208
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:27,693
They're good lads. They're
just a wee bit coarse.

209
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:30,996
And they didna have the
army like we did, aye.

210
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:34,249
I'm trying to school them.

211
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,085
Good luck to ye.

212
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:40,539
You know, I could use a man like you,

213
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:42,541
not just a Bonnie fighter...

214
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:45,210
A warrior.

215
00:13:54,054 --> 00:13:56,972
I've done enough fighting in my life.

216
00:13:57,057 --> 00:13:59,858
I'm settled now.

217
00:13:59,894 --> 00:14:01,560
You let me know if ye change yer mind.

218
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:06,565
Bhrain! Lucais!

219
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:20,579
It's about time.

220
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:22,581
Beginning to think ye
weren't gonna grace us

221
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,584
with your presence, Mr. Horrocks.

222
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,817
You two lads know each other?

223
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,862
I thought so.

224
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:56,782
But you tom-faced Scots
all look the same to me.

225
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,623
Let's get a drink.

226
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:09,161
But he knows there's a price on your head.

227
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:11,913
Aye.

228
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:15,083
Traitor to the British.

229
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:18,386
He's got no problem
robbing and killing Scots.

230
00:15:18,472 --> 00:15:20,255
He won't stay quiet for long.

231
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:25,427
Why would he stay quiet at all?

232
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:29,097
Surely there must be something he wants.

233
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:32,317
Lallybroch was the one
place I thought we'd be safe.

234
00:15:34,404 --> 00:15:35,937
I should never have come home.

235
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:38,990
Don't say that.

236
00:15:39,026 --> 00:15:42,494
Whatever happens, we'll handle it...

237
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:46,081
No matter the cost.

238
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:50,202
Now, you see here?

239
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:53,872
The Chisholm land borders
the Fraser's land to the west,

240
00:15:53,924 --> 00:15:56,258
and the Chisholm rent
party will be traveling

241
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:58,093
through this pass tomorrow.

242
00:15:58,178 --> 00:16:01,963
Our best shot's Lochaber
Bridge, a day's ride.

243
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:05,217
We take 'em just after
they cross under the bridge.

244
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:07,302
That's a fine spot for an ambush.

245
00:16:07,387 --> 00:16:09,471
And they'll be flush, ye say?

246
00:16:09,556 --> 00:16:11,356
- Aye.
- Ah, their sacks will be

247
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:13,942
the fullest with coin and goods.

248
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,979
After this, we've got the mending.

249
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:19,531
Ye any good with a needle?

250
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:21,950
Well, Iâve stitched
more wounds than clothes,

251
00:16:22,035 --> 00:16:23,235
but Iâll give it a whirl.

252
00:16:23,287 --> 00:16:26,955
Oh!

253
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,790
Jamie, have ye no sense?

254
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:30,375
Look what you've done
to your auntie's skirt.

255
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,160
- It's all right.
- I don't mind.

256
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:33,879
Well, I mind. Mrs. Crook.

257
00:16:33,914 --> 00:16:35,330
I'll take him back to the house

258
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:36,748
for a bit of bread and honey.

259
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:43,471
Be nice to get some chores done

260
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:45,757
without a bairn under my feet.

261
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:49,177
Some days I can scarce
go to the privy alone.

262
00:16:49,263 --> 00:16:53,765
But soon he'll have a
wee brother to play with.

263
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:55,483
How do you know it's not a sister?

264
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:57,819
Well, Iâve had no morning sickness

265
00:16:57,905 --> 00:17:01,239
and a taste for salty food,
and Iâm carrying low,

266
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:02,774
same as wee Jamie.

267
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:06,111
It's a boy, all right.

268
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:07,279
You have siblings?

269
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:10,365
No, Iâm an only child.

270
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:15,754
Well, it's good for a
man to have a brother.

271
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:19,457
Jamie was only eight when
we lost Willie to smallpox.

272
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:21,960
He said Ian's been like a brother to him.

273
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:23,762
Aye, he is.

274
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:25,964
The two of them were like
one after Willie died,

275
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,766
especially in a fight.

276
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:30,018
Auld John, Ian's father, used to tell Ian

277
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:32,804
his job was to guard
his chief's weaker side.

278
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:34,222
And he did.

279
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:36,141
When Jamie and Ian stood
shoulder to shoulder,

280
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:38,777
there was no one who could
take the pair of them down.

281
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:43,982
Jenny...

282
00:17:44,034 --> 00:17:47,235
What's wrong?

283
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:50,822
My waters have broken.

284
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:52,741
Looks like this laddie's on his way.

285
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:56,077
- All right.
- Let's get you inside.

286
00:18:13,096 --> 00:18:14,429
Jenny...

287
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:17,348
It feels to me that this baby is breech.

288
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:21,219
Well...

289
00:18:21,304 --> 00:18:23,221
He's in the wrong position.

290
00:18:23,306 --> 00:18:26,391
The head should be down
here, but it's still up here.

291
00:18:26,443 --> 00:18:29,360
He's a footling, then?

292
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:31,946
Yes, I suppose.

293
00:18:32,032 --> 00:18:34,532
We're going to have to turn him.

294
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:36,451
I'm going to need you to lie on your side,

295
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:39,571
and then Iâll have to palpate the belly.

296
00:18:39,656 --> 00:18:41,372
Here.

297
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:45,994
You know about babies and such, then?

298
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,378
I've seen childbirth.

299
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:10,568
You've not yet been with
child yourself, then?

300
00:19:10,604 --> 00:19:12,353
No, I haven't.

301
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:15,523
Grannie MacNab says ye should drink a tea

302
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:22,614
of raspberry leaves and
rosehips when the moon is waxing.

303
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,032
That and a bit of lady's mantle

304
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:27,535
wi' a raw egg beaten up in it.

305
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:44,185
It's not working, is it?

306
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:48,306
No, it isn't.

307
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:51,976
He's determined to land on his feet.

308
00:19:52,028 --> 00:19:55,530
- He's a stubborn one.
- Definitely has Fraser in him.

309
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:05,657
We should go get Ian. He
should know what's going on.

310
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:08,209
I'll not tell him anything
and neither will you.

311
00:20:08,295 --> 00:20:10,328
No point in worrying the man.

312
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:17,335
Tell him the bairn's
coming... Nothing else.

313
00:20:39,943 --> 00:20:42,643
Making yourself comfortable?

314
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:46,564
I was wondering when you'd seek me out?

315
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:48,533
We have a lot to talk about.

316
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:52,153
Then let's talk.

317
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:54,455
This...

318
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,624
This is all yours.

319
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:02,713
Isn't it?

320
00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:06,501
Yeah, I saw the name
Fraser carved in the lintel.

321
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:10,721
Who's Jenny to ye?

322
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:15,893
Very well. Don't tell me.

323
00:21:17,597 --> 00:21:19,730
She's bonny.

324
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:25,736
So's your bride.

325
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:27,355
Yeah.

326
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,241
They speak about the luck o' the Irish.

327
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:33,244
But you, Jamie Fraser,

328
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,414
- you're the lucky man.
- What do you want, Horrocks?

329
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:42,286
To sail to the colonies.

330
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:43,421
Boston, I fancy.

331
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:45,456
Then go.

332
00:21:45,508 --> 00:21:48,593
Scotland won't miss you.

333
00:21:48,628 --> 00:21:51,178
I'm gonna need money for my venture.

334
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,050
You'll have plenty in
your pockets after the raid

335
00:21:56,135 --> 00:21:57,885
on the rent party.

336
00:21:57,971 --> 00:21:59,854
Ah, it's a start, but not much of one,

337
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:02,723
not after I divvy the pot with the others.

338
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:05,476
My thinking was...

339
00:22:05,528 --> 00:22:08,362
Maybe you'd be willing to help a fellow...

340
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:11,449
Same way as Iâm helping
you by keeping my mouth shut.

341
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:14,402
- For a price, Iâm sure.
- You're a canny lad.

342
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,155
But you put up some money now, and I swear,

343
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:20,124
you'll not see my face again.

344
00:22:28,852 --> 00:22:30,518
How much?

345
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,728
- He's dropped now.
- I can feel it.

346
00:22:40,814 --> 00:22:43,564
- All right.
- We just have to wait.

347
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:49,320
Tell me what it's like, being pregnant.

348
00:22:51,324 --> 00:22:52,907
Well, it's no romp in the heather.

349
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:55,159
- Can't you see my face?
- I know. Come on.

350
00:22:55,211 --> 00:22:57,495
Tell me.

351
00:23:02,886 --> 00:23:07,722
Well, uh, in the early days,

352
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:11,976
it's just a bit like wind in your belly.

353
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:15,096
Later, you start to feel the child move.

354
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:19,734
And it's like a fish on
a line, just a quick tug,

355
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:22,904
and then gone so soon,
you're not sure you felt it.

356
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:29,694
They sleep for hours at a time.

357
00:23:29,746 --> 00:23:31,245
Sometimes when there's been no movement,

358
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:33,998
you fear they've died.

359
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:37,201
And then you try to wake
them, and when they kick again,

360
00:23:37,287 --> 00:23:38,753
well...

361
00:23:41,624 --> 00:23:44,842
You get down on yer knees and
promise god anything he asks

362
00:23:44,878 --> 00:23:47,628
if he'll just keep them safe.

363
00:23:47,714 --> 00:23:49,547
Ooh.

364
00:23:55,355 --> 00:23:57,722
Just breathe.

365
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,728
And towards the end,

366
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,230
when the child moves a lot,

367
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:09,534
it's a feeling like

368
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:11,619
when yer man's inside ye.

369
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,627
When he comes to ye deep
and pours himself inside ye

370
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:24,131
and that throbbing begins...

371
00:24:24,217 --> 00:24:25,967
Feels like that,

372
00:24:26,052 --> 00:24:29,754
only much bigger, like...

373
00:24:29,806 --> 00:24:32,223
Like it's him you've
taken into you instead.

374
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,931
That's what they want sometimes, ye know.

375
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:44,769
They want to come back.

376
00:24:56,115 --> 00:24:57,782
Mistress?

377
00:24:57,867 --> 00:24:59,534
There's word from the village.

378
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:01,752
The midwife was called
away to tend to a relative

379
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:03,588
who's taken ill.

380
00:25:17,637 --> 00:25:20,021
It's all right.

381
00:25:20,106 --> 00:25:22,557
It is possible to deliver a breech baby.

382
00:25:22,642 --> 00:25:24,942
I'm going to have to reach
inside and guide it out.

383
00:25:29,065 --> 00:25:30,565
All right, but you'll be fetching me

384
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,116
a good stiff dram before we start.

385
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:34,235
In that case, the baby
will likely be drunk too.

386
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,704
Then he'll come into the world a true Scot.

387
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,741
All right.

388
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,581
Ever since they got here,

389
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:49,000
ye have the look on your
face like you've got a thistle

390
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:51,252
stuck up your ass. You're provoking them.

391
00:25:51,337 --> 00:25:54,805
They burnt hay we need for winter.

392
00:25:54,841 --> 00:25:57,842
You'd have me turn the other cheek?

393
00:25:57,894 --> 00:26:00,761
That's why you've got
two cheeks, ye limmer.

394
00:26:05,985 --> 00:26:08,603
Jenny hates the very bones of them.

395
00:26:08,688 --> 00:26:11,906
I canna understand why you don't.

396
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:15,576
MacQuarrie could take more
from the estate than he does.

397
00:26:15,662 --> 00:26:19,580
Just ask the MacIntoshes.
He's been easy on us.

398
00:26:21,034 --> 00:26:22,750
So you're boon companions with him.

399
00:26:22,835 --> 00:26:26,037
Aye, so I am.

400
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,589
And if you want to ken the truth of it,

401
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:30,875
I look forward to his visits...

402
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:34,095
To drink whiskey with a man
who doesna look on me with pity,

403
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,714
as if Iâm some lame cur.

404
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:38,883
Maybe I favor him because he's a soldier

405
00:26:38,968 --> 00:26:40,885
or because...

406
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,891
Because he reminds me of you.

407
00:26:50,196 --> 00:26:53,731
And because he protects
us from the Redcoats.

408
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:56,233
He pays them to stay
away, and when they don't,

409
00:26:56,285 --> 00:26:58,202
he fights them.

410
00:26:58,237 --> 00:27:00,621
Ye pay one devil to
protect ye from another.

411
00:27:00,707 --> 00:27:02,740
I'm not proud of it, but there it is.

412
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,999
What happened here with
Jenny never will again.

413
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:15,002
But no man can stand up to
that monster Randall alone,

414
00:27:15,088 --> 00:27:16,804
not you, not me.

415
00:27:16,889 --> 00:27:18,839
It takes an army.

416
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:21,175
The watch is our army now.

417
00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:29,100
What's the matter?

418
00:27:33,856 --> 00:27:37,608
That new man, Horrocks...

419
00:27:37,694 --> 00:27:38,826
I've met him before.

420
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:41,278
He knows about the price on my head.

421
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,531
He wants money to keep quiet.

422
00:27:43,616 --> 00:27:45,199
What are you going to do?

423
00:27:48,621 --> 00:27:51,756
I dinna ken.

424
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:54,258
Jenny told me about a
small sum your father left.

425
00:27:54,293 --> 00:27:56,594
It's ferreted away in a nook in the Broch.

426
00:27:56,629 --> 00:27:59,096
- I canna use that money.
- Half of it's yours by right.

427
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:00,965
If Jenny knew about this, she'd want...

428
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,633
She doesn't know about it.

429
00:28:04,937 --> 00:28:07,772
And I want it kept that way.

430
00:28:07,807 --> 00:28:09,106
I won't be taking that money.

431
00:28:09,142 --> 00:28:12,193
Yes, ye will.

432
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:14,145
It's what she would want.

433
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,313
It's what I want.

434
00:28:18,568 --> 00:28:20,151
That money was meant for you,

435
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:22,236
for our sons and daughters.

436
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:24,822
I wanted to fill this
house with our children,

437
00:28:24,907 --> 00:28:27,658
hand down the good Fraser name.

438
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:30,995
I've let ye down, Claire.

439
00:28:47,597 --> 00:28:50,181
It's me that's let you down.

440
00:28:57,857 --> 00:29:00,191
Truth is, I may never give you a son

441
00:29:00,276 --> 00:29:03,527
as beautiful as little Jamie.

442
00:29:06,115 --> 00:29:08,916
I don't think I can have children.

443
00:29:12,705 --> 00:29:16,540
I tried before I met you.

444
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:20,928
With Frank.

445
00:29:28,971 --> 00:29:31,105
I should have told you
before we were married,

446
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,057
but...

447
00:29:33,142 --> 00:29:36,560
I never counted on loving you...

448
00:29:36,646 --> 00:29:38,896
Much less having children with you.

449
00:29:49,742 --> 00:29:52,126
I'm so sorry.

450
00:30:02,088 --> 00:30:04,088
Perhaps it's for the best.

451
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,566
There's... there's so many
things that can go wrong.

452
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:18,569
I wouldn't want anything to happen to ye...

453
00:30:18,604 --> 00:30:20,271
Or for ye to suffer.

454
00:30:22,742 --> 00:30:26,026
- I wouldn't mind the pain.
- I would.

455
00:30:26,112 --> 00:30:29,163
I can bear pain myself, but...

456
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:31,248
I couldna bear yours.

457
00:30:34,787 --> 00:30:38,505
That would take more strength than I have.

458
00:30:48,184 --> 00:30:50,050
I shouldna keep you from Jenny.

459
00:30:50,136 --> 00:30:53,053
Of course.

460
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:58,692
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

461
00:30:59,946 --> 00:31:01,779
I'll make sure of it.

462
00:31:51,614 --> 00:31:54,031
Oh. Ho-ho.

463
00:31:54,116 --> 00:31:56,200
I must thank ye.

464
00:31:56,285 --> 00:31:58,786
You've been generous.

465
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:01,705
- Then we're done here.
- Yeah.

466
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:05,175
There's just one small concern.

467
00:32:05,211 --> 00:32:07,594
- I thought there might be.
- This is enough

468
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,381
for safe passage to the colonies.

469
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:13,350
But then there's the matter of
making a living when Iâm there...

470
00:32:13,386 --> 00:32:16,270
I'll buy a small shop, start a business.

471
00:32:16,355 --> 00:32:19,023
I hear Boston's an expensive city.

472
00:32:19,058 --> 00:32:22,059
That's everything I have.

473
00:32:22,111 --> 00:32:24,561
But you're the laird.

474
00:32:24,647 --> 00:32:27,231
Surely you can raise the
rents of your tenants, huh?

475
00:32:27,283 --> 00:32:29,733
Sell off livestock or land?

476
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:32,236
This is clan land.

477
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:34,488
Belonged to my family
for hundreds of years.

478
00:32:34,573 --> 00:32:36,740
More's the pity if you lost it, then.

479
00:32:38,828 --> 00:32:42,079
You must be deep in the
drink to say such a thing.

480
00:32:45,251 --> 00:32:49,053
Ah, an Irishmanâs never drunk

481
00:32:49,088 --> 00:32:51,305
as long as he can hold
on to one blade of grass

482
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,059
and not fall off the face of the earth.

483
00:32:55,094 --> 00:32:59,430
I do partake from time to
time, and my tongue gets loose.

484
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:01,598
Who knows what I might say?

485
00:33:01,684 --> 00:33:04,018
I'm a danger to myself...

486
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:06,520
And others...

487
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:07,738
Like your kith and kin.

488
00:33:07,773 --> 00:33:10,607
You leave my kin out of this.

489
00:33:12,328 --> 00:33:14,278
The British army don't take kindly

490
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:17,247
to those who harbor outlaws.

491
00:33:17,283 --> 00:33:20,034
Prison's no place for decent folk.

492
00:33:21,587 --> 00:33:24,088
I'm sure you'd agree.

493
00:33:53,536 --> 00:33:57,404
I thought I killed my last man in the war.

494
00:34:02,328 --> 00:34:04,161
I'm grateful.

495
00:34:04,246 --> 00:34:08,715
Well if ye hadn't done it,
I would've done it myself.

496
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:10,801
The man was an absconder,
a traitor, and a thief.

497
00:34:10,836 --> 00:34:13,303
He wasna worthy of the watch

498
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:16,006
nor even a Redcoat.

499
00:34:16,092 --> 00:34:17,307
Let's bury the bastard,

500
00:34:17,343 --> 00:34:20,177
which is more than he deserves.

501
00:34:26,152 --> 00:34:29,186
Wipe the blood off first.

502
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:31,188
Ian.

503
00:34:51,844 --> 00:34:55,045
Remember...

504
00:34:55,097 --> 00:34:59,433
We used to argue which
was the bigger sin...

505
00:35:02,388 --> 00:35:06,140
Fornication or killing...

506
00:35:10,813 --> 00:35:13,397
And worry whether we would go to hell.

507
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:25,242
Well, if you're going to hell,

508
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:28,078
I might as well go too.

509
00:35:30,082 --> 00:35:32,416
God knows you'll never manage alone.

510
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:38,755
Go get the shovel.

511
00:35:56,492 --> 00:35:58,275
Take this.

512
00:35:58,327 --> 00:36:02,112
My fingers are swelling up like sausages.

513
00:36:02,164 --> 00:36:03,697
Ye can put it in the jewelry box

514
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:06,783
I keep it hidden in the drawer
when the watch is around.

515
00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:29,022
Our brother Willie carved that for Jamie

516
00:36:29,108 --> 00:36:30,641
for his fifth birthday.

517
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:33,443
Found it recently. I
meant to give it to him.

518
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:38,198
"Sawny."

519
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:39,733
It's a pet name.

520
00:36:39,818 --> 00:36:42,152
It's a play on the Gaelic
for his second name...

521
00:36:42,204 --> 00:36:43,453
Alexander.

522
00:36:43,489 --> 00:36:45,372
It's what Willie used to call Jamie.

523
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,128
I know he'd want him to have it.

524
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:03,724
Willie's buried out there...

525
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:05,592
Next to my mother.

526
00:37:08,681 --> 00:37:12,316
She died two years after he did,

527
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:13,684
in childbirth.

528
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:26,246
Give it to Jamie for me.

529
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,501
You give it to him yourself.

530
00:37:43,515 --> 00:37:46,717
- Woman!
- Quit yer scriechin'!

531
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:53,390
Yer wife's howling like she's
giving birth to a harpsichord.

532
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,408
I think we've used a bit
more of your hay than usual.

533
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,412
Buy some extra, in case
ye run short in the winter.

534
00:38:24,423 --> 00:38:26,890
Ye know, we haven't seen
Horrocks since supper.

535
00:38:26,925 --> 00:38:29,393
No.

536
00:38:29,428 --> 00:38:31,178
Neither have I.

537
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,401
Ah, he'll turn up...

538
00:38:37,436 --> 00:38:38,985
Irish pogue.

539
00:38:41,573 --> 00:38:43,490
He'd better...

540
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:48,245
'Cause we leave for Lochaber tomorrow.

541
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,365
- Ah!
- Hey, lads.

542
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,583
Tomorrow, aye.

543
00:39:05,798 --> 00:39:07,464
How's Jenny?

544
00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:10,267
The babbie's taking its own sweet time.

545
00:39:10,302 --> 00:39:12,436
But she's coming along.

546
00:39:14,857 --> 00:39:17,774
Well, there's still no sign
of our friend Mr. Horrocks...

547
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:21,528
Which is a wee bit of a puzzle.

548
00:39:21,613 --> 00:39:23,814
It is a puzzle.

549
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:29,653
Well, his horse is just outside,

550
00:39:29,705 --> 00:39:32,239
so he can't have gone far,

551
00:39:32,324 --> 00:39:35,325
given that the man would
barely walk ten steps to pish,

552
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:38,495
much less wander away.

553
00:39:38,547 --> 00:39:40,580
Now...

554
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:43,717
I have a fair knowledge of mathematics.

555
00:39:43,802 --> 00:39:45,886
Three men go out,

556
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:47,921
two men come in.

557
00:39:52,511 --> 00:39:57,347
If I add to that the fact
that you two knew each other

558
00:39:57,433 --> 00:39:59,683
and you hid it from me...

559
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:08,241
That doesn't tally up.

560
00:40:15,784 --> 00:40:17,200
I don't get yer meaning.

561
00:40:21,006 --> 00:40:23,757
Why'd you kill him?

562
00:40:33,352 --> 00:40:35,552
- Let me explain.
- I'm a wanted man.

563
00:40:44,363 --> 00:40:46,613
There's a price on my head...

564
00:40:46,698 --> 00:40:49,649
Ten pounds sterling...

565
00:40:49,735 --> 00:40:51,868
Likely twice that now.

566
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:56,790
Horrocks knew it.

567
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:59,743
He threatened me and my family.

568
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,747
So...

569
00:41:08,637 --> 00:41:11,638
I ran him through.

570
00:41:19,932 --> 00:41:23,433
Good.

571
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:26,436
I never liked the Irish bastard.

572
00:41:26,488 --> 00:41:28,939
If ever a man needed killing, it was him.

573
00:41:37,032 --> 00:41:39,749
We're raiding the Chisholms today,

574
00:41:39,785 --> 00:41:43,587
and now Iâm a man short.

575
00:41:43,622 --> 00:41:48,458
And I could do with a tall, strong Scotsman

576
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:51,294
who's swift with a sword.

577
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,296
So, unless you're prepared
to dig seven graves,

578
00:41:53,382 --> 00:41:55,181
including your own...

579
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:13,450
I'll ride with ye...

580
00:42:17,823 --> 00:42:21,157
This once.

581
00:42:21,243 --> 00:42:23,159
- I'm coming too.
- No, you're not.

582
00:42:23,245 --> 00:42:25,495
Oh, if he wants to come, let him come.

583
00:42:25,547 --> 00:42:28,131
He's got two hands. He can hold a gun.

584
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,420
I'll have you both.

585
00:42:33,505 --> 00:42:35,722
Watch your back.

586
00:42:35,807 --> 00:42:37,674
He could still turn you in for the reward

587
00:42:37,759 --> 00:42:39,759
after you've served his purpose.

588
00:42:39,845 --> 00:42:43,396
I don't think he will,
but Iâm going with him.

589
00:42:43,482 --> 00:42:45,432
You should stay.

590
00:42:45,517 --> 00:42:47,484
Jenny needs her husband here with her.

591
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:49,436
What I need is my brother home safe.

592
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:51,438
I lost him once already.

593
00:42:51,523 --> 00:42:53,740
And Claire's here, so
off with the both of ye.

594
00:42:53,825 --> 00:42:56,359
But haste ye back, Ian Murray.

595
00:42:56,445 --> 00:43:00,196
Your newborn son will
be waiting to meet ye.

596
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:29,559
Jenny found this, asked
me to give it to you.

597
00:43:32,064 --> 00:43:33,196
Sawny.

598
00:43:42,324 --> 00:43:45,575
I haven't seen him for a long time.

599
00:43:56,254 --> 00:43:58,254
You heard your sister.

600
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,141
Haste ye back or else.

601
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:07,313
Or else what?

602
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:09,983
Or else...

603
00:44:10,068 --> 00:44:11,434
I will follow you.

604
00:44:11,486 --> 00:44:15,605
I will drag you back by
your thick, red curls,

605
00:44:15,657 --> 00:44:18,158
and you won't like it one bit.

606
00:44:18,243 --> 00:44:20,744
No...

607
00:44:20,779 --> 00:44:24,447
<i>Sassenach...</i>

608
00:44:24,499 --> 00:44:26,249
I'm sure I wouldn't.

609
00:45:17,836 --> 00:45:19,753
Good being out on the road again, eh?

610
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:22,388
In the pishing rain.

611
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:26,726
The road's a dangerous place to live.

612
00:45:26,812 --> 00:45:28,511
Why do ye do it?

613
00:45:28,563 --> 00:45:32,015
Robbing's not an entirely
honorable profession.

614
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,984
I'm a fighter.

615
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,486
I'm good at it.

616
00:45:36,521 --> 00:45:40,490
I grew tired of fighting
for rich dukes and monarchs.

617
00:45:40,525 --> 00:45:44,244
I realized the world was mine.

618
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:48,414
And money taken is twice
as sweet as money earned.

619
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,500
Here...

620
00:45:50,535 --> 00:45:53,119
That's a souvenir for our last raid.

621
00:45:53,205 --> 00:45:54,205
Open.

622
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:59,709
"Pale death

623
00:45:59,795 --> 00:46:03,546
"visits with impartial foot

624
00:46:03,598 --> 00:46:06,683
"the cottages of the poor

625
00:46:06,718 --> 00:46:09,686
and the castles of the rich."

626
00:46:14,276 --> 00:46:17,393
These were made for Mary Stuart...

627
00:46:17,479 --> 00:46:19,145
Real barrel of laughs, that one.

628
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,399
You know, I don't mind death

629
00:46:23,451 --> 00:46:25,401
as long as it comes under an open sky.

630
00:46:25,487 --> 00:46:28,238
Myself as well.

631
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:31,457
This doesn't have to
end after today, ye ken.

632
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:34,244
We could branch out,

633
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:37,380
raid the royal tax
wagons, English landowners.

634
00:46:37,415 --> 00:46:39,215
We could go places...

635
00:46:39,251 --> 00:46:42,085
Prussia, Flanders, Saxony.

636
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,720
- Aye.
- Make a name for ourselves.

637
00:46:43,755 --> 00:46:47,090
They'd write songs about us.

638
00:46:47,175 --> 00:46:48,695
You paint a bonny picture, MacQuarrie.

639
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,011
If it wasn't for Claire,

640
00:46:52,097 --> 00:46:53,730
maybe Iâd take you up on it.

641
00:46:53,765 --> 00:46:55,565
Ah, we'll talk again
later, when your blood's up

642
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,267
and ye got gold in your pocket.

643
00:46:57,352 --> 00:47:00,520
- Or what?
- You'll turn me over?

644
00:47:00,605 --> 00:47:02,572
To the British?

645
00:47:04,743 --> 00:47:07,026
Never.

646
00:47:07,112 --> 00:47:09,696
I've seen the inside of a jail myself...

647
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:11,581
The tollbooth.

648
00:47:11,616 --> 00:47:14,450
I wouldn't wish it on a dog.

649
00:47:14,536 --> 00:47:16,703
I'd shoot you first.

650
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:24,594
Bridge, just up ahead.

651
00:47:43,281 --> 00:47:45,982
- Come on.
- Tell me you'll look after Ian.

652
00:47:46,067 --> 00:47:47,450
There'll be no need to look after anybody.

653
00:47:47,485 --> 00:47:49,402
Ah, just do as I say, Claire.

654
00:47:49,487 --> 00:47:52,288
Listen, you will get through this.

655
00:47:55,377 --> 00:47:58,077
- Ah, damn you, Claire.
- That's right, damn me.

656
00:47:58,163 --> 00:47:59,996
I can't do this.

657
00:48:00,081 --> 00:48:02,665
- I can't do this.
- Yes... yes, you can.

658
00:48:02,751 --> 00:48:05,134
You've done it before, and
you're going to do it again.

659
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,637
- Oh, get behind me.
- Get behind me.

660
00:48:07,672 --> 00:48:09,339
Oh, Christ almighty.

661
00:48:09,391 --> 00:48:12,141
Oh, bloody hell.

662
00:48:15,313 --> 00:48:17,680
- All right, he's coming.
- He's coming.

663
00:48:24,522 --> 00:48:26,272
All right, here we go.

664
00:48:44,209 --> 00:48:46,009
- Hold up.
- Hold it right there.

665
00:48:46,044 --> 00:48:48,211
Aye.

666
00:48:51,383 --> 00:48:53,216
When are the Chisholms due to pass?

667
00:48:53,268 --> 00:48:55,051
Just shy of sundown.

668
00:48:55,136 --> 00:48:57,387
Horrocks said they're going
to be coming from the east.

669
00:48:57,472 --> 00:48:58,721
I'll go up there and stop them,

670
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:00,223
just as they're crossing the bridge.

671
00:49:00,275 --> 00:49:02,275
Aye.

672
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,310
You say what you like about Horrocks.

673
00:49:04,396 --> 00:49:08,064
Scunner knew how to pick the
perfect spot for an ambush.

674
00:49:08,149 --> 00:49:11,117
- Let's get in yer positions.
- Horrocks was right.

675
00:49:11,202 --> 00:49:14,988
With the high walls and the dense cover...

676
00:49:33,308 --> 00:49:34,724
There's no way out.

677
00:49:36,094 --> 00:49:38,011
Jamie!

678
00:49:38,096 --> 00:49:39,679
Fire!

679
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:43,266
Back!

680
00:49:51,242 --> 00:49:53,176
Fire!

681
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:11,010
Oh.

682
00:50:11,096 --> 00:50:14,047
Congratulations. Mm.

683
00:50:15,717 --> 00:50:20,636
Your bonny little lass
just landed on her feet.

684
00:50:23,391 --> 00:50:25,975
A lass, ye say?

685
00:50:26,061 --> 00:50:27,977
Crivvens.

686
00:51:18,113 --> 00:51:19,745
Three days,

687
00:51:19,831 --> 00:51:23,282
and still no sign of Jamie or Ian.

688
00:51:23,368 --> 00:51:27,753
Every day I sat on the
steps and stared at the road,

689
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,256
as if I could will them to appear.

690
00:51:37,298 --> 00:51:39,966
She had us well fooled, didn't she?

691
00:51:40,051 --> 00:51:43,553
Little Margaret Ellen Murray.

692
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:45,188
She certainly did.

693
00:51:45,223 --> 00:51:48,441
'Twas my grandmother's name.

694
00:51:48,526 --> 00:51:50,726
Maggie...

695
00:51:50,812 --> 00:51:54,313
It suits her.

696
00:51:54,399 --> 00:51:56,983
Wee Jamie may favor Ian,

697
00:51:57,068 --> 00:51:59,235
but this little one,

698
00:51:59,287 --> 00:52:02,371
mm, she's got the Fraser eyes.

699
00:52:02,407 --> 00:52:04,574
Here, Mrs. Crook will
put her down for a nap.

700
00:52:11,549 --> 00:52:14,000
- Mrs. Crook.
- Yes, mistress?

701
00:52:18,056 --> 00:52:21,307
Shh, shh, shh.

702
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,983
Ye look good with a wee-yin in yer arms.

703
00:52:31,069 --> 00:52:33,186
You'll be holding yer own soon enough.

704
00:52:35,073 --> 00:52:37,073
Don't know that I will.

705
00:52:39,577 --> 00:52:42,195
Listen to me, Claire Fraser.

706
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:47,033
Every day for four years,
I stared at that very road.

707
00:52:47,118 --> 00:52:50,203
He will come home. He always does.

708
00:52:58,129 --> 00:53:00,046
These...

709
00:53:00,131 --> 00:53:03,049
Belonged to my mother.

710
00:53:03,134 --> 00:53:07,136
You're tall and queenly, like she was.

711
00:53:07,222 --> 00:53:10,139
The lady of Lallybroch should have them.

712
00:53:15,813 --> 00:53:19,031
They're gorgeous.

713
00:53:19,117 --> 00:53:21,651
Really, they are.

714
00:53:23,454 --> 00:53:27,123
So very...

715
00:53:27,158 --> 00:53:30,326
Unique.

716
00:53:30,378 --> 00:53:32,495
Someone gave them to her as a wedding gift.

717
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,380
She never would say who.

718
00:53:34,465 --> 00:53:38,167
My father used to tease
her about her admirer,

719
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:42,638
but she just smiled like a cat
that's had cream for its supper.

720
00:54:27,802 --> 00:54:29,969
Ian, you're hurt.

721
00:54:30,054 --> 00:54:31,554
I'm all right.

722
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:34,140
I lost my horse and my leg in the fight.

723
00:54:37,478 --> 00:54:39,478
- Where's Jamie?
- Ah.

724
00:54:39,564 --> 00:54:42,148
We were ambushed.

725
00:54:42,233 --> 00:54:44,817
The Redcoats were waiting.
They knew we were coming.

726
00:54:44,902 --> 00:54:48,954
Horrocks... that dirty bastard
must've cut a deal with them.

727
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,073
I don't understand.

728
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:53,125
Delivering the watch to buy his freedom.

729
00:54:53,211 --> 00:54:56,879
The other lads were killed outright.

730
00:54:56,914 --> 00:54:58,831
I fetched Murray home.

731
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:02,134
'Twas the least I could do.

732
00:55:05,173 --> 00:55:06,972
Where is Jamie?

733
00:55:07,058 --> 00:55:09,058
MacQuarrie was wounded.

734
00:55:09,093 --> 00:55:11,093
Jamie wouldn't leave him behind.

735
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:13,979
- Was Jamie hurt?
- Not that I saw.

736
00:55:16,768 --> 00:55:18,067
But they took him.

737
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:23,272
The Redcoats have him.

738
00:55:43,268 --> 00:55:45,868

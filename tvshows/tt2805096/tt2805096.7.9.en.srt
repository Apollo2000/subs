1
00:00:00,187 --> 00:00:02,265
Here we go.
Nice easy swing, okay?

2
00:00:02,421 --> 00:00:03,927
Keep your eye on it
the whole time.

3
00:00:04,015 --> 00:00:05,289
- Ready?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:06,763 --> 00:00:09,453
It's okay.
Don't get down on yourself.

5
00:00:10,398 --> 00:00:11,769
All right, you just got
to be patient, okay?

6
00:00:11,856 --> 00:00:13,195
Be patient.

7
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:16,512
Oh, so close, dude.

8
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,038
It's okay.
You just swing a little hard.

9
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,558
You ready?

10
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,386
Boom!
There you go!

11
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:22,822
- Yeah.
- Great grip.

12
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:24,763
- Score!
- Yeah, come on!

13
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:25,872
There you go.

14
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,175
- You killed it today, dude.
- Thanks.

15
00:00:27,262 --> 00:00:29,264
Yeah, man.
How are things at home?

16
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:30,984
- They're okay.
- All right, good.

17
00:00:31,342 --> 00:00:33,770
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, Angela.

18
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:35,102
- Hi!
- You know, you got yourself

19
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:36,183
a big leaguer here.

20
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:38,751
- Just like I told you, Jim.
- Yeah.

21
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:40,362
- You had fun?
- Yeah, I did.

22
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:41,798
Yeah, he was
crushing it today.

23
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:43,380
Why don't you go put
your things in the car?

24
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:45,078
Okay.

25
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:48,058
- Thanks.
- Yeah, any time.

26
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:49,856
Hey, listen, uh,
for groceries, okay?

27
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,125
Oh, no.
Put that away.

28
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,989
- What?
- I got it.

29
00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:55,614
That job come through?

30
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:57,450
Something like that.

31
00:00:58,926 --> 00:00:59,955
All right, good.

32
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:01,165
All right,
see you tomorrow, buddy.

33
00:01:03,036 --> 00:01:05,248
Bobby's spending the week
in Detroit with his cousins.

34
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:06,424
Oh, no.

35
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:08,003
Don't let them turn you
into a Tigers fan.

36
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,521
- I won't.
- All right, good.

37
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:11,306
All right,
I'll see you soon.

38
00:01:11,393 --> 00:01:12,489
- Be good, okay?
- Bye.

39
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,637
- See you guys.
- Bye.

40
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:31,487
You following me?

41
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,458
Well, that's what happens

42
00:01:33,545 --> 00:01:34,808
when you keep lying
to your partner.

43
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,504
- I lied to you?
- Mm-hmm.

44
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:38,518
Last week, you said
she was an unwitting.

45
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,335
So I did my due diligence.

46
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,061
- Oh, you did.
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:43,186
I know who she is.

48
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:44,888
The question is,
does she know who you are?

49
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:46,892
No, she doesn't,
but it's okay.

50
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:48,559
- I know what I'm doing.
- Jay...

51
00:01:48,647 --> 00:01:50,519
Hailey, I really don't think
it's that big of a deal.

52
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:52,390
I'm just helping out
a family that got screwed.

53
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:55,037
If she finds out who you are,
we're all screwed.

54
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:57,841
You've got to walk away
from this one.

55
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:03,217
Okay.

56
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:05,334
Hang on.

57
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:07,272
Voight.

58
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,271
There's a body in Englewood.
He wants us on scene.

59
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:10,608
All right.

60
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,459
- Hey.
- So the fun started in here?

61
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:20,070
- Yeah.
- Where's the DOA?

62
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:21,241
In the back.

63
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:24,067
- Make an ID?
- Jose Santiago, corner boy.

64
00:02:24,155 --> 00:02:25,771
Why did we get invited
to the party?

65
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:27,319
Oh, you'll see.

66
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,862
Whoa.

67
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,519
All right, Crawford wants
all hands on deck.

68
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:39,057
Obviously, whoever did this
was looking for answers.

69
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,701
Jay, help Kevin and Rojas
work the block.

70
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:44,936
You and Hailey hit the streets,
find security video.

71
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:49,936
Adam, find out
who this Jose is.

72
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:51,577
All right,
let's try and figure out

73
00:02:51,664 --> 00:02:53,819
why someone would do this
to a kid like that.

74
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:55,967
All right, it's all yours.

75
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:02,951
Hailey...

76
00:03:03,857 --> 00:03:05,412
I've got to take off
for a few minutes.

77
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:07,038
What do you mean?
We've got work to do.

78
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:09,787
Yeah, it won't take long.
Let's not talk about it here.

79
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,455
Okay, do what you got to do.

80
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:12,842
Okay.

81
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,342
Hey, Sarge,
no luck on the videos.

82
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,959
Huh.
Where's Halstead going?

83
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:21,668
Uh, he's just
got to take care

84
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:22,928
of something
that's personal.

85
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:24,235
Something you wanna tell me?

86
00:03:26,432 --> 00:03:28,537
Jay's going through
a few things.

87
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:30,552
Um, he's working it out.

88
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:33,280
Something you don't
wanna tell me?

89
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:38,530
Yeah, but
it's not my place, so...

90
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:40,745
Hailey, I respect what
you're trying to do here,

91
00:03:40,832 --> 00:03:42,450
but if there's something
I need to know...

92
00:03:42,537 --> 00:03:43,804
There isn't.

93
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:45,328
Not yet anyway.

94
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:48,273
Okay, I take you
at your word.

95
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:17,772
Hello?

96
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,725
You here?

97
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,331
You okay?

98
00:04:31,987 --> 00:04:33,717

100
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,542
Oh, man,
I'm not communicating well.

101
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:40,195
I just... I want you to know that

102
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:42,067
I know that you're working
through a lot,

103
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:44,635
and I want you to know that,
you know,

104
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:46,426
whatever you decide,
I'm okay with.

105
00:04:46,514 --> 00:04:47,621
If you wanna talk about it,

106
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:48,747
if you don't wanna
talk about it.

107
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:49,975
Hey, just...

108
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:53,256
I'm here for you.

109
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,027
Okay.

110
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:58,428
Thank you,
I do appreciate it.

111
00:04:58,655 --> 00:05:00,139
It's just... you know.

112
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:01,837
Yeah.
Sorry, I was...

113
00:05:02,028 --> 00:05:03,405
No, it's good.

114
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,988
Just...

115
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:07,600
Yeah.

116
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:09,818
Jay, third message.

117
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:11,400
I was annoyed
after the first two.

118
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:13,623
Now I'm getting worried.
Call me as soon as you can.

119
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,684
Hey, have you guys
heard from Jay?

120
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:17,442
No.

121
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,756
We were supposed
to get beers last night,

122
00:05:18,843 --> 00:05:20,326
but he never texted me back.

123
00:05:20,414 --> 00:05:22,631
Hey, is Halstead
on a UC run?

124
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:24,186
Not that I know about.

125
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:25,824
State's Attorney
is all over me.

126
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:27,312
He's supposed to be
in court right now.

127
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,661
Hailey, you know anything?

128
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:30,109
No, I called him
a few times, but...

129
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,371
I did too.
No answer.

130
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:33,199
So I ran the GPS on his truck.

131
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:35,207
It's parked on a street
in Englewood.

132
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,934
- How long has it been there?
- All night.

133
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,906
I ran the in-service calls
to that block.

134
00:05:38,993 --> 00:05:40,865
There were two calls
of suspicious persons

135
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:42,256
at a house on that street.

136
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:43,561
- Thanks, Trudy.
- Yeah.

137
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,905
Check it out.

138
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:55,912
- Looks clear.
- Check the glove box.

139
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:05,716
He left his badge and gun.

140
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,029
So he went undercover.

141
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:15,882
Adam.

142
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,248
Ready?

143
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:22,732
Chicago PD!

144
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,318
Anyone inside?

145
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,046
Jay, call out!

146
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:27,309
Hold.

147
00:06:27,397 --> 00:06:28,485
Move.

148
00:06:31,314 --> 00:06:33,011
Living room clear.

149
00:06:33,498 --> 00:06:34,982
Got blood!

150
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:44,592
Stairs.

151
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:47,943
Cover me.

152
00:06:48,904 --> 00:06:50,384
Clear.

153
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:54,011
- Adam, opening up.
- Copy that.

154
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:03,490
More blood.

155
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:07,586
Jesus.

156
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:10,951
What?

157
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:15,598
You recognize them?

158
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,485
There's a shell casing.

159
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:24,629
The whole house
is torn apart.

160
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:26,187
They came here looking
for something or someone.

161
00:07:26,274 --> 00:07:27,780
Jay must've got caught
in the middle of it.

162
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:29,975
Found a .38 shell casing
on the kitchen floor.

163
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:31,238
Do we have a name?

164
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,149
Angela Nelson.
She lives here with her son.

165
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:34,639
She's got one prior
for possession.

166
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:36,642
She on Jay's books as a CI?

167
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:38,404
- No.
- Hey.

168
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:40,536
A neighbor over there
saw two Latino men

169
00:07:40,624 --> 00:07:42,103
casing the house last night.

170
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:44,629
Later on, he thought he heard
gunshots, but wasn't sure.

171
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:46,283
All right, Jay is missing.

172
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:49,113
- I want every agency on alert.
- Sarge, we can't do that.

173
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:51,490
What the hell
are you talking about?

174
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:56,522
The woman who lives
in that house, Angela Nelson,

175
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,490
she was married to Marcus West.

176
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:02,271
Marcus West, the addict
who got killed at County?

177
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,139
Yeah.

178
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:07,678
I think Jay still blames
himself for that.

179
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:10,881
He's been seeing her.
Not romantically.

180
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:13,017
He's been spending time
with her and her son Bobby

181
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:14,240
trying to help them out.

182
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:16,521
So Jay went to see
Angela yesterday.

183
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:20,394
- You know why he came here?
- No.

184
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:22,287
He's been playing everything
real close to the vest,

185
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:23,795
hasn't said a word.

186
00:08:23,984 --> 00:08:25,741
But she did send him
a text message yesterday

187
00:08:25,828 --> 00:08:28,004
before he took off saying,
"Jim, I need your help.

188
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:29,199
Please come over."

189
00:08:29,294 --> 00:08:30,556
All right,
I'll talk to the others.

190
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,863
Let 'em know what's going on.
I mean, you're right.

191
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:34,725
We've got to keep
this in-house, off book.

192
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,919
This whole thing kicked off

193
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:40,532
with the murder of those
two boys a few months back.

194
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,784
Jay liked Marcus West
for the crimes.

195
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:45,959
So he got a little aggressive,
booked him into County.

196
00:08:46,155 --> 00:08:48,113
You know, make him nervous,
leverage a confession.

197
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,725
It's not Jay's fault that
the facial rec was inaccurate.

198
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:53,187
I mean, the evidence pointed to
Marcus killing those two kids.

199
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:54,798
Yeah, well, except he didn't,

200
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:56,771
and Marcus wound up dead.

201
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,670
Jay had a hard time
swallowing it, so...

202
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:02,764
you know,
he tried to make it right,

203
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:04,568
help out the family.

204
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:07,615
But this isn't about that

205
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:10,506
or about what happened
to Marcus in County.

206
00:09:10,594 --> 00:09:12,683
It's about finding Jay.

207
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,979
For now, this stays in-house,
off book.

208
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:19,373
But I wanna know everything
there is to know

209
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:20,985
about Angela Nelson.

210
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:24,209
We find her, we find Jay.

211
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:31,573
I'm gonna ask you again.

212
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,793
Where's the heroin you and
your girl stole from me, Jim?

213
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,381
I told you, man.
I got no idea.

214
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:36,491
I got no idea.

215
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:38,189
If I were you,
I'd come up with it.

216
00:09:38,354 --> 00:09:39,600
Stop it!

217
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:41,777
Please!
Maybe she's right, man.

218
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:43,976
Shut up!

219
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,521
Angela...

220
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:52,699
Do you wanna die down here?
No.

221
00:09:52,943 --> 00:09:55,119
Then tell me where
you got our stuff, huh?

222
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:56,860
Carlos has it, right?
Where is he hiding it?

223
00:09:56,947 --> 00:09:58,862
Please!
I swear!

224
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:00,385
You're not gonna tell me
where he's hiding?

225
00:10:00,472 --> 00:10:01,778
I don't know.
I don't know where it is.

226
00:10:01,865 --> 00:10:02,953
We didn't steal nothing.

227
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,650
Stop, man.
She doesn't know!

228
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:05,705
She doesn't know!

229
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:09,306
I swear, I'm gonna kick your
ass when I get out of here.

230
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:10,385
Tough girl?

231
00:10:10,473 --> 00:10:12,824
Huh?
I like that.

232
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:14,529
Tougher the better.

233
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:23,362
Ven conmigo.

234
00:10:32,237 --> 00:10:33,674
Angela...

235
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:35,425
I need to know what the hell
is going on.

236
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:37,079
Did you steal their drugs?

237
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:39,424
Did you steal
their drugs?

238
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,588
Yeah...

239
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:51,736
My friend Carlos told me

240
00:10:51,824 --> 00:10:53,908
he'd give me ten grand
to drive.

241
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:58,877
So I did it.

242
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:01,877
Drove him to that house
over on Sutton,

243
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:03,869
but he never showed up
to pay me.

244
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:06,533
I tried calling him,
but he wasn't picking up.

245
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:09,822
So I didn't know if he
was ripping me off

246
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:11,945
or something happened to him.

247
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:14,871
So you texted me.

248
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,299
Yeah.

249
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:18,603
I was getting nervous.

250
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:21,885
Whose drugs did you steal?

251
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,802
I don't know.
I just drove.

252
00:11:28,038 --> 00:11:29,658
I needed the money.

253
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:33,127
Since Marcus passed,
things have gotten bad.

254
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:36,229
I'm late on the rent.

255
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:38,705
Bobby's sickle-cell
is getting worse.

256
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,217
So I just agreed
I'd help Carlos.

257
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:46,664
He said it would be the easiest
ten grand I ever saw.

258
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,321
I'm sorry, Jim.

259
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:57,622
I didn't mean to drag you
into all of this.

260
00:11:58,346 --> 00:12:00,418
It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.

261
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:03,135
I'm gonna get us out of here.

262
00:12:04,363 --> 00:12:05,853
Okay?

263
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,359
So we got details back
on Angela's movements

264
00:12:12,447 --> 00:12:14,015
two days ago.
Pings on her phone put her

265
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:15,307
at Sutton Street and 150th

266
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:16,150
at 6:00 p.m.

267
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:18,539
Which is the same time that
we got a shots fired call

268
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:19,624
over the 8th District zone.

269
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:21,992
So I went down there,
found a doorbell cam

270
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,125
that's across the street
from a stash house.

271
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:26,455
That's Angela's car, and that's
her behind the wheel.

272
00:12:26,673 --> 00:12:30,088
And that guy looks like he's
carrying a bag full of bricks.

273
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:31,961
Patrol found a dead John Doe

274
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,640
and an empty drug trap
on the floor.

275
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:35,672
The John Doe is a Latino
in his '20s,

276
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,211
GSW to the head.
No ID found on him.

277
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,049
Area South is doing the case.

278
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:42,219
Which means they may know
what we know

279
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:43,493
and are already out
in front of this.

280
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,888
Which is obviously not good.

281
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:46,672
We got anything
on the stick-up man?

282
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,437
Yeah,
facial rec picked him up.

283
00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:50,252
His name is Carlos Diaz.

284
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,836
He's got three priors
for possession

285
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:53,461
and an armed robbery kicker.

286
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:56,148
And get this,
his last known is the apartment

287
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:57,805
where Jose Santiago
was tortured.

288
00:12:57,893 --> 00:12:59,373
He and Carlos
are roommates.

289
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,705
So...

290
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:03,463
Whoever's drugs got ripped
went looking for Carlos,

291
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:04,978
found Jose instead.

292
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:07,281
All right, what else do
we know about this Carlos?

293
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,931
Well, we know
he can't be too smart.

294
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:10,376
I've been pinging his phone
all day.

295
00:13:10,463 --> 00:13:11,642
Dummy never shut it off.

296
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,949
Right now, he's hiding out
in a flophouse in Gage Park.

297
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:15,171
All right,
let's scoop him up.

298
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:17,330
Nice and quiet.
You two.

299
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:25,726
- Ready?
- Yep.

300
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,029
Carlos Diaz,
Chicago PD!

301
00:13:47,116 --> 00:13:48,465
Put your hands
where we can see them!

302
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:10,263
He's cold.

303
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:12,045
Been here for a while.

304
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:13,978
Let's call it in.

305
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:20,174
All right,
tell me what happened.

306
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,242
Carlos Diaz, overdose.

307
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,343
M.E. says he's been dead
for at least half a day.

308
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,080
Ah, bingo.
Got it.

309
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:28,297
That's the bag we saw get
tossed into Angela's car.

310
00:14:28,462 --> 00:14:30,115
All right,
so Carlos stole the drugs,

311
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,552
started using,
wound up dead?

312
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,570
Probably not used
to this good of quality.

313
00:14:33,658 --> 00:14:35,384
All right, run those bricks
for latent prints

314
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:36,383
and test that gun.

315
00:14:36,471 --> 00:14:37,813
See if the markings
match the bullets

316
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,821
that popped our John Doe
at the stash house.

317
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:42,780
Listen, we keep digging
into Carlos.

318
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:44,726
The fact he's dead
changes nothing.

319
00:14:44,814 --> 00:14:47,192
'Cause whoever Carlos
and Angela ripped off,

320
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,130
that's who has Jay.

321
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:55,536
It ain't working.

322
00:14:57,525 --> 00:14:59,247
How you doing?
How bad is it?

323
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,423
I can handle it.

324
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:07,908
Maybe I should tell them
the truth.

325
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:11,809
About what we did,
about Carlos.

326
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,265
No.

327
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:14,563
The only reason
we're still alive

328
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,295
is because they think
we know where the drugs are.

329
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,419
Okay?

330
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:19,727
Stick to the story,
stay strong.

331
00:15:21,558 --> 00:15:23,650
That's what Marcus
used to say.

332
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:29,523
He gets laid off,
stay strong.

333
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:32,492
When we ain't got no money
for groceries,

334
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,528
stay strong.

335
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,549
Joke is...

336
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,126
Marcus was the one
who was weak.

337
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,167
Couldn't stay off those drugs.

338
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:46,061
Maybe if I was stronger,

339
00:15:46,148 --> 00:15:48,063
we could've gotten
him straight.

340
00:15:48,306 --> 00:15:50,657
Then none of this
would've happened.

341
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:52,321
No, don't do that.

342
00:15:52,546 --> 00:15:55,665
Marcus dying is not on you.
You didn't kill him.

343
00:15:58,688 --> 00:16:00,554
We can't think about Marcus
or the past right now.

344
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:03,513
You've gotta... you've gotta
just stay focused.

345
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:04,876
Okay?

346
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,038
Not if we want to survive.

347
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,751
Okay.

348
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:16,414
Techs just found
a second set of prints

349
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:17,808
on the bricks of heroin.

350
00:16:18,006 --> 00:16:19,399
Pedro Silva.

351
00:16:19,486 --> 00:16:21,401
Been popped
three times for distro

352
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:23,098
along with
a couple weapon charges.

353
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:24,795
All right,
what flag does he fly?

354
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:26,841
He's more of a lone wolf,
works with family.

355
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:28,789
His wife was killed
five years ago in a drive-by,

356
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:30,845
left Silva raising
his three sons on his own.

357
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:32,237
Two of them work
for the old man.

358
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,892
This is Hector Silva.

359
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,327
Did four years in Stateville,
drug distribution.

360
00:16:36,415 --> 00:16:38,461
He spent most of his time in
the hole.

361
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:40,063
Got in a few jams.

362
00:16:40,157 --> 00:16:42,509
I mean, he almost beat a guy
to death with a barbell.

363
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:43,969
This is the middle brother,
Luis.

364
00:16:44,057 --> 00:16:46,235
Pinched twice for possession,
no history of violence.

365
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:48,061
- And the other one?
- That's Emilio.

366
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:49,812
Still in high school,
honor student, no priors.

367
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:52,069
The two older brothers match
the eyewitness description

368
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:52,997
that the neighbor gave us.

369
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:55,086
All right, we got
an address on Pedro Silva?

370
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:56,348
Uh, yeah.

371
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,003
Uh, LKA is a house
on Hegewisch.

372
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,091
All right, Kev,
you and Rojas,

373
00:17:00,178 --> 00:17:01,658
get a bead on those
two brothers.

374
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:02,917
The rest of you,
with me.

375
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:04,456
- Mm-hmm.
- Good to go.

376
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:05,855
Yeah.

377
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:13,150
All right, let me know
when you're in position.

378
00:17:13,237 --> 00:17:14,628
Copy.

379
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,767
<i>Chicago PD,
get your hands up!</i>

380
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:25,001
You Emilio?

381
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,243
Yes, ma'am.
What's going on?

382
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:27,251
Emilio, anybody inside?

383
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,540
- No.
- You sure?

384
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:29,643
- I swear.
- Come downstairs.

385
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,166
Keep your hands up.

386
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:33,081
Where's your dad, Emilio?
We're looking for him.

387
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:34,561
I don't know.
I just got home from school.

388
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:36,258
What about your brothers?
Where are they?

389
00:17:36,345 --> 00:17:38,303
Working, I guess.
I don't see them much.

390
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,871
Okay, take a deep breath.
It's okay.

391
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:43,765
- I don't think he's involved.
- Yeah, well, let's find out.

392
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:45,789
You two go inside with him,
clear the house,

393
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:47,194
then bring him in.

394
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:48,225
We'll dump his phone,

395
00:17:48,313 --> 00:17:50,123
see if he's been in contact
with the old man.

396
00:17:50,211 --> 00:17:51,908
Get up.
Come on.

397
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:56,713
It's okay.

398
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,168
Listen, I talked to Kev.

399
00:17:58,256 --> 00:17:59,627
Anything on the two
older brothers?

400
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:00,877
Yeah, they're in the wind.

401
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:02,269
I checked their place
in Little Village,

402
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:03,354
a girlfriend's place
in Pilsen.

403
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:04,155
Looks like they went dark

404
00:18:04,242 --> 00:18:05,417
as soon as those drugs
went missing.

405
00:18:05,504 --> 00:18:06,767
That means they're involved.

406
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:08,159
Tell them to keep looking.

407
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:10,206
Well, it might be easier
to talk to Darius Walker.

408
00:18:10,469 --> 00:18:12,167
Turns out the old man,
Pedro, he got popped

409
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:13,599
for a weapons charge
a year ago.

410
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:15,602
Darius was the one
who bailed him out.

411
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:18,954
I'll meet you back
at the District.

412
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,738
Copy that, Boss.

413
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:27,906
Why are you interested
in Pedro Silva?

414
00:18:27,993 --> 00:18:29,299
You know where to find him?

415
00:18:29,386 --> 00:18:31,693
- I got his number.
- You in business with him?

416
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,651
Not the type you think.

417
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,174
Uh, Pedro's got his hooks

418
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:38,830
into some property I'm after
in Little Village.

419
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,379
Look, all I need is an intro.
That's it.

420
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:43,830
He keeps a low profile.

421
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:45,663
You tell him he better raise
his profile

422
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,410
if he wants to get
his drugs back.

423
00:18:48,884 --> 00:18:53,528
Look, I got long-term plans
with this man.

424
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:56,194
It took time to build
something real.

425
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:58,837
I can't risk that.
Darius...

426
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,473
I need this now.

427
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:05,770
Call him.

428
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:12,322
Why do I get the feeling

429
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,866
that you're not telling me
everything about this?

430
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:16,988
Because I'm not.

431
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:19,090
I figured.

432
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,487
So where were you locked up?

433
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,925
You don't got
to test me, bro,

434
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:31,723
I'm obviously good at this.

435
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,842
Pedro's solid, so...

436
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:36,758
Let's not talk about
how solid he is.

437
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:38,692
He got one of mine.

438
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:46,354
I should've said something

439
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:48,639
the second I knew Jay was
hanging out with Angela.

440
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,588
He was trying to help
a mom and her kid

441
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:52,611
down on their luck.

442
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:54,571
There's nothing wrong
with that.

443
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:58,518
The only problem is being
decent and being a good cop.

444
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,275
It's not always
a perfect marriage.

445
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:03,957
Yeah.

446
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,179
Sometimes you've got to swallow
all your pain and guilt,

447
00:20:07,495 --> 00:20:09,268
move on.

448
00:20:20,946 --> 00:20:22,208
Silva just arrived.

449
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,392
He's outside
of the parking lot,

450
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:24,959
black Lexus.

451
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:27,417
Unknown driver
in the vehicle.

452
00:20:27,504 --> 00:20:28,733
Copy.

453
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:30,657
Should we put a tracker on it?

454
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:32,577
Not with Silva sitting
in the car.

455
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,859
Sarge, if this goes south,
that's our only hope.

456
00:20:34,946 --> 00:20:37,092
Hailey,
I said it's too dangerous.

457
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,450
Here's your boy.

458
00:20:51,013 --> 00:20:53,114
Pedro, thanks for coming.

459
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:54,872
Yeah.

460
00:20:56,878 --> 00:20:58,528
Keyshawn.

461
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:02,321
Pedro, I appreciate you.
Let's get right to it.

462
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:04,976
My boy Jimmy and Angela
violated.

463
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:07,018
He got involved with some stuff

464
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:09,372
he had no business
getting involved in.

465
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,069
I just wanna
make peace with you.

466
00:21:11,156 --> 00:21:12,941
It's going to take
a lot to make peace.

467
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:15,262
My cousin got killed
in that house.

468
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:18,294
I hate to hear that,
and I'm sorry.

469
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,559
That's exactly why I'm here
to make it right.

470
00:21:20,707 --> 00:21:22,037
How are you gonna do that,
Keyshawn?

471
00:21:22,124 --> 00:21:23,342
First thing I'm gonna do

472
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:25,029
is give you back everything
that's yours.

473
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:29,566
Jim and Angela had no idea
what they were doing,

474
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:31,133
who they were doing it to.

475
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,554
They got played by a punk-ass
wannabe gangster, Carlos.

476
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:35,022
Yeah, I know.

477
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:36,486
I'm looking for him.

478
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:37,865
I know.

479
00:21:38,154 --> 00:21:39,998
I already took care
of him for you.

480
00:21:41,028 --> 00:21:42,459
He in the ground.

481
00:21:42,753 --> 00:21:44,407
How do you know that?

482
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,539
'Cause that's
where I put him.

483
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:53,457
That looks like your product,
right?

484
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:56,983
Not a gram is missing.

485
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,856
Allow me to give it back
to you.

486
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,337
I'll throw in an extra 50k.

487
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:03,568
That's out of respect
for your loss.

488
00:22:03,662 --> 00:22:05,863
All I need you to do is hand
over Jim and Angela.

489
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:07,342
I'll think about it.

490
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,320
Hey, come on now.
You can't just leave like that.

491
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:11,695
Excuse me?

492
00:22:11,992 --> 00:22:13,697
I need you to tell me
that my people are good.

493
00:22:13,784 --> 00:22:15,342
You don't tell me what to do.

494
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,030
If you don't give me proof
that they're good,

495
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:18,006
then there's no deal.

496
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:19,529
Okay, let's take it down.

497
00:22:19,616 --> 00:22:20,766
Let's take it down.

498
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:22,681
Pedro...

499
00:22:23,223 --> 00:22:24,529
listen, the man's got a point.

500
00:22:24,617 --> 00:22:27,031
He just wants to make sure
his people are good.

501
00:22:39,216 --> 00:22:40,938
Put him on the phone.

502
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:49,747
Talk.

503
00:22:51,032 --> 00:22:52,338
You got Jim.

504
00:22:55,246 --> 00:22:56,560
Jim, what the hell
did I tell you

505
00:22:56,648 --> 00:22:58,481
about grabbing
what's not yours?

506
00:22:59,297 --> 00:23:00,560
I messed up, man.

507
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:01,919
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Damn right you did.</i>

508
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,560
But we're gonna
get the drugs back,

509
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,164
then we're gonna get you back.

510
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:07,539
- You hang tight.
- Okay, good?

511
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:11,592
Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.

512
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,627
Let's meet at 4:00 p.m.
I'll text you a place.

513
00:23:23,786 --> 00:23:25,451
That looks like
it's getting worse.

514
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:27,827
It is.
She needs a hospital.

515
00:23:27,915 --> 00:23:29,603
You want a doctor?
Is that what you want, sweetheart?

516
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,314
How about I give you a kiss?
That'll make you feel better.

517
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:33,751
Just leave her alone.

518
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:40,882
Shut up, bitch!

519
00:23:47,097 --> 00:23:48,234
Yeah?

520
00:23:48,978 --> 00:23:50,328
Hold on.
I can't talk.

521
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:54,656
I'm gonna be back,
tough girl.

522
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:56,578
It's gonna be fun too.

523
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:04,201
What was that call about?

524
00:24:05,636 --> 00:24:07,464
My friend has their drugs.

525
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:09,056
He's gonna bring them up
to them

526
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:11,008
and they're gonna let us go.

527
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,853
Okay, what?

528
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:15,433
How did your people know
where to find the dope

529
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:17,663
- or Carlos?
- Don't worry about it.

530
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:19,243
The point is just to get
the hell out of here, okay?

531
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,984
Focus on that.
Nothing else, okay?

532
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:23,484
We're getting out of here.

533
00:24:37,391 --> 00:24:39,359
It's 4:12.
Silva's late.

534
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:40,846
Just stay patient,

535
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:42,674
and keep your head on
a swivel.

536
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:49,205
Sarge, what's this?

537
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:58,548
Just a small construction crew.

538
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,094
Let it play.

539
00:25:00,518 --> 00:25:02,641
10-4.
Maintaining a solid eye on Kev.

540
00:25:09,048 --> 00:25:10,461
Over there.

541
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:15,141
Silva is the passenger.

542
00:25:15,328 --> 00:25:16,591
All right, heads up.

543
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,004
Got a cargo van
heading your way.

544
00:25:43,452 --> 00:25:44,975
About damn time.

545
00:25:48,216 --> 00:25:50,307
Where the hell is
Jim and Angela?

546
00:25:50,394 --> 00:25:52,263
They're in the van,
they're nice and comfy,

547
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:54,392
and they're gonna stay there
until I see my product.

548
00:25:54,528 --> 00:25:56,095
Let me take a look at
how comfortable they are

549
00:25:56,182 --> 00:25:57,575
to make sure that
you're all good.

550
00:25:57,662 --> 00:26:00,665
You will see them
after I see my product.

551
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:12,837
You stay right there,
home boy.

552
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:21,310
This is it.

553
00:26:21,576 --> 00:26:22,795
It's all there.

554
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:27,279
It's all you, man.

555
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:29,513
Okay?

556
00:26:30,294 --> 00:26:31,783
Now it's your turn.

557
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:34,794
We're good.

558
00:26:35,134 --> 00:26:36,490
Gun!

559
00:26:42,497 --> 00:26:43,700
Silva, freeze!

560
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:45,667
Got one offender down.
Silva's fleeing on foot.

561
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:47,669
He's headed right for you,
Sarge.

562
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:04,552
Step out!

563
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,557
Step out before
I light your ass up!

564
00:27:06,644 --> 00:27:08,116
Turn around.

565
00:27:08,298 --> 00:27:10,343
No, no, no, no, no, no.

566
00:27:10,514 --> 00:27:12,040
Jay and Angela
are not in the car.

567
00:27:12,128 --> 00:27:14,046
Repeat, we do not have Jay.

568
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,351
Where is he?
Get your hands up.

569
00:27:16,554 --> 00:27:18,264
Hands up!
Where is he?

570
00:27:18,351 --> 00:27:19,396
Go to hell!

571
00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:21,354
He's a cop.
He's one of us.

572
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:23,530
Anything happens to him,
that's capital murder.

573
00:27:23,617 --> 00:27:25,531
Now where is he?

574
00:27:26,132 --> 00:27:27,500
Sarge.

575
00:27:30,407 --> 00:27:31,985
Hailey, not here.

576
00:27:37,513 --> 00:27:39,202
You better pray to God
he's still alive.

577
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,890
Put your hands
behind your back.

578
00:27:45,307 --> 00:27:48,398
Come on, this deal
was supposed to happen by now.

579
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:49,992
I know.
We just gotta be patient, okay?

580
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,663
Just gotta be patient.

581
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:53,687
I draw the young one close.

582
00:27:53,822 --> 00:27:55,780
Kick him, bite him,

583
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:58,696
maybe his knife falls out,
you grab it.

584
00:27:58,783 --> 00:28:00,710
No, that's a bad idea.

585
00:28:02,218 --> 00:28:04,515
I don't wanna die
in this basement.

586
00:28:05,747 --> 00:28:08,179
I'm not gonna let
that happen, okay?

587
00:28:09,343 --> 00:28:11,648
Maybe I deserved this.

588
00:28:12,884 --> 00:28:14,538
What are you saying?

589
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,288
I knew Marcus
was having problems,

590
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:21,327
but I just kept hoping
and praying that he'd change.

591
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,329
But he just got worse,

592
00:28:23,562 --> 00:28:25,288
killed two little boys.

593
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:33,252
I've had nightmares
about those boys,

594
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:34,950
their mothers.

595
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:43,304
I don't care if I live, Jim.

596
00:28:43,654 --> 00:28:46,962
Live, die.
What difference does it make?

597
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:48,882
Hey.

598
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:52,656
You've got a son.
He needs you.

599
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,210
Does he?

600
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:59,140
Everybody knows that his daddy
killed those two little boys.

601
00:29:00,475 --> 00:29:02,343
His mom is a mess.

602
00:29:03,978 --> 00:29:06,661
Maybe he's better off
living down in North Carolina

603
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:08,390
with his uncle.

604
00:29:16,818 --> 00:29:19,646
Angela, Marcus didn't kill
those two kids.

605
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:22,398
What?

606
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,640
What are you saying?

607
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:29,960
I'm a cop.

608
00:29:32,703 --> 00:29:34,792
The hell are you
talking about?

609
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:37,523
I'm a cop.
That's how I met Marcus.

610
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,562
I arrested him.

611
00:29:50,773 --> 00:29:51,924
Uh, you done?

612
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,534
Are you talking?

613
00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:55,161
- Only to my lawyer.
- Yeah?

614
00:29:55,249 --> 00:29:56,429
He's on standby.

615
00:29:56,517 --> 00:29:59,054
He's gonna be making calls,
gonna want to see his client.

616
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,757
Well, maybe his client
resisted arrest.

617
00:30:02,673 --> 00:30:04,374
Maybe his client reached
for my gun,

618
00:30:04,462 --> 00:30:06,551
so I had to shoot him
in the face.

619
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,181
You are gonna tell me
what I need to know

620
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:17,640
or you're gonna die.
Do you understand?

621
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:19,382
Kiss my brown ass.

622
00:30:19,908 --> 00:30:21,851
Sarge, take a break.

623
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:35,124
We need leverage, right?

624
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,076
Let's use the one thing
this guy cares about.

625
00:30:37,163 --> 00:30:39,304
- Which is?
- The youngest son.

626
00:30:40,324 --> 00:30:42,022
- The honor student?
- Yeah.

627
00:30:42,453 --> 00:30:43,945
He's the only thing we got.

628
00:30:44,891 --> 00:30:46,197
Do what you got to do.

629
00:30:49,604 --> 00:30:51,929
I'm the person
who put him in lockup.

630
00:30:54,534 --> 00:30:56,101
But we were wrong.

631
00:30:56,306 --> 00:30:58,499
He didn't kill those boys;
somebody else did.

632
00:31:10,008 --> 00:31:14,085
I knew in my heart that
Marcus didn't kill those kids.

633
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,632
Why did you do that to him?

634
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,210
All the evidence...

635
00:31:24,772 --> 00:31:26,781
said Marcus killed
two little kids,

636
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:29,039
so I just treated him like...

637
00:31:30,995 --> 00:31:33,507
I treated him like someone
who killed two innocent boys.

638
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,337
When I met you
at Marcus' grave,

639
00:31:41,425 --> 00:31:42,890
I thought...

640
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,609
here's a decent man.

641
00:31:48,045 --> 00:31:51,859
And all this time,
you were lying to me and Bobby.

642
00:31:52,566 --> 00:31:54,702
Lying right to our faces.

643
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:56,656
Yeah.

644
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,421
I just wanted to help you.
I'm sorry.

645
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:04,898
You've got no right
to say that you're sorry.

646
00:32:05,443 --> 00:32:08,554
You've got no right
to help me or Bobby.

647
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:11,979
I don't need your pity
or your money.

648
00:32:13,689 --> 00:32:16,807
You can't just hand out
a few hundred dollars

649
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:18,796
and pretend that
this didn't happen.

650
00:32:18,884 --> 00:32:21,104
That you're cleansed
of your sins.

651
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:31,038
Wonder what our boys here
would think

652
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:33,124
if they knew you were a cop?

653
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:35,855
- Angela...
- Yeah.

654
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:38,968
If I tell them
who you really are,

655
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:40,584
I bet they'll let me go.

656
00:32:40,672 --> 00:32:42,656
No, they will kill us both.

657
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:44,535
They will kill you.

658
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:47,816
Angela, be smart.

659
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:49,384
Be smart.

660
00:32:51,892 --> 00:32:53,804
You deserve to die.

661
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:56,140
You don't.

662
00:32:56,827 --> 00:32:58,762
So keep your mouth shut,
for you.

663
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,460
For Bobby.

664
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:04,072
My Bobby.

665
00:33:09,502 --> 00:33:11,504
You must be thirsty.

666
00:33:13,721 --> 00:33:15,114
She needs more than water.

667
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,145
Look at how much blood
she lost.

668
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:17,155
You've got to get her
to a hospital.

669
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:19,158
No one's going anywhere.

670
00:33:19,507 --> 00:33:21,390
I thought the deal
was going down.

671
00:33:21,604 --> 00:33:23,867
Well, it didn't go down
the way we hoped.

672
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,870
What does that mean?

673
00:33:28,984 --> 00:33:30,827
You should know something.

674
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:32,536
Angela.

675
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:46,569
My son is really sick,

676
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,780
and he needs help
with his medication.

677
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:50,471
He's just 12.

678
00:33:50,597 --> 00:33:53,202
I have to be there, please.

679
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,819
It ain't up to me, lady.

680
00:33:56,746 --> 00:33:59,296
Yo, get up here now!

681
00:34:12,005 --> 00:34:14,772
He was supposed to be here
half an hour ago.

682
00:34:17,234 --> 00:34:18,569
Yeah.

683
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:20,109
Okay.

684
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:40,090
You all right?

685
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,601
Yeah.

686
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:43,858
What's going on?

687
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:47,304
The lockup keepers
are taking a long time

688
00:34:47,393 --> 00:34:49,929
bringing up that Silva kid.
The honor student?

689
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:52,538
Yeah, we're gonna use him as
leverage against the old man.

690
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:54,937
That's a good idea.

691
00:34:57,425 --> 00:34:59,077
I've got to do something.

692
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:07,285
Hey.

693
00:35:09,154 --> 00:35:11,965
We're gonna find him.
You know that, right?

694
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,194
We're gonna find him.

695
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:19,356
Hey,
Emilio Silva just landed.

696
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:23,363
You know this isn't
exactly by the book.

697
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:25,879
- Ah, books are overrated.
- No, listen.

698
00:35:26,512 --> 00:35:28,285
You don't have
to walk through that door.

699
00:35:28,496 --> 00:35:30,942
No, I'm good.

700
00:35:31,983 --> 00:35:33,811
Is this how
you normally roll?

701
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:36,317
This isn't a normal case.
They got my partner.

702
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,729
Hey, Emilio.

703
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:40,260
- Can I go?
- No, you can't go.

704
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:41,450
We found a problem
with your car.

705
00:35:41,537 --> 00:35:43,871
It was reportedly used in
an armed robbery last night.

706
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:45,276
We're pressing charges.

707
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:46,660
A robbery?
But I didn't...

708
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:47,997
If I were you,
I'd keep my mouth shut.

709
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:49,232
Put your hands
behind your back.

710
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:50,801
But I didn't do anything!

711
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:52,402
Yeah,
we haven't heard that before.

712
00:35:52,762 --> 00:35:54,112
Can I call my dad?

713
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,767
He told me if I ever got
in trouble, I should call him.

714
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,899
Yeah.
He a lawyer or something?

715
00:35:59,231 --> 00:36:01,676
No, he owns
a construction company.

716
00:36:03,425 --> 00:36:04,973
Hey.
Hey!

717
00:36:05,384 --> 00:36:06,832
Wake up!

718
00:36:08,058 --> 00:36:10,562
- How's the eye?
- I can see fine.

719
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,608
Yeah?
Good.

720
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:13,067
Take a look at that.

721
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:16,787
Emilio!

722
00:36:16,933 --> 00:36:18,762
- Dad?
- What?

723
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,410
Dad, are you okay?

724
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:21,834
Dad, I didn't do anything!

725
00:36:21,922 --> 00:36:23,801
Emilio, it's okay, mijo.

726
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:26,317
It's okay, mijo!
It's okay!

727
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,482
We found a brick
of your heroin in his car.

728
00:36:29,843 --> 00:36:31,564
Let Emilio go.
He's a good boy.

729
00:36:31,652 --> 00:36:32,498
He's not part of this.

730
00:36:32,585 --> 00:36:34,082
- Is my man alive?
- I don't know.

731
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,863
You don't know?
Is he?

732
00:36:35,951 --> 00:36:37,793
I told them
to wait for my call,

733
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:40,160
to wait until my product
was returned.

734
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:42,902
Give me something.

735
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,685
He's at 3900 West Union.

736
00:36:45,773 --> 00:36:47,622
It's an old
manufacturing plant.

737
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,504
You son of a bitch!

738
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,400
Nice work.

739
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:00,874
Kick one of those pipes
over to me.

740
00:37:01,071 --> 00:37:02,504
Do it.

741
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:04,629
Angela.

742
00:37:05,218 --> 00:37:06,957
Angela.

743
00:37:07,362 --> 00:37:09,152
Angela, kick me
one of those pipes.

744
00:37:09,348 --> 00:37:10,752
Angela, come on.

745
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,451
We've got to work together
if we want to get out of here.

746
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:13,711
You've got to kick one over.
Come on.

747
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,762
Please, it's the only way.
Come on.

748
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:19,979
The front
has surveillance cameras.

749
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:22,215
So, Kim, you and Rojas
hold the perimeter.

750
00:37:22,303 --> 00:37:26,090
Kev, you and Hailey take
the south side of the building.

751
00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:36,771
Damn near like Fort Knox.

752
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:38,582
There's no windows or doors.

753
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:40,809
They got in,
we're getting in.

754
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:43,939
Sarge, no entry point
on the south side.

755
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:46,092
Just keep looking.

756
00:37:50,837 --> 00:37:52,317
Damn.

757
00:37:58,035 --> 00:37:59,572
All right, there you go.

758
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:04,163
Can I have some water?

759
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,637
Please, man.

760
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,926
- Look at that.
- That could be a way in.

761
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,770
Not for me,
but I can help you up.

762
00:38:21,858 --> 00:38:23,551
- Ready?
- Yeah.

763
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:26,590
Okay.

764
00:38:32,531 --> 00:38:33,879
Upton's inside, Sarge.

765
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,292
Alone?

766
00:38:35,403 --> 00:38:37,340
We had to, Sarge.
It's the only way.

767
00:38:48,113 --> 00:38:51,184
All right.
You did good, okay?

768
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:53,590
You did real good.

769
00:38:58,967 --> 00:39:01,137
All right, Hailey,
you got your ears on?

770
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:03,487
Hailey.

771
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:07,840
All right, we got entry
on the west side.

772
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,371
We are moving in.
Do you copy, Hailey?

773
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:13,270
I think she shut down, Sarge.
On my way.

774
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,590
Okay.
All right.

775
00:39:18,946 --> 00:39:20,687
Stay here.
Stay here.

776
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:23,793
Take this.
I'm going after the other one.

777
00:39:23,974 --> 00:39:25,889
Okay?

778
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,286
I still haven't
even heard from him!

779
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:35,855
Listen,
something ain't right.

780
00:39:35,942 --> 00:39:37,770
Stop talking!
Just...

781
00:39:37,857 --> 00:39:39,990
you call me the second
you hear anything.

782
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,166
Exactly, I tried
to call him three times.

783
00:39:42,253 --> 00:39:44,777
He still hasn't hit me back.
I don't care what you gotta do.

784
00:39:44,864 --> 00:39:46,866
You hit the streets.
You understand me?

785
00:39:46,953 --> 00:39:48,389
You hit the First,
you hit the Fifth.

786
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:50,217
I don't care...

787
00:40:04,884 --> 00:40:06,320
Jay!

788
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:07,713
Jay, are you okay?

789
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,933
Jay!

790
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,153
Hey, are you okay?

791
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:21,049
I've got to go help Angela.
She's downstairs.

792
00:40:25,818 --> 00:40:27,577
Stay there.

793
00:40:28,038 --> 00:40:30,083
5021 Henry,
we've got an offender down

794
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,519
and an officer injured.

795
00:40:31,606 --> 00:40:33,640
Roll two ambulances to 3900...

796
00:40:33,843 --> 00:40:36,541
Angela.
Angela, it's okay.

797
00:40:39,527 --> 00:40:40,746
You're safe.

798
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:44,775
It's over.

799
00:40:57,594 --> 00:41:00,570

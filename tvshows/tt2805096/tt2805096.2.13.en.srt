1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,650
Please accept my condolences on the loss of your paramedic.

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,490
Her name was Shay, right?

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,510
Unfortunately, OFI

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,670
has decided not to pursue Adrian Gish at this time.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,820
I need your help.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,960
Sure, sis.

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,960
Whatever you need.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,820
You know, we no longer work together.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,070
Is it too late to get my spot back in intelligence?

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,160
Welcome back.

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,580
Hey. Morning, Sergeant.

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,200
We were going to--

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,420
And a beautiful morning to you too, Officer Burgess.

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,570
How can I help you?

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,240
We wanted to know if you wanted us to check back in

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,940
with the neighborhood watch on Roosevelt?

17
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,250
That's a terrific idea, Burgess.

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,340
Team work to help the dream work.

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,870
Here's the keys to Squad 01664.

20
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,080
You two go out there

21
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,530
and do some good for this city.

22
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,980
Are you feeling all right, Sergeant?

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,350
I feel fantastic.

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,010
You guys! Go on.

25
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,930
Go on.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,680
There she is.

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,490
All right, let the ball-busting commence.

28
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,540
I don't know what you're talking about.

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,120
Yeah, we're just happy to see you, Lindsay.

30
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,200
Listen, we're thinking about putting together

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,040
a task force on how to make coffee.

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,910
Maybe you can help us arrange a press conference for that.

33
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,640
I got you started. Cream, two sugars.

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,750
It's real simple.

35
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,680
I am not gonna make you coffee.

36
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,570
Come on, what about you?

37
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,500
I wasn't going to say anything.

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,630
And then Lang called and he said you left

39
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,110
your pant suit at the headquarters.

40
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,130
Welcome back.

41
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,950
Yeah! Missed you a lot.

42
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,320
You guys have no idea how good it is to be here.

43
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,700
Hey, kiddo, I want you

44
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,420
with Antonio catching up on all the old case files.

45
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,130
I got to step out for a moment, Sarge.

46
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,070
What's up?

47
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,020
I'll let you know as soon as I find out.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

49
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,350
That's the place?

50
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,500
Yeah, that's where Adrian Gish works.

51
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,060
And how sure are you he's the arsonist responsible

52
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,050
for Shay's death?

53
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,540
100%.

54
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,920
We found the fire factory.

55
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,900
We mapped out his fires.

56
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,410
I mean, he basically admitted it to Severide

57
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,480
when he confronted him.

58
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,260
But OFI can't prove it.

59
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,730
You know how hard it is to prove arson.

60
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,200
All right.

61
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,560
Point him out to me.

62
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,490
There. That's him.

63
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,510
That's him.

64
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,250
Okay, stay back.

65
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,170
Excuse me.

66
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,920
You Adrian Gish?

67
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,310
I am.

68
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,720
Antonio Dawson, Chicago PD.

69
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,850
You mind if we go somewhere and have a conversation?

70
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,800
Regarding?

71
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,010
Regarding you being an arsonist.

72
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,720
Regarding that you killed a CFD paramedic.

73
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,140
I've already talked to the fire department.

74
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,600
You're talking to the CPD now.

75
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,170
You're embarrassing me.

76
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,400
I'm just getting started.

77
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,020
I'm going to go back to work now.

78
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,300
Did you just spit in my face?

79
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,260
I didn't spit in--

80
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,700
Now, that's assaulting an officer.

81
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,730
Why'd you make this ugly?

82
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,020
- You see it? - I saw it.

83
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,020
That's ridiculous. I didn't--

84
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,680
I'm gonna have to call medical

85
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,340
to make sure you don't have any diseases.

86
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,760
Lots of paperwork.

87
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,320
Is everything okay, Adrian?

88
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,470
Your employee is a murderer.

89
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,620
How's that for okay?

90
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,750
All right, talk to me.

91
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,630
51, including my sister, got called to a fire scene

92
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,000
in a storage facility.

93
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,250
In that space were cases of brake fluid, kitty litter,

94
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,690
and chlorine powder.

95
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,470
Classic arsonist material.

96
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,760
All right, so the guy's a pyro.

97
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
It's not our problem.

98
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,140
Along with an obituary of Leslie Shay.

99
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,860
That building explosion...

100
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,330
This guy.

101
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,750
I hope this is being recorded.

102
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,810
I've been physically harassed.

103
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,030
I hear you like to start fires, Gish.

104
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,760
Only when appropriate.

105
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,280
According to who?

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,140
Fires that kill innocent people?

107
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,380
Yeah, I've heard about men who do that.

108
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,040
Men who kill their own families.

109
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,370
Men who wipe out city blocks with a single match.

110
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,060
How challenging is that?

111
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,730
A stupid cow burnt this city to the ground.

112
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,710
Exactly.

113
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,670
The challenge would be to get away with it more than once.

114
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,520
It would take a very special cow to do it over and over

115
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,860
and over again for years.

116
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,480
Go ahead.

117
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,910
Show me how you do it.

118
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,270
Always underestimated.

119
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,080
You got away with it this long out of sheer dumb luck,

120
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,700
not because you're special.

121
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,170
Thankfully, the CFD turned us on to you,

122
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,180
and there's nothing we like better

123
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,990
than to correct God's mistakes.

124
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,600
Now I see it.

125
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,090
See what?

126
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,890
The paramedic who came in my office and accused me.

127
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,450
She's your sister, right?

128
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,020
So she dialed up a little police brutality.

129
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,950
How'd you know she was a paramedic?

130
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,000
I follow the news.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,190
She was at the fire where Leslie Shay died.

132
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,770
Gabriela Dawson.

133
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,710
You just gonna tiptoe right to the edge, huh?

134
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,160
I promise you I'll stand right behind you

135
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,730
to give you the last push.

136
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,220
God's mistake?

137
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,200
God's mistake?

138
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,920
Really? You think I was made by God?

139
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,140
Last I checked, fire was the devil's tool.

140
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,080
I'm warning you, Detective.

141
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,580
Do not push me.

142
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,250
Or what, Gish?

143
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,450
You gonna burn me up?

144
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,900
When I'm done with you,

145
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,540
you're gonna burn yourself up.

146
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,880
All right, all right, not another word.

147
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,820
I'm assuming he wasn't allowed

148
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,330
to contact his attorney as was his right?

149
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,870
Your client volunteered to talk to us.

150
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,290
Well, he's done volunteering.

151
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,570
Unless my client is being arrested,

152
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,090
then we will be leaving now.

153
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,350
Adrian Gish.

154
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,180
CFD is sure he blew up the building

155
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,710
that killed Leslie Shay.

156
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,650
I for one agree with them.

157
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,400
I got the mother of all bad hits off this guy.

158
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,980
Gish works at Herald Mortgage Company as a proofreader.

159
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,140
Lives at 2947 West 21st.

160
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,990
Alone.

161
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,460
No known relatives in Chicago.

162
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,490
What's his rush?

163
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,730
According to Kelly Severide, he's an excitement arsonist,

164
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,660
lives in the shadows and gets off on the chaos of the act.

165
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,720
This guy killed Leslie Shay, my sister's best friend.

166
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,550
Years ago, he killed Peter Mills' father,

167
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,000
and burned Chief Boden and who knows how many others.

168
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,680
As far as I'm concerned,

169
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,000
we don't sleep until this lunatic roasts.

170
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,180
I hear that.

171
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,290
So how do we handle him?

172
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,570
We get under his skin.

173
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,570
Make him feel us everywhere he looks.

174
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,870
Arson is hard to prove unless you catch him in the act,

175
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,080
so that's what we're gonna do.

176
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,530
Pressure the volcano and be there when it erupts.

177
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,720
Olinsky and Ruzek, roll to his workplace.

178
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,650
Apparently, Antonio caused a little stir there this morning.

179
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,190
My experience is, the office gossips

180
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,740
will be bursting to talk to us about this guy.

181
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,180
The rest of you,

182
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,540
find a common link between the victims of these fires.

183
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,450
I want a warrant for this home address ASAP.

184
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,930
And make sure you include all electronics

185
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,130
in the body of the warrant.

186
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,040
Of course.

187
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,260
Hey, Alvin, Adam?

188
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,500
I'm just checking if you need a patrol team

189
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,470
to assist you with your busy case load today.

190
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,530
We're always here to help Intelligence.

191
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,950
No, that's okay. Thanks.

192
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,520
Well, cheers to you, then.

193
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,860
Watch this.

194
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,670
What're you gonna do?

195
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,610
I don't know.

196
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,500
Hey, Sarge?

197
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,950
Hey, how can I help you?

198
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,630
Do you mind if I swap shifts tomorrow?

199
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,620
I think we can work something out.

200
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,840
Oh, great.

201
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,180
'Cause I have this cake-making class,

202
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,770
and the lesson is on layering,

203
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,610
and I'm so afraid if I get behind,

204
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,900
I will never really catch up

205
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,850
'cause it's like trigonometry, you know?

206
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,700
I do know.

207
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,780
And I don't like it.

208
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,120
I love it.

209
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,080
I mean, Caminetto can swap out with you, right?

210
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,840
Thank-- yeah, thank you.

211
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,320
And save me a piece, for me, okay?

212
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,510
'Cause that's just yum yum in my tum-tum.

213
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,730
Thank you.

214
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,430
Is Adrian in trouble or something?

215
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,380
You tell us.

216
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,600
He's never been anything but a perfect employee...

217
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,220
then today...

218
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,020
How long's he worked here?

219
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,250
I came on eight years ago and inherited him.

220
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,600
So before that.

221
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,330
Rachel!

222
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,090
Will you bring me Adrian Gish's work file?

223
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,050
Of course.

224
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,530
Look, what we do isn't exciting.

225
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,840
We write mortgage reports and Adrian proofreads them.

226
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,970
I mean, he comes in, he's super organized,

227
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,790
and he doesn't involve himself with office politics,

228
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,500
which, believe me, happen here

229
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,130
when you get three people in a room.

230
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,770
Anything ever burn down around here?

231
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,050
Any employees' houses catch fire unexpectedly?

232
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,280
Not that I know of.

233
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,730
I don't even think he smoked.

234
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,210
Thank you.

235
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,720
His resume says he started here in 2004.

236
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,270
Mind if we have a look at that?

237
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,200
Hey, smart guy.

238
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,050
- Kellogg Business School at Northwestern. - Yeah.

239
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,650
- Dr. Miller? - Yes.

240
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,010
- Hi. Detective Halstead and Lindsay. - Hi.

241
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,400
Thanks for meeting us.

242
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,730
Adrian Gish's resume said that

243
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,490
he went to Kellogg for his MBA.

244
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,320
You're listed as one of three professors

245
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,340
on his advisory committee.

246
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,710
We're just hoping you could tell us some more about him.

247
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,290
I remember Adrian.

248
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,770
Anyone who was here at that time does.

249
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,070
Gifted.

250
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
In what way?

251
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,990
He would light up a room.

252
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,590
Intellect, charm.

253
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:13,100
I remember thinking, this young man will be a senator some day.

254
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,110
A senator?

255
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,500
He never saw his wheelchair as a disadvantage.

256
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,410
I remember when--

257
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,850
Did you say wheelchair?

258
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,340
Yes.

259
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,950
Muscular dystrophy, I think it was.

260
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,610
This man?

261
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,630
No. I don't know who that is.

262
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,520
Okay, thank you for your time.

263
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,960
Thanks.

264
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,170
All right, we need to go to the registrar's office

265
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,730
and see if they have an alumni address

266
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,490
for the Gish that actually went here.

267
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,370
Yep.

268
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:49,850
Yes?

269
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,180
Mrs. Gish?

270
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,550
Yes.

271
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,180
I'm Piper Gish.

272
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,330
Mother of Adrian Gish?

273
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,050
Yes.

274
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,700
Do you know where he is?

275
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,650
I'm sorry?

276
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,160
We're looking for your son.

277
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,010
How dare you?

278
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,560
Ma'am--

279
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,210
Adrian was killed in an office fire 12 years ago.

280
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,020
They didn't have wheelchair ramps.

281
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,680
Only an elevator.

282
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,960
He didn't--

283
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,110
He was trapped.

284
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,820
So this isn't your son?

285
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,780
This is him.

286
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,740
This is Adrian.

287
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,130
We're sorry to bother you. We made a mistake.

288
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,100
What is this about?

289
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,240
Police business, ma'am.

290
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,360
Very sorry.

291
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,250
If that guy's Gish,

292
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,100
who the hell is our guy?

293
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,580
How the hell did arson investigation not know that Gish

294
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,220
is operating under an alias?

295
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,970
Well, they aren't cops.

296
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,720
They're about accelerants and incendiaries

297
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,040
and the causes of a fire.

298
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,160
It took them this long to even know it was arson.

299
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,880
Give us a minute.

300
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,880
My client legally changed his name ten years ago.

301
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,260
And stole an identity in the process.

302
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,330
My client's birth name was Ross Clayton McGowan,

303
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,070
and this is to inform you

304
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,110
that I have formally lodged complaints with the IPRA,

305
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,450
the I.G.'s Office, and will be suing.

306
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,600
File away.

307
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,810
They probably have pre-printed "Voight" forms ready to go.

308
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,390
So...

309
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,390
So...

310
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,840
So just 'cause I'm back doesn't mean I want to quit me and you.

311
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,140
I don't know.

312
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,660
I'm not really a sneak-around-behind-dad's-back kind of guy.

313
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,880
Says the guy that works undercover.

314
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,710
Let's just come clean.

315
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,500
Voight will respect us more if we look him in the eye.

316
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,070
Or we keep our personal lives personal.

317
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,990
It's nobody's business but ours.

318
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,390
Hey, Voight wants to move out.

319
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,480
Yep, got it.

320
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,170
- To be continued. - Yep.

321
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,960
There they are.

322
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,850
Hey, sergeant, I need to borrow Burgess and Roman.

323
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,150
- Of course, Hank, whatever you need. - Thanks.

324
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,290
This is Ross McGowan, AKA Adrian Gish.

325
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,230
We want you to follow him.

326
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,050
All right, we'll get changed.

327
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,910
No. This guy's a smart cookie.

328
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,610
We're gonna throw him a wrinkle. Come on.

329
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,950
Okay, Sergeant, we are good to go.

330
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,490
Police! Search warrant!

331
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,120
Clear!

332
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,930
Where do you want me to stick this warrant?

333
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,770
Just tag it to the front door.

334
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,250
All right, toss the place.

335
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,490
Make it messy.

336
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,700
Pull up the floorboards if you have to.

337
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,730
Can I get one cheese, large?

338
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,220
Here. Keep the change.

339
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,460
Hey, thanks.

340
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,020
Let me get a couple of slices of sausage, please.

341
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,610
CPD eats free here.

342
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,850
Oh, no, we can't--

343
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,930
Sure, we can.

344
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,610
Can we get a couple of sodas too?

345
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,430
Yeah.

346
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,570
Diet for my partner.

347
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,440
Hilarious.

348
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,610
Thank you.

349
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,720
Pies almost ready, sir.

350
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,950
Sorry to make you wait.

351
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,130
Not a problem.

352
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,300
Should we follow him?

353
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,770
He left his cell phone.

354
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,580
If he's not back in a minute I'm gonna--

355
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,540
I'm not worried.

356
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,680
Do you ever worry?

357
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,530
When you got shot, I worried.

358
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,360
The way Platt's acting this week,

359
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,380
that's got me worried.

360
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,670
But no, not usually.

361
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,170
I don't know how you do that.

362
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,400
I concentrate on the important things.

363
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,850
Oh, I'll have to start trying that.

364
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,560
Yeah, I'm gonna go see if he's--

365
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,310
Here you go.

366
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,050
Are you two following me?

367
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,290
We're just out on patrol, sir.

368
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,780
Nice weather, huh?

369
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,100
Lindsay, Halstead, Gish thinks he spied us.

370
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,540
Got him.

371
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,600
Wait, is he...

372
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,070
Son of a bitch.

373
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,410
For the District.

374
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,250
Extra cheese.

375
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,270
You're underestimating me again.

376
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,730
Maybe we should have worried.

377
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,720
You heard?

378
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,590
I heard.

379
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,440
I don't know what to tell you, Sergeant.

380
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,140
It happened so fast...

381
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,990
Just so I'm clear, the guy you were tailing got free

382
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,870
from your sight, snuck out a bathroom window,

383
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,220
and then Molotov cocktailed your squad car.

384
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,710
Okay, the details are a bit more complex than that--

385
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,740
but basically yeah, yes, Sergeant.

386
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,250
And you didn't arrest him why?

387
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,050
Because Halstead and Lindsay said we need something bigger.

388
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,880
Bigger than one of my squad cars?

389
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,000
These things happen.

390
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,090
The important thing is that you two are unharmed.

391
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,220
Listen, don't let the behavior of others affect your day today.

392
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,620
Do some good out there.

393
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,180
All right, out with it.

394
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,250
Who is that man and what is he holding over you?

395
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,950
Fine.

396
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,070
He works for the city bureau

397
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,280
of disciplinary action or something.

398
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,220
I don't know.

399
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,400
He's monitoring me.

400
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,020
I knew it!

401
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,050
Just keep your voice down.

402
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,940
Okay.

403
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,910
How long is this gonna go?

404
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,080
I don't know.

405
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:55,140
Someone anonymously complained about my people skills.

406
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,140
Said I was droll and demeaning.

407
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,420
Can you believe that?

408
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,910
No.

409
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,980
I love being the desk sergeant here, Burgess.

410
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,030
I mean, I really love it.

411
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,180
If they took that away from me,

412
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,290
put me behind some desk in the ivory tower, or worse...

413
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,060
early retirement,

414
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,550
I don't know what I'd do.

415
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,940
That could happen?

416
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,450
Okay, you want to bury me?

417
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,740
Now's your chance.

418
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,330
Just walk over to him and pour your heart out.

419
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,580
- Hey, Herlihy! - Yo, Sarge.

420
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,770
How's the family?

421
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,610
Hey, how you doing?

422
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,740
I've been better.

423
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,300
You remember Megan?

424
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,250
Of course.

425
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,220
Good to see you.

426
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,760
Sorry about the circumstances.

427
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,340
You guys close to finding this guy?

428
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,050
We're gonna get him, I promise.

429
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,920
He's obsessed with being underestimated

430
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,950
and he's going to crack.

431
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,760
Chief.

432
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,350
Okay.

433
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,170
So here's the map from the IFO logs

434
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,590
with all the suspected arsons going back to 1970.

435
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,750
We don't know how far Gish goes back with all this,

436
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,950
but figured the more information you had, the better.

437
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,260
His name's not Gish.

438
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,570
He's been using a fake identity for a long time.

439
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,830
We don't know how long.

440
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,540
He torched a patrol car yesterday.

441
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,650
- You serious? - Yeah.

442
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,890
It's actually a good sign.

443
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,940
Our plan is working.

444
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,080
This helps too.

445
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,340
Atwater, why don't you and me cross-reference all these fires

446
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,260
with the name Ross McGowan and see what pops.

447
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,240
Pardon me. What did you say?

448
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,550
Ross McGowan, Gish's birth name.

449
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,990
That is not his birth name.

450
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,300
What's that, Chief?

451
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,230
Ross McGowan was a firefighter.

452
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,260
He died in the same fire

453
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,170
that killed Peter Mills' father, Henry.

454
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,640
Same place I got my scars.

455
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,800
So McGowan's a fake ID too.

456
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,250
Going back 20 years.

457
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,150
Who is this guy?

458
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,200
Thanks, guys.

459
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,970
We'll update you as soon as there's anything to update.

460
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,170
Yeah.

461
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,680
Please don't tell me this means you guys aren't--

462
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,060
Megan, look at me.

463
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,490
This prick is going down.

464
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,360
Hey, sis.

465
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,950
Voight's just frustrated because we're all taking

466
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,550
this a bit personally now.

467
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,360
Antonio, you looked into that man's eyes, right?

468
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,950
He's not human.

469
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,330
He's not even an animal.

470
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,550
He's darkness.

471
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,660
I know it.

472
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,750
You need to arrest him,

473
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,060
you make something up, get him,

474
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,510
throw him in the pit, and never look back.

475
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,720
It doesn't work like that.

476
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,860
Voight does.

477
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,630
I've seen it.

478
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,770
Haven't you come full circle on Voight.

479
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,820
Well, what are you doing?

480
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,550
My job.

481
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,490
Man, everyone keeps saying that.

482
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,860
Because it's the truth.

483
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,990
You may not want to hear it,

484
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,460
but I believe in the system, Gabby.

485
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,120
Because at the end of the day, it works.

486
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,970
Now, we're gonna catch Gish in the act,

487
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,110
and he's gonna spend the rest of his pathetic life

488
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,630
right where he belongs.

489
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,220
Locked up.

490
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,440
Alone.

491
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,400
In the darkness, like you said.

492
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,650
I really hope you're right.

493
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,640
Before he kills somebody else.

494
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,760
Because if he does, that's on you.

495
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,320
All right, we know his age,

496
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,010
we know his weight, we know his face.

497
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,070
Anyone been in the interrogation room since him?

498
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,220
No, I don't think so.

499
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,730
Then his prints are on the table.

500
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,000
Let's run 'em through NCIC and LEADS.

501
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,400
We'll see if we get a pop or a match.

502
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,560
O and Ruzek are on him, right?

503
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,460
- Yeah. - Good.

504
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,340
Let's keep pushing this bastard.

505
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,880
I don't want to wait much longer.

506
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,890
Sorry, one second.

507
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,180
Excuse me.

508
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,130
Excuse me.

509
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,210
Sir?

510
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,120
I've worked with Sergeant Platt for a while now,

511
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,450
so I think I have some good perspective.

512
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,060
Okay, she would kill me for saying this, but...

513
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,990
she is an amazing woman and cop.

514
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,120
Nobody cares more about this district

515
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,550
than Sergeant Trudy Platt, okay?

516
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,530
She runs it firmly and fairly

517
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,770
and with a...

518
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,950
just ton of charisma.

519
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,230
Charisma.

520
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,450
Anyway, I wanted you to know that.

521
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,260
Thank you.

522
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,460
Officer Burgess, is it?

523
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,110
That's right.

524
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,820
Uh--guh-- no, my pleasure.

525
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,270
Hardware store?

526
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,400
Yeah.

527
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,020
Want me to stay back, guard your car?

528
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,600
I've been looking to trade this in anyway.

529
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,460
Let's go.

530
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,370
Danger...

531
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,220
Flammable...

532
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,010
Gas...

533
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,720
Under...

534
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,960
Pressure...

535
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,440
Do you know why arson is so hard to prove?

536
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,980
Why don't you tell us?

537
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,470
Because fire eats itself.

538
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,030
Destroying all the evidence.

539
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,740
It's as if you had a gun...

540
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,460
Used it in a murder,

541
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,290
and then the gun self-destructed.

542
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,190
Why don't you tell us more?

543
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,610
About the fires you started?

544
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,650
Get it out in the open?

545
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,810
You know you want to.

546
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,500
Excuse me.

547
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,010
I tried.

548
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,570
I can take you over here.

549
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,610
I'll wait.

550
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,050
How you doing today?

551
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,510
Dandy.

552
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,980
And you?

553
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,670
Oh, getting by.

554
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,250
I hope you don't mind my asking, but...

555
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,130
A fire?

556
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,020
I was trapped in one at my old school.

557
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,270
I don't remember much about it.

558
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,310
Lucky to be alive, they tell me.

559
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,760
Was it the school fire at August Ele--

560
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,830
Elementary on 38th, about...

561
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,080
8 or 9 years ago?

562
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,530
Yeah, it was.

563
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,200
I remember that.

564
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,050
A nasty one.

565
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,150
Glad you made it out okay.

566
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,770
Me too.

567
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,980
And thank you.

568
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,430
This will be $62.67.

569
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,460
You know what? I decided I don't want any of it.

570
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,870
I'm going to the grocery store next if you want to come.

571
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,050
We're gonna take you up on that.

572
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,990
Don't worry about him.

573
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,200
Yeah.

574
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,090
Thanks, Al.

575
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,680
Olinksy says Gish has old burn scars

576
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,330
from a fire on his arm.

577
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,480
We can use that.

578
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,200
We know he changed IDs at least twice

579
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,390
going back 20 years.

580
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,160
What do we know about psychopaths?

581
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,490
They work up to their first kills

582
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,170
and usually aren't very careful in the early going.

583
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,850
So either Gish burned himself starting a fire,

584
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,830
or more likely,

585
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,490
he suffered an inciting incident,

586
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,900
and that's what set him off.

587
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,090
Exactly.

588
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
In the interview room,

589
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,610
Gish mentioned men who kill their own families.

590
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,490
Let's look at some of the earlier fires

591
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,350
in the Bridgeport area,

592
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,330
see if maybe there was one

593
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,790
that took out a family except for one little boy.

594
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,670
Hey, we got one!

595
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,690
Fire in Bridgeport in 1975.

596
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,760
Killed a mom,

597
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,200
a husband, a brother.

598
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,900
There was one surviving child at the time.

599
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,260
He was age 7, Trenton Lamont.

600
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,540
You got an address?

601
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,030
3424 South Green Street.

602
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,250
Let's hit it.

603
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,180
Excuse me.

604
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,200
Excuse me.

605
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,590
You lived here long?

606
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,290
Just my whole life.

607
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,800
You here when this place burned down?

608
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,690
Yeah, the Lamont family.

609
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,290
How come no one ever rebuilt?

610
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,640
The son who survived, he still owns the property.

611
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,470
Trenton.

612
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,540
Trenton Lamont.

613
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,030
You ever have any contact with him?

614
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,820
Yeah, all the time.

615
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,110
Lives right there.

616
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,970
What?

617
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,820
Yeah, never left the area.

618
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,290
Saw him last week.

619
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,290
He comes and goes at weird times,

620
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,000
been always nothing but nice.

621
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,190
This him?

622
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,900
Yeah, that's him.

623
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,170
Trenton Lamont.

624
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,620
Let's go.

625
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,970
Clear back here.

626
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,510
Hey, in here!

627
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,630
Gabi.

628
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,630
Oh, my God.

629
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,480
Al, you got eyes on Gish?

630
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,920
Yeah, he's entering a grocery store

631
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,350
on Roosevelt as we speak.

632
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:30,930
We're letting him--

633
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,780
He's targeting Gabriela! Snatch him up!

634
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,250
Move to arrest, move to arrest!

635
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,110
He's sending out false texts.

636
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,750
Last one's to Gabby from Silvy Brett

637
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,470
telling her to meet him at this address.

638
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,230
When?

639
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,350
Now.

640
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,460
Come on, come on, come on.

641
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,930
You see a guy run through here, red jacket, dark hair?

642
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,180
Back of the store, Al.

643
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,570
Out of the store. Out of the store.

644
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,050
- Go, go, go! I got it, I got it. - Alright.

645
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,010
I think I got it.

646
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,090
Al, tell me you got him.

647
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,400
We don't have eyes. He's in the wind.

648
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,980
Oh, God.

649
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,330
Come on. Pick up, pick up.

650
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,780
Hey, Antonio.

651
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,370
I'm just about to get in a--

652
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,620
Antonio.

653
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,760
Gabby, get out of there.

654
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,780
Antonio.

655
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,140
Gabby, listen to me.

656
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,670
Oh, come on.

657
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,400
Hello?

658
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:32,100
Hey. Hi, I'm in a stuck elevator.

659
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,530
Anyone else in there?

660
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,060
Just me.

661
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,680
Okay.

662
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,380
I'll take a look. Sit tight.

663
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,190
Need a little help down here.

664
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,510
Do you?

665
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,070
I warned everyone.

666
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,690
Everyone.

667
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,870
No one listened.

668
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,940
You know what the police called me?

669
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,170
God's mistake.

670
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,790
But I'm not from God.

671
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,130
Stop.

672
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,180
Stop!

673
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,470
Listen to me. Stop!

674
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,710
You don't want to do this.

675
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:34,620
All I want to do is watch you burn.

676
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,110
Listen to me, Adrian! Listen to me.

677
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,380
You poured too much gasoline.

678
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,940
Okay, you know this!

679
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,600
If you light up this elevator car, you're going up too.

680
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,960
I don't care.

681
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,240
You got away with it for so long.

682
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,340
If you end it this way, they're gonna say--

683
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,310
they're gonna say that you made a mistake,

684
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,290
and the cops are gonna know

685
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,410
that they didn't underestimate you.

686
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,640
You will ruin your legacy,

687
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,420
what you worked so hard for.

688
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,660
Wrong.

689
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,410
This finishes my legacy.

690
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,700
Who are you?

691
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,400
What's going on?

692
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,550
Whoa, hey, I just work here, man.

693
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,200
I got a call the elevator was stuck.

694
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,360
You smell that?

695
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,130
It's gasoline.

696
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,790
Keys. What floor is it stuck on?

697
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,090
Between three and four.

698
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,330
Here. Wait out there.

699
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,430
I was destined for it.

700
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,000
To burn.

701
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:55,850
To be consumed in the chaos of fire.

702
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:56,850
No, don't.

703
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,330
Don't do it. Don't do it.

704
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,790
Do you know the story of the phoenix?

705
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,880
It's a beautiful bird that at the end of its life,

706
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,510
settles into a nest and sets itself on fire...

707
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,710
and a new phoenix is born from the ashes.

708
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,130
I will rise again, see?

709
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,800
Stronger, better.

710
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:49,940
Gabby!

711
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,280
I'm okay.

712
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,980
Oh, God!

713
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,360
You okay?

714
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,950
Yeah, yeah.

715
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,450
Antonio.

716
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,510
That's fine police work today, brother.

717
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,030
Yeah, thanks.

718
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,650
You all right?

719
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,030
Me?

720
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,710
I'm glad I saved the courts the trouble.

721
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,970
Hey, you and me both.

722
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,260
Hey, you're coming, right?

723
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,570
Yeah.

724
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,730
See you in a minute.

725
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,430
Devil in the white city.

726
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,710
Back in hell where he belongs.

727
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,840
- Hey. - Hey, Chief.

728
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,130
Hey, Chief, how you feel?

729
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,180
How do I feel?

730
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,010
God, I wish there was a word to encapsulate it all.

731
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,080
How about happy?

732
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,200
I mean, I'm happy the son of a bitch is dead.

733
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,400
No, happy is not the word.

734
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,030
I'm just...

735
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,730
I don't know.

736
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,080
I don't know, I'd say happy works for me.

737
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,010
I just might get some sleep for the first time in months.

738
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,920
I hear right?

739
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,410
Yeah.

740
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,330
They...

741
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,630
they got him.

742
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,440
Thank you.

743
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,190
Thank you.

744
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,440
God, I need a beer.

745
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,690
Yeah.

746
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,770
Maybe you were right.

747
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,910
Maybe happy is the word.

748
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,240
- Here's to happy. - Cheers.

749
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,240
I almost--

750
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,400
Come here.

751
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,630
We're all good.

752
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,850
You did it.

753
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,170
I'm fine.

754
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,230
We're all fine thanks to you.

755
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,470
Yeah.

756
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,000
We're fine.

757
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,170
Hey, if you want to tell Hank, we can tell him.

758
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,110
I don't want to talk about Hank.

759
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,240
What do you want--

760
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,330
I don't want to talk at all.

761
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,920
I've heard of a puff piece,

762
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,060
but this is a whole bag of puffs.

763
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,460
What's going on, Sergeant?

764
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,060
Ah, just a little article

765
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,460
the Sun-Times wrote about yours truly.

766
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,270
Nice of them to recognize the little people, you know?

767
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,600
"Officer Kim Burgess, a beat co in Platt's district told me,

768
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,380
no desk sergeant in the city has as much charisma

769
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,890
as Sergeant Trudy Platt."

770
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,980
You said that?

771
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,290
God, I love that word.

772
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,010
Charisma.

773
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,530
I got to remember that one.

774
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,820
You lied to me.

775
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,680
My mother's gonna read this.

776
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,360
You...

777
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,300
are unbelievable.

778
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,390
Yeah, but with charisma.

779
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,420
Well, at least we got a couple of nice shifts out of you.

780
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,920
Yeah, that quota's done for the year.

781
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,460
So quit sitting around like a piss bum

782
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,310
on the first of the month and get out and patrol, officer.

783
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,640
Spencer for Hire, you seen Lindsay?

784
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,200
What? No.

785
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,320
Why?

786
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,930
'Cause I got a package for her.

787
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:03,580
She texted me.

788
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,250
She said that she had to see her mom or something.

789
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,610
So what was so important you couldn't tell me over the phone?

790
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,140
Okay, Erin...

791
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,420
Is this about Teddy?

792
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,130
Teddy? No, no, no.

793
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,190
Nothing to do with Teddy.

794
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,980
Teddy's great.

795
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,400
As a matter of fact, he's really good.

796
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,270
He's enrolled in some night classes at CCU.

797
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,670
- Yeah. - Hotel management.

798
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,360
What then?

799
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,010
Well, I quit my job at the bar

800
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,170
and now I'm working the desk

801
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,110
at Johnny's rental truck company.

802
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,700
Which is great. It's all good.

803
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,890
It's good.

804
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,480
It's just that there's this one customer

805
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,200
who keeps renting from us.

806
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,900
Eight times in the last month.

807
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,570
I mean, we have our repeat movers, you know,

808
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,460
but eight times?

809
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,720
I just get a really bad vibe off this guy.

810
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,420
A bad vibe off a rental customer

811
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,530
is why you had me come all the way down here?

812
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,740
When he returned his last rental,

813
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,250
I found this in the back.

814
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,460
I think he killed somebody.

814
00:41:14,305 --> 00:42:14,533

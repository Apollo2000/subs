1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,698
They're doing the race
registration over in "A" wing.

2
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:09,234
Thank you.

3
00:00:09,268 --> 00:00:10,936
This is my niece Zoe.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,605
Do you want to go see them unload
the animals for the petting zoo?

5
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:18,710
Hey, I like the balloons.

6
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:26,662
Girls, can you hear me?

7
00:00:26,696 --> 00:00:31,133
Every bit of training we've
had was for today, boys.

8
00:00:31,168 --> 00:00:33,536
If there's one car bomb,
there's probably a second.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,639
It looks just like Oklahoma City.

10
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:37,873
Where's Dawson?

11
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:40,943
- She went inside.
- Dawson's in there?

12
00:00:40,977 --> 00:00:43,212
Are you okay?

13
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:45,781
Yeah, it's... it's just a little scratch.

14
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:48,150
Imogene! We need help over here!

15
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:50,586
Gabby! Hello?

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,922
She's only 9 years old!

17
00:00:52,956 --> 00:00:55,257
You came.

18
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:57,460
We found our second bomb.

19
00:00:57,494 --> 00:00:59,495
Shay, we got Dawson.

20
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,297
Shay?

21
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:04,667
Help!

22
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:07,703
We need some help over here!

23
00:01:07,738 --> 00:01:09,972
Oh, my God.

24
00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:15,244
Oh, she's lost a lot of blood.

25
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:17,480
Help me get her into one of these bays.

26
00:01:17,514 --> 00:01:19,315
All right.

27
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,987
I'm going to need to get an I.V. started.

28
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:26,822
Right away.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

30
00:01:37,234 --> 00:01:41,270
First bomb detonated 8:00 A.M. on the dot.

31
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:43,672
Second bomb located in a rental car.

32
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:46,142
Car is still there.

33
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:48,744
- Who dismantled the bomb?
- We did.

34
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:50,045
Check it out.

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,448
If they got anything, I
want to be notified first.

36
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:53,649
Yeah.

37
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:56,886
- How many confirmed dead?
- 18 dead...

38
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,456
15 in critical condition,
3 employees unaccounted for.

39
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,725
The sign-ups for the charity race

40
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,794
had just started before the bomb detonated.

41
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:07,997
We may have more civilians
buried beneath the rubble,

42
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:10,599
but there's no real way
of knowing right now.

43
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:12,735
FBI special agent in
charge wants all the bosses

44
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:14,637
in the command center.

45
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:17,373
All right, everybody inside.

46
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:20,609
Voight...

47
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:23,312
Animals did this.

48
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,317
We'll get 'em.

49
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:33,989
- Hey.
- Hey.

50
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:35,524
Anything?

51
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:38,494
Not much left to recover,
but we're still digging.

52
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:41,697
All right.

53
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:43,199
You know who did it?

54
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:45,367
No, we're just getting started.

55
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:47,503
Find 'em.

56
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:58,047
Call out if you can hear me!

57
00:02:58,081 --> 00:02:59,749
Who do we talk to first, Al?

58
00:02:59,783 --> 00:03:01,784
Whoever was closest to the
blast and is still alive.

59
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:03,252
Intelligence, C.P.D.

60
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:15,898
Quiet then, okay, everybody, listen up.

61
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:18,934
Listen up!

62
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,238
My name is William Graff.

63
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:23,839
I'm with the FBI.

64
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:25,274
I need all your help,

65
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:27,710
and I know you're all eager to provide it.

66
00:03:27,744 --> 00:03:30,346
First rule...

67
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,881
everything goes through me.

68
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:35,584
Okay, I want to go over
what we know right now.

69
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:38,387
Blood pressure coming up.

70
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:39,989
Any word on Zoe?

71
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:41,457
Nothing.

72
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:47,596
Vital signs are stable, no brain activity.

73
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:54,704
Keep her on life support. I
need to go talk to her sister.

74
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:01,344
- Anything on Zoe?
- Not yet.

75
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,514
Holly...

76
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:09,885
Oh, no.

77
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:15,391
I've made this speech.

78
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,795
Don't say anymore.

79
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,197
Oh, God.

80
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:23,999
Oh, God.

81
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:27,036
Your sister's still breathing,

82
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,641
but there's been no brain
activity for some time.

83
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:34,377
So she's alive.

84
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:39,448
I'm going to go see her.

85
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,351
Alim Al Safir,

86
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:44,720
ambassador from Syria, is here
for an off-the-books surgery.

87
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:46,389
My office and the office
of Greg Simpson at CIA

88
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:48,424
will be spearheading this angle,

89
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,426
but if you encounter
anything that waves near this,

90
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,795
notify me.

91
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:54,530
I was going to do the transplant...

92
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:56,198
On the Syrian ambassador?

93
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:57,433
All right.

94
00:04:57,467 --> 00:04:59,068
Did you see anything
that looked out of place?

95
00:04:59,102 --> 00:05:01,370
Do you remember?

96
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:04,040
- Oh, he had his guys.
- Guys?

97
00:05:04,074 --> 00:05:06,308
He's an ambassador. He has guys.

98
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:07,677
And the next thing I knew,

99
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,780
the ground shook like it was an earthquake.

100
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:13,516
I thought for a second I
was back in San Francisco.

101
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,152
Dr. Willhite, 7632.

102
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:20,056
- Dr. Willhite, 7632.
- All right.

103
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,425
We also have an orderly who works here

104
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:26,529
with distant ties to
a radical Muslim group.

105
00:05:26,563 --> 00:05:29,198
I can't help you. I didn't do it.

106
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:31,701
I didn't see who did
it, and I've got to focus

107
00:05:31,735 --> 00:05:34,036
on what I can do, which is save

108
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:37,339
as many lives and limbs as I possibly can.

109
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:40,710
- I got it. Thank you.
- All right.

110
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:43,913
There were two guys...
baseball caps on, sunglasses.

111
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:45,414
I noticed because everyone else was walking

112
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,116
toward the tent to sign up for the race.

113
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,250
They were walking away from it.

114
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:49,785
And what else did you notice about them?

115
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,222
Tan skin... olive, dark hair for sure.

116
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:56,625
But could have been
Hispanic or Arab or Italian.

117
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,626
I don't know.

118
00:05:57,661 --> 00:06:00,463
Excuse me. Agent Graff?

119
00:06:00,497 --> 00:06:02,632
Sergeant Hank Voight, Intelligence, C.P.D.

120
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,899
How you doing?

121
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:05,201
Listen, I'm really going
to need your help...

122
00:06:05,235 --> 00:06:07,269
securing the perimeter,
conducting interviews. Thanks.

123
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:09,605
My unit is gonna be
doing a hell of a lot more

124
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,875
than interviewing hospital
staff and setting out pylons.

125
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:16,278
This happened in my city, on my soil.

126
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:20,350
Don't get in my way.

127
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:25,205
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

128
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,914
Okay, I'll get somebody on it right away.

129
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:38,754
- Here you go.
- Yeah, thanks.

130
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,725
Sweeping the whole area.

131
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,161
I'm gonna need a few minutes, Billy.

132
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:47,063
Catch these guys.

133
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:48,998
Yeah.

134
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:08,451
Both males enter a white four-door Sedan

135
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:11,087
and head out the southeast exit of the lot.

136
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:12,588
And we have security video?

137
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:14,190
The security office was in the impact zone.

138
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:16,325
Database is gone, as in gone gone.

139
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,760
Second car with a bomb

140
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:20,029
was rented out of some
dirt-lot company in Milwaukee.

141
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,564
The name and the credit
card on the rental agreement

142
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:22,832
came back bogus.

143
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:23,966
And there's no security
video at the company,

144
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:25,334
or so they're saying.

145
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:26,769
So Milwaukee P.D.'s heading
there to investigate.

146
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:29,271
Sumner, you dealt with all
those antigovernment nutcases

147
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:30,339
when you were working undercover

148
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:31,674
at the NATO protests, am I right?

149
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,410
- That's right.
- All right, beat the bushes.

150
00:07:34,444 --> 00:07:36,546
Hey, guys, I just heard.

151
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,680
Burgess was here when it happened,

152
00:07:37,714 --> 00:07:40,583
and her niece is in the I.C.U.

153
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:44,954
- How bad?
- Not good.

154
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:54,363
Hey.

155
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:59,869
It's Zoe...

156
00:07:59,903 --> 00:08:04,540
She's, um... she's an only child.

157
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:06,842
Her... my sister and her
husband are out of town.

158
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:09,845
That's why she's staying with me.

159
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,213
And now Imogene...

160
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:17,219
- Hey.
- Hi.

161
00:08:17,254 --> 00:08:20,256
Hey.

162
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:27,930
We just heard. What did they say?

163
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,533
A ruptured liver.

164
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:34,337
She's... there's a list
or something, a donor list.

165
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:36,505
They're trying to match.

166
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,341
Do we know who did it?

167
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,177
Anybody taking credit?

168
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:42,612
Okay...

169
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:45,448
The lab got a print off the
duct tape of bomb number two.

170
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:47,550
Came back to a Paul Watts.

171
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:50,620
V.L.D. has him registered
at 5225 South Laramie.

172
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:52,254
I secured a no-knock search warrant.

173
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:54,624
Give us five minutes
before you notify the feds

174
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:55,891
about that print.

175
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:58,561
Yeah.

176
00:08:58,595 --> 00:09:02,264
They need you out on the perimeter.

177
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:03,766
I'm okay.

178
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:06,936
One more thing...

179
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,973
the second bomb was set
to go off at 8:30 P.M.

180
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,142
The bomber screwed up somewhere.

181
00:09:15,512 --> 00:09:17,480
We're gonna ask for forgiveness

182
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:21,384
instead of permission
today, you understand?

183
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:24,954
We're not slowing down for anything.

184
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:27,857
I mean anything.

185
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:32,061
No one's gonna give a damn
once these bastards are caught.

186
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:38,167
All right, let's go.

187
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:48,511
You let us know if anything changes, okay?

188
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:50,780
Okay.

189
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:53,849
Thank you.

190
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,258
Paul Watts... most recently a dishwasher

191
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:04,227
at a Red Lobster in Tallahassee.

192
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:09,665
Minor sheet... a couple
possession charges, D&D...

193
00:10:14,838 --> 00:10:16,005
What?

194
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:21,177
Nothing.

195
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:40,763
I'm, uh...

196
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:43,432
I'm trying to get a hold
of my father to notify him.

197
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,468
My, um...

198
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:47,370
I understand.

199
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,010
I'll recommend we take
her off life support.

200
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:57,046
I'll explain it to him medically.

201
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,081
Okay.

202
00:11:29,546 --> 00:11:31,213
All right, that's who we're looking for.

203
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:33,316
Apartment 1-A.

204
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,585
Okay, careful of wires or traps.

205
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:37,320
Anything's possible.

206
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:41,190
Hey, what's this?

207
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:43,860
Hey! Hey!

208
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,001
Hands on the wheel! Hands on the wheel!

209
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:53,769
Turn your head and look at me! Don't move!

210
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:58,274
Keep your eyes on me.

211
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:00,309
It's not him.

212
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,310
Clear.

213
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,979
What the hell is going on?

214
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,282
It's our bad. Have a nice day.

215
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:21,998
Well, it's clean.

216
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,700
I can't make any guarantees, though.

217
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,047
Paul Watts! C.P.D.!

218
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:39,081
Clear!

219
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:41,184
Body!

220
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,252
Clear!

221
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:46,088
Clear.

222
00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:53,863
- Call it in.
- All right.

223
00:12:53,897 --> 00:12:57,500
This wasn't a suicide. Gun's on the right.

224
00:12:57,534 --> 00:13:00,102
Cell phone clip and wallet are
on the left side of the belt.

225
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:02,605
He has no burn from muzzle flash,

226
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,340
no gunshot residue on his face.

227
00:13:04,374 --> 00:13:07,810
Somebody had to shoot
him from five feet away.

228
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:09,278
They set this up.

229
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:10,813
All right, call Jin and Sumner.

230
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:12,815
I want to know everything about this guy...

231
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:14,650
the first movie he rented

232
00:13:14,685 --> 00:13:16,719
right down to the last
breath mint he bought...

233
00:13:16,753 --> 00:13:17,720
everything.

234
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,720
- Hey.
- Hey.

235
00:13:53,357 --> 00:13:55,958
There was an explosion.

236
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:01,264
You weren't gonna tell anyone

237
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,132
about that enormous gash in your side?

238
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:05,301
I...

239
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:08,404
I kept meaning to. I just...

240
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:11,407
I had to keep going.

241
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:14,310
I know. I know. But not anymore.

242
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:20,183
Always looking out for me.

243
00:14:22,186 --> 00:14:25,655
Rest up, okay?

244
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:28,191
Okay.

245
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,661
Severide.

246
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:33,663
Um...

247
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:35,298
There were two little girls

248
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,733
about the same age... I think eight.

249
00:14:37,768 --> 00:14:39,202
Do you know if they made it?

250
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:43,339
I don't know. Um, it's...

251
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:45,575
It's bad out there.

252
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:48,477
Just get some rest, okay?

253
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,519
His prints were on the tape.

254
00:14:56,553 --> 00:14:58,554
Whoever he was working with took him out.

255
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:01,290
Crime scene is at his
place doing a full workup.

256
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:03,292
The Muslim orderly we've
been looking into...

257
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:04,927
we just found traces of fertilizer

258
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:06,796
- in the bed of his truck.
- How's he connected?

259
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,297
We haven't put the dots together yet,

260
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:09,632
but he's our focus.

261
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,435
Just keep interviewing staff.

262
00:15:17,975 --> 00:15:19,475
What do you got?

263
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,910
Jin did a cross-match on
Watts for known associates.

264
00:15:20,944 --> 00:15:22,145
All right.

265
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:24,514
It turns out Watts was
trolling the websites

266
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,315
of some pretty heavy-duty
anti-government groups.

267
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,650
We pulled the names of some people

268
00:15:27,684 --> 00:15:28,985
that he had repeated contact with.

269
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:30,186
Haven't been able to actually

270
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,355
access the contents of the emails.

271
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,557
I was just able to get addresses.

272
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:39,162
Whoa. Wait a second.
Wait a second. Go back.

273
00:15:39,196 --> 00:15:44,133
Go back. Wait, hold on, wait a sec.

274
00:15:44,168 --> 00:15:45,535
Yeah, that's him. That's the guy.

275
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,736
What guy?

276
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,404
The guy who told me two dark-skinned guys

277
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:50,039
in sunglasses were leaving the scene.

278
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:51,140
That's the guy.

279
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:52,675
He's here.

280
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:58,214
Thank you for everything,

281
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,150
and I am so sorry for what
you guys have been through.

282
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:03,619
You're all heroes.

283
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:05,822
- Pat Vaughn?
- Yeah?

284
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:09,125
Would you mind coming with us for a minute?

285
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,459
I just checked out.

286
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:12,361
We just have a few follow-up questions.

287
00:16:12,396 --> 00:16:14,130
Of course.

288
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:15,531
Sure.

289
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:17,500
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

290
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:19,502
Take it easy!

291
00:16:19,536 --> 00:16:21,838
I am walking out of here.

292
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,923
- Back up!
- Don't go any further, Vaughn.

293
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,058
- I got nothing to lose.
- Okay.

294
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,360
What are you hoping to gain?

295
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,395
Do you think we're gonna
let you drive out of here?

296
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,465
I got no problem slitting a
throat, especially a cop's.

297
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,866
- Easy.
- Back up!

298
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,702
Okay, man. What's going on here?

299
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,704
We're just trying to save some people...

300
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,540
- Shut up!
- Listen...

301
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,309
Let's just talk this out, all right?

302
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,211
You want to walk out of here,
you can walk out of here.

303
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,113
Don't say another word!

304
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,848
Hey!

305
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,851
- You all right?
- Stay down.

306
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,054
- You okay?
- Yeah. Thank you.

307
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,322
- Thank you.
- I need a room.

308
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,723
Don't move.

309
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,959
- This guy involved?
- Looks like it.

310
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,427
On your feet.

311
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,628
You can bring him in to
any firehouse in the city.

312
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,797
We'll take five minutes, all right?

313
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,432
We'll get some answers from him, I promise.

314
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,834
Thank you. Thank you.

315
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,643
Voight.

316
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,078
I got him.

317
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,146
Sir?

318
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,814
The Muslim orderly checks out.

319
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,649
The fertilizer residue
found in his truck traces

320
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:33,352
to a community garden in his neighborhood.

321
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,387
Well, we're onto something here.

322
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:39,058
Yeah, I can't let you traipse
off with our only lead,

323
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,727
doing God knows what at all hours.

324
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,696
All I need is 30 minutes.

325
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,269
You got 20.

326
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,420
My shoulder is broken.

327
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:11,156
I demand medical treatment.

328
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:14,760
18 people died in that bomb blast...

329
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:18,898
A dozen more clinging
to their life upstairs...

330
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,667
9-year-old girl who's a niece of a cop

331
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,770
in my district.

332
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:29,508
You tell me everything you
know, every participant...

333
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,478
because as a coward, Vaughn...

334
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,013
and I know you're a coward,

335
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:38,283
'cause that's who lays bombs
at cancer fund-raisers...

336
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,952
you will not endure the pain

337
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:42,354
that I'm going to put you through.

338
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,224
I need to see a... aah!

339
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,962
Now, let me tell you what I need.

340
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:53,599
I need to know about 8:30 P.M.

341
00:18:56,136 --> 00:19:00,005
Once I get medical treatment.

342
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,714
Vaughn said him and
Watts were both hooked up

343
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,416
with a guy named Ted Powell.

344
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,850
Ted Powell... I know that name.

345
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,686
He was big in the anti-government fringe.

346
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,687
So was his dad.

347
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,321
Why did Watts get killed?

348
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:18,157
Vaughn and Watts were both in charge

349
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,459
of setting off two separate car bombs.

350
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,795
Both bombs were supposed
to go off tonight...

351
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,064
Watts at 8:00, Vaughn at 8:30.

352
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:27,499
Watts must've rigged his wrong,
'cause it went off this morning.

353
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,501
8:00 P.M. was gonna be the gala

354
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,203
for the C.P.D. and the C.F.D. Brass, right?

355
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,204
Right.

356
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,173
First bomb was set to get them.

357
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:36,575
Second bomb was set to
get the first responders.

358
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,277
What else you get out of him?

359
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,913
Vaughn said that Powell
had some master plan

360
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,181
that he didn't share with him.

361
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,049
So this wasn't the end of it.

362
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:45,884
Here's Powell.

363
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,626
I saw him outside the
hospital with the crowd.

364
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,527
He was here too.

365
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:58,297
All right, let's check out his dad.

366
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,869
- Casey!
- Hey.

367
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,971
- How's Gabby?
- She's fine.

368
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:10,409
She's home... a little rattled
still, but who can blame her?

369
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,444
- Here.
- Oh, thanks, man.

370
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,214
- Thanks for getting her out.
- Mm.

371
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:19,018
I told her she owes me a 12-pack.

372
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,220
Any more survivors pulled
out from the rubble?

373
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:22,388
Doesn't look good.

374
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:23,555
We saw a woman's hand,

375
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,691
spent the last hour digging her out.

376
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,627
It was a single mom from
accounting... two kids at home.

377
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,364
Who would do something like this?

378
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:37,002
I've got a pretty good idea.

379
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:40,339
Ten years ago, Frank Powell,
many of you will remember,

380
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:43,108
was arrested after a
two-day standoff at his ranch

381
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:44,944
outside of Kankakee.

382
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:46,512
His wife died in the gun battle.

383
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,147
The old man is doing life at Stateville.

384
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:50,883
Two of my detectives are
en route to interview him.

385
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,651
Ted Powell was there
when the ranch was raided.

386
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:55,688
He lost his mother and his father that day.

387
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,189
He has been a fixture

388
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,558
on radical anti-government
websites ever since.

389
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,431
Powell... correct.

390
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,866
Okay. How far back?

391
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:09,802
Far back as they go. Five years?

392
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,470
Okay.

393
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:13,305
I'm gonna just need my
supervisor to approve.

394
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,473
He should be back in...

395
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,976
Have you been watching the news today, man?

396
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,712
Do I need to run down a list of the dead?

397
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:22,915
Thank you.

398
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:34,727
You're aware of what
happened at Chicago Med today?

399
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,261
I am.

400
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:39,798
Your son Ted was involved,
possibly the mastermind,

401
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:40,899
but you probably knew that.

402
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:43,836
So you allege.

403
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,738
Look, whatever problems
you've had with the government,

404
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:48,274
whatever losses you've suffered,

405
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:52,678
there's no way to excuse
what your son did today.

406
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,179
Now, we have reason to believe

407
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:57,916
that there might be more
to his plan, another step.

408
00:21:57,951 --> 00:22:00,886
So we can work out a deal, okay?

409
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:02,688
It's a buyer's market right now.

410
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:05,891
You help us, and we'll help you.

411
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,694
I couldn't be more proud of him.

412
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,763
You know, children were killed.

413
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:13,599
I got to explain collateral damage to you?

414
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,534
We're in a war.

415
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:19,438
And in a war, there are gonna
be noncombatant casualties.

416
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:23,909
Okay.

417
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:28,547
What do you want?

418
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:31,817
There's got to be something you want.

419
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:35,354
You know when the police
department started to go south?

420
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,458
When they started letting minorities in.

421
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:42,494
Yes or no? You want to make a deal?

422
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,830
'Cause before, see, when
all the cops were white,

423
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,999
you could talk to them
like a normal person.

424
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,134
But you get a minority in there,

425
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:52,571
and there's all this resentment

426
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:57,009
from historical and personal shortcomings

427
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,677
that comes to the fore.

428
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:00,846
Now's their big chance

429
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,149
to get back at their oppressors.

430
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,961
You mean like this?

431
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:09,089
I don't care what you have to
do. No, you give me an exact time.

432
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:12,980
- I need it now.
- Halstead.

433
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:14,837
Yeah. Hold on.

434
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:16,685
I think everyone's gonna want to see this.

435
00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:20,845
Okay, okay, settle down.
Settle down. Hit it.

436
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,114
Ted Powell just posted this on a fringe

437
00:24:24,123 --> 00:24:25,736
anti-government website.

438
00:24:28,156 --> 00:24:29,912
In 2004,

439
00:24:30,032 --> 00:24:32,081
my family's home in Kankakee, Illinois...

440
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:34,812
we came under attack,
without justification,

441
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:37,383
by the Chicago police department.

442
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:40,904
We were fired upon, and our
home was engulfed in flames.

443
00:24:41,024 --> 00:24:44,081
The Chicago Fire department
stood by and did nothing.

444
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:49,274
My mother died that day,
and my father sits in prison.

445
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,703
I have waited ten years
for the C.P.D. and C.F.D.

446
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:57,141
to admit wrongdoing and to drop
all charges against my father.

447
00:24:57,174 --> 00:24:59,006
I will wait no longer.

448
00:24:59,258 --> 00:25:02,165
I'm declaring war on the
Chicago Police Department

449
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,014
and Chicago Fire Department.

450
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:06,854
If you are a member of either
department, you are not safe.

451
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,803
If you are a family member of
someone in either department,

452
00:25:09,854 --> 00:25:12,123
you are not safe.

453
00:25:13,107 --> 00:25:15,064
This is just the beginning.

454
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,527
You've been warned.

455
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:23,595
Yep, I got it. I'll call you back.

456
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:27,262
A Ryan Wilcox visited
Powell's dad in prison

457
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,630
three times in the last six months.

458
00:25:28,664 --> 00:25:29,865
Lindsay did a workup on him.

459
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:33,101
He's loosely affiliated with
various anti-government groups...

460
00:25:33,136 --> 00:25:34,603
explosives background
from a stint in the army.

461
00:25:34,637 --> 00:25:35,604
Jin, she was gonna to send you something.

462
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:36,805
Yeah, I got it.

463
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,107
Wilcox owns a garage in an industrial area

464
00:25:39,142 --> 00:25:40,809
where 96th meets the Calumet River.

465
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:43,044
All right, have Antonio and
Lindsay meet us at the garage.

466
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,946
You stay here. Feed us what we need.

467
00:25:44,981 --> 00:25:47,215
And keep Graff in the loop.

468
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,351
So you're saying zero chance?

469
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:56,358
Yes.

470
00:25:56,392 --> 00:25:58,460
Yes, Mr. Thelan, that's
what we're saying...

471
00:25:58,494 --> 00:25:59,461
Zero.

472
00:26:01,664 --> 00:26:04,332
But there's something you can do

473
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:08,703
that couldn't have been
done even 30 years ago.

474
00:26:08,738 --> 00:26:11,139
Your daughter's blood type is "O" negative.

475
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:14,042
That's a match for another girl
that got hit by the same blast

476
00:26:14,076 --> 00:26:17,112
with a ruptured liver, right down the hall.

477
00:26:19,148 --> 00:26:21,750
She's going to die if
she doesn't get a new one.

478
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:26,755
That'll be two 9-year-olds killed by...

479
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:28,590
something like this.

480
00:26:30,092 --> 00:26:33,295
Under normal circumstances,
you'd have time to work

481
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:36,164
with the state to donate
your daughter's organs.

482
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:39,434
Today...

483
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:43,705
I'm asking you to make a targeted donation.

484
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,641
If you agree...

485
00:26:46,676 --> 00:26:50,512
your daughter's death won't be meaningless.

486
00:26:50,546 --> 00:26:52,881
That...

487
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:58,887
that I know to be true.

488
00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:08,463
It's your decision, dad.

489
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:15,437
But if it were me...

490
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:16,705
let's let her go.

491
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:28,784
We need to know in minutes, not hours.

492
00:27:45,768 --> 00:27:48,837
Doctor...

493
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:51,273
Imogene would want this.

494
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:10,692
Is that people talking in there?

495
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:15,130
A radio's on.

496
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:24,740
It's positive for barium nitrate.

497
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:26,108
Let's try the roof.

498
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:29,044
All right, grab the fiber-optic.

499
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:36,084
Now, what happens if the plaster falls

500
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,185
and sets off the bomb?

501
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,655
You'll be the first to know.

502
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,257
- All right.
- Do your thing.

503
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:55,937
Front, side, rear door are all rigged.

504
00:28:55,972 --> 00:28:57,906
So is the roll-up.

505
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,909
Wires and 50-gallon
drums attached to each.

506
00:29:00,943 --> 00:29:04,112
Short version... do not breach.

507
00:29:04,147 --> 00:29:06,181
We could rappel down.

508
00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:11,787
All right, we don't need
the whole team going in.

509
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:13,121
I'll do it.

510
00:29:13,156 --> 00:29:15,257
I just took the class in the academy.

511
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,959
Aced it.

512
00:29:17,994 --> 00:29:19,127
Okay.

513
00:29:19,162 --> 00:29:21,063
All right, well, I need two.

514
00:29:21,097 --> 00:29:22,831
Any volunteers?

515
00:29:22,865 --> 00:29:24,499
You.

516
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:26,401
Don't turn on any lights.

517
00:29:26,436 --> 00:29:27,969
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

518
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:31,640
Come on. Let's do this.

519
00:29:39,515 --> 00:29:41,149
Clear.

520
00:29:51,394 --> 00:29:53,662
Ryan Wilcox is here...

521
00:29:53,696 --> 00:29:55,197
multiple gunshot wounds.

522
00:29:55,231 --> 00:29:57,899
How long's he been dead?

523
00:29:57,934 --> 00:30:00,702
- I'd say a day?
- Max.

524
00:30:00,737 --> 00:30:03,505
It's Powell tying up more loose ends.

525
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,507
They left a lot of stuff behind.

526
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:06,842
They never thought it'd be found.

527
00:30:06,876 --> 00:30:10,045
They figured this whole
block would be a crater.

528
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:16,551
Wilcox purchased a white
cargo van about two months ago.

529
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:22,491
There were three timing devices purchased.

530
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:25,560
I'm not a pessimist, but...

531
00:30:25,595 --> 00:30:27,095
There's a damn good shot

532
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,331
that there's a third car bomb
out there in a white cargo van.

533
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:32,434
If the second bomb was
supposed to go off at 8:30 P.M.,

534
00:30:32,468 --> 00:30:35,070
maybe the third bomb was set
to go off at that time as well.

535
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:37,673
- What time is it now?
- 7:55.

536
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:44,361
29 minutes and counting.

537
00:30:44,395 --> 00:30:45,662
I'm listening, but I don't hear dick.

538
00:30:45,696 --> 00:30:48,220
- Hospital parking lot?
- Fully vetted.

539
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:50,259
Blowing up a district would be too risky.

540
00:30:50,293 --> 00:30:51,894
A bomb would be sniffed out in seconds.

541
00:30:51,928 --> 00:30:54,229
- A firehouse?
- Not enough victims.

542
00:30:54,264 --> 00:30:56,799
Powell wanted high-ranking
police and firefighters dead.

543
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:58,500
Most of them planned on
attending the 10k gala.

544
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:00,736
Yeah, and where would the rest be tonight?

545
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,737
Headquarters.

546
00:31:01,771 --> 00:31:04,707
Bull's-eye.

547
00:31:10,213 --> 00:31:13,048
- You ready, Greta?
- Ready, doctor.

548
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:16,085
Let's have one good thing
come out of this day.

549
00:31:36,873 --> 00:31:38,073
Thank you.

550
00:31:54,324 --> 00:31:58,660
Be on the lookout for a
van near the front door.

551
00:31:58,695 --> 00:32:00,829
Jin, text everyone the photo

552
00:32:00,864 --> 00:32:02,531
and plate number of the van purchased.

553
00:32:02,565 --> 00:32:05,134
You're looking for a white econoline.

554
00:32:05,168 --> 00:32:06,368
Bomb squad en route.

555
00:32:06,403 --> 00:32:09,371
We should have made that left.

556
00:32:09,406 --> 00:32:13,709
Halstead, Lindsay,
those back roads pay off?

557
00:32:13,743 --> 00:32:15,778
Yeah, but traffic
patterns are all screwed up

558
00:32:15,812 --> 00:32:18,080
- because of the bombing.
- 15 minutes out.

559
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,452
Alvin, please, give me some good news.

560
00:32:27,323 --> 00:32:29,291
Alvin?

561
00:32:29,325 --> 00:32:31,126
Pulling up now.

562
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:34,963
- Any eyes on the vehicle?
- Not yet.

563
00:32:41,671 --> 00:32:45,274
We're sure this van is white?

564
00:33:08,632 --> 00:33:10,432
Vehicle located, south side entrance.

565
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:12,601
It's blue, not white... no tags.

566
00:33:12,636 --> 00:33:16,572
- 12 minutes.
- Jin, bomb squad update.

567
00:33:16,606 --> 00:33:17,973
Three blocks away.

568
00:33:18,008 --> 00:33:19,608
Hey, if Powell was at the hospital

569
00:33:19,643 --> 00:33:23,012
- because he likes to watch his handiwork...
- What's that?

570
00:33:23,046 --> 00:33:25,114
- Right there.
- Up top?

571
00:33:25,148 --> 00:33:28,183
- Yeah, right there. See?
- Hey, on the roof.

572
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:31,587
- What do we got?
- On the roof!

573
00:33:49,773 --> 00:33:52,841
- Freeze!
- Drop it!

574
00:33:52,876 --> 00:33:54,710
Get out! Get out of the building!

575
00:33:54,744 --> 00:33:56,011
Now! Go! Go! Go!

576
00:33:59,182 --> 00:34:01,016
Stairs.

577
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:09,024
He's going up.

578
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:18,901
There's Voight. Come on.

579
00:34:23,006 --> 00:34:24,239
Nine minutes!

580
00:34:24,274 --> 00:34:26,208
We think Powell is on
the apartment building!

581
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:28,043
In pursuit!

582
00:34:28,078 --> 00:34:31,580
There's the bomb squad!
You stay with the bomb!

583
00:34:33,717 --> 00:34:36,985
Hey!

584
00:34:37,053 --> 00:34:38,887
Officer Sumner, District 21.

585
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:42,091
Explosive is inside the van,
set to go off in 8 1/2 minutes.

586
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,359
All right, clear the area, please.

587
00:34:43,393 --> 00:34:46,962
Get back! Back! Move!

588
00:35:00,377 --> 00:35:02,011
Suspect's entered roof!

589
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:21,753
Drop your weapon!

590
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,688
Cover me.

591
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:38,670
You can't win! Drop your weapon!

592
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:40,004
Put it down!

593
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:43,074
I want him alive!

594
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:44,609
Aah!

595
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:48,980
Get up.

596
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:51,216
How many of your boys did
I put in the dirt today?

597
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:54,152
Any of 'em good friends?

598
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:57,655
You wanna watch?

599
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,023
- Watch it.
- No! No, no!

600
00:35:59,058 --> 00:36:00,325
Time check!

601
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,427
60 seconds!

602
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:10,368
Bomb dismantled.

603
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:13,171
Repeat... bomb dismantled.

604
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:14,372
Aah!

605
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:15,940
Plan failed.

606
00:36:15,975 --> 00:36:19,944
Actually, I think it was a pretty good day.

607
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:35,126
Aah!

608
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,631
That's good work tonight.

609
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:54,579
Voight.

610
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,548
Good working with you...

611
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:59,050
Or, uh, watching you work, I should say.

612
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:00,819
You too, sir.

613
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,226
Hey.

614
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,894
You all right?

615
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:11,763
Solid.

616
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:13,264
Tough guy.

617
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,252
Suction.

618
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,090
As a senior resident,

619
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:24,693
I was on call.

620
00:37:24,727 --> 00:37:28,463
I was working with the
chief trauma surgeon.

621
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:30,132
I knew he'd be the one deciding

622
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:34,236
if I got the coveted
trauma fellowship position.

623
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,472
About 9:00 P.M., we were up to
our eyeballs in trauma cases,

624
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:41,343
and I got a call that my
dad suffered a heart attack.

625
00:37:41,377 --> 00:37:43,245
Was rushed to another hospital.

626
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:47,015
Clamp.

627
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,584
I asked if I could leave
to be with my father.

628
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:50,819
He looked me in the eye and said,

629
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,087
"yeah, you can go,

630
00:37:52,121 --> 00:37:55,390
but you'll never get
the trauma fellowship."

631
00:37:55,425 --> 00:37:58,193
I couldn't believe how
insensitive this guy was.

632
00:37:58,227 --> 00:38:01,096
Heart rate 150. Pressure is dropping.

633
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,099
We saved 16 people that night,

634
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:07,002
but my dad passed away.

635
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:09,037
Heparinized saline.

636
00:38:12,108 --> 00:38:14,009
Removing proximal clamp.

637
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:16,411
80 systolic.

638
00:38:16,446 --> 00:38:19,381
76, 70.

639
00:38:19,415 --> 00:38:24,886
It's a day like today when I
understand why that surgeon did that.

640
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:26,922
This is the life we've chosen.

641
00:38:26,956 --> 00:38:30,158
And what we can do is right here and now.

642
00:38:30,193 --> 00:38:31,593
It's the most important thing.

643
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:36,632
And that is to try and
save this little girl.

644
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,976
The operation went as
well as could be expected.

645
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:25,547
There's, uh, good blood flow to the liver,

646
00:39:25,581 --> 00:39:27,683
and the other bleeding has stopped.

647
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:33,021
She's got a long road ahead of her,

648
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:35,090
but, uh, it's looking good.

649
00:39:51,741 --> 00:39:53,675
Where the fire department
is still working hard

650
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,611
to clean up the mess left by a bomb

651
00:39:55,645 --> 00:39:57,846
that went off at 8 o'clock this morning,

652
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,880
leaving 18 dead...

653
00:39:58,915 --> 00:40:01,650
How many survivors they pull out?

654
00:40:01,684 --> 00:40:03,485
I just heard over two dozen.

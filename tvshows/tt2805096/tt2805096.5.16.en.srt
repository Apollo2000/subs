1
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:09,776
Hey, Antonio.

2
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:11,244
Hey!

3
00:00:11,276 --> 00:00:13,112
- Hey.
- Hey.

4
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:14,346
Sorry.

5
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:16,148
Are you okay?

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,317
Yeah, yeah.

7
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:18,978
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Good.

8
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:20,753
- You good?
- Good, yeah, all good.

9
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,721
- Yeah.
- Are you going in?

10
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:24,924
Good, me too.

11
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:26,926
- Should we walk?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:28,195
Okay.

13
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:32,261
Well I for one am very glad
that we can be together

14
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:33,931
and it's not awkward.

15
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,899
Are you here for Platt's thing?

16
00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:38,144
'Cause I've never seen Mouch so excited

17
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:39,536
about anything in his whole life.

18
00:00:39,568 --> 00:00:41,572
He made a cinnamon roll casserole
for the occasion.

19
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:43,239
What the hell's that?

20
00:00:43,273 --> 00:00:45,876
What's the big deal, man?
Just do me this favor.

21
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:48,579
I'm not live tweeting
a threeminute conversation.

22
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:50,913
It's a threeminute conversation.

23
00:00:50,946 --> 00:00:52,983
Local access, Mouch, I mean...

24
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:54,493
Who do you propose
is going to be tuning in

25
00:00:54,517 --> 00:00:55,551
for these live tweets?

26
00:00:55,584 --> 00:00:57,119
What are you doing here?

27
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:58,898
I thought PD was having
their own viewing party.

28
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:00,190
She's on in 30 minutes.

29
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:01,992
As much as I love Trudy.
I'm here for Eva.

30
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:04,060
- You guys seen her?
- She's down there with Gabby.

31
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:07,063
Third door on the left.

32
00:01:07,096 --> 00:01:08,197
There you go, Rapunzel.

33
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,498
Get your stuff. We're going.

34
00:01:09,532 --> 00:01:11,000
What? Why?

35
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:12,211
You said I could hang
with Aunt Gabby all day.

36
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:13,604
Yeah, she can. She's fine.

37
00:01:13,637 --> 00:01:15,205
You're not staying. You're grounded.

38
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:16,873
No more phone. No social media.

39
00:01:16,907 --> 00:01:19,310
- Let's go.
- What? What did I do?

40
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,182
All right, that's not
what it looks like.

41
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:27,950
- I can explain.
- Is that not your profile?

42
00:01:27,983 --> 00:01:29,920
- No, it is, but it's not...
- Under a fake name

43
00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:31,520
- so I can't monitor it.
- No.

44
00:01:31,554 --> 00:01:33,123
It's just a second account.

45
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:34,533
It's the one I use at my friends...

46
00:01:34,557 --> 00:01:36,626
It's the account where
you posted a dozen pictures

47
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,595
of yourself partying and drinking.

48
00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:41,164
I did not post any of those.

49
00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:44,034
- Last weekend... Hey!
- That was...

50
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:45,669
Last weekend when you told me

51
00:01:45,702 --> 00:01:49,072
you were studying late at Taryn's house.

52
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:51,974
- Did you not tell me that?
- I...

53
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:54,010
Go get your stuff.

54
00:01:54,643 --> 00:01:57,113
Don't look at her. Go.

55
00:01:58,148 --> 00:02:00,517
Eva, give me your phone.

56
00:02:04,086 --> 00:02:06,122
You know you look just like Dad, right?

57
00:02:06,155 --> 00:02:08,190
You even got that
forehead vein thing going.

58
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:09,459
That's papa.

59
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:13,029
Come on. Let's go.

60
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:16,132
Later, Eva.

61
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:18,534
Every single person
I know has two profiles.

62
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:20,003
It's just for privacy.

63
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:21,538
That's not privacy. That's hiding.

64
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,648
You're making those photos
into something they're not.

65
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:25,207
You can't trust the Internet, Dad.

66
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:26,944
It always looks worse than it is.

67
00:02:26,976 --> 00:02:29,313
If you would just
let me explain it to you

68
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:31,682
instead of you seizing
my phone without cause.

69
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:33,983
Platt's on in two. Everyone! Adam!

70
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:35,618
- Antonio, come on.
- We're not staying.

71
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:37,028
I'm gonna do the paperwork at home.

72
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:38,421
Hey, Eva. What's up, kid?

73
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:39,989
My father's a fascist.

74
00:02:40,022 --> 00:02:42,358
Okay, I don't know what to do with that.

75
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:44,360
Okay, everybody be quiet.

76
00:02:44,393 --> 00:02:45,361
Platt's on TV.

77
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:47,130
Betty's sitting down to discuss

78
00:02:47,163 --> 00:02:48,432
the new friendly face

79
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:49,533
of the Chicago PD

80
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:51,033
with Sergeant Trudy Platt.

81
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:52,143
- What friendly face is that?
- Betty.

82
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:53,369
Thank you, Sheri.

83
00:02:53,403 --> 00:02:55,304
I'm so excited to be here today

84
00:02:55,338 --> 00:02:58,241
with Sergeant Trudy Platt
from the 21st District...

85
00:02:58,273 --> 00:03:00,242
She couldn't possibly
hate this any more.

86
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:02,244
Thank you so much
for coming this morning.

87
00:03:02,278 --> 00:03:05,282
It's my pleasure.
I'm hap... I'm happy to be here.

88
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:07,483
This is like Christmas.

89
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:09,618
Those photos don't show
what you think they do.

90
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:12,221
Okay, we did go to Taryn's
house, and then we got a call

91
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:14,291
- from Becca that she needed...
- Eva, stop!

92
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:15,667
You put your whole life on that thing.

93
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:17,027
I don't need you to explain.

94
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:18,270
I can see exactly what you're doing

95
00:03:18,294 --> 00:03:20,330
and who you are. And you know what?

96
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:22,199
I don't like
who you've become very much.

97
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:24,266
In the neighborhoods that they serve.

98
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,403
Combating crime problems together

99
00:03:26,435 --> 00:03:28,571
along with...

100
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:31,340
- Is everything okay?
- I think that's coming

101
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:34,344
- from my office.
- What was that?

102
00:04:04,673 --> 00:04:06,176
Hey, Officer.

103
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,810
Sergeant Hank Voight.

104
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:09,346
There's no command post set yet?

105
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,114
- No, sir. Not yet.
- Okay.

106
00:04:11,147 --> 00:04:12,449
- What's your name?
- Joey.

107
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:14,151
- Mendez. Officer Mendez.
- Okay, listen.

108
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:15,718
You know how to set up cordon, Mendez?

109
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,119
All right, good.

110
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:18,288
I want you to establish it

111
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:19,756
around a threeblock radius.

112
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:21,223
No one in or out

113
00:04:21,256 --> 00:04:23,059
- except first responders and victims.
- Yeah.

114
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:24,302
All right, you set up a holding area.

115
00:04:24,326 --> 00:04:25,538
- Excuse me.
- Get everyone's info.

116
00:04:25,562 --> 00:04:27,264
No one leaves if you don't know 'em.

117
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:28,832
You got it? Go.

118
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:31,535
Trudy!

119
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:32,802
- Trudy!
- Sarge!

120
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:34,336
Seven minutes since the explosion.

121
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:36,372
Fire has no reads on gas meters.

122
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:39,141
And we haven't heard from Platt yet.

123
00:05:10,906 --> 00:05:13,209
Betty? Betty?

124
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:15,379
Betty.

125
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:29,292
Sheri?

126
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:32,761
Sheri? Sheri?

127
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:34,730
Hey, it's going to be okay.

128
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:40,437
Sheri. Sheri.

129
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:44,208
Sheri, stay with me. Come on.

130
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:51,614
It's okay, Sheri.

131
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:03,193
The exits are blocked.

132
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,728
We can't get upstairs.

133
00:06:05,761 --> 00:06:07,663
We'll go in here.

134
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:11,534
Come on.

135
00:06:20,742 --> 00:06:23,480
Sheri, are you still with me?

136
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,382
Sheri.

137
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:27,384
Come on, girl. Stay with me.

138
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,804
Stay with me, Sheri.

139
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:54,543
Come on, girl.

140
00:06:57,847 --> 00:06:59,316
Okay, girl.

141
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:01,985
Breathe. Breathe.

142
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:34,817
- Breathe, honey.
- Fire department. Call out!

143
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:38,788
Here!

144
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:40,990
Here.

145
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:42,324
Trudy? Trudy.

146
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:43,386
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

147
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:44,394
- Get her.
- You okay?

148
00:07:44,427 --> 00:07:46,563
I'm okay. Get her.

149
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:50,599
- I got her, I got her.
- Okay.

150
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:52,736
- You're okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

151
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:54,370
- Cruz is right behind me.
- Okay.

152
00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:55,614
He's covering the front entrance.

153
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:57,007
Okay.

154
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,575
Stay with us, Sheri. Okay.

155
00:07:58,607 --> 00:07:59,884
- Hey, you good to go?
- Yeah, I'm good to go.

156
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:01,343
- You sure?
- Good to go.

157
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:02,588
All right, just follow me, stay low.

158
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:04,014
I'm gonna get you back to Cruz.

159
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:05,357
He's gonna take you upstairs, okay?

160
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:06,621
- Yeah.
- All right, let's move.

161
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:10,886
Stay with us, Sheri. Here we go.

162
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,756
Medic!

163
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:14,556
I need a medic!

164
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,691
Trudy!

165
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:18,428
I'm okay.

166
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:20,062
Sheri's wounds are from bolts and nails.

167
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:22,280
This was a bombing.
First the timer sounded.

168
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:24,033
Less than 30 seconds later,
the explosion.

169
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:26,569
All right, get on the zone.
Get 1800 on the scene.

170
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:28,713
We need Bomb and Arson sweeping
for secondary devices.

171
00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:29,738
Copy that.

172
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:31,516
- You sure you're okay?
- Go, go, go, go, go.

173
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,717
- She had a pulse.
- Okay, we got it.

174
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:34,086
It was steady. She should be okay.

175
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,644
Platt. Platt, Platt! We got it.

176
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:37,322
- It's fine.
- Sheri, you're gonna be okay.

177
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:39,283
Trudy!

178
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:42,852
- What the hell happened?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

179
00:08:42,884 --> 00:08:44,687
- I am. I'm okay.
- Come on, come on.

180
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,922
- Medic! Give me a blanket.
- Yep.

181
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:48,325
No, ma'am.

182
00:08:48,358 --> 00:08:49,659
Don't try and speak. We got you.

183
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:52,328
- We're going to the hospital.
- Must talk to...

184
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:54,063
Don't try and speak.

185
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:56,533
I won't go.

186
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:58,401
- Must talk to cop.
- Okay, ma'am, all right.

187
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:00,035
- We're gonna get you a cop.
- No.

188
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:01,538
- No.
- Antonio.

189
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:02,847
- Need a cop!
- She won't let us leave

190
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:04,549
until she talks to a cop.
We don't have time.

191
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:06,075
- We got to move.
- I'll come.

192
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:07,711
No.

193
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,715
Let's go. Let's go.

194
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:19,121
Ma'am, you understand
that by continuing to speak

195
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:20,365
you're putting yourself at risk?

196
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:21,457
I don't recommend it.

197
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,991
- Talk.
- I'm here.

198
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:24,827
I'm here. I'm here.

199
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,462
I'm Antonio Dawson.

200
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:28,497
I'm a detective with
the Chicago Police Department.

201
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:30,467
Listen, we don't have to talk right now.

202
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:31,835
I want...

203
00:09:31,868 --> 00:09:35,038
I wanna... I want to talk.

204
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:37,106
Okay, okay. Okay.

205
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:39,441
There...

206
00:09:39,475 --> 00:09:42,479
was a pa... package...

207
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:45,114
- for me.
- A package?

208
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:49,886
I think it was... the... the bomb.

209
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,856
You think there was a bomb
in the package?

210
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:55,124
For you?

211
00:09:55,158 --> 00:09:59,495
It was delivered to my... my office.

212
00:09:59,528 --> 00:10:01,597
Okay, okay, okay.

213
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,665
I've been threatened.

214
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:06,502
Do you know who sent it?

215
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:08,004
Antonio, her heart rate's going up.

216
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:11,608
No, but there was a man

217
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,176
who I... I've already seen.

218
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,745
- Okay.
- 40s.

219
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:19,047
Beard. He...

220
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:20,682
Move.

221
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:22,485
What can I do? How can I help?

222
00:10:22,518 --> 00:10:23,854
Put pressure on her neck.

223
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:28,557
There's a lot of blood coming up.

224
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,528
Hey. Hey, Sheri, you hear me?

225
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:33,930
Sheri? Stay with me, Sheri!

226
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,211
All right, we got the initial
report from Bomb and Arson.

227
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:40,637
It was a single device.

228
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:42,038
Cardboard box in Sheri's office.

229
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:43,639
IED, nails, glass.

230
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:45,216
We're lucky no one
was standing closer, Sarge.

231
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,143
Sheri was pronounced at Med.

232
00:10:47,176 --> 00:10:48,778
She...

233
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:50,613
Injuries were too substantial.

234
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:52,181
Two others are in critical condition,

235
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:53,917
but they're both suspected
to pull through.

236
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,793
There was a dozen more victims
but as of right now

237
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:57,696
it looks like Sheri and Betty
are our only fatalities.

238
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,889
That bomb was planted in Sheri's office.

239
00:10:59,922 --> 00:11:01,057
She had to be the target.

240
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,059
She was getting threats too.

241
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:04,760
We recovered four emails all sent

242
00:11:04,793 --> 00:11:06,228
from an anonymous email account.

243
00:11:06,262 --> 00:11:08,465
Bounced around about a half dozen IPs.

244
00:11:08,498 --> 00:11:09,833
They're all death threats.

245
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:11,476
"Burn, bitch, burn.
Your days are numbered.

246
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,535
"You will burn." That sort of thing.

247
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:15,637
All right, so what do
we know about Sheri?

248
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:17,674
She's 26 years old, Northwestern grad,

249
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:19,609
started working
for the station as an intern.

250
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:20,952
She'd been on the air for two months.

251
00:11:20,976 --> 00:11:23,545
Single, wellliked.
Al's with the family.

252
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,014
Trying to track the package.

253
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:26,850
Cameras at the entrances of the building

254
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:28,785
only captured a man from behind.

255
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:32,087
It's not much, but given that
and what Sheri gave us

256
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,923
I pulled these pod photos.

257
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:37,559
Could be the same guy

258
00:11:37,592 --> 00:11:39,528
if he ditches the jacket and the hat.

259
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:41,230
This guy exits the newsroom at 8:42 a.m.

260
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:43,966
Half hour later a pod
picks him up across the street.

261
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,110
It's eight minutes after the
bombing and he's still there.

262
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:47,269
Like, he stayed.

263
00:11:47,302 --> 00:11:48,971
He matches Sheri's description.

264
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:50,581
Yeah, but it's not enough
for visual recognition.

265
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:52,075
Okay, let's release it to the media.

266
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:54,244
It's a person of interest.
Set up a tip line.

267
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:56,546
Are we sure that's the plan?

268
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,548
We got two pictures
of a guy in the vicinity.

269
00:11:58,581 --> 00:11:59,883
That's it.

270
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:02,159
That can go wrong a thousand ways

271
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:03,819
if the public has it.

272
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,056
I still have Sheri's blood on me.

273
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,768
You asking me, it's worth the risk.

274
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,860
Someone's gonna know who this guy is.

275
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,736
I'll get on the packs with news affairs.

276
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,538
Have them release it.

277
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:25,041
We got something.

278
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:26,585
I interviewed the guard who was working

279
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:27,977
the front desk at the news room.

280
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:30,045
He says everyone has
to sign in to get inside.

281
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,889
He only remembers one delivery
from this morning

282
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:33,658
and he was on the phone
when the guy came in.

283
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:35,652
But he swears he was white
and he had a beard.

284
00:12:35,685 --> 00:12:36,827
This guy's stopped by security

285
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:38,254
before he delivered the bomb?

286
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:40,023
This guy...

287
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:41,824
signed his name in the inout book.

288
00:12:41,856 --> 00:12:44,059
Eric Mitchel, he's a journalist

289
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:45,928
at a local entertainment magazine.

290
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:49,032
35, white, beard.

291
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:50,901
Bring him in.

292
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:54,970
- Nice house for a journalist.
- Yeah.

293
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:57,005
I thought journalism was
supposed to be extinct.

294
00:12:57,038 --> 00:12:58,073
Depends what kind.

295
00:12:58,106 --> 00:12:59,308
Still have a lot of money

296
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:01,043
if you make the news entertainment.

297
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:04,046
Hey, is that Mitchel?

298
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:08,617
Yeah, those are his plates.

299
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,085
SUV is Mitchel.

300
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:11,921
So we're gonna approach
on foot, distract him.

301
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:13,723
You guys come up behind him.

302
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:15,759
Copy. We're moving in now.

303
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:25,802
Looks like he shaved his beard.

304
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:29,605
- Eric Mitchel.
- Yeah?

305
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:34,753
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

306
00:13:34,777 --> 00:13:35,845
All right, call it in.

307
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:37,946
5021 Henry. Emergency.

308
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,882
- We have an explosion at...
- You guys good?

309
00:13:39,914 --> 00:13:41,817
- Yeah, you?
- We got to get him covered up.

310
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,285
Ambulance, CFD, Bomb and Arson.

311
00:13:43,318 --> 00:13:44,820
Could be multiple devices.

312
00:13:44,854 --> 00:13:46,230
Make sure they block off
a twoblock radius.

313
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:48,306
The entire blast hit him
head on. He's gone.

314
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:50,059
Hey. I saw it happen.

315
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:51,827
- I was right over there.
- Sir, I need you to step back.

316
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:53,171
- Can I help?
- Yeah, I know you want to help

317
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:54,639
- but I need you to stand back.
- What can I do?

318
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:56,699
Thank you.

319
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,429
Okay, Bomb and Arson confirmed

320
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:10,257
the bomb was wired to the mailbox door.

321
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:12,457
It's possible someone saw
the bomb being planted.

322
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:14,434
Area Central and Patrol are
canvassing the neighborhood.

323
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,057
We're running pods against surveillance

324
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:17,237
but so far we've got nothing.

325
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:18,835
We know Eric Mitchel's not our bomber

326
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,777
being we just watched him get blown up.

327
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:22,567
What the hell are we looking at?

328
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:24,284
This son of a bitch led us there.

329
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:25,377
He's screwing with us.

330
00:14:25,402 --> 00:14:26,479
He signed in using the name of

331
00:14:26,503 --> 00:14:27,938
his next target so we'd follow.

332
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:31,410
That's right. This is not
an isolated incident.

333
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:34,680
Okay? This could be the start
of a bombing campaign.

334
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:36,982
This guy's got an agenda.

335
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:39,050
All right, what do we know
about Eric Mitchel.

336
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,819
Well, he worked in media 15 years.

337
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:42,554
Journalist at an entertainment magazine.

338
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:44,689
There's no evidence
of death threats against him,

339
00:14:44,723 --> 00:14:46,000
but that doesn't mean
that it didn't happen

340
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:47,426
over the phone or facetoface.

341
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,694
Bomb and Arson and Homicide

342
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:50,761
are digging up more as we speak.

343
00:14:50,795 --> 00:14:54,466
Seriously, if one more person
asks me if I'm okay

344
00:14:54,498 --> 00:14:55,833
they are not gonna be okay.

345
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,569
I just want to help.

346
00:14:57,602 --> 00:14:58,970
And we'll take it.

347
00:14:59,002 --> 00:15:01,573
Bomb and Arson's got an update.

348
00:15:01,606 --> 00:15:02,874
I'll come with.

349
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:04,343
Okay, so we're gonna go

350
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:06,011
- with what we got, okay?
- I'm okay.

351
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:07,679
- Okay.
- The bombs themselves,

352
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:09,848
the IDs of these two victims.

353
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:11,449
We know they're both in the media.

354
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:13,551
There's some connection
between these two.

355
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:15,554
There's a reason they were targeted.

356
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:18,790
So let's find the damn nexus
before another bomb goes off.

357
00:15:18,823 --> 00:15:20,759
Come on, Trudy. I'll give you an update.

358
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,860
I'm talking clean.

359
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:24,863
This isn't some teenage wank
screwing around

360
00:15:24,896 --> 00:15:26,798
with his dad's Home Depot account.

361
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,567
The wires, the initiators,
the circuit board,

362
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:31,937
the soldering alone on these things.

363
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:33,771
It's by someone who knew
what they were doing.

364
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:35,373
Took their time to do it.

365
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,675
Devices were personalized

366
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,443
based on the location he was hitting.

367
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:41,146
The first device was an IED
relying on a time switch.

368
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,615
It was created to invoke
as much damage as possible

369
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:44,982
within an enclosed space.

370
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:47,151
The ball bearings, the nails, the bolts.

371
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:49,487
Plus enough gasoline
to spread hefty fire.

372
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:51,857
All right, so that's
different from our second?

373
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,159
The second is a victimactivated IED.

374
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:56,394
It was triggered when Mitchel
opened up his mailbox.

375
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:58,830
So two different models but
you're saying this is one guy?

376
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:00,898
Yeah, it's the exact same materials,

377
00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:02,633
same signature. It's like handwriting.

378
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,044
Same brain built both of these things.

379
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:06,103
Okay, so these bolts,
the nails, the wires

380
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:07,772
the gasoline even, I can purchase

381
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:09,083
that stuff at a hardware store, right?

382
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:11,776
You could but you couldn't buy the C4.

383
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:16,381
Both bombs used militarygrade C4.

384
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:19,050
All right, you can't buy
that kind of C4

385
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,161
over the counter, and the
military keeps strict records

386
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:23,030
- on theft and storage.
- It had to be either stolen

387
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:24,656
or bought on the black market.

388
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:25,900
I'm digging at an angle with ATF.

389
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:27,200
Yeah, rest of the bomb components

390
00:16:27,224 --> 00:16:28,902
are gonna be hard to track.
They're generic.

391
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:30,170
- Sold in hundreds of stores.
- All right.

392
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:31,963
Where are we at with the connection?

393
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:34,665
Nowhere. Eric and Sheri
never worked together.

394
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:36,209
They never reported on the same story.

395
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:37,911
There's no evidence they really
even knew each other.

396
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:39,805
Antonio, your tip line
sparked something,

397
00:16:39,838 --> 00:16:41,206
but we got to move fast.

398
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:43,774
Somebody called in,
identified the pod photos.

399
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:45,843
Mark Tremon. Height, weight.

400
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:48,045
Match everything the tech lab
already told us about.

401
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,614
He worked security at
the news station for two years

402
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:51,816
and he went to Illinois State

403
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:53,551
the same time Eric Mitchel did.

404
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:55,061
That's the nexus between our victims,

405
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:57,621
but that's not even the crazy part.

406
00:16:57,655 --> 00:16:58,990
He's army, Sarge.

407
00:16:59,022 --> 00:17:01,726
Did a tour in Iraq. EOD.

408
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,095
Explosive Ordinance Disposal.

409
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:07,499
All right, you two round robin?

410
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:08,942
Burgess and Ruzek are already
headed to his house,

411
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:10,468
but we need to move

412
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:11,978
because the Internet is blowing him up.

413
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:13,046
They already ID'd the photos.

414
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,238
He gonna see us coming.

415
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:15,506
I'll meet them there.

416
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,475
- Nice work.
- Yeah.

417
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:19,119
Our phone's been ringing off the hook.

418
00:17:19,143 --> 00:17:20,846
We just need to bring your husband in

419
00:17:20,878 --> 00:17:22,222
- to ask a few questions.
- What is all that?

420
00:17:22,246 --> 00:17:23,990
Ma'am, your husband.
Do you know where he is?

421
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:25,258
We're not giving you consent
to enter our home.

422
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:26,717
Sir, can you step outside, please?

423
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:27,953
No, I'm not stepping anywhere.

424
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:29,186
What the hell is going on?

425
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,889
I want to see both of your hands!

426
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:32,089
You got to be kidding me.

427
00:17:32,123 --> 00:17:33,592
Get away from my daughter!

428
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,693
Just come through, baby.

429
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:35,993
She can come through.

430
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:37,662
Don't put your hands on my daughter.

431
00:17:37,694 --> 00:17:39,105
- Sir, can you...
- Let her... Hey, man!

432
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:41,232
Hey! Hey! Don't touch my daughter!

433
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:43,601
- Dad, dad!
- Hey, don't touch my daughter.

434
00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:45,036
Don't touch my daughter!

435
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:46,204
- No!
- Get off of me!

436
00:17:46,236 --> 00:17:47,671
- Calm down!
- Get off me!

437
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:50,775
- It's all right, baby.
- You're fine.

438
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:52,010
It's all right, baby.

439
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:53,544
- You got his hands?
- Get off me.

440
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:57,549
I don't want him here.

441
00:17:57,581 --> 00:17:59,283
Okay.

442
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:03,521
I got to tell you though,
this room you're in?

443
00:18:03,554 --> 00:18:06,991
It's not a place you get a lot
of things you want.

444
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:08,302
I mean, you know why you're here, right?

445
00:18:08,326 --> 00:18:09,895
I've already been interviewed twice.

446
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:11,530
Two of your detectives.

447
00:18:11,562 --> 00:18:13,264
Well you're gonna talk to me now.

448
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:14,799
I'm here because of you.

449
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:16,166
Police tweet out a picture of me.

450
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,911
Push me to the ground,
put me in this chair...

451
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:21,071
You're here 'cause of them.

452
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:24,276
Three bombing victims, one day.

453
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:28,880
I told your officers,
I was at that news station

454
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:30,815
to get someone to fill out
a form of reference.

455
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,082
Yeah, well the problem is

456
00:18:32,116 --> 00:18:34,152
we can't find any evidence of that.

457
00:18:34,184 --> 00:18:37,289
You don't have the form,
and no one remembers.

458
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:39,089
I threw it out!

459
00:18:39,123 --> 00:18:40,859
I walked in there.
Old boss wasn't there.

460
00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:43,194
So I walked out.

461
00:18:43,226 --> 00:18:44,772
The Internet tells you I'm some villain

462
00:18:44,796 --> 00:18:46,197
and you believe it?

463
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,966
I'm a regular guy.

464
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:50,035
You're not a regular guy.

465
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:51,636
You're a guy who was at the scene

466
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:54,071
of an explosion that was cordoned off.

467
00:18:54,105 --> 00:18:56,575
Do you know what a police cordon is?

468
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:59,010
All witnesses and civilians
go into holding,

469
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:01,178
and you weren't in holding,
which means you bypassed

470
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:02,781
the police department cordon.

471
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:04,091
I had to get back home to my kid.

472
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:06,952
You're a guy who knew Sheri,

473
00:19:06,984 --> 00:19:08,587
knew Eric.

474
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:11,055
- Who the hell is Eric?
- He went to ISU with you.

475
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:12,857
What? I went to school for like a month.

476
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:14,358
That's access to both our victims.

477
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:17,662
- This is bull...
- And you were EOD.

478
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:18,963
Excuse me?

479
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:21,231
You know IEDs!

480
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:23,532
Right?

481
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:25,593
You defused them.

482
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,838
I'll bet you can make them.

483
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:32,643
- Give me a lawyer.
- The more you talk to us

484
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:34,798
- the easier it is...
- Get me a damn lawyer.

485
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,415
All right, tell me we got something

486
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,849
'cause Mark ain't talking

487
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:45,349
and we don't have enough to charge.

488
00:19:45,374 --> 00:19:46,452
Well, the nexus between Mark

489
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,772
and the victims is real,

490
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:50,001
but it's just not tight enough
to connect him to Eric.

491
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:51,401
Outside of ISU,

492
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:52,737
there's no real link.

493
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:54,304
All right, what about the C4?

494
00:19:54,337 --> 00:19:56,506
ATF's report says this
particular batch of C4

495
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:57,774
was made six years ago.

496
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,668
Multiple blocks were reported stolen

497
00:19:59,702 --> 00:20:01,738
from the manufacturer in 2012.

498
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:03,705
2012?

499
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:05,708
So we're six years behind the lead.

500
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:07,944
No, I got a guy in ATF.
I'll catch us up.

501
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:10,612
Do we have anything I can use
as leverage on this guy?

502
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:12,382
Mark's got a DUI from last year.

503
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,450
He chewed out the arresting officer.

504
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:15,717
He's an angry guy.

505
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:16,953
But a lot of people are angry,

506
00:20:16,985 --> 00:20:18,288
especially after a few beers.

507
00:20:18,313 --> 00:20:19,748
Doesn't mean they build bombs.

508
00:20:19,773 --> 00:20:21,456
Look, if we're not finding anything

509
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,168
then maybe we're looking
in the wrong place.

510
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:25,828
This guy's house was cleared
of any bombmaking materials.

511
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,405
And the security guard
at the news station

512
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:28,873
said he couldn't pick
him out of a line up.

513
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:30,174
To be fair, the guard at the station

514
00:20:30,198 --> 00:20:31,833
doubted he could ID the guy at all.

515
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:33,010
He said he didn't get a good look.

516
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:34,803
And Mark has no explanation

517
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:36,628
why he stood outside
the bombing for eight minutes.

518
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,354
Mark's got
a distinguished service cross.

519
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:39,450
You know that doesn't mean anything.

520
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:40,978
It means he fought
for the country and it means

521
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:42,444
I give him the benefit
of the doubt, all right?

522
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:44,079
Maybe we're looking in the wrong place.

523
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:45,891
I think these connections
seem pretty strained.

524
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:47,884
- Jay, look...
- All right.

525
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,986
Then cement or clear them.

526
00:20:52,954 --> 00:20:55,124
Do a psychological autopsy on Mark.

527
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:56,893
Anyone he's talked to in the last week.

528
00:20:56,925 --> 00:20:59,529
Anyone who can speak to his behavior.

529
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:00,896
Copy that.

530
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:03,699
If Mark is our man,
someone's gonna know it.

531
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:08,670
What's all that?

532
00:21:08,704 --> 00:21:10,071
Tracking Mark on social media.

533
00:21:10,105 --> 00:21:11,783
A lot of people coming
out the woodwork saying

534
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,017
they saw it coming, and so I'm trying

535
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,743
to verify if any of it's true.

536
00:21:14,777 --> 00:21:17,013
- And?
- So far, nothing.

537
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:19,782
Trolls jumping on the bandwagon.

538
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:21,717
People love to watch things burn.

539
00:21:28,223 --> 00:21:31,092
Yeah, Mark's phone records
indicate that we're friends

540
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:32,194
'cause we are.

541
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:34,196
You worked at WNMZ together, yeah?

542
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,999
I was there for a month.
Didn't work out.

543
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:38,800
Look, guys, I can't do
anything to help you.

544
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,168
And I'm at my job.

545
00:21:40,202 --> 00:21:41,947
We're an hour late getting
this shipment out.

546
00:21:41,971 --> 00:21:43,806
Okay, well, we just
got a few quick questions

547
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:45,049
and then you can do your thing, dawg.

548
00:21:45,073 --> 00:21:46,485
Did you talk to Mark at all this week?

549
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:48,176
About his bike.

550
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,812
And his kid.

551
00:21:49,845 --> 00:21:51,981
Okay, did he seem off to you at all?

552
00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:54,550
Was his behavior different in any way?

553
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:56,862
Did he seem like he was gonna
blow up a couple of buildings?

554
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:58,820
No, he didn't.

555
00:21:58,854 --> 00:22:01,090
Mark gets hot, but he's not hard.

556
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:02,959
He never even talked to that news lady.

557
00:22:02,992 --> 00:22:04,694
If anything, he protected her.

558
00:22:04,726 --> 00:22:06,528
He tried to protect Sheri, you saw this?

559
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:08,563
Look, some guy came in
to talked to Sheri.

560
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:10,966
He was all jacked up
and screaming about something

561
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,103
she wrote or some news blog
or gossip blog or something,

562
00:22:14,136 --> 00:22:16,939
and Mark forced him from the building.

563
00:22:16,972 --> 00:22:19,775
Okay, when was this
and what did he look like?

564
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:21,577
It was a white guy, about my age.

565
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:23,146
I think he had a beard.

566
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:27,483
- Okay.
- Thank you.

567
00:22:28,884 --> 00:22:30,720
What are you doing?

568
00:22:30,752 --> 00:22:32,821
Giving Shuman a bathroom break?

569
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:34,766
How is it every time I give
Shuman desk assignment

570
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,626
his bladder fails him? Hey, Wallace.

571
00:22:36,658 --> 00:22:39,127
You know, if there was ever
a day to take off

572
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,564
it would be the day after
someone tried to blow you up.

573
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:44,834
You could take a day, you know.
Get your hair done.

574
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:47,069
- What's wrong with my hair?
- Not a thing.

575
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:50,005
Not a thing. Just something people do.

576
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,016
Like my grandmother, she takes
a day and get her hair done.

577
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,208
Not that I am in anyway...

578
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:54,549
- Referring to you as my grand...
- Burgess, Burgess.

579
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,609
Burgess!

580
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:59,115
Everyone!

581
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:01,283
Don't key your radios.
Don't touch your phones.

582
00:23:01,317 --> 00:23:03,019
Burgess, I want you to go downstairs

583
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:05,655
shackle up the prisoners
and lead them outside.

584
00:23:05,687 --> 00:23:06,821
I'll evacuate upstairs.

585
00:23:06,855 --> 00:23:09,559
We need to clear the district now.

586
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:19,068
Device has been defused.

587
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,637
We're doing a sweep
for any secondary devices.

588
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:22,948
We'll get you in as soon as we can.

589
00:23:22,972 --> 00:23:24,574
Do we know what it was?

590
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:26,175
Some cheap, crude IED.

591
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:28,076
I don't think the thing
would have gone off.

592
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:30,012
That doesn't fit with our offender.

593
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:31,680
It does and it doesn't.

594
00:23:31,713 --> 00:23:33,182
Same material. Same signature.

595
00:23:33,214 --> 00:23:34,817
We'll investigate the components,

596
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:36,651
but this is him.

597
00:23:36,685 --> 00:23:38,588
Just built this one fast.

598
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,556
Get you in as soon as we can.

599
00:23:41,823 --> 00:23:43,625
Built it fast.

600
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:45,227
We pissed him off.

601
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:51,294
He gave us a lead. Let's not waste it.

602
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,413
- That device came from somewhere.
- Just give me a second.

603
00:23:53,437 --> 00:23:55,458
All right, we're at a zero
with delivery.

604
00:23:55,483 --> 00:23:57,138
The device was delivered and mailed

605
00:23:57,163 --> 00:23:59,413
from a UPS store by a private shipper.

606
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,849
The order for pickup was made online

607
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,675
with a prepaid money card.
Yeah, I'm back.

608
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,344
Customer requested the box be picked up

609
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:06,045
at a residential address on Sheirdan.

610
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,913
- House is vacant.
- Check the deeds.

611
00:24:07,938 --> 00:24:10,553
Run every single property owner
in the past two decades.

612
00:24:10,578 --> 00:24:12,244
- Yeah.
- Box and device are being

613
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,364
rushed through for DNA,
but it was wiped with bleach.

614
00:24:14,388 --> 00:24:15,755
Bomb squad said same materials

615
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,191
as our other two devices.

616
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:18,325
It's generic, store bought.

617
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:19,560
We'd be running down deadends.

618
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:20,694
Well, run them anyway.

619
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:21,871
We don't assume anything is dead

620
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:23,531
- until we pronounce it.
- Hey.

621
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:27,433
I got copies of the note
that was on the packing slip.

622
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,570
"Once again an innocent man blown up

623
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:30,837
"by the engine of fake news.

624
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,339
"The CPD, further perpetrators

625
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,908
of the fake news engine will burn."

626
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,676
He's talking about Mark.

627
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,312
The security guard?

628
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:39,846
Mark's got to be the innocent man.

629
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,849
"Once again." "Once again." I mean...

630
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,358
He's referring to fake news as if it's

631
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,186
blown up someone close to him before.

632
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:47,321
- It's personal.
- Found it.

633
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,756
The gossip blog Mark's friend mentioned.

634
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,859
Sheri never officially worked for one.

635
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:53,726
But there was a blog.
"The Chicago Scoop."

636
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,530
It was active Sheri's last
two years a Northwestern.

637
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,765
The site reported on gossip, scandal,

638
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,367
anything that was pulltherug worthy.

639
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,937
Whole thing was anonymous,
but the historical data,

640
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:06,273
IPs, it was Sheri. She ran it.

641
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:07,975
Sheri wrote a story there

642
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,210
that tore someone's life apart.

643
00:25:10,244 --> 00:25:12,679
And Eric reported on that same story.

644
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:14,815
I mean, that would fit.

645
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,884
All right, let's run with it.

646
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:21,221
So we're not gonna hold Mark
on the whole 48, right?

647
00:25:21,254 --> 00:25:22,922
He was in custody
when the bomb was sent.

648
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:24,491
Doesn't fit the profile,

649
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,493
and he's got a wife
and a daughter at home.

650
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,728
Yeah, I know, but new profile or not

651
00:25:28,762 --> 00:25:31,331
we haven't cleared him fully yet, so...

652
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,398
What?

653
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:34,367
His life's getting destroyed online.

654
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,302
Yeah.

655
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:38,572
I mean, one more day won't
change that, so.

656
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,949
- Hey.
- Hey.

657
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:52,820
- You look good.
- No, I don't.

658
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:54,554
Rebecca left me.

659
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:55,923
Now all I do is eat Pizza Hut

660
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:58,859
and watch reruns of "M.A.S.H."

661
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,460
This didn't come from me.

662
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:03,397
Guys in my unit are running
a case on this dealer,

663
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:06,266
so I wanna play it close to the vest.

664
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,701
Ali Beron. He big time?

665
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:10,671
Decent.

666
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:11,972
Mostly deals in artillery,

667
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,974
but he was selling C4 a year ago.

668
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,509
It was your stuff.

669
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:18,911
Now, we were gonna make him,
but he got tipped.

670
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,455
By the time we got to his Midwest hub,

671
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,581
place was empty.

672
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,549
We know where the C4's at?

673
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,287
If we had a tip, we would
have given it to you.

674
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:29,657
But we're getting close
to the nailing Ali

675
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:32,392
because this small time fence
in Indianapolis

676
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:36,030
says he bought three RPGs
from him a year ago, cheap.

677
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:37,874
Said there's more to buy,
but he was only interested

678
00:26:37,898 --> 00:26:39,332
in the heavy stuff.

679
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:41,502
So I'm looking for a smalltime fence.

680
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:43,437
Honestly, the guy selling the C4s

681
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,405
probably some dude
hocking it from his garage.

682
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,508
Ali just wanted to dump his product.

683
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:51,512
Gonna be a needle
in a lot of lowlife hay.

684
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:54,481
Well, lowlife hay's where I live.

685
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:58,518
So we think that Eric
and Sheri were targeted

686
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:00,754
for a story that they both reported on

687
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,989
something inflammatory.

688
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:05,626
Being as Sheri wrote over 300 articles

689
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:08,762
for her blog while Eric worked
here at the Telegraph, so...

690
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,772
We were hoping that one of
these would jump out at you

691
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,999
as a story that Eric would
have worked on too.

692
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:14,901
I'm sorry, most of Sheri's articles

693
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:16,736
are pop culture and gossip.

694
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,571
When Eric worked here he was a stringer.

695
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:20,640
- He chased crime stories?
- Homicides.

696
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:23,477
Englewood, Garfield Park,
daily blood and bullets.

697
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,020
It would have to be something
with enough weight

698
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:26,479
to disrupt someone's life.

699
00:27:26,513 --> 00:27:29,082
Didn't Eric run the Larry Shepard story?

700
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:31,352
- What story was that?
- Shepard.

701
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:33,420
He was a reporter here,
investigative journalist.

702
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:35,589
Was a good guy,
fired about two years ago.

703
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:37,457
Why was he fired?

704
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,660
Shepard had been reporting on a murder

705
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:43,997
and then rumors started
circulating at other outlets

706
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,966
that he was in some way...

707
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,368
that he had murdered the woman.

708
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:49,635
A journalist being accused

709
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,209
of the very crime he was reporting?

710
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:53,506
- You can imagine.
- That got press time?

711
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,608
Lots of it.

712
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,377
Look, our paper did the right thing.

713
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:59,379
It was a PR nightmare.
They had to fire Shepard.

714
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:01,914
Okay, so Shepard got
arrested for the murder?

715
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,484
No. God, no.

716
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,951
It was nonsense.

717
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:08,989
So you guys blew up
your reporter's career

718
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,890
based on fake news.

719
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:13,060
Yeah, he never forgave us for that.

720
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:14,695
His own paper, his own column.

721
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:16,863
I saw him a couple
of weeks ago on the L.

722
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:18,564
Started yelling when he saw me.

723
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:21,869
Larry Shepard. White male, 40s, beard.

724
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,770
It matches.

725
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:30,843
Go dark.

726
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:45,152
Hold.

727
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:49,623
Go.

728
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:02,796
Hey, Sarge, put a BOLO out on
every car Shepard's ever owned.

729
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:04,673
Canvassing every neighborhood
he's ever lived in.

730
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,275
Area Central's talking
to friends and family,

731
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,710
but, boss, I got to tell you this guy,

732
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:09,202
he was prepared for this.

733
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:11,338
He hasn't used his cell phone
in over three months.

734
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,806
Not a single credit card.
CTA hit nothing.

735
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,043
He wiped his social media,
bank accounts, email.

736
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:18,393
This guy's living in the dark.

737
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,246
I don't know how we're gonna find him.

738
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:21,801
- Sergeant.
- Yeah.

739
00:31:21,826 --> 00:31:22,841
Dawson and Upton are sitting

740
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:24,059
on Shepard's house, no movement.

741
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,320
Yeah, I doubt there will be. All right.

742
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:28,254
Just walk me through what we know.

743
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:29,355
- Okay?
- Okay.

744
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,724
Two years ago Shepard

745
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,034
was investigating the brutal murder

746
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:34,027
of this young woman in Ravenswood.

747
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,426
- Okay.
- Sheri,

748
00:31:35,451 --> 00:31:37,153
while working her blog, noticed,

749
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,365
I guess you would call it,
an obsessive bent to his story

750
00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:42,459
because in multiple articles
Shepard refers to her beauty,

751
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:44,360
radiance. Sheri thought it was off.

752
00:31:44,393 --> 00:31:45,796
So she dug into it.

753
00:31:45,828 --> 00:31:46,996
She found out Shepard

754
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:48,431
knew the woman who was murdered.

755
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:50,801
She wrote a tweet in her blog.

756
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:53,036
A joke accusing Shepard of the crime.

757
00:31:53,068 --> 00:31:55,104
"I went ahead and solved
the Ravenswood murder.

758
00:31:55,138 --> 00:31:58,008
Where was Shepard the night of?"

759
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,710
So she was murdered
over this twosentence joke?

760
00:32:00,744 --> 00:32:02,120
Yeah, she never wrote
anything else on Shepard.

761
00:32:02,144 --> 00:32:03,446
Never even met him.

762
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:05,716
She was killed
over those 140 characters.

763
00:32:05,748 --> 00:32:07,718
The tweet gets spread,
picked up, reported,

764
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,185
and then Shepard, he gets fired.

765
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,453
Our people investigated him.

766
00:32:10,487 --> 00:32:11,930
They found almost none of it was true.

767
00:32:11,954 --> 00:32:13,489
I read the homicide report.

768
00:32:13,523 --> 00:32:15,258
They basically cleared him
from the jump.

769
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,359
They found the real killer
a couple months later.

770
00:32:17,392 --> 00:32:18,761
Yeah, didn't matter though.

771
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:20,106
Shepard couldn't get another job.

772
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,832
His wife left him, then three months ago

773
00:32:21,864 --> 00:32:24,166
she commits suicide.
I guess he just broke.

774
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,268
He did try to erase
his digital footprint,

775
00:32:26,302 --> 00:32:28,205
but CPIK was able to pull this

776
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,239
from a deleted account.

777
00:32:30,273 --> 00:32:32,509
There comes a time when people pay,

778
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:34,144
when their actions matter,

779
00:32:34,177 --> 00:32:36,012
when the libel they spit into the ether

780
00:32:36,045 --> 00:32:39,149
of a virtual landscape has a reckoning.

781
00:32:39,181 --> 00:32:42,318
Journalism needs to be accountable.

782
00:32:42,352 --> 00:32:44,454
People need to be responsible.

783
00:32:44,487 --> 00:32:48,225
All right, so he goes on
like that for quite a while.

784
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,459
Do we know where he's
gonna be hitting next?

785
00:32:50,492 --> 00:32:52,128
If we assume that he's gonna target

786
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:53,896
a journalist that reported on him,

787
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,307
then we got these
half a dozen possibilities.

788
00:32:55,331 --> 00:32:57,767
Now, we're trying to round
these people up, but...

789
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,769
Shepard could have bombs
planted already.

790
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:01,371
- Right.
- So we're like seven steps

791
00:33:01,403 --> 00:33:03,405
behind this guy.

792
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,908
All right, let's make it a priority.

793
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,777
Bring in anyone who might be a target.

794
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:08,486
All right, I got a guy
who might know where Shepard

795
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,980
bought his C4. I had Tact bring him in.

796
00:33:11,014 --> 00:33:12,750
- Could use a second.
- Yeah.

797
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:15,417
Put the rest of that thing on.

798
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,419
You got it.

799
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:17,887
No, no, no, no, no.

800
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:18,997
I don't have to talk to you anymore.

801
00:33:19,021 --> 00:33:20,256
I worked that case off.

802
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,500
I just got a couple of questions...

803
00:33:21,524 --> 00:33:23,026
No, no! I'm better now.

804
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:26,095
Listen, the thing is, all my Cis,

805
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,131
they pointed me to you, Malcolm.

806
00:33:28,163 --> 00:33:29,441
They say that you're still busy.

807
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,168
No, I ain't. I'm better.

808
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,336
No, they say you're still
making your little gadgets.

809
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:36,873
So now all I need is the name

810
00:33:36,905 --> 00:33:38,841
of a small time fence dealing C4.

811
00:33:38,874 --> 00:33:40,485
No, I don't make weapons
no more. I'm better.

812
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:42,244
Is that a cell phone?

813
00:33:42,277 --> 00:33:44,247
You can't bring that near me,
okay? You can't.

814
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,425
I can't be around those things.
This is how it's gonna end.

815
00:33:46,449 --> 00:33:49,318
- This is how it's all gonna end.
- Okay, okay, hey, hey.

816
00:33:49,352 --> 00:33:50,921
I'll put it away.

817
00:33:50,953 --> 00:33:53,088
- He give you anything?
- No.

818
00:33:53,122 --> 00:33:55,491
Come on. All we need is a name, Malcolm.

819
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:57,960
No, I told you. I'm better now.

820
00:33:59,062 --> 00:34:01,064
You don't have a choice I guess.

821
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:04,367
He's gonna... he's gonna search
your place, Malcolm.

822
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:07,870
Now, if he finds anything
that violates your parole,

823
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:10,407
chemicals, weapons, whatever,

824
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:12,809
he's gonna take it.

825
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:15,111
Or you can just give us a name

826
00:34:15,143 --> 00:34:17,247
and you get to go home
like you never saw us.

827
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:25,087
- All right.
- What kind?

828
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,459
Military grade in bricks.

829
00:34:29,491 --> 00:34:32,027
Manufactured in 2012.

830
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,438
Small time fence would have probably

831
00:34:33,462 --> 00:34:35,932
just started selling it this year.

832
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:40,871
George Lehr.

833
00:34:40,904 --> 00:34:43,139
George Lehr. We met this prick.

834
00:34:43,172 --> 00:34:45,242
He was a witness
at Eric Mitchel's explosion.

835
00:34:45,274 --> 00:34:46,426
He offered to help us.

836
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,011
We had him fill out a witness report

837
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,980
on the scene, made him
give a driver's license.

838
00:34:50,013 --> 00:34:51,871
Adam and I checked out
his ID by the way.

839
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:53,014
- It's legit.
- But he's our fence.

840
00:34:53,038 --> 00:34:54,806
Sold the C4 Shepard's using.

841
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:56,386
Which means they were in contact.

842
00:34:56,419 --> 00:34:57,953
Okay, we know this how?

843
00:34:57,986 --> 00:35:00,189
Messages on Lehr's Facebook timeline.

844
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,158
Five in two months, each one posted

845
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,660
from a different dummy profile.

846
00:35:03,692 --> 00:35:05,895
Then three days ago
another dummy profile

847
00:35:05,928 --> 00:35:07,596
posted nothing but an email address.

848
00:35:07,629 --> 00:35:09,498
The email address has since
been shut down,

849
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:10,966
but I think it was Shepard.

850
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,335
All right. So you want to take him?

851
00:35:13,368 --> 00:35:14,904
No.

852
00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:17,039
I mean, we finally
got a lead to Shepard.

853
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,575
I don't want to blow it.

854
00:35:18,607 --> 00:35:20,609
Look, get coverts on Lehr's house.

855
00:35:20,643 --> 00:35:23,013
Find out everything about this guy.

856
00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:24,924
If these two are on contact,
we got to figure out

857
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:28,218
a way to get ahead of it
without Lehr knowing.

858
00:35:30,386 --> 00:35:32,922
Hey, you should probably
go ahead and release Mark.

859
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,002
I made myself real damn clear

860
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:48,614
I'm not talking to anyone
without my lawyer

861
00:35:48,638 --> 00:35:50,073
sitting next to me.

862
00:35:50,105 --> 00:35:51,941
Not here to interrogate you.

863
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:53,643
You're free to go.

864
00:35:56,511 --> 00:35:58,515
So no charge?

865
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:00,250
No, sir.

866
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,263
You don't even have
the stomach to apologize.

867
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,369
You're free to go.

868
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,687
Yeah, what's up?

869
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,189
What?

870
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:41,557
What do you mean she's packing?
I'm on my way.

871
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,532
All right, so what's the plan then?

872
00:36:49,564 --> 00:36:52,301
Well, I don't really want
to spend the weekend alone

873
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,137
on house arrest in your apartment.

874
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:56,372
- Yeah.
- And I was gonna go to Mom's,

875
00:36:56,406 --> 00:36:58,475
but she's sleeping over
at a boyfriend's.

876
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,611
So just hightail it out of here?

877
00:37:01,643 --> 00:37:03,714
I'm going to Aunt Mara's.

878
00:37:05,448 --> 00:37:07,017
Wait, wait.

879
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:08,218
In Detroit?

880
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,451
You're gonna take a bus alone

881
00:37:09,484 --> 00:37:11,286
- in the middle of the night?
- Yes.

882
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:13,288
Yeah, Dad, I'm gonna somewhere

883
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:16,258
where people can stand who I've become.

884
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,261
Eva, you know I didn't mean...

885
00:37:18,294 --> 00:37:20,096
No, you know what hurts most?

886
00:37:20,129 --> 00:37:22,431
You didn't give me
a chance to explain, okay?

887
00:37:22,464 --> 00:37:24,767
I went to that party
to pick up my drunk friend.

888
00:37:24,801 --> 00:37:26,803
So she wouldn't drive.

889
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:28,475
Then they all posted
these pictures online

890
00:37:28,504 --> 00:37:30,315
and suddenly it looks
like I was there partying.

891
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:31,708
But I wasn't.

892
00:37:31,741 --> 00:37:35,045
You can't decide who I am
off of a picture.

893
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:38,315
Or how people react to a picture.

894
00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:45,388
You're right.

895
00:37:47,156 --> 00:37:49,192
I should have let you explain.

896
00:37:50,692 --> 00:37:52,729
I got that wrong.

897
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:54,530
I'm sorry.

898
00:38:04,674 --> 00:38:06,576
Thank you.

899
00:38:08,176 --> 00:38:10,747
I still deleted
your second account though.

900
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:12,714
Because that stuff is dangerous, Eva.

901
00:38:12,747 --> 00:38:14,517
No, look, listen.

902
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:19,355
You have to at least let me
try to protect you.

903
00:38:19,388 --> 00:38:21,458
That's what I want to do. That's it.

904
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:42,612
I have another apology I have to make.

905
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,227
Hey. Winslow, what happened?

906
00:38:57,259 --> 00:38:58,761
Couple of bricks through the window.

907
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,395
Shattered glass at a 12yearold.

908
00:39:00,428 --> 00:39:02,206
She'll be fine. She's just
scared out of her mind.

909
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,600
- Do you know who threw them?
- No.

910
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,234
Family says they have no idea.

911
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:07,737
It's linked to the bombings.

912
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,706
It's the guy the internet ID'd.

913
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:12,575
They've been getting a lot of
calls addressed to the house.

914
00:39:12,607 --> 00:39:14,576
Guy's one unlucky dude.

915
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:17,180
Maybe you guys'll be around next time.

916
00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:18,556
Okay, thank you very much for your time.

917
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,815
Nightly, you know.

918
00:39:19,848 --> 00:39:21,450
- Help me out.
- All right.

919
00:40:06,629 --> 00:40:08,297
- Sarge.
- Yeah.

920
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:11,267
I think I have a way in with Lehr.

921
00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:13,335
It's a bit unorthodox,
but we would get his house,

922
00:40:13,368 --> 00:40:16,172
his emails. He wouldn't know a thing.

923
00:40:20,276 --> 00:40:21,978
Tell Antonio. I want him there with me.

924
00:40:22,011 --> 00:40:23,513
Okay.

925
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:26,515
It's a potential of dozens of targets.

926
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,226
I mean we're working
to get those mentioned

927
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,785
prominently into protective custody,

928
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:31,254
but it takes time.

929
00:40:31,286 --> 00:40:33,622
And we're making
predictions here, Chief.

930
00:40:33,656 --> 00:40:36,625
We can't be confident we know
where he's going next.

931
00:40:37,026 --> 00:40:39,328
All right.
We'll help you any way we can.

932
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:41,363
- Thank you.
- Squad's off shift.

933
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,565
Severide would be happy
to jump on transport.

934
00:40:43,598 --> 00:40:47,403
I appreciate that,
but it's not what we need.

935
00:40:50,939 --> 00:40:52,508
We need your paramedics.

936
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,977
We strongly believe Shepard's

937
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:56,245
in contact with a man, George Lehr.

938
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:57,413
Now, Lehr's a fence.

939
00:40:57,446 --> 00:40:58,748
We believe the pair's actively

940
00:40:58,781 --> 00:41:00,650
- keeping in touch through email.
- Lehr?

941
00:41:00,683 --> 00:41:02,951
- Do I know that name?
- Yeah, you do.

942
00:41:02,984 --> 00:41:04,586
You and my sister responded to his house

943
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,256
three times in the last six months.

944
00:41:06,288 --> 00:41:08,390
- He has a heart condition.
- No.

945
00:41:09,658 --> 00:41:12,694
Chief, look, we need realtime access

946
00:41:12,727 --> 00:41:15,998
to Lehr's emails, his laptop,
without him knowing.

947
00:41:16,031 --> 00:41:17,700
I said no.

948
00:41:17,732 --> 00:41:19,768
Chief, we can do this.

949
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:21,004
Look.

950
00:41:22,071 --> 00:41:24,940
You will not endanger my paramedics.

951
00:41:27,576 --> 00:41:29,411
We need to get inside Lehr's house

952
00:41:29,444 --> 00:41:31,723
to clone his laptop.

953
00:41:31,913 --> 00:41:35,200
I need you to get us in the door.

954
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:44,458

00:00:20,982 --> 00:00:23,262
Once the world was full of wonders,

3
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:26,930
but it belongs to humans now.

4
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,790
We creatures
have all but disappeared -

5
00:00:31,684 --> 00:00:34,929
demons, vampires and witches...

6
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:36,923
hiding in plain sight,

7
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:38,610
fearful of discovery,

8
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:40,732
ill at ease, even with each other.

9
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:44,653
But, as my father used to say...

10
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:46,878
in every ending

11
00:00:48,153 --> 00:00:50,313
there is a new beginning.

12
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,148
Do the villagers know about you?

13
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:00,110
Yes. Like witches, vampires are always
safer when they're in a community.

15
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,870
Is your mother expecting us?

16
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,790
Yeah.

17
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,748
Diana. This is my mother.

18
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,950
Ysabeau de Clermont.

19
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,430
Well?

20
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,310
Shall we go inside or continue
the greetings out here?

21
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,950
After you.

22
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,148
You might have shown
some consideration, Matthew.

23
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,868
I thought you prided yourself
on being a radical.

24
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,950
I have never been a radical.

25
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,028
Change is overrated.

26
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,230
Thank you for having me
in your home.

27
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,430
She's pleased to meet you.

28
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,268
Of course, she speaks
only English and New French.

29
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,590
Modern warmbloods
are so poorly educated.

30
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,428
Matthew!

31
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,950
Ah, Marthe.

32
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,948
- This is my friend, Diana.
- Welcome.

33
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,468
Marthe has been with
our family for centuries.

34
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,390
- Thank you.
- She needs some rest.

35
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,828
It's been a long journey.

36
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,588
I'll make up her room.

37
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,270
No, I'll do it.
She'll be sleeping in my tower.

38
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,270
You need to get some sleep.

39
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,108
- You must be tired to.
- Oh, vampires don't sleep often.

40
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,028
Not in the same way
you warmbloods do.

41
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,868
Your mother doesn't want me here.

42
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,068
It's been a long time since
anyone other than family

43
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,870
has visited Sept-Tours.

44
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,750
Not since my step-father
Philippe's death.

45
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,470
What happened to him?

46
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,150
He was killed.

47
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,830
During World War Two.

48
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,228
I'll be downstairs.

49
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,870
Just...
call me if you need anything.

50
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,068
At least they got there safely.

51
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,388
And witches won't mess with Ysabeau.

52
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,870
Ysabeau's more likely to rip off
Diana Bishop's head than they are.

53
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,390
Marcus?

54
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,790
Marcus?

55
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,030
Marcus, are you there?

56
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,150
Hello, Marcus.

57
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,708
Juliette. What are you doing here?

58
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,070
Where is he?

59
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,308
Is he chasing after that witch?

60
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,868
What witch?

61
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,148
If you don't tell me,
Gerbert will be very angry with me.

62
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,588
Do you really think I care?

63
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,708
- Does he miss me?
- He's moved on.

64
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,350
He doesn't think of you, ever!

65
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,790
Can't do anything on your own,
can you?

66
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,990
Always need someone
to take care of you.

67
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,510
Tell Matthew I called.

68
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,350
Eternity's a long time to be chasing
a man who doesn't want you, Juliette.

69
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,230
I don't want that room open
while she's here.

70
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,310
I have some work to do.

71
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,230
I'd like to use Philippe's office.

72
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,830
Maman, I need the key.

73
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,668
I don't want to fight.

74
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,630
- I'm not fighting.
- Diana didn't kill Philippe.

75
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,550
Thank you.

76
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,270
Her kind killed him, nobody else.

77
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,590
Do you truly understand
what you're exposing us to?

78
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,390
Mum?

79
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,430
Mum?

80
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,350
- Diana.
- Mum?

81
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,350
Diana!

82
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,268
- Hello.
- Diana, your ringtone's changed.

83
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,670
- Where are you?
- Oh, I had to leave Oxford.

84
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,388
What? Why?

85
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,308
Peter Knox threatened me.

86
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,508
I think it was right for you to leave.

87
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,750
He harassed your parents too.

88
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,708
Honey, where are you?

89
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,110
I'm with Matthew.

90
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,910
- Where's he taken you?
- To his mother's house.

91
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,190
- In France.
- His mother?

92
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,068
- Ysabeau de Clermont?
- Yeah.

93
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,990
You know her?

94
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,628
Listen to me very carefully.
You need to get out of there...

95
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,548
now.
She has destroyed entire covens.

96
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,588
In the '50s and '60s,
South America...

97
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,468
dozens of witches lost their lives,
many of them elderly.

98
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,948
- Why would she do that?
- Why?

99
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,148
Because she's a witch killer.

100
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,190
Come home now, Diana.

101
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,308
- Demons.
- Yes.

102
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,828
That's Agatha Wilson.

103
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,548
- Their leader.
- You won't tell them about the book?

104
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,708
No, of course not,
but we need their support.

105
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,828
Agatha. Please meet Satu J×”rvinen.

106
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,108
- Our new witch on the Congregation.
- Nice to meet you.

107
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,708
Agatha's always telling us how
we need to up our women count.

108
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,748
Which doesn't go down well
with the vampire colleagues.

109
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,268
Why?

110
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,388
It seems to me that every vampire
appointed over the last 900 years

111
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,308
- has been a white male.
- Finished, Agatha?

112
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,990
Actually, Baldwin,
I'd only just started.

113
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,390
Gentlemen.

114
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,430
Now we're all gathered...

115
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,590
Merde!

116
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,000
I bring this meeting to order.

117
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,750
Peter Knox has called
this emergency session.

118
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,120
Thank you.

119
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,000
On behalf of the witches...

120
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,760
I formally request
the assistance of this chamber.

121
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,430
Congregation rules have been broken.

122
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,520
- By whom?
- Matthew de Clermont.

123
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Your brother has abducted a witch.

124
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,150
Does your mother use the whole house?

125
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,040
Well, she used to.
Now most of it's closed up.

126
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,680
That used to be Philippe's office.

127
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,880
I know you told me he died
in the Second World War.

128
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,310
Then Ysabeau spent
the next few decades

129
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,000
wiping out covens in South America.

130
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,200
I remember my aunts telling me that
some witches worked with the Nazis.

131
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,990
They played a part in his death.

132
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,320
Yes.

133
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,800
But that has nothing to do with you.

134
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,160
For her it does.

135
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,320
Take that out.
It's been in there long enough.

136
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,150
What's wrong?

137
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,600
I know my results are back.

138
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,040
Why aren't you telling me
what's in them?

139
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,670
No one hands out results without
the appropriate tests being run.

140
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,950
And I need a second opinion
from Matthew.

141
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,390
For fuck's sake, Miriam!
Stop buying time.

142
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,760
I need to know
what happened with James.

143
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,430
There are markers in there
that we've seen before

144
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,480
in other cases of failed sirings.

145
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,880
- It's Baldwin.
- Here we go. Defcon 1.

146
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,630
Baldwin.

147
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,710
- Does Matthew want to cause a war?
- No.

148
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,030
Then explain what the hell he's doing.

149
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,710
- What was he thinking?
- Why don't you ask him yourself?

150
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,470
I've tried. He's not picking up.

151
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,240
Does he have the witch?

152
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,150
He may be your father...

153
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,400
but unfortunately for me
he's also a De Clermont.

154
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,360
As head of your family,
you can't refuse me.

155
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,680
Where is he?

156
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,470
Her name's Rakasa.

157
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,790
My mother used to ride her,
but, er...

158
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,630
- She has a quieter horse now.
- Well?

159
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,110
She's nice.

160
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,790
I haven't smelt such power
for centuries.

161
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,950
Sweet and green.

162
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,590
Like the spring.

163
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,070
Mind your head.

164
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,880
She's bewitched him.

165
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,430
What's her name mean?

166
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,110
Nar Rakasa's Arabic.

167
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,990
It means "fire dancer".

168
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,040
Let's see you dance then.

169
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,830
Yah! Come on!

170
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,160
Yah!

171
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,080
Slow down!

172
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,480
As you can see,
he's been stalking her.

173
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,630
And now she's disappeared
from her rooms.

174
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,280
No doubt abducted
by Matthew de Clermont.

175
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,430
Your father set up the Congregation

176
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,190
to avoid drawing human attention to us

177
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,510
and to keep peace amongst the species.

178
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,670
Your brother has broken that peace.

179
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,190
If this is true, then I'm afraid
Matthew must be brought to account.

180
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,630
What I don't understand
is why he'd want to do it.

181
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,760
The lineage is distinguished,
isn't that right?

182
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,310
- Is she powerful?
- No.

183
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,430
She was tested as a child.

184
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,910
So if she did have the power,
it would have come up then.

185
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,910
No, we're straying from the point,
which is, where is she

186
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,870
and how are you going to get her back?

187
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,840
Yes, but she is the only creature
who has found The Book Of Life.

188
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,310
Is that true?

189
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,510
Peter has failed to provide us
with the full facts, as usual.

190
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,030
- Take that back!
- Oh, come on,

191
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,510
we all know you lie like thieves.

192
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,070
If she's found the book,
she must bring it here to us.

193
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,590
She doesn't have The Book Of Life.
But she does know how to retrieve it.

194
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,390
And you were going to keep
that information to yourself?

195
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,670
At least I haven't snatched her
like Matthew de Clermont.

196
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,600
- It belongs to all of us, Peter!
- Enough!

197
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,400
My brother does have the witch.

198
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,750
He's taken her to Sept-Tours.

199
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,830
We will send
a Congregation representative

200
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,600
and he will hand her over
for investigation.

201
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,400
You know, your mother's right,
I should go home.

202
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,470
I don't want you to feel
responsible for me

203
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,870
and your mother
does not want me here.

204
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,990
Her bark's worse than her bite.

205
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,510
Well, maybe, but Sarah's right. I...

206
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,470
I should be with them.

207
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,670
And the Madison coven,
they can protect me.

208
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,070
You can't go back to Madison.
It's not safe amongst the witches.

209
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,630
I'm not going to go
into hiding my whole life.

210
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,110
I have to face Knox
at some point, Matthew.

211
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,520
It's not just about Knox.

212
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,000
The photographs of your parents.

213
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,390
They were staged...

214
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,070
to make it look like a fear of
devil worship, but I examined them.

215
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,950
Underneath the debris

216
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,040
there was a chalk circle.

217
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,270
A witches' circle.

218
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,830
Your parents weren't killed by humans.

219
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,000
Your parents were killed...

220
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,520
by witches.

221
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,920
I'm sorry.

222
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,320
Diana.

223
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,600
Why didn't you tell me
you tested Diana Bishop?

224
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,640
You missed her power.

225
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,240
How could you have?

226
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,920
Stirred to motion.

227
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,320
Rest what is and what shall be.

228
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,280
Rest all things that be.

229
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,950
I brought you here
to serve as my ally.

230
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,480
Not to look up information
and use it against me.

231
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,320
In the Salem trials...

232
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,080
when a witch refused to plead...

233
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,880
humans crushed them to death
with weights.

234
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,600
Shall I treat you as a human would?

235
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,880
We can only protect ourselves
against humans and other creatures...

236
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,680
if we work together.

237
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,690
Hey, Mum.

238
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,170
- How's Sophie?
- Yeah, good, yeah.

239
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,010
- The baby's started moving.
- Great.

240
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,610
Can I talk to her?

241
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,290
Did you speak to them about the rules?

242
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,410
I didn't get a chance.
It's been chaos here.

243
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,410
- Put Sophie on, will you?
- It's Mum.

244
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,740
Oh?

245
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,210
Hi!

246
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,100
That statue of the huntress
that you were given by your family.

247
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,740
Why do you link it to alchemy?

248
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,330
Because the moon
in her hair reminds me

249
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,090
of the White Queen in the books.

250
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,260
And the person I have to give it to,
she's in alchemy, too.

251
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,370
- How do you know?
- Well, I've had visions of her.

252
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,450
She's in this castle
with seven towers.

253
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,210
Seven's the big number in alchemy.

254
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,490
Seven planets, seven metals.
Even the transformation process...

255
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,340
has seven stages.

256
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,090
It hasn't started yet though.

257
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,730
It must be beginning.
She's with her Dark King.

258
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,570
And you dreamt about him, too?

259
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,050
He's distant. I can see her face.
I can't see his.

260
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,250
- Sophie...
- The session will recommence

261
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,450
- in ten minutes.
- You mustn't talk to anybody about this.

262
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,380
Why would I?
Do you know who she is?

263
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,730
I might.

264
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,210
- Then you need to get me to meet her.
- No.

265
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,730
She's in trouble
with the Congregation.

266
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,690
She's broken God knows how many rules.

267
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,090
I don't want you
getting mixed up with her.

268
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,060
She knows who she is.

269
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,660
Diana.

270
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,770
Does she know?

271
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,100
Yes.

272
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,620
Yes, I just told her.

273
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,820
And?

274
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,780
Well, she's not falling apart,
if that's what you were hoping.

275
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,620
One of the reasons
I'm drawn to her is her bravery.

276
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,500
She reminds me of you.

277
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,410
You were open-minded once.

278
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,330
Loved everyone for who they were.

279
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,460
Why can't you at least try?

280
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,530
Matthew won't keep the book
for himself.

281
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,650
If he gets hold of it,
he'll bring it to me.

282
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,410
Are you sure? He does what he wants.
Always has.

283
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,540
I have him under control.

284
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,300
Doesn't seem like it.

285
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,250
The witches on the Congregation
are plotting for more power.

286
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,610
Even the demons have become unruly.

287
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,850
We used to rule with an iron fist.

288
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,100
It's the 21st century, Gerbert.

289
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,140
We must at least show
a semblance of democracy.

290
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,490
And Matthew's behavior
has weakened us further.

291
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,700
Your family affairs are
compromising all of us.

292
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,420
After eight centuries of rule.

293
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,780
Do you know what I think?

294
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,300
I think...

295
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,020
the De Clermonts
are finally losing their grip.

296
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,380
Didn't my son warn you
not to move from his tower?

297
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,340
Yes.

298
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,570
You should listen to him.

299
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,730
This was your husband's office.

300
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,090
It's still his office.

301
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,980
It always will be.

302
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,300
How exactly did he die?

303
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,740
How dare you ask me that?

304
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,020
My parents were murdered.

305
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,140
- By witches.
- Who are capable of anything.

306
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,780
There is good and evil
in every species.

307
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,700
My parents were the best.

308
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,450
And I'm a witch...

309
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,410
who's willing to make up my own mind,

310
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,660
despite the stories
I've heard about you.

311
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,620
Why were they killed?

312
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,300
I don't know.

313
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,260
Whoever did it, make them pay.

314
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,860
It doesn't take the pain away.

315
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,660
But it helps.

316
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,050
Do all vampires love red wine
like you do?

317
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,850
Actually, most vampires
drink a lot more than we do.

318
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,930
Our family's known for its restraint.

319
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,060
With regard to wine perhaps.

320
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,900
It doesn't have the same effect on us
as it does on warmbloods.

321
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,290
Thank you for letting me ride Rakasa.

322
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,140
She's too willful for my liking.
Fiddat's more biddable.

323
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,570
As I get older, I find that quality
admirable in horses.

324
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,140
And in sons.

325
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,090
You didn't need to light that for me.

326
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,860
It's good to have a fire. We haven't
had one in that grate for too long.

327
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,500
This is a wonderful room for a party.

328
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,610
We used to celebrate Christmas
in here.

329
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,730
We'd invite all the villagers,
the family would come too.

330
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,090
- Do you remember, Matthew?
- Mm.

331
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,100
Louisa would dance
with anyone and everyone.

332
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,820
You didn't exactly hold back.

333
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,620
Maman.

334
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,460
I'm not sure you'd like this one.

335
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,770
Come on.
Your turn.

336
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,610
I'm not a dancer.

337
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,940
Neither am I.

338
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,450
Come on, just give it a try.

339
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,250
I am not exactly a great dancer either
but it could be fun.

340
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,010
- That's not true.
- All right.

341
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,060
The secret is, go back on this one
to start off with.

342
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,980
Pretty good.

343
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,890
Let him lead!

344
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,540
Your dance, at least.

345
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,740
Come on, spin. To me.

346
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,420
To me.

347
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,620
Yes!

348
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,860
My God.

349
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,260
Diana.

350
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,300
Extraordinary.

351
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,220
That's the first time I've seen you
enjoying your magic.

352
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,260
I'm glad it's happening
when I'm with you.

353
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,500
What spell have you put on me?

354
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,050
Goodbye.

355
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,370
- Goodnight, Gillian.
- See you at the next coven meeting.

356
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,170
- Thanks for coming. Bye!
- Goodnight.

357
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,540
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

358
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,860
Bye!

359
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,930
Diana is with Matthew Clairmont
at his family home.

360
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,410
Oh, no.

361
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,730
Do you think he forced her
or she went willingly?

362
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,450
- I can't believe she'd do that.
- Why?

363
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,250
She half killed us all with
witch wind. She's capable...

364
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,970
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, it's pleasure. Bye-bye.

365
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,450
- Bye!
- Ö° bient×¤t.

366
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,900
Ö° la prochaine.

367
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,090
Gillian, she is capable of anything.

368
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,730
Maybe she doesn't understand.

369
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,370
I don't think she knows
much about Congregations.

370
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,820
Because she willingly
kept herself ignorant.

371
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,050
- What will they do to her?
- They'll interrogate her.

372
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,290
- She has a lot to answer for.
- What about Matthew Clairmont?

373
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,050
He'll be punished too.

374
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,970
Of course, the more information
we have on him, the better.

375
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:56,140
Peter Knox wants us to find out
exactly what he was doing in Oxford.

376
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,900
Mm?

377
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,650
Will you please tell me
about William Harvey?

378
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:18,250
Well... It's not a particularly
interesting story.

379
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,570
Well, maybe not to you,
but to this historian,

380
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,450
it is the closest thing
I'll get to meeting the man

381
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,740
that discovered
that the heart is a pump.

382
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,700
Matthew.

383
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,460
Domenico.

384
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,210
- It's been years.
- When was the last time?

385
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,690
In Ferrara?

386
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,850
We were both fighting the Pope.
I was trying to save Venice.

387
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,290
- You, the Knights Templar.
- Why are you here?

388
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,620
Ah!

389
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,820
And this must be the witch
I've heard so much about.

390
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,820
Diana, go back to the house.

391
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,290
- Go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

392
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,690
Domenico. What an unexpected visit.

393
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,410
Ysabeau, it's a pleasure to see you.

394
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,330
How did you know I was here?

395
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,610
- I smelled you.
- Maman.

396
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,010
Take Diana back to the house.

397
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,180
I think she should stay
until I deliver my message.

398
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,770
Diana Bishop,

399
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,650
you must come before the Congregation
for questioning

400
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,570
and to hand over The Book Of Life.

401
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,250
You tell the Congregation
that I don't have it.

402
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,250
If they want it,
they can get it themselves.

403
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,130
But you must come and tell us how to.

404
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,410
Diana will not be going
anywhere with you.

405
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,940
Are you refusing to let me
carry out Congregation orders?

406
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,580
I am.

407
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,570
You do know the consequences?

408
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,170
- Yes, I do!
- Matthew, please, don't do this.

409
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,300
Ah, it's not about the book, is it?

410
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,020
No.

411
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,460
It's about her.

412
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,100
You're breaking the Covenant.

413
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,330
What is the Covenant?
What is he talking about?

414
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,060
She doesn't even know, Matthew.

415
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,460
You've lost your mind.

416
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,780
Take her back now!

417
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,850
One twitch and I will
rip your head off!

418
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:37,500
You've delivered your message
and you've been answered.

419
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,180
Now, leave!

420
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,370
We'll hunt you down.

421
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,860
I'll kill you both.

422
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,260
Even De Clermonts can die.

423
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,250
The Book Of Life?

424
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,100
Why didn't you say?

425
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,370
It was what drew me to her.

426
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,740
And then it became
about something else.

427
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,660
Maman.

428
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,860
I can see that.

429
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,060
And so can Domenico.

430
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,530
Give her to them.

431
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,540
They won't kill her if you do.

432
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,700
They will if you don't.

433
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,950
What is the Covenant?

434
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,070
You really don't know?

435
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,230
It forbids interspecies relationships.

436
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,670
That's insane.

437
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,110
Why would anyone ever agree to that?

438
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,430
There were a lot more
of us creatures back then.

439
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,950
And we'd grown accustomed
to taking what we wanted.

440
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:12,910
Philippe decided that if creatures
from different species mated,

441
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,390
it might upset the balance of power.

442
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,870
So...

443
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,670
the Covenant was drawn up.

444
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,710
What happens when creatures break it?

445
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,430
To my knowledge,
it never has been broken.

446
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,430
He's gone.

447
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,990
There'll be no more visits
from the Congregation.

448
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,190
How do you know that?

449
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,630
Because we're not going
to break the Covenant.

450
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,910
You're giving in?

451
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:59,110
Domenico's visit was a diplomatic
mission. The next one will not be.

452
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,950
Even if we stood up to them,
what then? Hmm?

453
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:07,230
We'd be opening up old animosities
that would spiral out of control

454
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,430
and expose us to humans.

455
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,630
I won't let that happen.

456
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,350
So that's it?

457
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,950
We're just going to abide by some
ancient, narrow-minded agreement

458
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,750
that was made a thousand years ago?

459
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,270
Yes.

460
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,270
No.

461
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,350
We are bound together.

462
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,590
My magic started coming out
when I met you.

463
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,830
Three weeks ago,
you'd never even heard of me.

464
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,070
You don't know me!

465
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,430
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

466
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,870
You don't even know yourself.

467
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,390
Stop.

468
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,550
Stop it.

469
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,190
Why are you being like this?

470
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,310
Yes?

471
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,510
Is there damage?

472
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,830
I'll get there as soon as I can.

473
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,630
Someone broke into the lab.

474
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,150
- I have to get back to Oxford.
- I'll get my things.

475
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:37,630
- You're not coming.
- Diana should go back to her aunts.

476
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,670
She's staying here.

477
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,710
- Maman...
- Stop making decisions for me.

478
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,350
Guard her with your life.

479
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,550
Yes, Matthew.

480
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,110
Leaving me isn't the answer.

481
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,390
I love you.

482
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,230
Tell me how you feel.

483
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,750
Forget the Covenant,
forget the Congregation.

484
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,310
How do you feel?

485
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,590
You know how I feel.

486
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,990
Say it!

487
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,270
Let him go.

488
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,110
Look!

489
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:55,590
My God!
She's doing this.

490
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,040
The lab's secured.

491
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,240
It was witches.
Their scent was everywhere.

492
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,360
- You think this was about Diana?
- Of course this is about Diana.

493
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,160
This is what I wanted you to see.

494
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,040
You fear I shall come
to know your past?

495
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,640
Who are Blanca and Lucas?

496
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,480
I don't want you to worry about that.

497
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,920
It appears the vampires
are studying witches' DNA.

498
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,120
- What's Clairmont up to?
- This changes everything, everything.

499
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,280
Witches and vampires
can't be together.

500
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,600
You cannot put yourself
in that danger.

501
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,320
I will never leave him.

502
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,080
The witches will think that Diana
has turned her back on her own kind

503
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,740
and they will come.

504
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,270
I need to show you something.
You might not like what you see.

505

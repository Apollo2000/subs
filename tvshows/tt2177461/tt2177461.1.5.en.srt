00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,314
<i>Once the world was full of wonders</i>

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,040
<i>but it belongs to humans now.</i>

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,794
<i>We creatures
have all but disappeared -</i>

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,157
<i>demons, vampires and witches...</i>

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,118
<i>hiding in plain sight</i>

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,955
<i>fearful of discovery,
ill at ease, even with each other.</i>

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,914
<i>But, as my father used to say...</i>

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,200
<i>in every ending...</i>

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,551
<i>there is a new beginning.</i>

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,358
Witch water.

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,320
Power like that
is rarely seen nowadays.

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,160
What you did I've not seen
for many centuries.

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,593
I didn't mean for it to happen.

15
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,316
Witch water, witch wind...

16
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,918
it's just more magic
that my body can't control.

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
Give it time.

18
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,114
I should go to Madison.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,310
See if my aunts can help me.

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,080
You're not going anywhere for now.

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,030
And I made my son a promise.

22
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,350
Get dressed, we're going hunting.

23
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,394
The lab's secured.
We've accounted for everything.

24
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,393
It was witches.
Their scent was everywhere.

25
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,233
They tried hacking into the computers.

26
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,960
They failed, of course.
Our servers are impenetrable.

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,520
I need to see it for myself.

28
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,200
This is Peter Knox's doing.

29
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,471
It's because of you, Matthew.

30
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,950
We've run this lab for years
without being noticed.

31
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,714
Flown under the radar
of humans and creatures.

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,076
Then suddenly, it's all jeopardised

33
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,994
because you decide
to mate with a witch.

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,992
That is enough, Miriam.

35
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,072
Don't even begin to deny it.

36
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,318
I'm the only one of us
who's mated before. I know the signs.

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,199
Domenico knows, too.
Ysabeau phoned me.

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,112
Domenico can go to hell.

39
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,270
You're absolutely positive
nothing was stolen?

40
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,319
Diana's DNA samples, her bloods?
They're secure.

41
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,596
You think this was about Diana?
Of course this is about Diana.

42
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,473
I know that scent.

43
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,395
Where are you going?

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,480
Matthew, don't go there!

45
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,916
Call Baldwin.
It's time we told him the truth.

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,399
What do you mean, they're mating?

47
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,794
He's fighting it.

48
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,480
He's gone back to Oxford
and she's at Sept-Tours.

49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,557
Ysabeau says
he will respect the Covenant.

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,193
<i>He just needs to get his head straight.</i>

51
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,896
I thought this was about
<i>The Book Of Life.</i>

52
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,479
It was.

53
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,040
It still is.

54
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,759
But there's more to it than that.

55
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,554
<i>Someone broke into the lab - witches.</i>

56
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,599
<i>Matthew thinks they were looking
for information about Diana.</i>

57
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,314
I was just thinking, with you being
a member of the Congregation

58
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,790
and the head of our family that...
<i>That I can save him?</i>

59
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,193
Matthew never destroys only himself,
Marcus.

60
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,634
<i>He always drags the rest of us
down with him.</i>

61
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,073
Well, I can't help him this time.

62
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,834
If he breaks the rules...

63
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,554
<i>he pays the price.</i>

64
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,677
I thought I'd take you hunting.

65
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,275
Have you ever seen a vampire, hunt?

66
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,991
<i>It's not as romantic
as humans believe.</i>

67
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,800
<i>It's relentless and it's brutal.</i>

68
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,511
Do not come anywhere near me
when I'm hunting, do you understand?

69
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
Yes.

70
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,513
If the animal scent
gets confused with yours

71
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,956
I can't promise
I won't attack you instead.

72
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,000
What do you want?

73
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,390
Still marking undergraduate essays.

74
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,480
Is that why you're jealous of Diana?
I'm not jealous of her.

75
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,998
Or is this about preferment?

76
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,036
Has Knox told you
you're going to rise in the ranks?

77
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,755
Why did you break into my lab?

78
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,719
I smelt your scent.

79
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,990
What were you looking for, I wonder?

80
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Tell me.

81
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,679
Makes me sick
that she'd debase herself with a vampire.

82
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,914
He was right.

83
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,034
The sooner your kind are wiped
from the face of the Earth the better.

84
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,830
This is the nature of vampires.

85
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,718
Could you be with my son
knowing that he kills?

86
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,759
That hunting like this
is the only way for him to survive?

87
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,355
If you're trying to frighten me
away from your son...

88
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,354
you've failed.

89
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,114
Marthe said this wouldn't be enough
to make you reconsider.

90
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,360
Well, she was right.

91
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,240
Can we go home now?

92
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,236
Gillian.

93
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,354
Gillian.

94
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
God.

95
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,914
Sylvia reports that
Miss Chamberlain took photos

96
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,914
when she was inside the laboratory,
but De Clermont took her phone.

97
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,359
Can Sylvia tell us
anything that Gillian saw?

98
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,229
It appears the vampires
are studying witches' DNA.

99
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,794
What's Clermont up to?

100
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,034
Testing witches?

101
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,120
It's good
Miss Chamberlain discovered it.

102
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,872
But why did she break into a vampire
laboratory in the first place?

103
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,635
She could have been killed.

104
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,672
Matthew de Clermont
abducted her friend.

105
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,514
She must have been acting
out of concern for Diana.

106
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,631
Will one of us need to go to Oxford?

107
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,115
Sylvia will handle Oxford
and Gillian Chamberlain.

108
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,394
We'll be needed here.

109
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,593
Hey, Sarah.

110
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,077
I'm sorry I haven't called.
<i>Oh, no matter.</i>

111
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,272
Just talk to us now.
Honey, is everything OK?

112
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,239
This Venetian vampire came.

113
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,433
<i>He's on the Congregation.</i>

114
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,396
He told me about the Covenant.

115
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,835
How come I didn't know about this?
<i>Well...</i>

116
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,395
You... You turned your back
on being a witch.

117
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,154
You... You refused
to talk about magic.

118
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,630
We didn't tell you because...

119
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,518
it wasn't relevant to your life.

120
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,597
Well, it is now.

121
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,118
I love Matthew.

122
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,032
<i>I can't help myself.</i>

123
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,480
That's impossible.

124
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,591
<i>Witches and vampires
can't be together.</i>

125
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,354
Yeah, everyone keeps telling me that.

126
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,795
But for me, there... there is no choice.

127
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,550
You cannot put yourself
in that danger.

128
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,109
I thought you two might understand.

129
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,430
Honey, it's just the Congregation

130
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,399
is going to do everything
in their power to stop

131
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,318
<i>a mixed species relationship.</i>

132
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,155
They don't get to choose who I love

133
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,072
no matter the consequences.

134
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,471
Honey, what does Matthew
have to say about all this?

135
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,078
He... He hasn't told me
how he feels yet.

136
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,640
You've left her with Ysabeau?

137
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,235
A twisted idea of culture.
She loves me.

138
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,153
Or she says she does.
And you love her?

139
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,756
- Oh, Christ, Matthew.
- I know.

140
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,072
I've been fooling myself that
the Congregation would no longer care.

141
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,073
And somehow, she didn't even know
about the Covenant.

142
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,199
Why should they tell us who to love?

143
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,759
They haven't stopped me.

144
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,834
A relationship between a demon
and a human doesn't threaten them

145
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,718
but a vampire and a witch.

146
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,111
This vampire, a De Clermont no less,
and this witch.

147
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,396
Honestly, Hamish, she...

148
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,676
she is astonishingly powerful.

149
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,034
And she's clever and funny.

150
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,513
She's full of courage.

151
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,711
Then don't fall in the trap
of thinking for her.

152
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,671
This isn't just about
the Congregation, is it?

153
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,080
She's a historian.

154
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,911
I am her latest research subject.
Ah!

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,640
And you fear
she'll come to know your past?

156
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,354
I know about it...

157
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,470
and I love you.

158
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,594
There are many things in this life
one can control.

159
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,880
Love is not one of them.

160
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,877
If you love her, then don't let
anything get in your way.

161
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,958
Matthew has been living
for 1,500 years.

162
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,429
You've been with him a few days.

163
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,636
You know nothing about him.

164
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,870
It's time you began to understand.

165
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,350
Matthew was born in the village.

166
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,750
He'd drive his father mad

167
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,831
following him around,
picking up his work tools.

168
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,792
He became a craftsman,
just like his father.

169
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,352
This is what I wanted you to see.

170
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,232
Matthew built it.

171
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,878
"Peace."

172
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,833
Perfect peace.

173
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,878
"Blanca and Lucas."

174
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,751
Who were Blanca and Lucas?

175
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,399
When Matthew was human...

176
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,351
he had a wife and son.

177
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,874
What happened to them?

178
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,912
Fever spread through the village.

179
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,751
Lucas was just a small boy.
He'd not long turned five.

180
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,032
He and Blanca were both struck
with the sickness

181
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,679
and died.

182
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,312
He laid this stone in their memory.

183
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,036
Matthew's true love

184
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,998
will always be Blanca.

185
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,434
She gave him a son.

186
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,434
You'll never be able
to bear a child by him.

187
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,710
In 1,500 years,
Matthew has never mated.

188
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,951
And I don't think he ever will.

189
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,039
It's forever.
I will never leave him.

190
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,230
Of course you will.

191
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,119
Your life is fleeting
compared with a vampire's.

192
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,998
When you are long gone...

193
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,674
Matthew will have to carry on
living without you...

194
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,076
just as he did with Blanca.

195
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,995
Madame De Clermont.

196
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,350
Ah!

197
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,480
<i>Bonjour, madame.</i>

198
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,680
<i>Comment allez-vous?</i>

199
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,831
I sired Matthew in the church.

200
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,553
No one knew whether he slipped
or if he jumped.

201
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,670
His body lay here on the ground.

202
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,118
His legs and back broken.

203
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,880
Dying man.

204
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,353
I told him I could
take his suffering away

205
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,716
and make him live forever.

206
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,197
He was so out of his mind with pain.

207
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,671
I don't think he completely
understood what he'd agreed to.

208
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,799
If I could use my blood to save him,
I would.

209
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,877
I felt the gods were giving me
an opportunity to make a child.

210
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,634
And afterwards?

211
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,874
How did he adapt?

212
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,433
Matthew was in a rage at being sired.

213
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,831
His need to feed was... endless.

214
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,791
I can't imagine him like that.
He's always...

215
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,997
so controlled.

216
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,271
He would go away for periods of time.

217
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,233
Philippe forbade me asking
where he'd been.

218
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,437
Matthew was in a dark place

219
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,119
doing things Philippe
didn't want my eyes to see.

220
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,634
I demand that Diana be removed
from the clutches of the De Clermont family

221
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,791
and be brought back to the witches.

222
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,359
Last night, the equilibrium between
the species was further threatened

223
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,955
when Matthew de Clermont
brutally attacked a witch.

224
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,136
Gillian Chamberlain was attacked
because she was trespassing

225
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,640
on vampire territory.

226
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,833
Rules are rules.

227
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,752
We won't survive
if the vampires continue

228
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,718
to abuse their power
in the Congregation.

229
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,197
- Careful, Agatha.
- We must question Diana Bishop.

230
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,511
And bring Matthew de Clermont
to account.

231
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,798
I offer my services
to retrieve the witch.

232
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,996
Be assured, I can be
a little more persuasive

233
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,559
than Domenico.

234
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,030
We can't leave the responsibility
of her retrieval

235
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,237
in the hands of just one creature.

236
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,874
A representative from each species
should go to Sept-Tours.

237
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,270
Sept-Tours is my property.

238
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,353
I will not have a swarm of creatures
invading my home.

239
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,198
I will go and get Diana Bishop myself.

240
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,793
We must find a way to look inside
Diana, see how she's hiding her power.

241
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,155
An opening spell.

242
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,437
You can't put a living witch
through that.

243
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,912
They rarely survive the trauma.

244
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,277
That sort of dark magic's unreliable
and highly dangerous.

245
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,719
It's almost impossible to master,
anyway.

246
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,190
It affects the spell-caster greatly.

247
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,196
What if Baldwin wants her for himself?

248
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,512
She's on his land.

249
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,997
We have no choice
but to let him go.

250
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,710
Have you ever considered working
with other vampires against him?

251
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,634
Have you been talking with them?

252
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,553
No, of course not.

253
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,472
Domenico's a sneak.

254
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,319
And Gerbert... Gerbert is unspeakable.

255
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,757
It's long been rumoured that he's
kept a witch captive for centuries

256
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,910
in his thrall.

257
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,077
You keep away from them both.

258
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,353
Humans, they should be given the choice

259
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,596
to either accept us or not.

260
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,876
A couple of witches at uni
know what I am.

261
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,856
Well, there's a big difference between
a couple of witches knowing what you are

262
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,200
and all humans knowing.

263
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,319
The Congregation are running scared.

264
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,829
The vampires and witches
want to shut us up

265
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,070
keep us on the outside.

266
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,190
They're afraid of us.

267
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,336
They're afraid of what we might do
if we come together

268
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,000
which is only natural,
it's how we're supposed to be.

269
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,616
And the thing is, not all humans
are ignorant when it comes to us.

270
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,792
Really?!
What humans are we talking about?

271
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,150
I've got mates at uni and they're fine...
Hold on a sec.

272
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,833
Alright. Cool, nice one.

273
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,755
Hey. Where have you been?
Sorry, I, erm... I...

274
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,675
I fell asleep and I had this
really weird dream.

275
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,994
Agatha and the witch
were in it and my dad

276
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,192
saying over and over
I have to tell the truth.

277
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,600
Can we talk about this later?

278
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,792
I mean, people are actually here, Soph.
They came.

279
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,999
Look, the forum actually worked.

280
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,356
I know, Nat, but I figured it out.

281
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,757
The dream. I, erm...
I need to speak to your mum.

282
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,150
I have to tell her about my family
and what I am.

283
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,232
Soph, you can't. I know, but...

284
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,994
She's a Congregation member, OK?
Think of the baby.

285
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,720
It's not safe.
But she'll understand.

286
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,554
And I can't pass the statue on
without her.

287
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,474
The witch needs it.

288
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,351
OK.

289
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,232
Let's do it.

290
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Yeah.

291
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,079
"The Knights..."

292
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,153
of Lazarus...

293
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,232
of Bethany...

294
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,758
"M, D, CI".

295
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,030
Matthew de Clermont.

296
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,030
How are you?

297
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,470
Ysabeau has been
keeping me entertained.

298
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,194
<i>Telling me stories about you.</i>

299
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,237
Yes, I was afraid of that.

300
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
<i>According to her</i>

301
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,750
you're a mix between Superman

302
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,916
<i>and Lancelot.</i>

303
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,553
Well, I try.

304
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,916
<i>- Is everything okay?</i>
- Yes.

305
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,912
Yes, it doesn't look like
anything's been taken.

306
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,191
Was it witches? Peter Knox?

307
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,516
I don't want you to worry about that.

308
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
OK.

309
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,960
It's late. I'm gonna go to bed.

310
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,680
Goodnight, Matthew.

311
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Goodnight, Diana.

00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,714

324

325
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,519
♪ Ooh-aie-ee, oh, ee-aie-oh... ♪

326
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,151
Matthew?

327
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,240
What are you doing?

328
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,517
Comparing Diana's DNA
to pre-11th-century witches.

329
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,196
I already did that.

330
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,191
The programme didn't recognise
her markers.

331
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,240
Genetic mutations over the centuries
made an exact match impossible, but...

332
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,830
I compared the actual physical data.

333
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,992
The similarities were unmistakable.
Take a look.

334
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
Go on.

335
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,874
How is this possible?

336
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,756
Everything before
pointed to species decline.

337
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,951
This changes everything. Everything.

338
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,750
Help me run them again.

339
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,870
I need to get back and tell Diana
what we've discovered.

340
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,478
Good morning, Diana.
Matthew called for you.

341
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,113
He's on his way.

342
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,196
Tell me.

343
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,230
If I do...

344
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,712
there's no turning back.
You have to understand what that means.

345
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,752
Ysabeau made me understand.

346
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
Tell me.

347
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,434
From this moment...

348
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,400
we will always be one.

349
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,675
Diana...

350
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,675
I love you.

351
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,509
Do you know what you have just done?

352
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,111
If we're not welcome here,
Diana and I will leave.

353
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,598
Have I ever deserted you?

354
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,910
No, <i>Maman.</i> Then why would I now?

355
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,356
You are my beloved son.

356
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,630
And you are now my daughter.

357
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,915
Your fight is now my fight.

358
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,755
If you have the courage
to love my son...

359
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,270
you have no need to fear your power.

360
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,673
The women of the De Clermont family
defend themselves.

361
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,876
And you will be no different.

362
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,551
<i>In nomine Patris</i>

363
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,355
<i>et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

364
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,477
<i>In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

365
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,712
What is it? What can you see?

366
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,353
Is Diana Bishop
the witch from the prophesy?

367
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,237
Beware of the witch
with the blood of the lion and the wolf

368
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,356
for with it she shall destroy
the children of the night.

369
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,794
I know that. I know.

370
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,840
Speak to me
or you'll get no more of this.

371
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Two.

372
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,833
Light, dark.

373
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,998
There are two witches?

374
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,394
One... close.

375
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,199
Who is she?

376
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,919
Where can I find her?

377
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,110
Beware the witch with the blood...

378
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,913
of the lion and the wolf

379
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,789
for with it she shall destroy
the children of the night.

380
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,590
Beware the witch with the blood
of the lion and the wolf

381
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,796
for with it she...

382
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,479
<i>Buonasera, signorina. Prego.</i>

383
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,670
<i>Venga.</i>

384
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,750
You think that lighting a fire
and pouring some wine will help them?

385
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,160
He loves her, Ysabeau.

386
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,878
They'll need more than love.

387
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,237
The witches will think that Diana
has turned her back on her own kind

388
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,357
and they will come.

389
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,514
And when they come,
her weakness will put us all at risk.

390
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,230
She will find a way to use
her magic to protect herself.

391
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,040
Then she'd better stop
behaving like some human

392
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,191
and find a way fast.

393
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,393
I need to show you something.

394
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,792
What is this?

395
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,793
When I was in Oxford
I worked on your DNA samples.

396
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,554
These are the results. You ready?

397
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,350
We don't understand everything yet

398
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,309
but so far we've discovered
that you have...

399
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,554
every genetic marker
we've ever seen in a witch.

400
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,838
You have the elemental markers
of air and water.

401
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,877
Witch wind and witch water. Mmm.

402
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,239
You also have earth

403
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,960
which means you're likely,
more than likely

404
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,713
to be able to cast spells.

405
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,752
It's bizarre.

406
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,071
I've never felt connected to magic

407
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,992
like Sarah or Em.

408
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,556
Or... even Gillian.

409
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
Mmm.

410
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,637
Does this test tell us
why this is happening now?

411
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,839
Well, your magic's behaving as though
it's waking up from a long sleep.

412
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,956
It's restless.

413
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,157
It wants to get out.

414
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,359
My parents were persecuted
because of their powers.

415
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,794
Hey.

416
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,591
We will face this together.

417
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,792
Otherwise, you'll always be running.

418
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,838
I need to talk to you
about Oxford, Diana.

419
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,195
I don't want to hear
about Oxford, Matthew.

420
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,596
So...

421
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,435
what does the distinguished historian
know about...

422
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,236
bundling?

423
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,717
- Bundling?
- Mmm.

424
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,398
Well, I'm familiar with the custom,
but it <i>is</i> 2018.

425
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
Diana.

426
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,116
You may not like what you see.

427
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,510
Oh.

428
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,914
Oh, Matthew.

429
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,640
That one was made by
the tip of a broadsword

430
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,797
during the 100 Years War.

431
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,118
Think of them as, er...

432
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,800
a map of my life.

433
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,393
I want to hunt down
everyone who hurt you.

434
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,754
My love.

435
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,759
With you my life has a beginning,
a middle and an end.

436
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,955
When you're gone my life will be over.

437
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,671
I don't think that's bundling.

438
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,675
Well...

439
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,879
it is in France.

440
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,670
I wouldn't bother going home.

441
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,873
Gerbert's very disappointed in you.
Matthew wasn't even in Oxford.

442
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,269
It wasn't my fault.

443
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,799
I know where he is.

444
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,120
You see, unlike you

445
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,034
he's been able to move on.

446
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,157
He has a new woman.

447
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,840
A witch.

448
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,957
Diana Bishop.

449
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,236
He only wants her for her powers.

450
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,439
That's all.

451
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,637
Matthew hates witches.
Not this one.

452
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,039
He's in love with her.
He's in love with me!

453
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,480
Matthew's mine.

454
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,158
He belongs to me.

455
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,033
What are you waiting for?

456
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,159
She's at Sept-Tours.

457
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,630
I can't go without
Gerbert's permission.

458
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,680
Really?

459
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,480
Diana!

460
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,557
She's in pain. What did you see?

461
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,160
I'll kill you if you've harmed her!
Where is she?

462
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,159
I caught her scent in the garden,
but mixed with another.

463
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,416
You've clearly involved in this.

464
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,160
I assure you
this has nothing to do with me.

465
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,638
Gerbert took her then.
I know what he's capable of.

466
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,639
Is this witch really worth
going to war against our own for?

467
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,636
Yes!

468
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,514
This is what happens to witches
who don't co-operate.

468
00:42:10,305 --> 00:43:10,173

00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,591
<i>but it belongs to humans now.</i>

HEAD OF FACULTY: <i>Please, join me
in welcoming back to Oxford...</i>

27
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,631
this year's visiting research fellow.

28
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,876
As many of you know, she took her
DPhil in the history of science here.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,390
And after publishing
two prize-winning books

30
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,836
she was awarded tenure at Yale

31
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,072
one of the youngest ever
to have been awarded that distinction.

32
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,155
We are delighted
to have her back amongst us.

33
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,840
Dr Diana Bishop.

34
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,154
Thank you. Thank you so much.

35
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,435
Alchemy.

36
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,480
In the 17th century, alchemy was at
the very heart of the study of nature

37
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,277
and a precursor to modern chemistry...

38
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,274
and death. All parts of the natural
world, be they animate or inanimate

39
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,352
were believed to experience
these stages.

40
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,592
Although these images were
often interpreted as allegory

41
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,400
they actually represent
the chemical processes...

42
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,597
With access to
the Bodleian Library's collection

43
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,912
of unique manuscripts
owned by Elias Ashmole

44
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,590
the 17th-century antiquarian,
astrologer and alchemist

45
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,151
I will continue to explore
the role that alchemy had

46
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,118
in 17th-century thought

47
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,150
and how it influenced great scientists
such as Isaac Newton and Robert Boyle.

48
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,720
- Thank you.
- ADIENCE APPLAUDS.

49
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,397
- Very stimulating.
- Thank you.

50
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,357
There's an opening
coming up soon in the faculty.

51
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,238
I'm drawing up a shortlist of
candidates. Would it interest you?

52
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,991
Er, yes.

53
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,912
We'll need to evaluate all your work.

54
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,870
The talk that you just gave today -
I assume it's ready to be published?

55
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,356
It is, it is. It's almost finished.

56
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,279
Well, I'd need it by late October.
Absolutely.

57
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,272
I look forward to reading it.
Thank you.

58
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,874
Diana, that was brilliant.

59
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,352
Gillian Chamberlain at a lecture
for alchemy? What a lovely surprise.

60
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,513
DIANA: It's been, what, four years
since I've seen you?

61
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,956
GILLIAN: Almost six, actually.
Can't believe it.

62
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,714
When did you arrive?
Over a week ago.

63
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,872
I've been practically living in
the library. I haven't even unpacked.

64
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,353
It is so good to see you.

65
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,914
It's like...

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,640
No, it's like coming home,
nothing's changed.

67
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,194
Tell me about it.

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,193
I'm not regular faculty, that's all.

69
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,956
Still no vacancies
for a classical historian.

70
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,550
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,597
If there is anything I can do.
It'll happen.

72
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,673
Otherwise, Oxford's still great.

73
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,959
The coven's pretty active.
We're meeting tonight for the equinox.

74
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,316
You'll know loads of us
if you wanted to come.

75
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,400
I'm still not comfortable
around magic.

76
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,077
Not after what happened to my parents.

77
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,834
I still find it...

78
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,954
I just find it difficult.

79
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,480
Do you not use your powers at all?

80
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,712
I am a walking disaster on that front.

81
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,837
My powers are so unpredictable.

82
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,470
This morning, it happened
by accident in public.

83
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,076
I mean, no one saw,
but they could have.

84
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,400
You should speak to Sylvia about that.

85
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,696
She's the head of coven now.
She might be able to help you.

86
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,552
It's OK. I'm used to it.

87

I hear your lecture impressed
a few people yesterday.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,469
So, now you've got to get
that paper finished, right?

93
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,200
What do you need?

94
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,230
Ashmole 37, 92, 183 and 782.

95
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,676
No problem. Be with you shortly.

96
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,114
Thanks.

- Hey.
- How's it going?

102
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,037
Oh, just the usual, you know.

103
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,990
There you go, the Ashmole manuscripts.

104
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Thank you.

105
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,800
Right, so, I'm out by the call desk.

106
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,395
Maybe we could have a coffee later?
Yeah, great.

107
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,199
- Awesome. See you.
- OK, bye.

Diana!

131
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,640
What happened in there?

132
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,231
GILLIAN: Did you feel it?
I don't think the humans did.

133
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,279
That Ashmole manuscript,
there was something weird about it.

134
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,197
Did you see anything unusual?

135
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,520
Diana, are you all right?

136
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Diana?

00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,072
Where are you going?

138
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,960
MARCUS:
So I presume I'm seeing you tonight.

139
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,394
- No.
- Come on.

140
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,096
No.
James, look, I've found a new place.

141
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,874
JAMES: I've just been on
a 12-hour shift. I'm going home to crash.

142
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,136
Last week was a mistake
and I admit last week was a mistake.

143
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,416
That's what you said last week.
Tuesday's better than the weekend.

144
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,035
You can get a booth,
it stays open till 3:00am...

145
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,396
3:00am, midweek?
Are you off your rocker?

146
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,520
And I'm pretty sure the DJ plays
almost exclusively '90s R&B.

147
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,877
See, when I'm not on shift,
I'm in bed by 12.

148
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,998
How come you never look tired?
I'm not a lightweight like you.

149
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,400
A-huh.

150
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,313
Have a good sleep.

151
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,519

No.

MARCUS PANTS

163
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,231
Matthew, have you been here all night?

164
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,870
She's a witch, Miriam, a powerful one
if her family's anything to go by.

165
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,116
Who is?

166
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,874
The academic I overheard
outside the Bodleian.

167
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,277
She's a direct descendant
of Bridget Bishop

168
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,576
the first woman to be executed
at the Salem witch trials.

169
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,592
You think what happened yesterday
was witchcraft?

170
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,480
I don't know, but she'd just taken out
an alchemical manuscript.

171
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,154
An Ashmole manuscript.

172
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,119
Come on, Matthew

173
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,714
it's not possible.

174
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,996
What, that she's found
Ashmole 782? Why?

175
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,480
Because you've been looking
for that book for over 100 years.

176
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,710
Longer.

177
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,316
Ever since I began to believe that it
could help us understand our origins.

178
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,880
It's missing.

179
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,714
It's always been missing.
How could this witch have found it?

180
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,038
Perhaps it wasn't missing.

181
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,239
Perhaps it was waiting.

182
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,034

Hello.

189
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,677
Hey. Er, it's me.

190
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,196
Hey. You alright?

191
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,476
It's five o'clock in the morning,
Diana.

192
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,313
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

193
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,517
<i>Something's happened.</i>

194
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,320
You all right, honey?
DIANA: <i>I was in the Bod studying.</i>

195
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,959
<i>I took out a manuscript.</i>

196
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,271
But it was bewitched or something.

197
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,918
Was it a grimoire?
<i>It was an Ashmole manuscript.</i>

198
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,959
There were alchemical illustrations.
Uhhuh, what else?

199
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,875
Er...

200
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,191
Moving under the pages.

201
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,599
I couldn't read it.

202
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,592
Definitely sounds
like it was bewitched.

203
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,400
How did you unravel the spell?
Did you say any words?

204
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,835
There was no witchcraft involved,
Sarah.

205
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,480
<i>How many times?
You know I refuse to practise.</i>

206
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,914
<i>I couldn't wait to get rid of it.</i>

207
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,434
I returned it. <i>- What?</i>

208
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,029
<i>Diana, we've always told you...</i>

209
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,918
if you ever come across
something magical...

210
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,152
<i>you should always, always,
try to understand it!</i>

211
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,675
Honey, what is happening?
It's Diana.

212
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,717
She's discovered some magical book.

213
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,918
<i>That is not even why I called.
It's...</i>

214
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,152
It's what happened afterwards.

215
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,358
I think... I think I saw Dad.

216
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,837
What do you mean, you saw your dad?
<i>He was just as I remembered him.</i>

217
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,037
<i>What do you think it means?</i>

218
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,517
Well, honey, we're not
gonna know now, are we?

219
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,674
You've given it back. Really, Diana,
it's time you faced what you are

220
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,035
a witch!

221
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,158
<i>We've been over this, Sarah.
I'm an historian, that's what I am.</i>

222
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,431
Oxford might offer me a professorship.

223
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,672
Oh, honey!
That is wonderful news, Diana.

224
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,558
<i>Well, I don't have it yet.</i>

225
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,393
I have to get a paper written.

226
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,711
Wai t! Wai t!
You can't just hide in your work.

227
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,792
You saw your father.
This is important.

228
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,793
<i>If the book is bewitched, there's no
telling how you unlocked the spell.</i>

229
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,112
You have to take the book out again.
Work out what's going on.

230
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,238
That may be what you would do, Sarah,
but I'm not you.

231
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,074
<i>I called for your advice,
not another lecture.</i>

232
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,156
Well, you know how
she feels about all this.

233
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,550
Give her time to cool off, honey,
and try again.

234
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,838

registration number's right?

00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520

243
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,950
I'm a doctor.
I was trying to save his life.

244
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
Hey, Matthew.

245
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,714
Think of the risks you took.
You could've been seen.

246
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,519
James was my friend
and a brilliant doctor.

247
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,256
I couldn't bear for all that
potential to go to waste.

248
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,476
Did you even get his consent?

249
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,392
Christ, Marcus!

250
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,153
How many times do you have to be told?

251
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,640
Alright, I messed up.

252
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,359
Why didn't it work?

253
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,156

Marcus is our new research subject.

257
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,720
Another failed siring.

258
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,231
Would you take his bloods and do
a cheek swab? Thank you, Miriam.

259
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,996
Hello, Miriam.

I'll need that.

262
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,433
And roll up your sleeve.

263
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,834

00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,360
You knew that there'd been other
failed sirings, so why the secrecy?

268
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,920
You're not meant to be siring anyone.

269
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,111
Do I have to haul you both out of here
or can we finish our wine first?

270
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,118
You know I didn't plan to sire James.

271
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,216
If there had been more time,
I would have asked permission.

272
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,960
And if I'd known
there was a risk of failure

273
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,918
I never would have attempted it.

274
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,118
Matthew, his last moments

275
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,196
were ugly, confused

276
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,070
and desperate, but he didn't know why.

277
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,235
I did that.

278
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,477
He was my friend and I took
his death away from him for nothing.

The reason I didn't tell you...

281
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,879
is because we're all in the dark.

282
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,751
We know there's a problem,
but we don't know the cause

283
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,150
and that's the reason...

284
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,074
that we need the book.

285
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,270
Matthew thinks Ashmole 782
covers early creature history.

286
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,118
It could help us
understand our evolution

287
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,714
our origins.

288
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,952
The witches cannot be allowed
to have that information.

289
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,433
Some would want to use that knowledge
to destroy us.

290
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,079
So what do we do?

291
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,834
I talk to Dr Bishop.

292
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,474
And if need be...

293
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,997
we take the book for ourselves.

- Dr Bishop.

304
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,832
I found your article
on colour symbolism

305
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,389
in alchemical transformation
fascinating

306
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,631
and your work on
Robert Boyle's approach

307
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,839
to problems of expansion and
contraction quietly persuasive.

308
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,480
You have a wonderful way
of evoking the past for the reader.

309
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,196
Thank you.

310
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,155
I'm hardly likely to forget you now,
after that.

311
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,315
I didn't think that witches were
allowed to show their magic in public.

312
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,677
I didn't mean for that to happen.

313
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,956
Not in control of yourself, Dr Bishop?

314
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,952
I'm perfectly in control.

315
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,077
Thank you.

316
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,991
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Professor Clairmont

317
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,309
I have to get back to my work.

00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,149
Focus.

320
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,359
- Gillian.
- Sylvia.

321
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,715
Is everything all right?

322
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,038
The disturbance we all felt. Your
text said if anyone knew anything.

323
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
Yes?

324
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,832
I think maybe I do.

325
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,914
BELL TOLLS

00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,833

329
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
DOOR CLOSES

330
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,919
Anything of interest?

331
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,551
You're following me.
Well, we work in the same place.

332
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,950
It's hardly strange that our paths
should cross again.

333
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,672
You knew who I was yesterday.

334
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,958
I'd call that a professional hazard.

335
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,360
Your photograph's on the back
of all your books.

336
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,078
Checked in with the staff at the Bod.

337
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,280
You were in and out of there
in five minutes max.

338
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,874
You were looking for me.

339
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,952
Not because you enjoyed
my thesis on Robert Boyle.

340
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,350
What do you want, Professor Clairmont?

341
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,516
That's a fair question.

342
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,039
You called up an Ashmole manuscript
earlier this week

343
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,474
and something happened

344
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,554
something that disturbed you.

345
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,720
Was it Ashmole 782?

346
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,272
I'm assuming you used magic
to retrieve it.

347
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,949
Why do you care?
Alchemy's not your area.

348
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,794
This is about a great deal more
than just alchemy.

349
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,360
Where's the manuscript now?

350
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,200
Where it always is. You can't take
books out of the Bodleian.

351
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,390
Excuse me.
Dr Bishop, please hear me out.

352
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,631
No one has seen that book
for a very long time

353
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,280
and it's not just me who wants it.
Word is spreading.

354
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,600
It might be safer for you

355
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,514
if the creatures of Oxford knew
that it was longer in your possession.

356
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
Is that a threat?

357
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,231
No. It's a warning.

358
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,874
You need to be careful.

359
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
I will be.

360
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,712
Goodbye, Professor Clairmont.

361

BELL TOLLS

362
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,153
- Sean.
- Yeah?

363
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,674
I need a drink.

364
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,240
NOISY INDISTINCT CHATTER

365
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,234
For you.
So now I know what you drink.

366
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,436
I know what you read.

367
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,955
Pretty much everything pre-1800.

368
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,952
What else is there?

369
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,797
Oh, come on.

370
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,076
Family? Brothers, sisters?

371
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,389
I'm an only child.

372
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,031
I, er... I was actually raised
by my aunt and her partner.

373
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,793
- Oh.
- Yeah.

374
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,280
My parents died.

375
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,070
Both of them?

376
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,000
Car crash or something?

377
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,114
They were, er... They were murdered.

378
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,758
I shouldn't have asked. You
really don't have to talk about it.

379
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,275
It's OK.

380
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,829
They were on a research trip

381
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,911
to a village
on the Ukraine-Russia border.

382
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,634
We think the villagers turned on them.

383
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,153
They thought that they...

384
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,200
that they were witches.

385
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,680
Witches?

386
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,637
Some people still believe in witches.

387
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,713
That magic is real.

388
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,752
They believe in other creatures too.
Superstitious crap.

389
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,880
I don't know how people
can still be so ignorant.

390
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,037
We're living in the 21st century.

391
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,878
I'm so sorry, Diana.

The bed's still warm though.

00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,153
She can't be far away.

398
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,034
We never are.

399
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,198
Where'd you come from, witch?

402
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,040
I found him in the local pub.

403
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,557
Told him about the witch in the woods.

404
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,477
Humans and their prejudices.

405
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,949
Tell me...

406
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,552
are you always this assertive?

407
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,439
The equinox gives me an edge.

408
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,109
You've proven yourself
more than worthy, Satu.

409
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,271
I shall take you to be sworn
into the congregation.

410
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,198
But we have work to do first.

411
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,200
There's been a disturbance.

412
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,113
He's already put in his requests.

413
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,040
These are his two.
Give them to him, will you?

414
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,315
Sure.

415
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
- Hey.
- Hey.

416
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,870
What's going on?
Some hotshot scientist

417
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,792
has graced us with his presence.

418
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,394
Sorry, he requested 83.

419
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,510
Yours, Professor Clairmont.

420
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,520
Thank you.

421
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,956
Good morning.

422
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,480

00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,399
I'm sorry, am I bothering you?

425
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
No.

426
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,677
I'm just surprised you find
a southern exposure comfortable.

427
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,598
You don't believe
everything you read, do you?

428
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,955
Alright, then.

429
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,996
I thought that you
might like some company.

430
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,836
The library's busy today.
Quite a few witches here.

431
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,309
You see?

432
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,640
Hey.

433
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,629
So what? They often work in here.

434
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,430
They're here to watch you.

435
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,191
I did warn you that other creatures
would take an interest in you.

436
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,831
They're looking at me
because I'm talking to you.

437
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,296
They are not the ones
with the problem.

438
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,152
MAN: Do you mind?

439
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,117
- Leaving so soon?
- Yeah.

Diana.

443
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,515
Hey.

444
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,831
That was a vampire.

445
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,635
Yes, yeah.
What was he doing in the library?

446
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,118
I don't know any more than you do.

447
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
But he talked to you.

448
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,310
Yeah, he'd read my works.

449
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,274
It's not a big deal.

450
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,474
They're very dangerous and they
hate us as much as we hate them.

451
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,635
Hopefully, he'll be gone by tomorrow.

452
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,836
Yeah.

453
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,880
I'm going back to my rooms to work.
OK.

454
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,360
Sure.

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,636
Welcome to Oxford, Mr Knox.

459
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,633
It's such
an honour to have you in our city.

460
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,837
Come in. Don't linger out there.

461
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,592
So, Miss Chamberlain.

462
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,909
Hello.

463
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,590
- Please, sit down.
- DOOR CLOSES.

464
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,431
Now, tell me exactly what happened?

465
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,160
There was this Ashmole manuscript
in the Bodleian Library

466
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,437
- an alchemical one.
- Old?

467
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,319
Medieval, two clasps,
distinctive binding.

468
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,120
My friend took it out.

469
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,629
If it's the book I think it is

470
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
then I've been looking for it
for a very long time.

471
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,673
What's the name of your friend?

472
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,199
- Um...
- You heard him.

473
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,640
The name.

474
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,800
Diana Bishop.

475
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,715
Do you actually think it's safe
down here in the dark, Dr Bishop?

476
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,040
Are you stalking me?

477
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,354
I'm merely pointing out
that rowing on your own is a risk.

478
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,870
So...

479
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,919
<i>The Book Of Life,</i>
what did you do with it?

480
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,400
I don't know what that is.

481
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,551
A witch of your powers,
how could you not know?

482
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,197
Just because you saw me in
the library. That was unusual for me.

483
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,237
I don't use magic.
Don't lie to me, Diana.

484
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,640
I can feel your power.

485
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,917
If you want the book,
why don't you go get it?

486
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,669
I told you, I gave it back.
I don't believe you.

487
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,436
OK, let's say I'm lying.
What are you going to do?

488
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,274
Rip my head off
to get the truth out of me?

489
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,475
I could.

490
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,678
But it's not how I operate.

491
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,394
I'm going to say this to you
one more time.

492
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,517
I don't have your book.

493
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,200
Ashmole 782 has been missing
for centuries

494
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,033
and yet you were able to call it up.

495
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,157
Aren't you curious why?

496
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,115
That book has never appeared to me
or anyone else

497
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,634
no matter what we've done.

498
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,313
Only to you.

499
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,916
It could be the key to our survival

500
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,314
so isn't it strange that the only
creature who can summon it

501
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,710
is a witch who can't
control her magic?

502
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,472
Walk past me slowly.

503
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,316
No sudden movement.

504
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
Go!

505
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,640
But don't run.

506
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,834
HAMISH: What's going on?

507
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,391
I came up here to get away
from a witch. I'm craving her.

508
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,870
Good hunting.

509
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,119
HAMISH: <i>If you hurt her,
you'll never forgive yourself.</i>

510
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,511
KNOX: <i>Vampires abuse their longevity
to gain far too much control.</i>

511
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,277
GERBERT: <i>This dead tourist is
a brazen vampire killing.</i>

512
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,717
MATTHEW: Other creatures will want the
book. Why is it so important to you?

513
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,154
It could tell us how we...

514
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,033
created vampires.

515
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,716
If we created them,
then we could uncreate them.

515
00:44:18,305 --> 00:45:18,896

00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,060
Matthieu!

2
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,260
Over there.

4
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,578
I used to know a Matthew.

5
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,100
It's Matthieu.

6
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,180
You have blood on your face.

7
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,380
Matthew!

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,018
Once the world was full of wonders,

10
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,778
but it belongs to humans now.

11
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,898
We creatures
have all but disappeared -

12
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,378
demons, vampires and witches...

13
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,060
hiding in plain sight,
ill at ease, even with each other.

14
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,138
But, as my father used to say,
in every ending...

15
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,580
there is a new beginning.

16
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,698
-New trousers, Hamish?
-Morning.

17
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,378
You really didn't need to be here,
you know.

18
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,618
"Hello, Hamish. Nice to see you."
Good to see you, too, Matthew.

19
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,258
-I can quite well go hunting on my own.
-It's good to have a break from London.

20
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,498
I've been meaning to get out
on the moors, anyway.

21
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,060
John's preparing the car.

22
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,338
I see you've redecorated.

23
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,858
I thought the place
needed brightening up.

24
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,180
Looks like a wedding cake.

25
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,498
You didn't come all the way up here
to diss my interiors, Matt.

26
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,978
-What's going on?
-It's complex.

27
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,218
Isn't it always with you?

28
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,578
-This is even more...
-What? Fucked up?

29
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,140
Look at the two of us.
A vampire friends with a demon.

30
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,780
I came up here
to get away from a witch.

31
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,020
When you say "get away"...

32
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,700
-do you mean?
-I'm craving her.

33
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,098
Who are you?
You can't come in here without...

34
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,138
My boss will call you
in three seconds to give it.

35
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,340
I'm looking for the body
of the tourist found last night.

36
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,380
Yes?

37
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,540
Yes.

38
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,380
Of course, sir.

39
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,420
The body?

40
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,620
He has no blood in him.

41
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,220
And there was no blood at the scene.
It's... strange.

42
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,660
Is there any background on him?

43
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,220
He was French.

44
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,620
Name?

45
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,260
Matthieu Beny.

46
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,740
Matthew.

47
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,900
Stop.

48
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,820
-Where?
-About 35 meters below the ridgeline.

49
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,580
Good hunting.

50
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,298
-Hey. Busy today.
-Don't know why.

51
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,220
Students aren't back yet.

52
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,340
Dr Bishop.

53
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,458
May I help you?

54
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,380
My name's Peter Knox.

55
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,940
I presume there aren't usually this
many other creatures in the library.

56
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,740
Well... no.

57
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,580
So I suppose word has spread about
the Ashmole manuscript you took out.

58
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,818
Sorry, I'm waiting on a book.

59
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,218
You're quite right to keep it quiet,

60
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,460
but I assure you I am a friend.

61
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,580
Shall we discuss this over coffee?

62
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,780
I don't think so.

63
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,180
Or are you a tea drinker
like your mother was?

64
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,310
Did you know my father, too?

65
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,790
Only slightly.

66
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,910
Your mother and I met
when we were teenagers.

67
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,750
I was very fond of her.

68
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,910
What was she like?

69
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,228
Passionate, clever,

70
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,588
stubborn as a mule
when she wanted to be.

71
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,950
Really?!

72
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,030
It's truly terrible what happened.

73
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,388
I've thought about you
a good deal over the years and...

74
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,190
I've wanted to introduce myself,
but your aunt's very protective.

75
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,510
Yeah.

76
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,390
-Could we get tea for two, please?
-Yes, sir.

77
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,670
Feeling better?

78
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,510
Yes.

79
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,790
Thank you.

80
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,910
I think you're wise
to keep your distance from the witch.

81
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,628
Yes. But the problem is, she's in
possession of something that I need.

82
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,950
Or rather...

83
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,790
she's capable of retrieving it.

84
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,548
-So, er, did you just call it up?
-Yeah.

85
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,188
How?

86
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,348
Er, the... the normal way.

87
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,388
That's odd because I requested
Ashmole 782 this morning

88
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,908
and it isn't there.

89
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,828
-Not there?
-Missing.

90
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,190
According to the Bodleian catalog
it's been missing for years.

91
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,108
But how could it be?

92
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,988
That doesn't make any sense.
I took it out.

93
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,348
You did return it, I take it?

94
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,988
Of course!

95
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,028
I would never steal a book from the Bod.

96
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,830
No. It could be the date.

97
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,148
Yeah. Maybe the book only shows itself
around the time of the equinox.

98
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,068
Or... or it could be
that there's a spell on it

99
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,628
and that somehow, for some reason,
you broke it.

100
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,990
I'm not my mother, Mr Knox,
I didn't inherit her powers.

101
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,068
-What happened when you opened it?
-I only looked at one page.

102
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,948
What was on it?

103
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,750
-A picture.
-Of what?

104
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,228
The alchemical child.

105
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,190
There must have been more.
You must have seen more.

106
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,148
Why is it so important to you?

107
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,828
Because if this book
is what I think it is,

108
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,230
it contains the witches' first spells.

109
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,470
It could tell us
how we created vampires.

110
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,748
-That's just a myth.
-Vampires have used

111
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,748
their brute power and longevity

112
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,590
to gain far too much control,
but if we created them...

113
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,710
then we could uncreate them.

114
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,110
I won't have any part of that.

115
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,908
You have to try and take it out again.

116
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,948
You're the only person
who's seen it in years.

117
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,830
Let go of my arm!

118
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,110
I'm quite sure
I'll see you again, Diana.

119
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,510
Not as amenable as I'd hoped.

120
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,230
We might need to use firmer tactics.

121
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,228
Juliette, good evening.

122
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,988
If you're here to see my father,
he's not to be disturbed.

123
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,430
I think he's going to want to hear
what I have to say.

124
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,670
This better be important.

125
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,830
It is.

126
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,830
It's a police matter.

127
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,670
Leave us.

128
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,548
To be honest, I still don't get
what you're so anxious about.

129
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,908
How could taking out a book
for a senior witch do any harm?

130
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,988
Come on, you were in the library.
You felt it.

131
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,668
This... this book is powerful
and I...I don't...

132
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,910
I don't trust what Peter Knox might
do with it. He hates other species.

133
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,748
He'll use it against them.

134
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,108
It's no concern of ours.

135
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,428
I don't even know how he knew
I took it out in the first place.

136
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,948
-These things get out.
-I just...

137
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,748
I don't want to have
anything to do with it.

138
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,028
I want to lead a normal life.
I want to be normal.

139
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,268
I've known you for ten years.
You couldn't be normal if you tried.

140
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,350
It's so typical something like this
would happen to you.

141
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,470
What shall do, Gillian?

142
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,830
Just get it out for him
and forget all about it.

143
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,228
Carry on with your paper.

144
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,948
Yeah, but that's nearly impossible
with all these...

145
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,470
creatures and the library.

146
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,268
Not the vampire
that was following you before?

147
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,708
No.
He seems to have given up on me.

148
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,550
Oh, that's are relief at least.

149
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,308
I don't know.

150
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,310
There is something about him.

151
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:04,870
CHe... He seemed to know more
about the book than anyone else.

152
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,188
I should asked him about it.
Instead, I...

153
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,310
-I told him to leave me alone.
-You're quite right, too.

154
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,068
Have you ever talked to them?

155
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,308
No.

156
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,908
So you don't know what they're like?

157
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,150
And you do, after one conversation?

158
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,750
He didn't seem to be as prejudiced
against us as we are against them.

159
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,868
I gotta go.

160
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,428
Been invited to one
of the dean's awful parties.

161
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,068
Thank you.

162
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,110
Sorry to burden you with this.

163
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,348
So even though Ashmole 782 might be
the answer to our problems, Hamish,

164
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,868
my interest in it puts her in danger.

165
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,468
It seems we're all in danger, Matt,
if we don't get that book.

166
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,948
You know that daemon suicides
are on the rise?

167
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,068
As are mental health problems,
homelessness.

168
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,068
Yes, I know.

169
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,068
I've been looking into the statistics.

170
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,110
We are struggling.

171
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,988
If this book could
explain our origins...

172
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,150
Yes. Wouldn't that be
something, my friend?

173
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,228
-Where's Matthew?
-He's not here.

174
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,950
Oh, just, he said he'd ring me
with the results.

175
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,910
Have they come through yet?

176
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,550
James' have.

177
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,030
His blood tests are normal.

178
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,950
So the problem's with me then?

179
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,270
It seems so.

180
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,510
That was quick.

181
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,150
What did you do to your hand?

182
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,590
I think the book did that to you
when you opened it.

183
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,828
Who are you?
You were in the library.

184
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,508
You were the magnet for it.

185
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,590
Magic attracts magic.

186
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,630
But yours is hidden.

187
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,470
Someone did something to you.

188
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,750
Oh.

189
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,390
You did it to yourself.

190
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,148
Do you fear persecution?

191
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,590
Is that it?

192
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,750
I haven't until now.

193
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,350
You were with Peter Knox.
You tell him I won't get out his book.

194
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,910
This isn't just about the book.

195
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,230
It's about you.

196
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:00,823
Hey, Em.

197
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:03,743
-Have you heard of Peter Knox?
-Peter Knox is in Oxford?

198
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:05,223
He said he knew Mum.

199
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:08,703
-Yeah, he was crazy about her.
-I thought so, from what he said.

200
00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:10,543
Tried to persuade her
not to marry your father.

201
00:21:10,545 --> 00:21:12,063
Did she like him?

202
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:15,823
They were friends in the early days
and then he just got into some stuff.

203
00:21:15,825 --> 00:21:18,903
-What?
-Dark magic.

204
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:21,143
Why is Peter Knox in Oxford?

205
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:22,903
The book I told you about.

206
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:24,783
He wants it.

207
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:27,905
Your father distrusted him
and, by the end, your mum did too.

208
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:31,545
Be careful of him, Diana.

209
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,985
Juliette.

210
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:43,905
A word.

211
00:21:56,145 --> 00:21:58,945
Where were you two nights ago?

212
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:02,303
Seeing the city at night.

213
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:04,623
You said I was allowed.

214
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,343
I said...

215
00:22:06,345 --> 00:22:09,583
as long as you were good.

216
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:13,543
-I have been.
-If there's something I don't know,

217
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:16,183
Baldwin can use it against me.

218
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:20,663
-Baldwin's not even in Venice.
-He sees and hears anyway!

219
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:22,783
This dead tourist...

220
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:26,183
is a brazen vampire killing.

221
00:22:26,185 --> 00:22:28,703
And Domenico...

222
00:22:28,705 --> 00:22:31,625
the nosey little fucker...

223
00:22:32,825 --> 00:22:35,783
smelt you on him.

224
00:22:35,785 --> 00:22:38,063
That's not true.

225
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,145
Domenico hates me.

226
00:23:05,705 --> 00:23:07,025
Matthew!

227
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:28,863
You taught me to crave Matthew!

228
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,185
No!

229
00:23:31,385 --> 00:23:34,823
Father! Father!

230
00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:37,463
This book you say Diana called up.

231
00:23:37,465 --> 00:23:40,103
-Mm.
-I've heard stories about it.

232
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:43,183
The witches stole it from the vampires.
The vampires stole it from the witches.

233
00:23:43,185 --> 00:23:46,543
-That's untrue.
-Demons, of course, don't get a look in.

234
00:23:46,545 --> 00:23:48,303
We know it's important to us
but we don't know why

235
00:23:48,305 --> 00:23:50,785
and we're not even allowed to ask.

236
00:23:51,785 --> 00:23:54,943
The general feeling being we matter
so much less than the other creatures.

237
00:23:54,945 --> 00:23:56,943
Can we not have a political argument?

238
00:23:56,945 --> 00:23:59,383
It's easy for you to say. You're not
treated like a third-class citizen.

239
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:01,225
It's hardly like you are.

240
00:24:02,145 --> 00:24:03,823
You practically run
the City of London.

241
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:06,865
That's not the point. I'm an anomaly.

242
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:10,985
Checkmate.

243
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:15,025
There is more to the game
than protecting your queen.

244
00:24:24,785 --> 00:24:27,063
Wait! Think before your next move.

245
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,823
No, other creatures
will want the book.

246
00:24:29,825 --> 00:24:32,343
I have to obtain it from Diana
before they do.

247
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,543
I know you need the book,
but couldn't Marcus do it?

248
00:24:34,545 --> 00:24:37,543
Marcus? Not letting Marcus
anywhere near Diana.

249
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:40,143
He's much less of a danger
to Diana than you are!

250
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,823
Think what's happened in the past
to women you've craved.

251
00:24:42,825 --> 00:24:44,865
Elena, Cecilia.

252
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:48,623
I wish I'd never told you.

253
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:51,745
But you did because you wanted me
to be your conscience.

254
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:55,263
After Cecilia,

255
00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:57,623
I swore to myself that
I would never get involved

256
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:59,783
with another warmblood again
and you know that!

257
00:24:59,785 --> 00:25:02,663
But, Matt, you've never
talked about another woman

258
00:25:02,665 --> 00:25:05,065
the way you do about Diana Bishop.

259
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:08,545
I'm just trying to protect you.

260
00:25:09,545 --> 00:25:12,263
-I'll try to take your advice.
-Don't try.

261
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:17,185
Do. If you hurt her, you'll never
forgive yourself and I couldn't bear it.

262
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:19,463
Don't go back to Oxford

263
00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:23,025
until you're sure you can control
yourself around Diana Bishop.

264
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:40,663
Dr Bishop.

265
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:43,623
-Good evening, Professor Marsh.
-Welcome.

266
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:48,023
-Thank you.
-I understand you gave an excellent talk

267
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:50,743
and that you are writing it up.

268
00:25:50,745 --> 00:25:52,903
Yes, yes, I am indeed.

269
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:55,903
And I look forward to reading it.

270
00:25:55,905 --> 00:26:00,383
-We want to get you on that shortlist.
-Well, thank you.

271
00:26:00,385 --> 00:26:04,863
Now, there's someone
I would really like you to meet.

272
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:08,743
He has a very interesting
specialization,

273
00:26:08,745 --> 00:26:12,745
the occult... sciences.

274
00:26:18,105 --> 00:26:21,185
Alchemy. It's quite a subject.

275
00:26:22,785 --> 00:26:26,745
Especially for someone who says
she lacks interest in magic.

276
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:30,223
I don't just lack interest.

277
00:26:30,225 --> 00:26:33,663
-I lack aptitude.
-Are you sure?

278
00:26:33,665 --> 00:26:35,863
The book came out for you
and no one else.

279
00:26:35,865 --> 00:26:38,783
I told you,
I don't know how that happened.

280
00:26:38,785 --> 00:26:41,465
But you didn't tell me
a vampire's been following you.

281
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:43,983
How do you know that?

282
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:46,703
It would be catastrophic
if it falls into their hands.

283
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:49,263
Can't you see the danger you're in?

284
00:26:49,265 --> 00:26:51,183
I can take care of myself.

285
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:53,343
Laudable, but naive.

286
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,863
The fact that vampires
are now involved

287
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,423
makes this so much more urgent.

288
00:26:57,425 --> 00:27:00,143
-I'm not going to call it up for you.
-Why not?

289
00:27:00,145 --> 00:27:05,023
Because I don't happen to like
the idea of uncreating other species.

290
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:07,463
They would do exactly the same to us,
if they could.

291
00:27:07,465 --> 00:27:12,105
I'm like my mother, Mr Knox.
If I've made up my mind,

292
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,385
I don't change it.

293
00:27:21,545 --> 00:27:22,865
Diana.

294
00:27:24,985 --> 00:27:27,345
Think about what you're doing.

295
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,703
You must be true to your blood,

296
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:32,823
your heritage.

297
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:35,425
Don't make me force you
to recall that book.

298
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,545
Diana.

299
00:27:42,705 --> 00:27:44,185
Don't walk away!

300
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:52,745
You can't escape me that easily.

301
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,825
I can be with you wherever you are.

302
00:27:58,305 --> 00:28:00,583
I need the book.

303
00:28:00,585 --> 00:28:02,865
We need the book.

304
00:28:14,865 --> 00:28:17,065
Get out of my head!

305
00:28:58,185 --> 00:28:59,823
How's it going with Diana?

306
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:02,543
Did she get the manuscript
out for you?

307
00:29:02,545 --> 00:29:03,865
No.

308
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:08,583
Last night, she performed
an elemental spell.

309
00:29:08,585 --> 00:29:13,783
-What? Diana did?
-Did you know she was powerful?

310
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,423
No, I... I...

311
00:29:15,425 --> 00:29:17,423
I can't believe...

312
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:19,865
She's never shown she is.

313
00:29:22,265 --> 00:29:26,225
Maybe she's used her magic
to forward her career.

314
00:29:28,705 --> 00:29:31,825
And that's why
she's kept it secret from you.

315
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,745
Oh, thank God you're here.
You haven't been answering your phone.

316
00:30:04,745 --> 00:30:08,023
If this book is what I think it is,
vampires...

317
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:10,345
then we could uncreate them.

318
00:30:13,065 --> 00:30:17,103
I don't even know how he knew
I took it out in the first place.

319
00:30:17,105 --> 00:30:19,145
These things get out.

320
00:30:22,425 --> 00:30:24,585
This isn't just about the book.

321
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,705
It's about you.

322
00:30:30,465 --> 00:30:33,185
This is about a great deal more
than just alchemy.

323
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:38,423
Ashmole 782 has been missing
for centuries

324
00:30:38,425 --> 00:30:41,825
and yet you were able to call it up.
Aren't you curious why?

325
00:30:48,025 --> 00:30:50,385
You need to be careful.

326
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,225
Professor Clairmont's rooms, please.

327
00:31:58,915 --> 00:32:03,715
You were right about creatures
coming to look for the book.

328
00:32:06,155 --> 00:32:10,993
Peter Knox from the Congregation
and there was this Scandinavian witch.

329
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,875
I don't know...
I don't know who she was.

330
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,793
Try to calm down.
Your adrenaline is very high.

331
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:21,315
-You can smell my adrenaline?
-Course I can.

332
00:32:29,635 --> 00:32:30,955
Thank you.

333
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:38,753
Why did you come to me?

334
00:32:38,755 --> 00:32:41,233
Last time I saw you, you said
you never wanted to see me again.

335
00:32:41,235 --> 00:32:44,115
-I have no one else to talk to.
-You must have friends.

336
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:48,155
None I can trust.

337
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:53,913
It was a mistake to come here.

338
00:32:53,915 --> 00:32:57,075
-I'm sorry I disturbed you.
-Does Knox want the book?

339
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:02,513
He says it has the witches'
first spells in it.

340
00:33:02,515 --> 00:33:04,393
Is that what you think it is?

341
00:33:04,395 --> 00:33:08,153
Peter Knox believes that witches
created everything and everyone.

342
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:10,115
I'm obviously not of that opinion.

343
00:33:12,395 --> 00:33:15,433
-Does he know that you sent it back?
-Yes.

344
00:33:15,435 --> 00:33:17,073
He wants me to try
and get it out again.

345
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:18,955
-Will you?
-I don't want him to have it.

346
00:33:52,235 --> 00:33:57,955
"Dear sir, Your letter of 15th October
has reached me at last."

347
00:34:02,395 --> 00:34:05,753
-You knew Charles Darwin?
-Yes.

348
00:34:05,755 --> 00:34:08,033
I met him on a number of occasions,

349
00:34:08,035 --> 00:34:11,393
particularly when he was building up
to his publication of Origin.

350
00:34:11,395 --> 00:34:14,993
I began to wonder how his theories
might relate to us creatures.

351
00:34:14,995 --> 00:34:17,153
I was desperate
to understand our origins.

352
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,993
You see, I'd already heard rumors,
whisperings,

353
00:34:19,995 --> 00:34:21,953
about a book

354
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:24,353
hidden from human eyes,
an alchemical text.

355
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:26,875
-Ashmole 782.
-Ashmole.

356
00:34:29,115 --> 00:34:32,993
That man had an uncanny ability
to find bizarre manuscripts.

357
00:34:32,995 --> 00:34:34,995
I found and read every one of them.

358
00:34:37,435 --> 00:34:40,073
Apart from 782.

359
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:44,113
You've been searching for the book
since 1859.

360
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,435
Mm.

361
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:49,753
-How old are you?
-I'm older than I look.

362
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,353
300 years?

363
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,675
Mm.

364
00:34:53,555 --> 00:34:55,075
500 years?

365
00:34:57,715 --> 00:34:59,875
Did you know Machiavelli?

366
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:03,915
-Survive the fall of Carthage?
-Which fall of Carthage?

367
00:35:06,595 --> 00:35:08,313
I'd like to show you my laboratory.

368
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:11,115
The work we've been doing recently
links into creature origin.

369
00:35:12,635 --> 00:35:15,715
I won't harm you.
You have my word.

370
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:19,315
All right.

371
00:35:22,715 --> 00:35:24,795
Put this on.

372
00:35:27,315 --> 00:35:29,515
-You're cold.
-How do you know that?

373
00:35:33,635 --> 00:35:36,673
Adrenalin causes a rise
in metabolic heat production.

374
00:35:36,675 --> 00:35:39,275
Your adrenalin has dropped
and so has your heart rate.

375
00:35:40,755 --> 00:35:42,755
You can hear my heart?

376
00:35:43,795 --> 00:35:45,115
Yes.

377
00:35:46,715 --> 00:35:48,515
All the time.

378
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,593
We're among hundreds of laboratories
using genetics

379
00:35:56,595 --> 00:35:59,713
to study species origin,
but in our lab

380
00:35:59,715 --> 00:36:02,315
humans aren't the only species
we're studying.

381
00:36:03,755 --> 00:36:06,553
-You're studying vampire genetics?
-Mm.

382
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:08,993
Witches and demons, too.

383
00:36:08,995 --> 00:36:12,993
We take physical specimens
from burial sites mostly

384
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:15,315
and extract DNA from the samples.

385
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:17,795
Hey, Matthew!

386
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,475
He's been helping me
while you've been away.

387
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:24,793
Diana, this is my colleague and
lab manager, Dr Miriam Shepherd.

388
00:36:24,795 --> 00:36:26,873
Miriam, this is Dr Diana Bishop.

389
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:29,993
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-And I'm Dr Marcus Whitmore.

390
00:36:29,995 --> 00:36:32,235
Different type of doctor.

391
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:38,313
Wow!
AB negative.

392
00:36:38,315 --> 00:36:39,913
Don't suppose I could take
some of you blood, could I?

393
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:41,793
It's tough getting a sample
from a living witch.

394
00:36:41,795 --> 00:36:43,313
No... thank you.

395
00:36:43,315 --> 00:36:46,593
If your friend isn't here to give
blood, what is she here for exactly?

396
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:49,993
I wanted to show Diana that
the work we're doing here proves

397
00:36:49,995 --> 00:36:51,913
beyond all doubt...

398
00:36:51,915 --> 00:36:54,195
that creatures are dying out.

399
00:36:55,995 --> 00:36:58,113
Vampires are failing to sire.

400
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:00,193
Demons are increasingly
prone to madness.

401
00:37:00,195 --> 00:37:01,515
And witches?

402
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,315
Are losing their powers.

403
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:08,795
Come and see.

404
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:13,875
Please, sit down.

405
00:37:15,195 --> 00:37:17,635
-Allow me.
-Thank you.

406
00:37:20,715 --> 00:37:24,673
Now, this graph shows
the mitochondrial DNA

407
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,553
of a witch named Benvenguda.

408
00:37:26,555 --> 00:37:28,473
She lived in Brittany
in the 7th century

409
00:37:28,475 --> 00:37:30,633
and she was very, very powerful.

410
00:37:30,635 --> 00:37:32,153
A marvel really,

411
00:37:32,155 --> 00:37:35,353
in an age that produced...
many marvels.

412
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:38,993
Now, compare that to the graph
belonging to Beatrice Good,

413
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:41,233
Benvenguda's last known
direct descendant.

414
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:44,633
Now, as you can see, Beatrice's DNA
shows far fewer markers

415
00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:46,915
common amongst witches,
indicating that...

416
00:37:48,395 --> 00:37:52,153
her ancestors,
as the centuries passed,

417
00:37:52,155 --> 00:37:55,793
relied less and less upon
witchcraft to survive. Now...

418
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:58,673
is this pattern of...

419
00:37:58,675 --> 00:38:00,993
denying power,

420
00:38:00,995 --> 00:38:04,115
is the reason why witches
will eventually become...

421
00:38:07,115 --> 00:38:08,435
extinct?

422
00:38:15,715 --> 00:38:18,193
-Who do you think she might talk to?
-Well, I don't know.

423
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,755
Apart from me, Diana doesn't
have any friends in Oxford.

424
00:38:23,275 --> 00:38:25,313
Oh, forgive me.

425
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:28,275
I don't believe you've been
introduced. This is Miss Järvinen.

426
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,793
She's our new representative
on the Congregation.

427
00:38:32,795 --> 00:38:34,595
Oh. Wow!

428
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:36,835
Congratulations.

429
00:38:41,715 --> 00:38:44,755
-Well?
-I tried to look inside her.

430
00:38:47,715 --> 00:38:49,475
She interests me.

431
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:56,075
You think 782's going to help you
with your research, don't you?

432
00:38:57,155 --> 00:38:59,635
It could explain our origins, yes.

433
00:39:01,235 --> 00:39:04,113
But we aren't going to go
extinct tomorrow.

434
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:06,635
There are still plenty of creatures
in the world.

435
00:39:08,075 --> 00:39:10,075
I have a different
sense of time to you.

436
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:15,873
When humans talk about climate change
that's exactly the argument they use.

437
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:20,675
"Oh, the polar ice caps will take
so many years to melt. Who cares?"

438
00:39:23,435 --> 00:39:26,675
I remember when the Thames
iced over every winter.

439
00:39:28,515 --> 00:39:30,715
I used to skate on it.

440
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:33,953
You're right though.

441
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:37,675
It's not going to happen immediately,
tomorrow, but it's already begun.

442
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:41,355
One day, there'll be just one species.

443
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:44,475
Humans.

444
00:39:46,155 --> 00:39:47,993
And at first, they won't
notice the difference

445
00:39:47,995 --> 00:39:50,915
because they've never noticed us,
but, gradually...

446
00:39:52,315 --> 00:39:54,115
eventually,
they'll come to see that...

447
00:39:55,715 --> 00:39:59,353
all the magic has
seeped out of the world.

448
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,873
And they'll look around them

449
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:04,075
and everyone will be the same.

450
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:12,835
You think whatever power I have
I should use?

451
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:18,713
I think at the very least you should
try not to be frightened of it.

452
00:40:18,715 --> 00:40:20,673
Although, as far as I can tell,

453
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:23,313
there are only two emotions
that keep the world turning.

454
00:40:23,315 --> 00:40:25,993
One is...desire.

455
00:40:25,995 --> 00:40:28,435
And the other is fear.

456
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:32,873
Magic is desire made real.

457
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:35,115
-That's what my aunt says.
-Mm.

458
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,435
The book's a palimpsest.

459
00:40:48,715 --> 00:40:51,235
Old words hidden under new.

460
00:40:52,395 --> 00:40:54,553
It was heavy.

461
00:40:54,555 --> 00:40:56,715
It smelt. It smelt odd.

462
00:40:58,955 --> 00:41:01,513
Three pages were cut out.

463
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:07,633
The only page I saw showed a baby
floating in an upside-down vessel.

464
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:09,673
It was probably the alchemical child,

465
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,675
although I've never seen it
represented like that before.

466
00:41:15,315 --> 00:41:16,635
Thank you.

467
00:41:58,155 --> 00:42:00,353
I thought you knew about vampires.

468
00:42:00,355 --> 00:42:02,675
That's why you invited me to dinner.

469
00:42:03,435 --> 00:42:06,473
I need to get a book, Ashmole 782.

470
00:42:06,475 --> 00:42:07,835
Are you going to give the book
to the vampire?

471
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:10,353
Where are we going, anyway?

472
00:42:10,355 --> 00:42:11,675
My house.

473
00:42:12,795 --> 00:42:16,713
Did you cast a spell
to call up Ashmole 782?

474
00:42:16,715 --> 00:42:20,073
What are you doing
hanging around with a vampire?

475
00:42:20,075 --> 00:42:22,353
He could feed off you,
take your memories.

476
00:42:22,355 --> 00:42:24,873
Seen everything you saw
when you opened up that book!

477
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,833
Matthew de Claremont's
harassing a witch.

00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:31,313
Did your source tell you
who this witch is?

479
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,793
Her name's Diana Bishop.

480
00:42:32,795 --> 00:42:36,075
You shy away from us and yet
you seek out vampire company.

481
00:42:36,435 --> 00:42:38,155
I'm not a bigot like you.

482
00:42:39,355 --> 00:42:41,675
You're craving her.

483
00:42:42,675 --> 00:42:44,273
What would I taste like?

484
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:45,873
You wouldn't be able
to stop me if I struck

485
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:47,555
and I wouldn't be able to stop myself.

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,079
Now I've got you!

3
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,715
You must be Diana.

4
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,390
Juliette.

5
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,590
Hello, Matthew.

6
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,797
Is Gerbert here with you?

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,120
I've left him.

8
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,958
You abandoned me!

9
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,955
And now...

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,233
you're mating with her.

11
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,795
If you hurt her...

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,072
I have to know how she did it.

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
Kiss her.

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,314
Or I'll make her bleed.

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,839
It's going to be alright.

16
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,633
It's going to be alright.

17
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,995
You like how she responds to you?

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,673
Gerbert sired me.

19
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,995
Groomed me to be
the object of your desire.

20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,720
I had no value.

21
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,595
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,555
Your magic can't save him!

23
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,516
OK.

24
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,879
I searched for you my whole life.

25
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,440
You're not going to die.

26
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,636
Do you hear me?

27
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,349
I won't let you.

28
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,477
Maiden, mother, crone, I call you.
Goddess, help me!

29
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,000
I will do anything to save him.

30
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,152
<i>If I help you, there will be a price.</i>

31
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,674
I will give anything...

32
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,518
anything that you want.

33
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,519
Anything! Just save him.

34
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,954
<i>Give him life!</i>

35
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
Oh...

36
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,990
Matthew!

37
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Em!

38
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,395
Marcus!

39
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,836
Diana, you need to let me help him!
Don't!

40
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,991
Get away from him!

41
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,589
Don't!

42
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,114
Drink.

43
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,440
Drink.

44
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,273
Your blood can't heal
both of his wounds.

45
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,840
He's dying.

46
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Drink.

47
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,160
Diana, you need to let him go.

48
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,596
I will pay your price, whatever it is.

49
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,194
<i>Very well.</i>

50
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,752
<i>What would I taste like?</i>

51
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,231
<i>Don't ever say that to me.</i>

52
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,676
<i>It would take but a moment.</i>

53
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,376
<i>You wouldn't be able
to stop me if I struck</i>

54
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,312
<i>and I wouldn't be able to stop myself.</i>

55
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,595
No!

56
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,792
<i>I'm safe with you.</i>

57
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,629
<i>I love you.</i>

58
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,800
What took you so long?

59
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,076
I had to go to Oneida.

60
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,996
Use the left arm. It's already opened.

61
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,230
That arm's useless.

62
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,916
The tissue's full of your saliva,
so it won't absorb anything.

63
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,910
There's going to be a line
going into your right arm, Diana.

64
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,478
You may feel a sharp scratch.

65
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,720
Any news of Juliette?
Afraid not.

66
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,433
Unlike her to run away.

67
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,316
Have you heard
anything more about Matthew?

68
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,114
He's not at Sept-Tours.

69
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,796
He's hiding somewhere
with Diana Bishop.

70
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,269
We must find them.

71
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,674
Well, what?

72
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,639
I have other news.
If I shared it with you, I'd be...

73
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,794
taking a certain risk, which I hope
you agree deserves some...

74
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,076
reward.

75
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,637
You've had enough handouts,
you greedy little shit.

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,515
Tell me what you know.

77
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,318
The stench of a frightened witch.

78
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,039
How I love it.

79
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,196
What did you do with Meridiana?

80
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,554
I let her go.

81
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,000
She'd been enthralled to you
for long enough.

82
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,953
No one should have to suffer
centuries of slavery.

83
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,599
Is Diana Bishop as powerful as her?

84
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,711
She may be more powerful.

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,799
And you held me back from her.

86
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,160
You let Matthew get his hands on her.

87
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,759
I didn't want that to happen.

88
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,676
She really did defeat you.

89
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,800
Your power...

90
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,552
still hasn't returned.

91
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,431
Baldwin's kept me in here.

92
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,277
Because I'm dangerous to him.

93
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,037
Don't you want to know why?

94
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,069
What she did was
unspeakably courageous.

95
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,237
You might not have been able
to stop drinking.

96
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,390
I know.

97
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,151
She's certainly full of surprises.

98
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,590
Witch fire.

99
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,033
It wasn't in her DNA markers.

100
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,593
I'd like to do more tests on her.

101
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,150
No. She's been through enough.

102
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,760
Matthew, she's the most powerful
witch we've ever encountered.

103
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,431
And she doesn't descend
from the ancient clans.

104
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,994
If we were to trace
her genetic lineage

105
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,356
understand how powers we thought
were extinct have survived.

106
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,195
Alright. Alright. Yes.

107
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,430
I'll ask her.

108
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,280
You craved me...

109
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,000
all this time.

110
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,153
And you resisted.

111
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,434
Did you love her?

112
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,990
Once.

113
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,870
She was Gerbert's creature.

114
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,394
He trained her to...

115
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,837
infiltrate my heart and my family.

116
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,114
And I took her life.

117
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,354
You saved me.

118
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,074
I don't regret it.

119
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,517
We can't yet protect ourselves

120
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,076
and if Juliette could find us, then...

121
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,040
Knox can and the Congregation can.

122
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,114
We can't just sit here,
waiting for that to happen.

123
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
Diana.

124
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,193
- What if...
- If <i>we.</i>

125
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,040
Time walked.

126
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,239
What if we hide somewhere in time?

127
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,439
Send out the order.

128
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,275
The Congregation will convene
to decide the fate of Satu Järvinen.

129
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,715
In the divine name of the goddess...

130
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,195
Baldwin.

131
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,398
<i>Knox's knows Satu Järvinen is in
Venice and is demanding we convene.</i>

132
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,837
If the Congregation gets back
together, it may be impossible

133
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,639
<i>to stop further investigation.</i>

134
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,279
You must stop them.

135
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,636
Your time is running out!

136
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,514
What's this?

137
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,273
It's a poppet.

138
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,676
Witches use these to cast spells.

139
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,556
I've never seen one so old before.

140
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,551
Didn't your ancestor Bridget Bishop
have a problem with one of those?

141
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,950
Yeah, they used it as evidence
to convict her at Salem.

142
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,194
What is this?

143
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,714
An earring.

144
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,675
It's Ysabeau's.

145
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,193
My father, Phillipe, gave that to her

146
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,080
but she lost it hundreds of years ago.
How on earth...?

147
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,234
What is this house trying to tell us?

148
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,039
Matthew will need this, too.
I'll be sure he gets it.

149
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,519
Send him and Diana...

150
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,996
all our love.

151
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,195
You could land in the middle
of a war or an epidemic.

152
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,670
Yes, there are risks,
but what's the alternative?

153
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,920
The moment that she found the book
she became a target.

154
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,635
What do you think, Diana?

155
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,395
Well, it depends on where we go.

156
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,200
But I think wherever it is
or whenever it is

157
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,456
it has to be somewhere
where I can learn about my magic.

158
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,279
Agreed. Now, Em, you explain that
to timewalk you need three objects

159
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,352
from a particular time and place.
Yeah.

160
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,239
That's what Stephen told me.
Good.

161
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,000
Now, I have items coming
from my past lives

162
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,880
but the thing that really concerns
me right now is once we arrive there

163
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,193
how do we return from the past?

164
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,076
If it's a short way,
it's not that difficult.

165
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,477
But Stephen said
the further you go back in time

166
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,552
the harder it is to return.

167
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,197
You're gonna need
some powerful spells for that.

168
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,992
And that'll require proper training.

169
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,800
Open your mind.

170
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,914
Think about the still room.

171
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,319
You have to want to be there
more than here.

172
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,595
Where will you be?
It depends when you arrive.

173
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,078
If it's before you left,
we'll be there. If not, we'll be here.

174
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,676
Time to take a big step
into the mysterious.

175
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,835
Pick up one foot and travel.

176
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,911
Focus, Diana, focus!

177
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,793
Why didn't that work?

178
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,476
Honey, you're focusing way too much
on the details of the room.

179
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,878
Honey, you need
to think about Matthew.

180
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,910
You want to be with him, hmm?

181
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,597
Magic's in the heart, not the mind.

182
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,155
Try again.

183
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
OK.

184
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,838
Matthew, relax.

185
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,149
Relax?

186
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,437
She could be stuck somewhere in time.

187
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,834
Then how would we get her back?

188
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,915
I did it!

189
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,320
I knew you could.

190
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,159
Beware the witch with the blood
of the lion and the wolf.

191
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,592
For with it she shall destroy
the children of the night.

192
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,360
I've been trying to decipher
that prophesy...

193
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,275
for longer than you can imagine.

194
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,111
Thought it might be Satu, but...

195
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,594
the state of her.

196
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,149
It must be Diana Bishop.

197
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,315
What have you done with Satu?

198
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,960
Domenico has her
with Baldwin's approval.

199
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,554
It's a delaying tactic.

200
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,155
Baldwin is protecting
his brother and...

201
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,399
the Bishop witch.

202
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,791
- He's gone too far.
- I agree.

203
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,991
And if we can prove it, we could
remove him from the Congregation.

204
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,716
It would throw the De Clermonts
into chaos.

205
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,599
And give us the...

206
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,077
opportunity to find...

207
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,636
Diana.

208
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,511
- Hamish!
- Hello, Matthew.

209
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,159
Marcus, Miriam.

210
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,720
You must be Diana.

211
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,235
I've heard so much about you.
Likewise.

212
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,156
I see you've brought everything.
Yes, and some added extras.

213
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,794
They're demons.

214
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,554
I can vouch for them.

215
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,513
And they have something for Diana.

216
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,197
<i>I wanted to get to you earlier...</i>

217
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,512
but we didn't know where you were
until Agatha told us.

218
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,190
Agatha Wilson. She's a demon
on the Congregation.

219
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,873
You have links to the Congregation?

220
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,715
Agatha's trustworthy.
And we know that how?

221
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,434
Because she's my mother.

222
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,477
This has been passed down
through the Norman family

223
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,360
and my father told me,
when the time comes

224
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,671
to give this to the woman
who has need of it.

225
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
What is it?

226
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,837
Diana, the goddess of the hunt.

227
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,469
It's a chess piece.

228
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,156
The white queen.
I lost that in a wager

229
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,720
on All Souls' Night...

230
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,390
a very long time ago.

231
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,314
But how did it end up in my family?

232
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,674
I have no idea.

233
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,955
Soph, let's go.

234
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,799
No, Nathaniel, look at these people.

235
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,591
Vampires, witches and demons
all together under the same roof.

236
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,751
If we can't tell them,
who can we tell?

237
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Tell them what?

238
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,510
Soph.

239
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,829
Stop.

240
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,320
My parents were witches.

241
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,194
Cross-species?

242
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,320
That's impossible.

243
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,429
Just to let you know, the house has
a mind of its own, so don't be scared.

244
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,637
And it's right up here.

245
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,353
If the Congregation
finds out about Sophie's family history

246
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,954
she'll be in trouble.

247
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,555
Mmm.

248
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,199
All I know for sure is that...

249
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,040
that chess piece was in
the same place as this

250
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,114
on the same night.

251
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,474
Witches always say there's not much
keeping the living from the dead

252
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,552
between Halloween and All Souls'.

253
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,514
I don't know, maybe...

254
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,038
maybe it might help us to time walk.

255
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,797
All Hallows' Eve is in six days.
Will you be ready?

256
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,395
We'll have to be.

257
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,759
How many do we need?

258
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,799
Usually? Two.

259
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,719
For the porch.

260
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,430
But, er... But it... This is great!
We can put them up the driveway.

261
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,296
Problem is, those rules
haven't actually changed

262
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,516
since their establishment
during the Crusades!

263
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,069
That's what I mean. The
Congregation are using ancient texts

264
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,992
to corroborate modern prejudices.

265
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,029
Well, they're getting along.

266
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,510
It's good for Nat to have
someone to talk to.

267
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,190
He wants to change the world,
but it's hard to do that on your own.

268
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,956
And you, honey,
who do you have to talk to?

269
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,035
Me? Well... I'm fine.

270
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,278
I couldn't sleep last night and
I heard you crying in the bathroom.

271
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,070
Bad dreams?

272
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,154
I don't want to worry Nat.

273
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
Tell us.

274
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,119
I'm in a room

275
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,080
with my baby.

276
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,956
There are footsteps outside.

277
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,072
I know the Congregation
are coming for me.

278
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,152
I don't care about that, but I'm...

279
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,229
I'm scared because
they're coming for my baby, too.

280
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,320
Oh!

281
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,559
Oh, honey.

282
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,874
You're among witches now.
We'll do everything we possibly can.

283
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,235
- Mmm.
- Mm-hm.

284
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,030
How do you do that?

285
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,113
A couple of hundred years' practice.

286
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,640
Want a go?

287
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,677
I'll stick to computers.

288
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,590
Hey, Mum.

289
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,797
Are you alright?
<i>Yeah, everyone's good.</i>

290
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,550
There's three vampires here
and three witches

291
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,199
along with the three of us.

292
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,632
No one's killed anyone.

293
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,790
Yet!

294
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,234
Well, be careful.

295
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,039
I'm heading back to Venice.

296
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,316
The Congregation's reconvening.

297
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,990
<i>Tell Diana to be careful. I love you.</i>

298
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,193
Am I really ready
to take us back 25 days?

299
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,351
Well, we have to practise.

300
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,831
If we can't do this, we don't stand
a chance crossing the centuries.

301
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,757
And you're sure we're not going
to bump into our past selves?

302
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,032
I think it's a different kind of past.

303
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,318
You haven't bumped into your past self
whilst you've been time walking?

304
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,595
No.

305
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,838
I guess we'll soon find out.

306
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,240
Don't let go.

307
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,278
Close your eyes.

308
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,160
Now pick up your foot.

309
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,709
When I tell you.

310
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,556
Now!

311
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,357
How do we know it's the right night?

312
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,715
We don't.

313
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,632
Well, don't you look
lovely tonight, <i>Maman</i>?

314
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,912
No better than I did this morning.

315
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,279
Shall we eat?

316
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,600
Why not?

317
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,551
"Tuxedo Junction" by Glenn Miller.

318
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,435
<i>Voles dancar amb ieu?</i>

319
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
<i>T'aimi.</i>

320
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,311
I was present when Philippe
set up the Congregation.

321
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,076
He weighed the scales in his favour.

322
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,391
A De Clermont must be one of the nine
creatures who sit in the chamber.

323
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,719
It's a problem,
but it's not insurmountable.

324
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,756
Who would take the seat?
After Baldwin and Matthew?

325
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,754
Marcus.

326
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,799
But we wouldn't have
any trouble with him.

327
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,520
Baldwin won't go easily.

328
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,117
He'll put up a fight, but...

329
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,234
we can match him.

330
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,916
Oh, God!

331
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,119
He doesn't find it funny. So...

332
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,032
you said goodbye to Ysabeau?

333
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,632
- We did, yes.
- Mm-hm.

334
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,757
And we made it back
just in time for supper.

335
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,799
Last one.
With us, for a while, anyway.

336
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,916
Mm-hm.

337
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,760
Come on, Nat!

338
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,116
I'm not letting you two
anywhere near my baby's DNA.

339
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,760
Don't you want to know
if your child's a witch or a demon?

340
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,877
I do. I think it's a great idea.

341
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,038
I'd like to propose a toast.

342
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,879
To unusual friendships.

343
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,196
Unusual friendships!

344
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,551
I presume you still want me
to be a Knight?

345
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,917
Of course. It's because of you
the order runs so smoothly.

346
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,671
But I am going to give up
my post of Grand Master.

347
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,240
Matt, no.

348
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,676
The brotherhood could do
with new energy.

349
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,321
There was more than enough of it
round that table tonight.

350
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,116
Almost a shadow Congregation.
Mmm.

351
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,554
And if Sophie's claim to being
a cross-species is true, then...

352
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,518
they'll be more like her
in need of protection.

353
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,994
It might just be...

354
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,836
that the Knights have to
take on the Congregation.

355
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,877
Which is why you must lead us.

356
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,117
I might not be able to.

357
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,950
If Diana doesn't master the spells

358
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,350
that are required
to leave the past, then...

359
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,839
we may never come back.

360
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,790
Matthew's playing
his cards close to his chest.

361
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,397
Don't you want to know
where you're going?

362
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,150
No.

363
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,035
No.

364
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,595
I just...

365
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,509
I want to be here

366
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,350
present

367
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,874
for the time that we have left.

368
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,079
Travelling back in time

369
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,159
you'll be totally reliant on him.

370
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,993
You do realise where you're going

371
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,800
he won't be the same man?

372
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,514
Baldwin has ordered
Satu to be put on trial.

373
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,877
No matter what she's done,
we must stand united.

374
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,635
How are you?

375
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,917
My power is coming back.

376
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,116
Good.

377
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,632
We may need it today.

378
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,280
Nathaniel.

379
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,672
If you become at all concerned
when you're home...

380
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,354
take Sophie here.

381
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,958
France?
Mmm. My mother's expecting you.

382
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,554
Sarah and Em will be there.

383
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,997
I don't want them here
when the Congregation calls.

384
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,314
You do understand, we have
a hell of a fight ahead of us?

385
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,194
I've been fighting all my life.

386
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,896
- Please take good care of yourselves.
- Good luck.

387
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,320
And the baby.

388
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,110
Thank you for bringing me the statue.

389
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,640
Well, I'm glad that I did.

390
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,797
And that I met you.

391
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,591
It feels like it's going to be important.

392
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,830
Yeah.

393
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,919
What about <i>The Book Of Life?</i>

394
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,601
When you're away, the witches
could get their hands on it.

395
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,509
Well, in the present,
the book isn't whole.

396
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,632
Pages are missing, but...

397
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,716
where we're going
we might it in its entirety.

398
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,836
Think of that.

399
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,510
Come back and bring it with you.

400
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,360
Goodbye, my friend.

401
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,589
Bye.

402
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,559
You abducted Diana Bishop

403
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,552
against the permission of this chamber.

404
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,916
- Do you deny this?
- No.

405
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,311
You will therefore be stripped of your
status as a Congregation member.

406
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,710
The witches will decide
the punishment you deserve.

407
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,511
They will also need
to nominate a new member.

408
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,719
Until then, this chamber is adjourned.

409
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,280
I did it because I believed
you were working with your brother

410
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,953
to keep Diana from us.

411
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,593
And I was proven right.

412
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,638
Keep her under control, Peter.

413
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,151
I'd like to hear what she has to say.

414
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,080
How were you proven right?

415
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,356
I took the witch somewhere
we'd be safe.

416
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,917
But Matthew Clairmont
followed us there

417
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,434
with his brother.

418
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,155
He's helping them.

419
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,712
Working against the Congregation
is a treasonous offence.

420
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,872
One I deny! Your witch has no proof.

421
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,399
And my brother has always been a thorn
in my side. Why would I help him?

422
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,235
Has anyone in this chamber
heard of the Knights of Lazarus?

423
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,836
The Knights have been running
a parallel organisation

424
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,195
since the covenant was signed.

425
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,114
They were established
by Philippe de Clermont...

426
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,680
and his sons.

427
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,675
The aim of the order is to further

428
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,193
the vampire cause.

429
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,794
The brotherhood is philanthropic.

430
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,997
We protect those
who can't protect themselves.

431
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,634
Like Diana Bishop?

432
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,032
You are a Knight of Lazarus

433
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,840
and your brother is
its Grand Master, is he not?

434
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,549
He's ordered you to protect her,
hasn't he?

435
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
No.

436
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,633
Your heart is beating at double
its usual speed, Baldwin.

437
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,191
Your pupils <i>are</i> dilated.

438
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,513
You're lying.

439
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,896
Where are they?
What's your brother done with her?

440
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,056
Does she have <i>The Book Of Life?</i>

441
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,391
You want the book
and Diana Bishop for yourself.

442
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,518
This is a vampire conspiracy.

443
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,320
I am as shocked as you, Peter

444
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,599
and to prove that I have
no allegiance with Baldwin

445
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,396
I demand that he step down
from the Congregation

446
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,553
with immediate effect.

447
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,553
I have no intention of stepping down.

448
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,316
Then we must make you.
We don't use force in this chamber.

449
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,593
Baldwin de Clermont

450
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,876
you have committed treason
against the Congregation.

451
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,429
Your punishment is death
by beheading and fire.

452
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,110
That is a punishment suited
for the 14th century, not the 21st!

453
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,592
It comes from our ancient testimony.
There is no newer one to replace it.

454
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,230
There is one Congregation rule
we mustn't overlook.

455
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,152
Each of us has one vote

456
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,310
on every decision in this chamber.

457
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,154
Does that include me?

458
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,676
You're still on the Congregation,
so, yes.

459
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,879
As am I.

460
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,078
I also have a vote.

461
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,716
All those who accuse Baldwin
of treason raise their...

462
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,950
Wait!

463
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,954
Unlike the vampires,
demons give everyone a voice.

464
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,677
We will recess
and discuss this further.

465
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,518
Make it quick.

466
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,920
Oh, before I forget,
here's a card with the numbers

467
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,434
to get in contact with my mother.

468
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,314
I never thought I'd be staying under
Ysabeau de Clermont's roof.

469
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,632
A diet of nuts and berries.
At least we'll lose weight, right?

470
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,359
Right? Diana.

471
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,029
I love you.

472
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,360
Goodbye, Em.

473
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,279
Goodbye, my darling.

474
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,317
- Take care, you.
- Yeah, you too.

475
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,880
Yes, I will.

476
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,234
Listen to your teachers.

477
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,398
Absorb all the knowledge you can.

478
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,750
Yeah.

479
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,989
You have more talent than any witch
could ever dream of possessing.

480
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,398
And I am so glad
you're not going to waste it.

481
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,195
Thank you.

482
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,478
I won't let you down.

483
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,034
Stay safe.

484
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,320
Good luck.

485
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,233
All those who accuse Baldwin
of treason raise their left hands.

486
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,034
Domenico.

487
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,715
All those against.

488
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,592
The motion is dismissed.

489
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,069
You may have kept your head
on your shoulders for now

490
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,195
but you will tell us...

491
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,230
where are Matthew Clairmont
and Diana Bishop?

492
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,031
You'll be hearing from me.

493
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,355
Thank you.

494
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,280
I have my reasons to want
to protect Diana Bishop.

495
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,635
But you owe us a debt.

496
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,876
Right.

497
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,474
All done.

498
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,310
We'll continue our research
while Matthew's away.

499
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,880
Thank you.

500
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,237
Your leaving now?
Not staying for Halloween?

501
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,756
We thought you two should have
some time here alone.

502
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,874
And as you know...

503
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,514
I hate goodbyes.

504
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,912
I'll see you outside, Marcus.

505
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,200
So...

506
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,874
I have something for you.

507
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,590
Open it.

508
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,994
Grand Master?

509
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,193
Of the Knights of Lazarus.

510
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,399
I can't do this.

511
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,676
I don't want to.
You think I did?

512
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,030
But Philippe wanted to keep the
Congregation and the Knights separate

513
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,713
so he made me promise him

514
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,193
that the brotherhood
would never be run by Baldwin.

515
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,079
And I'm asking you to do the same.

516
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,357
I can't follow in your footsteps.
My son...

517
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,673
you are the only one
that I trust to do the job.

518
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,595
<i>Je suis à votre commande, seigneur.</i>

519
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,994
It's time.

520
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,034
In the suitcase of clothes,
your mother added this.

521
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,553
It's engraved.
<i>"A ma vie de coeur entier."</i>

522
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,272
"My whole heart for my whole life."

523
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,000
<i>Please leave
a message and I'll get back to you.</i>

524
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,838
Your time's run out, Matthew.
Go now!

525
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,433
<i>They know where you are.</i>

526
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,512
<i>Gerbert has the witches,
so be prepared for magic.</i>

527
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,910
<i>Be prepared for anything.</i>

528
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,469
<i>I just hope I'm not too late.</i>

529
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,474
This should help us find our way.

530
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,670
"Settle thy studies
and begin to sound the depth"

531
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,475
of that thou wilt profess.

532
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,592
"Dr Faustus."

533
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,554
Christopher Marlowe?

534
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,677
I remember the night he inscribed it.

535
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,879
Kit was a close friend of mine

536
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,554
in a dangerous time when
there were very few creatures

537
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,360
that one could trust.

538
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,520
It was to him that
I lost that chess piece to

539
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,880
on a wager on All Souls' Night.

540
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,231
Every year, a group of us
would meet at the old lodge

541
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,960
for the Catholic Holy Days
of All Saints and All Souls.

542
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,636
So we're going back to London?

543
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,949
Mmm.

544
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,715
To 1590.

545
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,113
Top room of the house.
They're alone.

546
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,919
Matthew's slipping.

547
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,913
There's some kind of spell on it.

548
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,032
Now, remember

549
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,113
do not let go, no matter what.

550
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,080
Never.

551
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,919
Lift up your foot.

552
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,157
And now put it down when I tell you.

553
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
It's time.

553
00:43:19,305 --> 00:44:19,319

00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:26,615
Once the world was full of wonders,
but it belongs to humans now.

3
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:30,253
We creatures
have all but disappeared -

4
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:33,215
demons, vampires and witches...

5
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:36,773
hiding in plain sight,

6
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:38,893
fearful of discovery,

7
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:41,015
ill at ease, even with each other.

8
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:45,975
But, as my father used to say...

9
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,533
in every ending

10
00:00:50,535 --> 00:00:52,775
there is a new beginning.

11
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,775
-Matthew.
-Are you off to the library?

12
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:06,413
-Yes.
-Well, you should know

13
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:08,893
that it's absolutely full
to the brim with creatures.

14
00:01:08,895 --> 00:01:11,735
Waiting to see if you can
call the book up again.

15
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:14,215
I thought we'd...

16
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,575
Would you let me take you out
for the day instead?

17
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:20,013
Diana? Erm...

18
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:22,015
Do you mind if we just...?

19
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:30,935
I, er...

20
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:34,773
I just wanted to explain about
Peter Knox being at my house.

21
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:37,093
It was you who told him
about the book.

22
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:41,053
I told Sylvia. She asked.
I... I couldn't lie to another witch.

23
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:42,733
I trusted you.

24
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,895
You haven't exactly
been honest with me.

25
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:48,853
You've used magic for your own gain.

26
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:51,373
-Did Knox tell you that?
-He's a good man.

27
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,495
He's in the Congregation.

28
00:01:55,935 --> 00:01:59,053
-He's worried about you and so am I.
-Well, you don't need to be.

29
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:01,293
Look, I know that you're angry
with me. I understand.

30
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,455
But that does not mean that
you need to spend time with that.

32
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:17,615
I can open my own door.

33
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:33,295
Where are we going, anyway?

34
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:35,615
My house.

35
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:37,255
I spend most of my time
at All Souls, but...

36
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,853
I come back here

37
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:41,855
very occasionally.

38
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:46,813
This whole place...

39
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:48,973
it's like a time capsule.

40
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:50,295
Mm.

41
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:53,215
Can't stay in the same place
for too long.

42
00:03:54,215 --> 00:03:56,533
Humans tend to get suspicious, so...

43
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:58,413
I closed it up and left.

44
00:03:58,415 --> 00:04:00,453
But I've dropped by over the years.

45
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:02,093
Updated the plumbing.

46
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:03,815
Put in the electricity.

47
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:08,975
Who's she?

48
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:13,295
My sister, Louisa.

49
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:18,575
Did you have to change your name?

50
00:04:21,415 --> 00:04:23,175
I always keep my Christian name.

51
00:04:24,535 --> 00:04:25,895
Otherwise, yes.

52
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:28,495
What is your real name?

53
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:31,695
De Clermont.

54
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:34,575
You're French?

55
00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:37,215
Don't you ask a lot of questions.

56
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:40,733
Yeah.

57
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:42,455
It's the historian in me.

58
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:45,575
I took my mother's name
when she sired me.

59
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:50,613
She lived in France

60
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:53,615
with my step-father, Philippe.

61
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:57,375
He's no longer with us.

62
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,855
-He died?
-Mm.

63
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:03,135
Yes.

64
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,015
We can be killed...

65
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:09,135
if you try hard enough.

66
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:47,973
-Rico Jean.
-Satu Järvinen.

67
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:49,975
Welcome to the Congregation.

68
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:55,733
You're human.

69
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,653
The job of administrating
the Congregation

70
00:05:57,655 --> 00:06:01,055
has been passed down to the oldest
male in my family for centuries.

71
00:06:02,215 --> 00:06:04,133
Have you got siblings?

72
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:06,013
An elder sister.

73
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:08,253
Well, she must be pleased.

74
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:12,535
Oh, we're also tasked to help keep
all this secret from humans.

75
00:06:16,295 --> 00:06:18,335
The Congregation chamber.

76
00:06:26,295 --> 00:06:28,133
I want to see inside.

77
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:29,935
I'm afraid you can't.

78
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:33,175
Not unless we're in session.

79
00:06:34,575 --> 00:06:37,095
The demons are to
the north of the building.

80
00:06:38,175 --> 00:06:40,055
The vampires over there.

81
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:42,815
And this...

82
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:48,895
is the witches' archives.

83
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:10,655
Were you an alchemist?

84
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:13,775
No, no. I inherited those
from my brother.

85
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:16,095
He was fascinated by it.

86
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:19,415
Science with magic,
magic with science.

87
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:22,573
He never knew
which way round it was.

88
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,333
I'm not sure either, to be honest.

89
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:27,055
That's why I'm drawn to it.

90
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,935
Did you... cast a spell
to call the book up?

91
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:44,533
No. No.

92
00:07:44,535 --> 00:07:47,533
No, I've never been very good
at spell casting.

93
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,135
Well, then...

94
00:07:50,255 --> 00:07:51,655
perhaps...

95
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:57,015
there was a spell on it and you just
happened to meet its conditions.

96
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:05,893
What are you doing?

97
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:07,735
I thought so.

98
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:11,813
Your magic's instinctive. It just
comes out of you when you need it.

99
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:13,613
You needed...

100
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:16,095
Ashmole 782 for your research.

101
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:19,335
It's not that simple.

102
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,493
Well, no, of course not.

103
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:24,975
There's something else, some kind
of link between you and the book.

104
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:26,573
-Em?
-I thought I was getting

105
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:30,813
-something there.
-How was I to know you were scrummying?

106
00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:33,175
I couldn't sleep. Dreams about Diana.

107
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:36,693
-What?
-Odd things.

108
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:38,733
I thought I'd try to peep.

109
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:40,615
Did you see anything?

110
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:45,053
A man... in the shadows.

111
00:09:45,055 --> 00:09:48,133
With her, following her.

112
00:09:48,135 --> 00:09:49,935
It was Knox.

113
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:52,255
No, he wasn't a witch.

114
00:09:56,975 --> 00:10:01,295
Maybe you're right.
Maybe my magic is connected to need.

115
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:05,373
Don't you have any memories of it
having surfaced before?

116
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:09,333
No. I don't remember much
about my childhood.

117
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,215
My parents died when I was young.

118
00:10:12,215 --> 00:10:13,575
Yes, I know.

119
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:19,853
Living without magic isn't... bad.
I've survived without it.

120
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:23,055
Well, that's not quite true.
You use it all the time.

121
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,575
You can feel me
when I'm looking at you.

122
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:30,415
That feels cold.

123
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:34,215
Like ice growing under my skin.

124
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:38,173
Witch power is in your blood
and it's in your bones.

125
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:42,535
You were born to be a witch, just
as you were born to have blonde hair.

126
00:10:43,535 --> 00:10:45,175
Or those blue eyes.

127
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:47,735
And you?

128
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:52,735
Well, I was born a human.

129
00:10:57,335 --> 00:11:00,253
We didn't keep track
of birthdays back then.

130
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:04,013
But I'd estimate it was in 500

131
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:06,733
and then I was reborn
as a vampire in...

132
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:09,455
the year 537.

133
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:14,695
-The things you must have seen.
-Mm.

134
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:19,095
And done.

135
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,175
Would you like to have
dinner with me tomorrow?

136
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:43,735
-New stock's arrived.
-Oh, what's come in?

137
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:47,615
Ghosties and ghoulies and things
that go bump in the night.

138
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:15,215
Hey!

139
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:19,975
Hey, look at this.

140
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:23,693
-Oh.
-The story's been up since this morning

141
00:12:23,695 --> 00:12:25,855
and already it's got
over 100 messages.

142
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:29,653
I knew this was gonna work.

143
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:31,933
The stories they're telling.

144
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:35,693
Demons born to humans who had
no idea why they were different.

145
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:37,895
They've spent half their lives
thinking they were freaks.

146
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,575
And now you've got them
talking to each other.

147
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:47,855
Someone's gonna want
to meet face to face.

148
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,893
What do you reckon?

149
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,973
Stay online for now.

150
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:54,855
It's risky enough.

151
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,093
What's this?

152
00:12:58,095 --> 00:13:01,413
I got them from the library. Look.

153
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:04,335
Does this remind you of something?

154
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:09,895
That's your statue.

155
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,253
-Hey, Sarah.
-What are you doing...

156
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:27,533
hanging around with a vampire?

157
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:29,215
Has Em been spying on me?

158
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:33,693
Anyway... most of the things we've been
told about them aren't true.

159
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:36,053
He could feed off you,
take your memories.

160
00:13:36,055 --> 00:13:39,173
-I'm sure that's not true.
-That's what they do, Diana.

161
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:40,893
He could have fed off you already.

162
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:43,013
Seen everything you saw
when you opened that book.

163
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:46,653
-You wouldn't remember.
-He wouldn't do anything like that.

164
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:49,375
I'm not in any danger with him.

165
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,813
Diana, do you remember the stories

166
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,933
your mum told you
when you were little?

167
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:59,935
The Shadow Prince that lived
between sunset and moonrise?

168
00:14:01,095 --> 00:14:06,173
Yeah.
Yeah, I used to love those stories.

169
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:07,815
What if it's him?

170
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:13,933
We are putting two and two together
and making five.

171
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:17,253
We have no idea who this vampire is
or what he wants!

172
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:19,373
Well, he's coming to dinner tonight...

173
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,415
so I can just ask him.

174
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,893
Morning.

175
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:39,053
I presume it's not a coincidence
you're outside my college.

176
00:14:39,055 --> 00:14:41,093
Matthew's away at a conference.

177
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:43,653
Molecular biology techniques.

178
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:45,415
He asked me to keep an eye on you.

179
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:50,733
-Is he always this controlling?
-With us, yes.

180
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:52,733
But with a witch...

181
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:54,175
it's a first.

182
00:14:56,175 --> 00:15:00,773
Okay, then, I may as well utilize you.
I'm feeding Matthew tonight.

183
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,935
Talk me through it.

184
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:07,293
Look, I'll tell you
what Matthew likes

185
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:11,615
if you come to the lab
and get your bloods done.

186
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:15,293
We're taking DNA from witch remains

187
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:17,293
and we've identified four original
clans.

188
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:18,773
Thanks.

189
00:15:18,775 --> 00:15:21,215
Don't you want to find out
which one the Bishops belonged to?

190
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:41,375
This is our archive.
It's not for vampires.

191
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,215
"Test of Diana Bishop's powers."

192
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:01,455
Who is Diana Bishop?

193
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:07,055
Surely, you've wondered
about the Bishop blood?

194
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:10,775
I certainly have.

195
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:15,613
What will this tell us?

196
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:18,413
Your inherited traits and powers
and where you come from.

197
00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:22,533
Through your DNA we can trace descent
back to one of four witches who...

198
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:24,215
What the hell are you doing?

199
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:26,855
Stop now.

200
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:30,813
If any vampire is
going to take her blood,

201
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:33,095
it's going to be me.

202
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:48,135
Are you all right?

203
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:23,415
Grazie.

204
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:28,775
A strange story came to me today.

205
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:33,853
Apparently, Matthew de Clermont's
harassing a witch in Oxford.

206
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:37,293
What? If it's true,
we should capitalise on it.

207
00:18:37,295 --> 00:18:40,613
Bring him in front of
the Congregation, punish him.

208
00:18:40,615 --> 00:18:45,533
It sounds unlikely to me. Did your
source tell you who this witch is?

209
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:47,175
Her name's Diana Bishop.

210
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,333
I couldn't get more than that.
My source was a witch herself.

211
00:18:51,335 --> 00:18:53,455
Probably lying to you
like they all do.

212
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:59,373
Why would Matthew leave himself...
so vulnerable.

213
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,613
There might not be any truth in it,
but if there is,

214
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:04,213
we can't afford to miss
this opportunity.

215
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:07,055
Someone should go over there
and find out.

216
00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:27,735
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.

217
00:19:54,215 --> 00:19:58,575
Beware the witch with the blood
of the lion and the wolf.

218
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:24,825
Don't you ever close your door?

219
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,943
Anyone could walk in.

220
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:29,625
Oh, darling!

221
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:34,063
Are these for us?

222
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,583
You need to eat when you're pregnant.

223
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:40,305
-Has the baby moved yet?
-Oh, she's lazy, I reckon.

224
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:44,703
What's all this?

225
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:46,943
I've been reading up on alchemy.

226
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,943
Nat, your mum's here.

227
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:52,143
"Alchemy exits to transform mortals

228
00:20:52,145 --> 00:20:55,383
from a state of suffering
to enlightenment."

229
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:58,825
I didn't know you were into all this.
Hey!

230
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:03,383
They've given me a day
to close the chatroom.

231
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:04,903
Did you tell them?

232
00:21:04,905 --> 00:21:06,743
Of course not.

233
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:08,903
I might not approve,
I'd never report you.

234
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,943
Demons need to communicate
with each other.

235
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:12,903
You know it's against Congregation...

236
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,225
Well, it shouldn't be. It...

237
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,503
If we were allowed to come together,
there'd be fewer problems.

238
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:25,583
Not necessarily. Think of the risks.

239
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:28,705
Demons aren't good
at doing things quietly.

240
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:31,903
So we just get told to shut up
and hide away?

241
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:34,063
Nat, don't fight it.

242
00:21:34,065 --> 00:21:35,983
So you fight it for me.

243
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:37,943
You're on the Congregation.

244
00:21:37,945 --> 00:21:39,265
You have a voice!

245
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,623
It's gonna get better.

246
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:49,425
This has been in my family
for generations.

247
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:52,865
How will that make it better?

248
00:21:53,305 --> 00:21:56,665
Well, it's the White Queen,
from alchemy.

249
00:21:57,905 --> 00:21:59,505
I don't think that's what that is.

250
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:04,343
She's got a bow and arrow.

251
00:22:04,345 --> 00:22:06,623
She's like her, anyway.

252
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,383
My... My dad told me
when the time comes

253
00:22:09,385 --> 00:22:12,025
that I must give her
to the person who needs her.

254
00:22:13,385 --> 00:22:15,145
How will you know who that is?

255
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:19,145
I don't know... yet.

256
00:22:20,345 --> 00:22:22,465
Just have to wait for a sign.

257
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:32,345
You like something maybe?

258
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:36,745
-They're lovely.
-Thank you.

259
00:22:38,545 --> 00:22:39,945
Hello, Miriam.

260
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:44,985
You're craving her.

261
00:22:45,945 --> 00:22:50,263
Miriam, how I feel about Diana Bishop
has absolutely nothing to do with you.

262
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:51,823
She's a witch.

263
00:22:51,825 --> 00:22:53,625
You're a vampire.

264
00:22:54,745 --> 00:22:58,823
You know the rules. It's forbidden
by the terms of the Covenant.

265
00:22:58,825 --> 00:23:01,783
The Congregation isn't about to
enforce a thousand-year-old rule.

266
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:03,623
Does Diana even know about it?

267
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,745
Because Marcus
doesn't seem to think so.

268
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,865
Bye, Miriam.

269
00:23:34,505 --> 00:23:35,945
Coming.

270
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:38,385
Okay.

271
00:23:52,825 --> 00:23:54,825
Sorry, I'm running...

272
00:23:56,225 --> 00:23:57,545
Expecting someone?

273
00:23:58,945 --> 00:24:00,985
Get out of my rooms!

274
00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:03,305
Feeding him?

275
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:08,023
You shy away from us and yet
you seek out vampire company.

276
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:10,023
I'm not a bigot like you.

277
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:12,183
Yes, just like your father.

278
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:16,065
So open-minded that he put himself
and your mother in mortal danger.

279
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:25,745
Mr Knox was just leaving.

280
00:25:15,145 --> 00:25:16,625
Red deer.

281
00:25:18,745 --> 00:25:21,703
A young Highland stag
from the taste of it.

282
00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:23,783
How could you possibly know that?

283
00:25:23,785 --> 00:25:25,543
Our senses are heightened.

284
00:25:25,545 --> 00:25:27,743
Oh, so some of the stories are true.

285
00:25:27,745 --> 00:25:30,263
-Can you fly?
-No.

286
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:33,423
But we can run and jump very well,

287
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:36,023
which makes humans
think that we can fly.

288
00:25:36,025 --> 00:25:37,665
And we're efficient, too.

289
00:25:38,505 --> 00:25:40,943
Our bodies don't use up much energy,

290
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:44,943
so we have an awful lot
to draw upon when we need to.

291
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:47,143
You don't breathe much.

292
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:50,225
Well... our hearts don't beat...

293
00:25:51,865 --> 00:25:53,983
very often.

294
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,303
I thought you knew about vampires.

295
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:59,025
That's why you invited me to dinner.

296
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:03,823
I probably know a little less
than most humans do.

297
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:06,623
Most legends about us were...

298
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:08,823
dreamed up by humans.

299
00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:11,583
Black hats and bats and brooms.

300
00:26:11,585 --> 00:26:18,463
Yes. Somewhere in all those stories
there's a speck of truth.

301
00:26:18,465 --> 00:26:21,383
Something that
frightened humans and...

302
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:23,945
helped them to deny that we were real.

303
00:26:27,345 --> 00:26:28,865
What do you taste?

304
00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:32,105
Flowers and spice.

305
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,065
-You?
-Oh, there's violets in there.

306
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:39,543
Purple sugared ones.

307
00:26:39,545 --> 00:26:41,825
Elizabeth Tudor
absolutely adored them.

308
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:44,385
Ruined her teeth.

309
00:26:45,265 --> 00:26:48,625
Also blackberries from hedgerows.

310
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:53,105
Cigar smoke, redcurrants in brandy.

311
00:26:54,105 --> 00:26:55,665
I could go on.

312
00:26:58,025 --> 00:26:59,545
What would I taste like?

313
00:27:08,785 --> 00:27:10,265
Don't ever...

314
00:27:11,265 --> 00:27:13,065
say that to me.

315
00:27:20,985 --> 00:27:23,345
I only asked to understand.

316
00:27:24,985 --> 00:27:26,983
It would take but a moment.

317
00:27:26,985 --> 00:27:29,103
You wouldn't be able to stop me
if I struck

318
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,345
and I wouldn't be able to stop myself.

319
00:27:33,905 --> 00:27:35,385
I'm safe with you.

320
00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:47,825
The smell of you...

321
00:27:50,465 --> 00:27:52,383
Willow sap.

322
00:27:52,385 --> 00:27:54,225
Camomile honey.

323
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:57,665
Frankincense.

324
00:27:59,265 --> 00:28:00,625
Lady's mantle.

325
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:06,345
Ancient things
I thought I'd forgotten.

326
00:28:09,065 --> 00:28:11,023
It's not only your scent.

327
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:13,465
I can hear your witch's blood...

328
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:17,425
moving in your veins.

329
00:28:21,105 --> 00:28:23,065
When I touch your skin...

330
00:28:24,545 --> 00:28:26,425
and it rushes to the surface.

331
00:29:10,185 --> 00:29:11,985
Thank you for dinner.

332
00:30:09,665 --> 00:30:11,705
Go and find Matthew.

333
00:30:15,305 --> 00:30:17,145
Thank you, Father.

334
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:40,185
You knew about this!

335
00:31:41,225 --> 00:31:43,105
What? Who are they?

336
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:48,065
My parents.

337
00:31:49,265 --> 00:31:51,223
Oh, I... I'm so sorry.

338
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:54,663
-Knox sent these to me.
-Why would he do something like that?

339
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:57,863
-Where is he?
-I... I have no idea.

340
00:31:57,865 --> 00:31:59,863
This is sick.

341
00:31:59,865 --> 00:32:01,705
Please, can we just
a talk about the...

342
00:32:02,905 --> 00:32:05,103
Are you going to give the book
to the vampire?

343
00:32:05,105 --> 00:32:07,143
I will understand that book.

344
00:32:07,145 --> 00:32:09,465
I'm gonna deal with this myself.

345
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:21,345
Diana?

346
00:33:11,585 --> 00:33:13,065
Hey, Sean.

347
00:33:14,065 --> 00:33:16,063
Hey. Sorry, I know you're closing.

348
00:33:16,065 --> 00:33:17,905
I need to get a book.

349
00:33:18,905 --> 00:33:21,303
Ashmole 782.

350
00:33:21,305 --> 00:33:23,425
People have been
asking for that all week.

351
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:26,423
It's missing.

352
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:28,623
Last one who had it out was you.

353
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:31,703
-I returned it to the stacks.
-Yeah, I remember. It's odd.

354
00:33:31,705 --> 00:33:33,983
Well then, it's got to be there.

355
00:33:33,985 --> 00:33:35,505
Can you check again?

356
00:33:36,545 --> 00:33:38,383
Just for me, please.

357
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:41,423
I'll go and have a look.
Give me a few minutes.

358
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:42,945
Thank you.

359
00:33:59,185 --> 00:34:01,425
We'll wait together, shall we?

360
00:34:14,545 --> 00:34:16,425
Gillian thought you might
take the book out.

361
00:34:17,425 --> 00:34:20,385
You see, she understands
its importance to us.

362
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,983
You sent me those photographs.

363
00:34:23,985 --> 00:34:27,263
I don't want you
to end up like Rebecca.

364
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,783
Your father made her turn her back
on her own kind.

365
00:34:29,785 --> 00:34:32,265
-Just as you are.
-Sorry, Diana, it's just not there.

366
00:34:33,545 --> 00:34:35,343
Don't worry about it.

367
00:34:35,345 --> 00:34:38,143
-It's fine.
-What's going on?

368
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:40,223
-It's okay.
-Diana.

369
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:42,425
Ask him to look again.

370
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:47,505
All of you, get out!

371
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,503
With this binding knot...

372
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,825
Stop!

373
00:34:56,065 --> 00:34:57,385
Sean!

374
00:34:57,945 --> 00:34:59,265
Sean!

375
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:49,465
Hold on, Diana!

376
00:35:53,745 --> 00:35:55,745
Don't hold your breath.

377
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:58,825
Just breathe, Diana.

378
00:36:03,065 --> 00:36:04,545
I've got you.

379
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:09,945
You're safe.

380
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:24,065
Sean, are you okay?

381
00:36:43,185 --> 00:36:44,665
Is she okay?

382
00:36:46,185 --> 00:36:49,423
-No, she's exhausted.
-Not surprising.

383
00:36:49,425 --> 00:36:51,703
Witch wind.

384
00:36:51,705 --> 00:36:55,743
I've checked on Sean. He's fine.
And I've sorted out the Bodleian.

385
00:36:55,745 --> 00:36:58,743
If she wakes up,
tell her I'll return soon.

386
00:36:58,745 --> 00:37:00,065
Where are you going?

387
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:03,423
I'm going to fight Peter Knox.

388
00:37:03,425 --> 00:37:05,263
If you make a move on him,

389
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,663
it'll be seen as a direct challenge
to the Congregation.

390
00:37:07,665 --> 00:37:10,743
He sent her those photographs.
His scent was all over them.

391
00:37:10,745 --> 00:37:13,623
Are you seriously considering
endangering our family

392
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:15,623
just to avenge a witch?

393
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:19,105
-Are you questioning my loyalty?
-I'm questioning your judgment.

394
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:22,825
Think before you do this.

395
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:26,625
Get Diana out of Oxford, fine,
but don't take on Knox.

396
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,625
If you do, it'll be war.

397
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:42,185
I've never felt so protective
over anyone.

398
00:37:43,745 --> 00:37:46,705
You can protect her
without causing a shit storm.

399
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:51,503
Drop her off with Hamish in Scotland.

400
00:37:51,505 --> 00:37:53,465
Leave her at Woodstock.

401
00:37:55,225 --> 00:37:56,545
No.

402
00:37:57,745 --> 00:38:00,943
-I'll take her to Sept-Tours.
-What?

403
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,583
You can't put Ysabeau through that.
You can't leave a witch at her house.

404
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:08,185
It's my house too.
And I'm not leaving her there.

405
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:11,305
I'm going with her.

406
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:34,865
Matthew.

407
00:38:41,505 --> 00:38:43,143
What time is it?

408
00:38:43,145 --> 00:38:46,623
Five o'clock.
You've been asleep for ten hours.

409
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:49,305
You were exhausted
from the witch wind.

410
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:52,983
-Witch wind?
-Mm.

411
00:38:52,985 --> 00:38:55,945
No witch has summoned it
for centuries.

412
00:38:57,345 --> 00:38:58,945
You have to leave Oxford.

413
00:39:01,225 --> 00:39:04,463
No, I... I can't leave.

414
00:39:04,465 --> 00:39:06,505
Peter Knox will come after you.

415
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:10,505
-I can deal with Peter Knox.
-Not yet, you can't.

416
00:39:12,265 --> 00:39:15,665
Your power is extraordinary,
but it's undisciplined.

417
00:39:16,785 --> 00:39:19,863
You have to come to terms with it
somewhere safe.

418
00:39:19,865 --> 00:39:23,663
-I could go to my aunt's.
-No.

419
00:39:23,665 --> 00:39:25,945
No, I'm taking you home
with me to France.

420
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:30,145
No witch would dare trespass
on vampire land.

421
00:39:39,105 --> 00:39:41,305
You'll be safe there.

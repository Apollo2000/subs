MATTHEW: <i>Once the world was full of wonders</i>

3
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,760
<i>but it belongs to humans now.</i>

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,275
<i>We creatures
have all but disappeared</i>

5
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,594
<i>demons, vampires and witches...</i>

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,155
<i>hiding in plain sight</i>

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,556
<i>fearful of discovery</i>

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,075
<i>ill at ease, even with each other.</i>

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,560
<i>But, as my father used to say</i>

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,319
<i>in every ending...</i>

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,591
<i>there is a new beginning.</i>

DIANA SCREAMS

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,433
A witch in flight!

18
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,800
I haven't seen that for many

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,994
many years.

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,395
It's difficult to know when she's
been with De Clermont, where...

21
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,920
her scents begin and his...

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,636
end.

GERBET SNIFFS HER - SHE GASPS

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,680
Is it lust...

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,751
as well as the book that attracted...

26
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,959
Matthew to you.

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,559
Women, after all...

28
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,554
are his weakness.

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,480
Take your hands off her.

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,597
I want to examine her.

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,672
Stick to what we agreed, Gerbert.

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,510
I got her out from Sept-Tours.

33
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,152
You couldn't. You'll have your time
with her after I've had mine.

34
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,632
She's all yours.

35
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,794
DIANA: What do you want from me?

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,990
Relax.

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,470
We are both witches, Diana.

38
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,074
I'm not your enemy.

Now, no one can listen in
and there is no way out.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,959
I want to know
how powerful you really are.

44
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,800
Would you show me?
I don't have any power.

45
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,996
Why didn't you fly
when I dropped you, I wonder?

46
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,313
Because I can't fly.

47
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,313
Can't or won't?

48
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,035
Your family never teached you
how to use your magic?

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,356
It was their duty as your guardians.

50
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,794
Not every witch
shows magical aptitude.

51
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,395
You're not just any witch, Diana.

52
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,590
You're a Bishop.

53
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,189
It did not escape their notice
that you were powerful.

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,790
They've done you
a great disservice, Diana.

55
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,079
My <i>mummo</i> taught me
how to fly when I was a girl.

56
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,878
She was the one who helped me
understand my magic

57
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,235
and embrace my power.

58
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,590
Let me be the one to help you.

59
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,397
Show me the power inside you...

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,595
and I can teach you how to control it.

61
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,712
You don't need to go
through this alone.

62
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,879
I am not alone.

63
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,558
The vampire.

64
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,920
It's vital that I help you
control your power

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,117
so you can protect yourself
from Clairmont.

66
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,353
We don't have much time.

67
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,872
Gerbert will be back for you soon.

68
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,757
And if you want to make it
out of here alive...

69
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,510
then you need to start
co-operating with me.

70
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,676
Matthew isn't the one
I need protecting from.

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,680
He isn't the one holding me
against my will.

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,919
I'm not going to tell you anything.

73
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,952
So there is something you're hiding?

74
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,473
Matthew deceived you.

75
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,957
He only ever wanted
the lost manuscript.

76
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,394
That's not true.

77
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,949
He'll take what he wants
and he'll dispose of you

78
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,713
just like he did with Gillian.

79
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,035
Gillian?
She broke into Clairmont's lab.

80
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,039
She's just like you.

81
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,319
Working for Knox.

82
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,316
Doing anything he says
just to please him.

83
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,752
Everyone follows him blindly.
Gillian's dead.

84
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,679
Clairmont killed her.

85
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,960
The Oxford coven leader
found her dead body.

86
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,356
No.

87
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,238
No, Matthew wouldn't do that.

88
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,798
Bite marks all over her neck.

89
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,353
The body drained of blood.

90
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,793
Such a brutal attack.

91
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,156
Stop fighting your true nature.

92
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,712

Good.

95

Let's see what other power you have

96
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,957
besides the ability
to protect your mind.

97
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,720
There are two powerful witches here.
One light...

98
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,995
the other dark.

99
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,074
Beware of the witch with the blood
of the lion and the wolf.

100
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,355
Tell me...

101
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,880
which one is it?

102
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,751
SATU: You're a traitor, Diana.

103
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,911
A traitor and a disgrace.

104
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,159
You betrayed your own kind
for a vampire.

105
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,959
Think of your parents.
DIANA GRUNTS.

106
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,157
What that would do to them.

107
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,677
How dare you talk about my parents!
You didn't know them!

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,753
I was the one that was betrayed!

109
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,517
I grew up believing that humans
in their ignorance killed my parents.

110
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,271
But it was witches!

111
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,832
This pathetic witch wind
doesn't work on me.

112
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,390
You're a liar, Diana.

113
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,472
Don't you think I did research?

114
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,759
I know what happened.

115
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,117
Witches murdered my parents
and they covered it up.

116
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,915
Ask Knox.

117
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,636
Ask him!

118
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,759
But then it must be because
they were keeping secrets.

119
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,510
Like you are doing now.

120
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,754
What are you going to do?

121
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,472
Are you going to kill me?
Like the witches did to them.

122
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,990
I'm going to do whatever it takes.

123

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,279
BALDWIN:
Let's get her out of here.

329
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,156
HELICOPTER BUZZES

330
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,757
I'm glad you're safe.

331
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,318
I should call Sarah and Em.

332
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,756
Ysabeau will call them
and let them know you're safe.

333
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,472
I'll never let you go again.

334
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,400
Come on.

335
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,992
My face hit the floor.

336
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,198
Is the bone broken?
No, no, it's just badly bruised.

337
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,880
I'll examine you properly
when we get you cleaned up a little.

338
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,673
You showed such strength.

339
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,479
<i>Ma lionne.</i>

340
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,233
How did this actually happen?

341
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,476
Oh, Satu wanted to see my power.

342
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,556
She tried to rip me apart.

343
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,754
MATTHEW: Alright.

344
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,636
I think you'd be more comfortable
in bed. Shall we?

345
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,800
Put your arm round me.

346
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,520
MATTHEW: What is it, your back?
- Yeah.

347
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,593
It's tender.

348
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,600
Satu used her magic on me.

349
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,396
Would it be all right
if I take a quick look?

350
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,115
- OK.
- We need to take this off.

351
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,830
Scissors.

352
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,149
I'm going to have to
cut your top off, Diana.

353
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,749
What is it?

354
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,640
<i>Marie, Dieu mère!</i>

355
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,553
It's my insignia.

356
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,354
She's branded you.

357
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,835
Do you want to see
what she did to you?

358
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,715
Yes, show me.

359
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,752
Matthew, no,
she's been through enough.

360
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,720
She survived the doing of it.

361
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,110
The seeing of it
can't possibly be worse.

362
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,600
I've got you.

363
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,353
Are you ready?

364
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,596
Yes.

365
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,675
Satu said she was
going to open me up.

366
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,154
DIANA: But she didn't.

367
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,994
DIANA: Thank you.

368
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,233
You should really
try and eat something.

369
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,280
Did you kill Gillian?

370
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,953
No, I didn't.

371
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,036
But I should have killed her,
for betraying you.

372
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,794
I spared her life.

373
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,669
And I will not...

374
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,200
make the same mistake again.

375
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,870
And I will hunt down anyone
who wishes to harm you

376
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,599
and I will kill them.

377
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,996
I told you.

378
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,555
I know you told me.

379
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,478
Promise me one thing.

380
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
Name it.

381
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,592
You won't go after Satu.

382
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,633
I want to deal with her myself.

383
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,591
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

384
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,360
How's the witch?

385
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,115
Her name is Diana, and she's resting.

386
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,714
Thank you.
No need to thank me, Matthew.

387
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,551
I'll be taking her back
to the Congregation with me.

388
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,831
You would have her face Gerbert
and the other witches

389
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,230
knowing full well
what they would do to her?

390
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,593
I've made my decision.

391
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,360
I won't discuss it further.

392
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,440
Diana is staying here.
I'm the head of this family!

393
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,960
To protect the De Clermonts,
I will disown you.

394
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,277
This is no longer a family matter.

395
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,070
The Knights of Lazarus will
see to Diana Bishop's protection.

396
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,311
After all these years defunct

397
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,558
you're going to rally the Knights of
Lazarus to protect a fucking witch?

398
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,957
MATTHEW:
You are a Knight and you are my brother.

399
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,272
We fought at the Battle of Acre.

400
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,592
Helped the Albigensian heretics
resist the Northerners.

401
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,350
We do not come to the aid
of our master

402
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,553
to protect a forbidden love affair!

403
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,075
Diana is in need of our protection
from her own people

404
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,197
and I will see to it that she gets it.

405
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,991
Philippe should never have passed
the order on to you when he died.

406
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,954
Baldwin de Clermont

407
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,317
I call upon you to fulfil your sworn
oath and enter the battlefield

408
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,040
where you will obey my commands
until I release you.

409
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,710
As for the Congregation
pursuing Diana?

410
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,918
I'll try and make punishment
for Knox's new witch their priority.

411
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,956
MATTHEW: Thank you.

412
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,831
FOOTSTEPS MOVE AWAY

413
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,160
You've both shown that
you have some fight in you.

414
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,600
Hold on to that because
you're going to need it.

415
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,751
Do whatever it is you must to survive.

416
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,633
You can't hold the Congregation
off forever.

417
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,318
It's imperative that you make your
next move before they make theirs.

418
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Do you understand?

419
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,555
Diana.

420
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,874
Till we meet again.

421
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,838
CROWS CAW - BIRDS SING

422
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,755
Who are you?

423
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,434
What did he do to you?

424
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,953
I know that you're old.

425
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,920
Very old.

426
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,718
I felt that in your magic.

427
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
THE HEAD SIGHS

428
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,399
Meridiana.

429
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,119
Are you <i>the</i> Meridiana?

430
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,680
THE HEAD SIGHS

431
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,755
<i>Helvetti!</i>

432
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,476
He kept you all of this time.

433
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,029
Help me.

434
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,989
MERIDIANA: Release me.

435
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,759
You'll join the mothers
on the other side, as you.

436
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
THE HEAD GASPS

437
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,080
Only you.

438
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,190
None of him.

439
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,676
Beware the witch with the blood
of the lion and the wolf.

440
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,196
For with it she shall destroy
the children of the night.

441
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,192
The lion and the wolf?

442
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,395
Is it the baby? Are you taking
care of yourself, eating right?

443
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,109
No, no. I'm fine and so is the baby.

444
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,554
Just listen, Mum.

445
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,794
Would you like some tea?

446
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,416
No, no, no.
I want to know what's going on.

447
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
Soph.

448
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,831
You said you might know
who the witch is

449
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,957
that I need to give my statue to...

450
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,680
I shouldn't have told you anything.
I'm sorry if I got you excited.

451
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,816
She's not someone for you
to be getting involved with.

452
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,720
She's trouble.
She's <i>in</i> trouble, Agatha.

453
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,076
I... I see her in my dreams.

454
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,753
And I think that our connection
is so strong because...

455
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,675
she's a witch and...

456
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Well...

457
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,435
I was born of witches.

458
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
You're a witch?

459
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,040
No. No. I'm...

460
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,113
I'm a demon, but...
but my parents witches

461
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,989
and my grandparents
and theirs before them and...

462
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,233
It can't be possible.

463
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,239
Does that mean the baby
could be a witch?

464
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,433
I've got a pretty strong feeling
that she is.

465
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,480
And you didn't think to tell me?

466
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,235
If our baby is a witch
born of demons

467
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,313
she'll be everything the Congregation
fears and wants to destroy.

468
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,720
You didn't trust me.

469
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,240
My God, Nathaniel!

470
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,280
We didn't want to put you
in a difficult position.

471
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,709
I'm your mother.

472
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,555
You come first.

473
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Both of you do.

474
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,753
I'm this child's grandmother.

475
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,271
My loyalty and love are to you.

476
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,992
We... didn't mean to upset you.

477
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,750
Everything's more complicated now.

478
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,193
The witch is important, Agatha,
for me and the baby.

479
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,794
I just know she is.

480
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,199
Her name is Diana Bishop.

481
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,115
Thank you, weaver.

482
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,635
Weaver?

483
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,074
I feel so different.

484
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,074
The air in my lungs.
It's no wonder.

485
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,399
You've been liberated,
inside and out.

486
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,036
Unbound.

487
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
<i>Trop tôt.</i>

488
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,077
I think we've established
she doesn't need coddling.

489
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,671
I'm... I'm sorry. Am I...

490
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,279
Am I missing something?

491
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,319
We believe that you may
have been spellbound.

492
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,396
Do you know what that is?

493
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,160
Yes, but...

494
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,550
And what happened to you
at La Pierre...

495
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
freed your magic.

496
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
Diana.

497
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,711
Do you know who could
have done such a thing to you?

498
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,272
No, but I don't understand.

499
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,630
Only witches who were mad
were ever spellbound.

500
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,874
Witches who hurt people.

501
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,000
What am I?

502
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,910
- Home.
- Tell me the truth.

503
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
All this time, did you know
what was wrong with me?

504
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,760
What's going on?
Did you know that I was spellbound?

505
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,309
You killed Rebecca Bishop
and Stephen Proctor.

506
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,072
The power was never theirs.

507
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,556
It was Diana's.

508
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,558
No! I tested her!

509
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,474
There's a prophesy about
the end of the vampires.

510
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,472
I think it has to do with Diana.

511
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,637
Where are the spells for self-defence?

512
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,951
Those spells haven't worked
in generations.

513
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,520
She needs to learn control.

514
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,434
And you can teach me
how to defend myself, Matthew.

515
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,958
Is that what I think it is?
Ashmole 782.

516
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,357
You said, do not...

517
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,396
- run.
- HE SNARLS

517
00:42:24,305 --> 00:43:24,167

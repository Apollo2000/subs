When's the last time you
talked to your girlfriend?

163
00:06:09,842 --> 00:06:13,731
We don't talk that much,
if you know what I mean.

164
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:14,821
I'm usually reading.

165
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:16,842
Well, you might want to check in with her.

166
00:06:19,722 --> 00:06:21,741
You're so lucky you're still young.

we're only allowed 20 minutes

We got to turn 'em and burn 'em.

Well, but shooting the
breeze with the patients

181
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:49,891
is the reason I became a dentist.

doing it, just do it quicker.

Um, uh, anyway, y'all have a good day.

Here's the thing. [Chuckles]

I'm having the same problem with this paper

211
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:01,755
that I had with the last one,

212
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:04,905
is that it... it doesn't
address how you feel.

213

Now, answer this question for me.

00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:09,855
Why do you think people create conflict?

215
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:13,735
Because they haven't found
their best selves yet.

216
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:15,855
And why do you think there's
pain and suffering?

crack at this paper, okay?

is really hone your critical thinking.

I just can't give you what you want.

359
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:21,935
And believe me, I tried.

360
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:23,775
I talked to a crazy guy.

361
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:25,885
I watched an Anderson Cooper marathon.

362
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:28,745
I stayed up all night listening
to Joni Mitchell albums.

363
00:13:28,746 --> 00:13:29,845
What are you talking about?

364
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:32,765
Look, I know you think
being deep is important,

365
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:34,775
but I think other things are important.

366
00:13:34,776 --> 00:13:36,755
Like seeing the best in people,

367
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:38,945
and believing that the human
spirit is what gives us the gift

368
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:42,855
to face the world with
curiosity and optimism.

369
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:43,935
It's nothing personal.

370
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,835
You are obviously very deep and intelligent

371
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:48,895
and a little bit handsome,
and that's great,

372
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:50,895
but you just can't take someone
who has thought one way

373
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,815
their whole life and convince
them to think your way.

374
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:55,775
I am never gonna understand
your side of things,

375

and you are never gonna understand mine.

376
00:13:57,776 --> 00:13:58,855
And the more you force me to do it,

377
00:13:58,856 --> 00:13:59,935

What's it? Right where?

That's the crack I was talking about.

That's the passion I wanted to see.

I want you to argue with me.

Take a stand. Paint a painting.

Go and see a band that
you thought you hated.

That's what college is about.

and a scoop of tough love,

and found more than just
rainbows and unicorns.

It was still mostly rainbows and unicorns,

is always gonna be Sue.

[Marshmallow chirping]

I know you said don't
ask, but I have to ask.

409
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:07,895
Why do you have a bird?

410
00:15:07,896 --> 00:15:10,765
Why do I have a bird? [Chuckles]

411
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:11,955
I have a bird because apparently,

412
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:13,815
when you're a businessman,

413
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:14,955
you get to do lots of important stuff,

414

like, uh, picking up your boss'
crap from the dry-cleaners.

415

But when he forgets to give you his ticket,

416
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:20,795
you get to spend a half-hour

417
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:21,895
trying to convince "Dave the manager"

418

that you're not trying to
steal your boss' golf shirts,

419
00:15:23,926 --> 00:15:24,935
which makes you late to the vet,

where you're taking his sick bird,

but the guy won't take the bird

422
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,755
because it's one minute after 6:00,

423
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:30,835
so you get to go to the pharmacy

424
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:31,935
where you beg them to give
you the bird's medicine

425
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:34,835
which, they inform you, has
to be applied every two hours

to the bird's butt.

But what they don't tell you is
where on the bird is the butt.

lowest moment of my life.

I realize I should have reversed that,

00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,988
You know, you're not
gonna make me feel bad.

484
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:34,108
Everybody brings their work home with them.

485
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:36,908
I don't.

486
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:38,098
Last week, an earthmover
rolled over my foot.

487
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,938
I didn't say a word.

488
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:40,998
All my toes are completely black.

489
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:43,978
- You want to see?
- Uh, I'll take your word for it.

490
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,958
Axl and I are not alike in any way.

491
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,908
I happen to be a very positive person.

492
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:50,118
I know. You're very positive

493
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,028
that all your pie-in-the-sky
ideas are gonna work out.

494
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,928
And when they don't, you
complain and give up.

495
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:57,988
I do not have pie-in-the-sky ideas.

496
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:00,908
Really? How's that jewelry line coming?

497
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:02,008
You ever get Oprah to try on your earrings?

498
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:03,948
For your information, I
have some feelers out

499
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,028
to locate her exact address.

500
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:06,888
Okay, well, maybe when you do,

501
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:08,928
you should send her one of
Axl's buttronaut t-shirts

502
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:10,078
that were gonna make him famous.
Maybe I will.

503
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,998
I think they look great with the earrings.

504
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:13,958
Look, I'm just pointing
out that you and Axl

505
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,078
are kind of the drama queens of the house.

506
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,118
You know what, Mike?

507
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,068
I don't even know why I'm arguing with you.

508
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:21,028
If you think Axl and I are alike,

509
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:22,988
I am gonna take that as a compliment,

510
00:18:22,989 --> 00:18:26,048
because I love my son, and he
has a lot of great qualities.

511
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:29,018
You sit here in silence with
your stoic, black-toed army,

512
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:31,889
and I will be hanging with the dreamers.

513
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:41,763
[Sighs] What are you doing up?

514
00:18:41,764 --> 00:18:42,958
[Marshmallow squawks]

515
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:45,048
Axl: Marshmallow, just sit still! Ow!

516
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:46,998
That bird is not a fan of his medicine.

517
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:49,098
[Sighs]

518
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:52,078
Dad, I'm sorry I yelled at you
about the whole Cindy thing.

519
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,018
It wasn't your fault.

520
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:55,998
You were just the messenger.

521
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:58,958
Ah, don't take it so hard, Brick.

522
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:02,958
You... you've got a lot of life left.

523
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:03,998
It's fine.

524
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:05,958
I just thought you'd get
what I was going through

525
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:08,068
'cause you always talk about that girl.

526
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:10,028
You know, the one whose house

527
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:11,088
you always rode over to on your bike?

528
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:13,088
Ah, Debbie Sullivan.

529
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:15,048
Yep.

530
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,888
She had the greatest hair.

531
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:20,889
At Christmas, she used to put
jingle bells in her ponytail.

532
00:19:21,969 --> 00:19:23,099
Man, she was something.

533
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:28,008
Here's the thing, Brick.

534
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:31,898
When it comes to women,
there are no easy answers.

535
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:33,018
I don't know much,

536
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:34,928
but I've picked up a few
things over the years.

537
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,968
Even though you're only in...

538
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,008
- Eighth.
- Eighth...

539
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:40,008
I was gonna say eighth... grade,

540
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:41,988
women, in my opinion,

541
00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:44,068
are somewhat interested
in what you have to say

542
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:45,968
or what you think,

543
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:48,058
but they're definitely
interested in what you feel.

544
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:52,018
There's nothing like a father/son talk.

545
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:54,938
Of course, Brick didn't use
a word of Mike's advice.

546
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:56,998
He decided it was easier
just to pay Cindy 10 bucks

547
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:59,118
to never kiss another boy again.

548
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,018
But nothing beats a mother/son talk.

549
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:03,098
Ohh.

550
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:05,098
So, how was your day?

551
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:07,068
You do not want to know.

552
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:09,108
Actually, I do.

553
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:11,908
Hm.

554
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:14,898
I just had this whole picture in my head

555
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,938
of what it was gonna be
like, and it's just not it.

556
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:17,988
I got all these ideas,

557
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:19,068
and my boss just doesn't want to hear them.

558
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:21,058
I know what you mean.

559
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,108
One time, I told Mr. Ehlert this idea I had

560
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:26,118
for a labor day promotion, and he said,

561
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,938
[gruffly] "I got an idea.

562
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:28,998
Why don't you hose down that Camry?

563
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:31,058
I think a raccoon gave
birth in the wheel well."

564
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:32,918
[Both chuckle]

565
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,888
Mm.

566
00:20:34,889 --> 00:20:36,968
[Normal voice] Ooh, you pick
out the almonds, too, huh?

567
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,928
Yeah. I like the almond flavor,

568
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:42,068
but the nuts, they're
just too much chewing.

569
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:44,028
Yeah, right?

570
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:46,068
Like, why did they have
to complicated things?

571
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:48,078
We don't need any heroes.
Just give us the ice cream.

572
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,949
Yep.

573
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:54,988
You know, we should open an
ice-cream store together.

574
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:56,068
We would crush an ice-cream store.

575
00:20:56,069 --> 00:20:57,088
Plus, I'm taking econ now,

576
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,968
so I can run the money side of things.

577
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:00,958
Yeah, but you have such great personality

578
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:01,998
that we would want that out front.

579
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:04,118
Mm, you'd definitely want this out front.

580
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,068
You know what would be another
great flavor of ice cream?

581
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:08,028
Chips and dip.

582
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:09,968
Would there be actual chips in it?

583
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,068
No, no, no, no, no, no. Just the flavor.

584
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:13,108
You don't want chips in your ice cream.

585
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:15,008
Mm.

586
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:17,918
Yeah, 'cause salty and sweet
is, like, the big thing now.

587
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,118
Yeah. It would have,
like, a saltiness to it.

588
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,119
Just throw it together.

589
00:21:21,832 --> 00:21:28,922

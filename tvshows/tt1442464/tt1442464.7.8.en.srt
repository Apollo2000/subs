1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:06,126
Frankie: Out here in the middle,

2
00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:09,129
every day is pretty much
like the day before.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,767
You get up, you get dressed,
you go to work, you...

4
00:00:14,802 --> 00:00:17,671
Smile Superstars International?

5
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:19,339
Mm-hmm. It's some huge franchise.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,742
Apparently, they buy up
struggling dental offices

7
00:00:21,743 --> 00:00:23,677
and turn them into these
one-stop super clinics,

8
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:25,112
like Jiffy Lube for teeth.

9
00:00:25,113 --> 00:00:27,114
Mm. Well, at least you still have your job.

10
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:29,116
Yeah, but we're closed until January.

11
00:00:29,117 --> 00:00:30,717
I guess goodwin has to remodel the office

12
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:32,319
to look like all the
other smile superstars,

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,288
so no paycheck for two months.

14
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:35,822
Happy holidays to us.

15
00:00:35,823 --> 00:00:36,890
Mm.

16
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:39,293
Mm.

17
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:41,361
I really don't want to get
another job for the holidays.

18
00:00:41,362 --> 00:00:42,930
I mean, I'm too old to flip burgers.

19
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:45,165
I'm too young to be a Walmart greeter.

20
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,200
Actually...

21
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:47,935
Yeah, I'm thinking the same thing.

22
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:49,803
You're not too young to
be a Walmart greeter.

23
00:00:49,804 --> 00:00:52,105
That's not what I was gonna say.

24
00:00:52,106 --> 00:00:54,274
Oh.

25
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:56,343
- Your hair looks pretty.
- Mm.

26
00:00:56,344 --> 00:00:58,979
What I was gonna ask is, how's
the diaper business going?

27
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,747
I think you should get a
job for the holidays.

28
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:02,950
Damn it.

29
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:04,685
♪ ♪

30
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,955
Well, you are not gonna believe this.

31
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:13,026
So, I managed to get myself a holiday job,

32
00:01:13,027 --> 00:01:14,962
which is good. I'm back
at heritage village.

33
00:01:14,963 --> 00:01:16,163
Hey, there you go.

34
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:17,798
When in doubt, go back to the prairie.

35
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,166
Wait for the bad news.

36
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:20,200
Always do.

37
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:22,736
Heritage village is open on Thanksgiving,

38
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,375
and I'm working the Harvest Feast.

39
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:26,373
So now I don't know what
we're supposed to do

40
00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:27,908
about our Thanksgiving.

41
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:30,844
I hate to say it, but we
may have to float it.

42
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:32,179
Would everybody be okay with that?

43
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,981
All: Fine.

44
00:01:33,982 --> 00:01:37,084
Okay is that a "fine"
fine or a "TV's on" fine?

45
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:38,752
It's fine.

46
00:01:38,753 --> 00:01:40,654
Now I can go out to the bar
and drink with my friends

47
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:41,822
as the Pilgrims intended.

48
00:01:41,823 --> 00:01:42,990
Yeah. Works for me.

49
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:45,092
I can pick up some extra
shifts at spudsy's.

50
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:48,095
The mall's gonna be open
for 48 hours straight.

51
00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:49,997
Except they don't call
it Thanksgiving anymore.

52
00:01:49,998 --> 00:01:52,666
Now it's called black Friday Eve.

53
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:55,869
Hm. So, dad, looks like it's
just you and me at home.

54
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,371
Maybe we can do something together.

55
00:01:57,372 --> 00:02:00,040
Well, I'm gonna be
watching football all day,

56
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,809
but, uh, you're welcome to do
something right over there.

57
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,144
All right, well, if nobody cares,

58
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:06,680
how about we float
Thanksgiving to December?

59
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:08,282
Wait. That's too close to Christmas.

60
00:02:08,283 --> 00:02:09,716
Let's see.

61
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:11,952
How about... January?

62
00:02:11,953 --> 00:02:13,220
Can't. Our a cappella group

63
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:15,789
is doing this big month-long
tribute to the '80s...

64
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,991
Duran Duran-uary.

65
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:19,660
Brick: February's out.

66
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:22,362
Cindy's got something big
planned for Valentine's day.

67
00:02:22,363 --> 00:02:24,231
What's a couples retreat?

68
00:02:24,232 --> 00:02:26,733
Okay, how about march?

69
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:28,135
- March madness!
- March madness!

70
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:30,237
Okay, who's free in May?

71
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:31,938
Yeah, nothing good happens in May.

72
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:33,807
Well, except mother's day.

73
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:36,076
Like he said, nothing good happens in May.

74
00:02:36,077 --> 00:02:38,645
And it'll be warm out, so
maybe we can eat outside.

75
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:40,180
Ooh, we can put some turkey on the grill.

76
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,328
There's no rule that says
we got to eat a turkey.

77
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,685
We could eat hot dogs or potato salad.

78
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:46,887
This is starting to sound
a lot like Memorial Day.

79
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:50,390
Fine. Thanksgiving... June 12th. Done.

80
00:02:55,863 --> 00:02:56,963
Brad!

81
00:02:57,999 --> 00:02:59,733
What are you doing here?

82
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:01,101
I didn't know you were
picking up extra hours.

83
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:03,870
Aw, shoot. You just missed me.
I'm heading home to bed.

84
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:05,872
Got to get up early to help
with Thanksgiving dinner.

85
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:07,974
I'm added a fourth bean
to the three-bean salad

86
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:09,943
and pulling a layer out
of the seven-layer dip.

87
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:11,411
So watch out.

88
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:15,849
Oh, I know why you're here.

89
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:20,187
To serve delicious potatoes
to hungry shoppers.

90
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:22,122
And possibly see Logan.

91
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:23,757
Is it that obvious?

92
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:25,659
You keep darting your
eyes over at Abercrombie.

93
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,827
It doesn't take Benedict Cumberbatch

94
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:28,161
to figure it out.

95
00:03:28,162 --> 00:03:30,297
It's like we're so totally star-crossed.

96
00:03:30,298 --> 00:03:32,065
I mean, we had the best time at prom

97
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:34,301
and then I saw him up at
school and I lost him.

98
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:35,836
I didn't have his number.

99
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:37,938
So I thought if I am working over break,

100
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,840
maybe he's working over break.

101
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:42,909
So today, I am going to

102
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,113
casually go over to Abercrombie on my break

103
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:49,316
and try to casually run into him.

104
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:51,351
Oh, my god, Sue.

105
00:03:51,352 --> 00:03:53,253
You're like a really adorable '90s movie.

106
00:03:53,254 --> 00:03:54,689
I know, right?

107
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:00,194
- You go, Meg Ryan.
- Yeah.

108
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:07,167
Oh, well, hello, kind people.

109
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:09,403
If you're wondering what tool I'm using

110
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:12,973
to make my husband a
fine Thanksgiving feast,

111
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:16,309
this is a... a... What is it?

112
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,246
Um... hang on.

113
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:22,082
Oh, I remember. It's an
old-timey corn grinder. Pbht!

114
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,050
'Tis a grist mill.

115
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:27,721
Good morrow, and welcome
to our humble cabin.

116
00:04:27,722 --> 00:04:31,291
I'm Rachel Moody Cochran, and
this is my husband, Obadiah.

117
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:33,960
Hey. Hi.

118
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:37,764
Sorry, but I think I'm supposed
to be playing Obadiah's wife.

119
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:40,300
Perhaps thou has been stricken
with the devil's fever,

120
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:44,301
for it was I who wed dear
Obadiah on my 14th birthday.

121
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:46,673
Did you not read your packet?

122
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:48,909
You're not Rachel. I'm Rachel.

123
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,211
You're Abigail, the barren
spinster sister-in-law

124
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:52,979
with the clubfoot.

125
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,347
Are you sure?

126
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:56,149
'Cause I come back here
and play Obadiah's wife

127
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,851
every time I get fired from a job,

128
00:04:57,852 --> 00:04:59,753
and I get fired a lot.

129
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:02,055
Trust me, lady, 'tis I.

130
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:03,990
Fine. Relax.

131
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:05,225
I'll be the sister-in-law.

132
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:07,160
But I'm not playing the clubfoot.

133
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:09,664
Barren, on the other hand, sounds fabulous.

134
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:15,836
All right, Nick will be
here after pecan pie.

135
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,103
That's pretty much the whole class.

136
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:19,940
Whoo. We are gonna rage!

137
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:21,942
So how'd you convince your mom

138
00:05:21,943 --> 00:05:23,243
to let you out early on Thanksgiving?

139
00:05:23,244 --> 00:05:26,780
Well, I told her, "mom,
I'm a vegetarian now.

140
00:05:26,781 --> 00:05:29,015
I'm not eating anything
with a mother anymore."

141
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:30,984
And she said, "you don't
have a mother anymore."

142
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:32,185
Whoa.

143
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:35,322
I don't think I've even seen your mom mad.

144
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:36,389
Man, she needs to chill.

145
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,792
I mean, I-I'm evolving.

146
00:05:38,793 --> 00:05:40,994
I-I'm not even sure if I
want to be a doctor anymore.

147
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:43,330
It's like I've always just done
whatever Ron and Nancy want.

148
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:44,764
What... what about what I want?

149
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:46,066
Yeah.

150
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:47,834
Well, no one's really expected much of me,

151
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:49,169
so I guess I'm delivering.

152
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,338
See, you're lucky. Nobody hassles you.

153
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:53,273
You can just be the Ax-man.

154
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:56,076
Yeah, well...

155
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:58,111
Ax-man's not so awesome these days.

156
00:06:00,314 --> 00:06:02,782
I mean, football is a total bust,

157
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:04,684
um, got kicked out of my house at school,

158
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:07,954
so now I'm living at home with
my parents, like a loser.

159
00:06:07,955 --> 00:06:09,856
I don't even know what Devin
and I are doing anymore.

160
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:13,627
And school... everyone's talking
about jobs and grad school,

161
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:15,161

know if I'm gonna make it,

162
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:16,296
you know?

163
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:17,898
In the back of my mind, I always thought

164
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,933
my hair would be enough to
separate me from other people,

165
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:21,935
but maybe that's just not enough anymore.

166
00:06:21,936 --> 00:06:23,870
I don't know.

167
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:25,906

It's just really, really hard.

00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:32,345
Dude, are you crying?

170
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:35,115
Uh, no.

171
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:41,721
So the house may not have
smelled like turkey,

172
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:43,990
but it did smell like cool ranch Doritos,

173
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:45,826
and Mike was fine with that.

Aw, crap.

00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,707
Well, it's not a fuse.

176

Whole neighborhood's out.

Hey, you want to do something?

Edwin, I need a break.

185
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:42,082
Sorry, Sue. This is the
black Friday Eve rush.

186
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,950
We're on course to shatter
our sour cream record.

187
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:45,719
I'm about to roll out a third drum.

188
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,421
Okay, but I have been here 10 hours,

189
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:50,090
and I haven't had a break.

190
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:52,225
I am pretty sure that's illegal.
Come on, please.

191
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:53,793
Just let me take a little
stroll on over to Abercrombie.

192
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:55,095
Later!

193
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:57,063
Right now, I need you to push
the turkey-cranberry potato,

194
00:07:57,064 --> 00:07:59,199
'cause at midnight, we start
moving our Christmas product.

195
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,700
Oh, no.

196
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:01,868
Not the peppermint potato.

197
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:03,937
Yep. No, no, no.

198
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:06,373
This year, it's the gold,
frankincense, and myrrh potato.

199
00:08:06,374 --> 00:08:08,008
The gold is cheese sauce,

200
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:09,643
the frankincense is ham,

201
00:08:09,644 --> 00:08:10,944
'cause nobody knows what frankincense is,

202
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:12,045
and the myrrh is also ham,

203
00:08:12,046 --> 00:08:13,047
'cause nobody knows what myrrh is, either.

204
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:19,853
And then I stirred the almonds
into an earthen basin

205
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:22,088
with flour and gum dragon

206
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:24,024
and baked it in a wood-fired oven.

207
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,725
Oh.

208
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:27,894
And how did you make the soup?

209
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:30,830
Well...

210
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:33,900
I threw some vittles in a pot,

211
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:37,901
then I got some water from
yon crick over yonder

212
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:41,307
and poured that into a cotton gin.

213
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:46,566
Then Paul Bunyan ate it and
declared, "soup is good food."

214
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:49,350
Prithee a word, Abigail.

215

Did you even read your packet at all?

216
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,191
I skimmed it.

217
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:01,628
Okay, since you're clearly
unprepared, I'll do the talking,

218
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:04,264
and you can go in the back
and make the potato balls.

Really? That's gonna take forever.

222
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:09,903
Why don't we just do mashed potatoes

223
00:09:09,904 --> 00:09:11,271
and take a rain check on the potato balls?

224
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:12,706
Nobody will even notice.

The game is five-card stud, no draw.

You listen here, sister.

I did not claw my way up
from milkmaid to cinder girl

to seamstress to Obadiah's wife

to get kicked out of here because of you.

326
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,033
You think I'm not eyeing mayor's wife next?

'Cause I am.

Are you okay?

334
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,925
We heard a rumor you were out here crying.

What?

336
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:02,261
God, no. I'm fine.

Aww. Can we see?

Yeah, Debs. So pretty.

Oh. I'm so glad.

345
00:14:20,814 --> 00:14:23,049
What do you say, Court? Group hug?

346
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,052
Definitely group hug, Deb.

00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:33,026
Wow. Déjà Sue!

I never left.

You worked three shifts in a row?

Please tell me you saw Logan.

No.

353
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:43,269
But I saw one of the other greeters.

354
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,339
Turns out, Logan is in Chicago
visiting his grandma.

Oh, no.

This is great because
now I have a new plan.

360
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,385
I just need to casually drive to Chicago

361
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:01,854
and casually find out
where his grandma lives

362
00:15:01,855 --> 00:15:03,656
and casually wait outside her house...

363
00:15:03,657 --> 00:15:06,759
Sue, I'm gonna write you a
reality check payable right now.

quoting "lean in" all summer?

The Sue Heck I know
doesn't cross state lines

372
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:30,049
No, that's not him. That's Dale. I think.

373
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,852
Seriously. Could I be any more pathetic?

374
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,687
This is not the kind of woman I want to be.

Yeah. Fine. Why wouldn't I be?

Yeah. Well, I got to warn you.

393

Da da da.

Uh, okay, look.

397
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:34,380
Um, I don't know what y'all heard about me,

00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:36,015
but I'm doing great.

399
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:38,151
Actually, no. I'm doing awesome.

400
00:16:38,152 --> 00:16:40,686
Last month, I played the
best game of my life.

401
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:42,755
I was on the field for 72 seconds.

402
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:43,856
Yeah.

403
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:45,258
I'm still a business major,

404
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:46,959

And hey, I grew 1/4 inch when I
thought I was done, so yeah.

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,064
It's all good.

407
00:16:52,065 --> 00:16:56,636
I guess what I really
wanted to say is, um...

408

You know, it really means a lot

Hmm. I could play some poker.

Oh, dad, by the way,

419
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,907
there might be a rumor going around town

422
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:44,439
Turns out my pal Sheila
reported me to the town elders,

423
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,875
and I was demoted to cinder girl.

424
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:49,711
I can't tell you how much
it means to Obadiah and me

425
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:52,848
to have you here with us today
to share in our lord's bounty.

426
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:55,951
You see, this summer, my dear
brother Samuel sent news

427
00:17:56,264 --> 00:17:58,799
that his wife, Priscilla, was
stricken with typhoid fever,

428
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,968
and she might not survive the harvest.

429
00:18:00,969 --> 00:18:04,137
So we packed up our family in Lynchburg

430
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:07,140
and began our three-month journey by wagon.

431
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,810
But with the rain and hail,

432
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:12,112
the mountain pass proved treacherous.

433
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:15,415
For weeks, our wagon was mired in mud,

434
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,751
our food supplies dwindled.

435
00:18:17,752 --> 00:18:20,220
But even as we grew weak with hunger

436
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:22,222
and fended off bear attacks,

437
00:18:22,223 --> 00:18:23,924
the thing that kept us going

438
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:27,160
was the thought of being with
our loved ones on Thanksgiving.

439
00:18:27,161 --> 00:18:31,161
So after four grueling months,
we finally arrived in Orson,

440
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:34,334
and my dear brother greeted
our wagon with open arms

441
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:38,171
and good news... Priscilla
was going to live.

442
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:40,874
'Tis truly a time to rejoice,

443
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:45,924
for now our family is together
on this day of thanks.

444
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:50,688
Sadly, the trip proved too
much for little Johnny.

445
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:54,154
He contracted scarlet fever.

446
00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:56,923
The doctors say he may not
live to see Christmas.

447
00:18:56,924 --> 00:18:58,358
What?

448
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,927
Read your damn packet!

449
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:05,365
That is why today we give thanks

450
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:06,833
because you never know

00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:11,104
how many more thanksgivings
you're gonna get.

452
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:14,641
What was wrong with me? With my family?

453
00:19:14,642 --> 00:19:17,678
The Moody Cochrans didn't
float their Thanksgiving.

454
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,746
They crossed rivers and climbed
mountains and ran from bears

455
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:23,116
and mashed potatoes with
wooden sticks to be together.

456
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:25,419
They weren't all, "it's fine. I don't care.

457
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,987
I want to go to a bar."

458
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:28,622
Well, it wasn't too late.

459
00:19:28,623 --> 00:19:30,757
I had to make it home before
Thanksgiving was over.

460
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:33,260
I had to remind my sweet, sweet family

461
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:34,861
how thankful we should be.

462
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:36,630
Our life is good.

463
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:37,898
We've got nothing to complain...

464
00:19:53,748 --> 00:19:55,916
Where's my phone?

465
00:19:57,985 --> 00:20:00,654
Well, I guess things that are worthwhile

466
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:02,089
don't come without a struggle.

467
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,926
If the Moody Cochrans
could do it, so could I.

468
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:13,767
Mike: Okay, we're almost done with the...

469
00:20:13,768 --> 00:20:15,135
Whoo! Keep it.

470
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:17,804
Hey! Mom's here. Look.

471
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:19,673
Power's out. Living in the 1800s.

472
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:21,174
Tell me about it.

473
00:20:21,175 --> 00:20:22,309
Mom, come play!

474
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,643
You'll be on my team.

475
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:24,945
Oh, dad, we can have teams, right?

476
00:20:24,946 --> 00:20:26,413
I'll allow it.

00:20:26,414 --> 00:20:27,414
Pull up a chair.

or "the TV and the power are out,
so I had nothing else to do" fine?

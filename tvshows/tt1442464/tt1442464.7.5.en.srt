Okay,
you're kind of scaring me now.

You know, it's like when you get turbulence
and the flight attendant sits down

465
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:06,910
and you know it's time to panic.

You're my flight attendant. So stand
up and get the beverage cart moving.

I will.

I don't know.

In my life, I always know
what the next thing is,

thing and the next thing.

school and the house half empty,

I don't know what
the next thing is.

the ones in the commercial?

They take the

they end up living an active lifestyle,

That was a miserable weekend.

I was at 12 libraries,

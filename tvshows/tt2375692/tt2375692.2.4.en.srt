1
00:00:00,736 --> 00:00:02,903
Land ho!

2
00:00:02,938 --> 00:00:04,605
I'd like to go back and retrieve the gold.

3
00:00:04,657 --> 00:00:06,607
Refit, hire a consort, finish the job.

4
00:00:06,659 --> 00:00:08,860
- Is that possible?
- Well, it might have been possible.

5
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:11,111
Before the bay fell into
the hands of a madman.

6
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:12,830
Either we act now to
remove him or no one will.

7
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:15,332
Congratulations, Jack.

8
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:17,668
Now you know what it's like
to rise from the grave.

9
00:00:17,703 --> 00:00:19,787
We're gonna sail again.

10
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,339
Your judgment with her is clouded at best.

11
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,174
And there's nothing I can do to counter it

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,960
when I'm on the wrong side of that door.

13
00:00:26,962 --> 00:00:28,796
Found the prize they was hiding.

14
00:00:28,848 --> 00:00:30,297
Her father is Lord Peter Ashe,

15
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:32,016
governor of the Carolina colony.

16
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:33,967
Lord Ashe won't be trifled with.

17
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:36,103
I have no intentions of trifling with him.

18
00:00:36,138 --> 00:00:39,690
Charles Vane and the animals he commands

19
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:43,143
have until sunrise tomorrow
to vacate that fort

20
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:45,195
or, so help me God,

21
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:47,881
I will rain holy hell down upon him.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

23
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:21,018
Go on.

24
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:25,689
"If you fail to meet these demands,"

25
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:27,774
if you remain when the deadline arrives,

26
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,143
I will respond swiftly and definitively.

27
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:34,147
And as I currently sit fully
outside your means of retaliation,

28
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:37,951
this response will continue
unabated until you,

29
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:41,655
your men, and that structure
are rendered fully incapacitated.

30
00:03:41,657 --> 00:03:44,291
"Until dawn, Captain James Flint."

31
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:56,753
Get him out of here.

32
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:00,257
Put him behind a door somewhere.

33
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:03,176
I want him whole when
he delivers my answer.

34
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:10,291
Make ready the guns in the northwest.

35
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,986
Move everything we have
to the southwest bastion.

36
00:04:13,022 --> 00:04:16,323
He's telling the truth.
The southwest bastion

37
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:19,243
is too weak to support
any batteries at all.

38
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:24,698
We have no guns that
can reach his position.

39
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,704
Somehow Flint knew exactly
where to sit to take advantage.

40
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,626
Then find out how close I can get.

41
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,178
Now.

42
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:55,228
Tell me right now you had
nothing to do with this.

43
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:57,814
- Charles, look at me.
- Tell me this isn't part of your plan

44
00:04:57,866 --> 00:05:00,117
- to push me into the sea.
- Look at me.

45
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:07,741
I had no idea this was coming.

46
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:10,127
I had no idea that Flint
would be so fucking reckless

47
00:05:10,162 --> 00:05:12,245
as to threaten the fort itself.

48
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:14,665
I had no idea Hornigold
would be so fucking petty

49
00:05:14,717 --> 00:05:16,300
as to divulge secrets about its weaknesses,

50
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:18,835
risk its destruction for
his own personal gain.

51
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:21,088
I told you what I would do
if challenged like this.

52
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,673
- I know.
- I may not be able to hit his ship,

53
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:24,257
but I can hit the rest of them.

54
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,593
I can turn that whole
goddamn bay into a graveyard.

55
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:28,929
- But you won't.
- You doubt me?

56
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:32,766
No, I have faith in your ability

57
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:35,018
to formulate a plan more
effective than this.

58
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:41,825
The initial barrage will be
targeted at the southeast bastion.

59
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,694
Once the turrets are destroyed,
we'll turn our aim

60
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:45,946
to the weaker of the defensive walls.

61
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:48,281
Hammer them until the interior is exposed

62
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:51,785
and the fort is vulnerable to
an assault from the ground.

63
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:55,339
At this point, there's no limit
to the damage we can inflict.

64
00:05:55,374 --> 00:05:57,958
- How long to rebuild?
- Rebuild?

65
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,794
After we secure possession
of what's left of the fort,

66
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:03,646
how long will it take you and your
men to rebuild what we've destroyed?

67
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:07,801
10 weeks before the batteries are restored.

68
00:06:07,803 --> 00:06:10,637
Twice that to resecure the interior.

69
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,639
It is a risk,

70
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:15,609
but a relatively short
window in the grand scheme.

71
00:06:15,644 --> 00:06:18,195
A short window that coincides
with a British warship

72
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,697
sitting in anchor 40 miles from here

73
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:23,734
and my having stolen a Spanish warship

74
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:25,819
in full view of a company
of Spanish soldiers.

75
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:33,160
We'll just have to keep our fingers
crossed for a while, then, won't we?

76
00:06:33,212 --> 00:06:35,579
Are you suggesting the threat we posed

77
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:39,216
to Captain Vane is an empty one and we
have no intent of following through?

78
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:41,251
I am fully committed, as are we all,

79
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:43,837
to the removal
of Captain Vane from that fort.

80
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,922
But we'd be fools to ignore

81
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:48,258
the catastrophic risks
that lie down this road.

82
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,761
I have committed men
and resources to aid you

83
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:52,479
in retrieving the Urca gold.

84
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:55,348
In exchange for which you've
assured me of your assistance

85
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:59,186
of expelling Captain Vane from
that fort by any means necessary.

86
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:02,022
Now, as I hear you waver,

87
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:06,193
I feel forced to ask,
if the sun rises tomorrow

88
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:08,695
and Vane has not ceded to our demands,

89
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:10,864
then what will you do?

90
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:34,270
I was told it was urgent.

91
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:36,322
He said he wanted to see you right away.

92
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:40,577
What about?

93
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:43,329
It's all right.
It has nothing to do with you and I.

94
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,961
He'll be arriving in less than two hours.

95
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:01,829
I'm sorry, who?

96
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,551
The fourth Earl of Ashbourne.

97
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:07,387
Lord Proprietor to the Carolina colony,

98
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,938
including the Bahama Islands,

99
00:08:08,974 --> 00:08:10,473
and peer of the realm.

100
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:12,559
Lord Alfred Hamilton.

101
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:14,944
My father.

102
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,031
I'm told he expects a
full report of our efforts

103
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:21,151
to devise a plan for the
management of Nassau.

104
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:24,454
And you're concerned how he'll receive it?

105
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:27,157
I'm concerned about how he'll
receive one particular part of it.

106
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:30,910
The part you and I have yet to discuss.

107
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:34,297
I didn't think we had one of those.

108
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:40,420
These past few months

109
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:43,056
I have come to trust you.

110
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:45,675
Very much.

111
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:48,261
Which is why I feel I
can ask for your help.

112
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:51,097
When my father arrives,
I intend to propose something to him

113
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:53,099
which could be very dangerous politically.

114
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:55,568
What is it you want me to help you with?

115
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:59,355
I want you to try to talk me out of it.

116
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:36,309
Yes?

117
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,562
Ma'am, you're needed.

118
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:41,364
All right.

119
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:11,428
It's a Spanish warship!

120
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,665
There's a Spanish galleon
anchored in the harbor!

121
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:18,919
Is today some sort of holiday
that I've forgotten about?

122
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:21,788
Spanish warship anchored in the bay.

123
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,957
Word is it's Flint's crew sailing her.

124
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,260
And it's scaring the shit
out of everyone on the beach.

125
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:30,797
Flint's sailing a Spanish warship?

126
00:10:30,849 --> 00:10:33,099
Think we should try and
lure some of them inside?

127
00:10:38,307 --> 00:10:40,941
Wait. Does he have it?

128
00:10:40,976 --> 00:10:42,526
Does he have what?

129
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:44,311
Did Flint get to the Urca gold?

130
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:45,645
I don't know.

131
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:11,171
Hold there.

132
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:15,759
The fuck are you doing?

133
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:17,928
The situation is as we feared.

134
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,847
That warship is fully
outside our field of fire.

135
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,901
And given our severe disadvantage,

136
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:27,938
might she provide us valuable leverage?

137
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,690
Make sure Flint knows the
moment he fires those guns,

138
00:11:30,742 --> 00:11:34,027
her body gets dumped over the wall.

139
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,829
Your reply to Flint will be significantly

140
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:37,197
more effective if it
comes from me personally.

141
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:39,082
You might want to keep quiet now, miss.

142
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:42,869
You have questions about my loyalties

143
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:44,838
as it relates to Miss Guthrie?

144
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:51,678
Then accuse me. Challenge me. Fight me.

145
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:54,514
Or shut the fuck up about it.

146
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:58,051
Open the gate!

147
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:57,077
What are you doing here?

148
00:12:58,163 --> 00:12:59,863
Putting an end to this.

149
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:08,539
Miss Guthrie.

150
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,509
Captain Vane has issued a
reply to your ultimatum.

151
00:13:12,544 --> 00:13:14,844
It's being read aloud on
the beach as we speak.

152
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:18,715
I think you should see it.

153
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:28,808
Give us the room.

154
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,227
- I have as much right...
- Now, please!

155
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:49,712
"You must ask yourselves who represents"

156
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:52,832
the greater threat to your interests...

157
00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:56,135
my men in this fort

158
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,387
"or the madman on the water."

159
00:13:58,423 --> 00:14:00,389
It's effective.

160
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:02,675
Mm, I can see that.

161
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:07,230
What I cannot see is how
Charles Vane alone was clever enough

162
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:09,565
to turn this all into political theater

163
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:13,019
in which he is the defender
of the island's welfare.

164
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:15,354
Are you suggesting he had
help in crafting his reply?

165
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:17,990
Did he?

166
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:20,776
Were I to have aided
Captain Vane against your efforts,

167
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:24,113
helped him move into a more
favorable position last night,

168
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:28,451
what would such a move say about the
trust you and I are supposed to share?

169
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:31,170
I believe I was clear yesterday
about the danger he represents

170
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,456
and my desire to see him
removed from that fort.

171
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:35,124
Though you conveniently omitted the part

172
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:37,009
about how you were prepared
to use a Spanish warship

173
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:38,761
to annihilate the fort to achieve that end.

174
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:41,213
Your refusal to acknowledge the urgency

175
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,382
of the situation gave me no choice but...

176
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:47,353
But to do what? Disregard our partnership?

177
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:49,722
Ignore the resources and influence
and trust I have invested in you?

178
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:52,224
This isn't personal.

179
00:14:52,277 --> 00:14:54,393
It's too important for that.

180
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:58,064
All right, then.

181
00:14:58,066 --> 00:14:59,982
What is it you wish to accomplish here?

182
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,703
To see him removed from the fort.

183
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:07,540
Then this is a stupid fucking
way of going about it.

184
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:10,710
He'll never voluntarily leave if he
thinks it will show weakness to do so.

185
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:12,745
You want him out, here's how you do it.

186
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:16,666
You move this ship.
You allow him to save face on this score.

187
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:21,220
And then you and he and I sit down
at a table and we sort it out.

188
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:26,225
Eleanor,
I don't care if he leaves voluntarily.

189
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:31,397
If I give up this position,
I will never regain it.

190
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:34,433
And without this position,
the decision is his and his alone.

191
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:36,152
No, I simply cannot risk that.

192
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:37,570
Not with what's at stake.

193
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:39,271
You are talking about rendering this bay,

194
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:41,407
rendering Nassau completely unprotected.

195
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:44,110
I know!

196
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:46,412
And I am perfectly aware of
the danger that presents.

197
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:50,416
But when it comes to Charles Vane, you and
I simply do not see him in the same way.

198
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:55,705
Now, if you can see a way,

199
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:58,374
an effective, credible way out of this

200
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:00,376
that doesn't involve disabling the fort,

201
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:02,294
I would love to hear it.

202
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:03,763
If you think that he will hear reason.

203
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:05,514
Not with you holding a gun to his head.

204
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,299
Then I suggest you talk to him.

205
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,685
Because one way or another,
he is leaving that fort.

206
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:11,971
And right now my way is the only way

207
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:13,522
that I can be certain of that.

208
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:00,686
My name is Charles Vane
and you are now my guest.

209
00:17:00,738 --> 00:17:04,607
As such, no harm will come to you
as long as you do exactly as I say.

210
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:07,109
You understand?

211
00:17:09,497 --> 00:17:13,032
The other one, he said no talking.

212
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:16,001
Captain Low?

213
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:20,039
You don't need to worry about him anymore.

214
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:22,758
How can you be sure?

215
00:17:24,846 --> 00:17:26,295
I cut his head off.

216
00:17:32,804 --> 00:17:34,220
Good.

217
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:40,726
Now, your father is Lord Peter Ashe,

218
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:43,979
governor of the Carolina colony.
Is that right?

219
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:47,650
What is the total value of his estate?

220
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:49,235
I don't know.

221
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:52,622
How many rooms in his house?
How many slaves?

222
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:55,575
Honestly, I don't know.
Haven't seen him in years.

223
00:17:56,962 --> 00:17:59,829
I've been at school in London.

224
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:01,297
Are you close with him?

225
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,249
What?

226
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,969
I'm asking if there's any
reason I should expect

227
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:10,139
he may not be willing to pay
to ensure no harm comes to you?

228
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:17,096
You're asking if he loves me?

229
00:18:23,855 --> 00:18:25,655
He'll pay you what you ask.

230
00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:34,113
Can you write?

231
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:37,500
Of course.

232
00:18:37,535 --> 00:18:39,919
Then write the following.

233
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:46,125
You're a prisoner of the
pirate Captain Charles Vane.

234
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:49,583
Your ransom, should your father
ever wish to see you alive again,

235
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:51,797
is £250,000.

236
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,766
The next contact I'll
make will be to arrive

237
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:55,718
in Charlestown harbor
with you in my possession.

238
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,305
If I sense a trap or my demands are unmet,

239
00:18:59,357 --> 00:19:02,274
I'll kill you and throw
your body into the bay.

240
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:08,531
Do you understand?

241
00:19:57,415 --> 00:19:59,365
She's writing the letter now.

242
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:01,667
I want it on its way to Charlestown

243
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,503
before whatever's going to
happen here tomorrow happens.

244
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,372
Right.

245
00:20:06,374 --> 00:20:08,507
Who are they?

246
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,961
Friends from the beach.

247
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:16,715
They have pledged
their services to Captain Vane

248
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:20,686
to defend the fort and to
discourage any move against it.

249
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:24,023
It seems his pronouncement
has had the intended effect.

250
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:29,144
And 40 men becomes 60

251
00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:31,480
and the fight ahead only gets bloodier.

252
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:34,066
Then get out there. Sit with the captains.

253
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:35,567
Talk some sense into them.

254
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,536
Tell them that it's their ships and cargo

255
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:40,739
that will be subject to his
extortion the moment it suits him.

256
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,408
I'll get to the beach.
Appeal directly to the crews.

257
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,460
If we can stop anyone
else from going up there,

258
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:46,135
we can keep this from getting out of hand.

259
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:02,144
Can I assume when you say
you'll go to the beach

260
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,596
to make this appeal, you mean me?

261
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:09,018
All right, then.

262
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:14,106
Why do you think they went up that hill?

263
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:18,444
Beg your pardon?

264
00:21:18,496 --> 00:21:20,746
If we're to stop any more
men from joining his side,

265
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:23,082
isn't it a prerequisite
that we try and understand

266
00:21:23,117 --> 00:21:25,167
the thinking of the men who
have already joined him?

267
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,621
Sorry, are you asking my opinion?

268
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:35,127
Oh.

269
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:38,797
Well, uh...

270
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,102
I suppose one could argue
that it's simple fear.

271
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:45,971
Their fear of losing the fort

272
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:49,358
being greater than their
fear of Vane remaining in it.

273
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:50,859
But then again,

274
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:53,696
it's possible this has
nothing to do with the fort.

275
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:55,647
Nor with Vane.

276
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:59,034
Perhaps it's just them expressing
their opinions about you.

277
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,403
So you think that they see me

278
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:03,238
as the villain in this particular story?

279
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:08,210
I think that would explain
their decision, yes.

280
00:22:10,438 --> 00:22:14,550
And you? What do you think?

281
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,668
You see me as the villain here?

282
00:22:18,506 --> 00:22:22,591
I see you as the agent most likely

283
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:25,144
of securing my share of
the gold on that beach.

284
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,429
As long as that remains true,

285
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:30,315
I am not bothered in the
least by whatever labels

286
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:32,151
anyone else decides to affix to you.

287
00:22:37,331 --> 00:22:39,074
Why?

288
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:42,995
What do you think about it?

289
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,199
I'm sorry?

290
00:22:49,787 --> 00:22:52,588
It bothers you, doesn't it?

291
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:54,506
What they think?

292
00:22:57,511 --> 00:22:59,762
With the things you've done...

293
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:03,215
My God.

294
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:08,520
It must be awful being you.

295
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:14,476
Time is short.

296
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:17,062
You'd better be off.

297
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:28,407
We have reasonable proposals to
recruit men for the expedition.

298
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:30,409
To procure supplies and to ferry them.

299
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:32,711
But it will be the approach to
dealing with the Nassau pirates

300
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:34,463
by which the entire plan will be judged.

301
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:36,415
I feel that's where we're strongest.

302
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:39,501
Targeted raid on the beach
under cover from two men-of-war.

303
00:23:39,553 --> 00:23:42,554
Public trials and hangings of
roughly a dozen of the ringleaders.

304
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,424
And the replacement of the governor
with an officer of our choosing.

305
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:46,975
It's precise, it's affordable,

306
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:48,427
and it'll play well with the Sea Lords.

307
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:51,063
I understand that's the expected proposal.

308
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:53,816
The safest one.
But it's not the one I would like to make.

309
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:57,236
When my father arrives,
I would like to propose to him

310
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,655
that we don't hang the pirates.

311
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,108
- That we pardon them.
- I'm sorry, what was that?

312
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,445
I want to pardon them.

313
00:24:06,497 --> 00:24:08,197
- You want to pardon them?
- Yes.

314
00:24:10,451 --> 00:24:13,502
- How many?
- All of them.

315
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,497
- All right.
- The island needs commerce to survive.

316
00:24:15,506 --> 00:24:18,590
It needs labor. It needs men and
women vested in its interest.

317
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:20,066
Don't these men fit that description?

318
00:24:20,094 --> 00:24:21,293
Couldn't they become part of the solution?

319
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:23,262
You don't need me to answer that.

320
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:24,546
- They're men.
- They're traitors to the Crown.

321
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:27,299
- What difference does that make?
- Makes some difference to the Crown.

322
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:29,184
Just answer me this, would it work?

323
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:33,272
To pardon a traitor is the act of a coward.

324
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,474
And given our current war footing,

325
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:38,694
precisely no one in Whitehall
wants to wear that label right now.

326
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:41,029
If you propose this to your father,

327
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:45,150
he will almost certainly distance
himself from it and most likely from you.

328
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:47,402
Now, I only know
what I've heard of your father,

329
00:24:47,454 --> 00:24:49,571
but if half of what I've heard is true,

330
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:51,740
he's not a man one wants as an enemy.

331
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:56,078
If you're asking me as your
liaison to the Admiralty,

332
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,747
my advice to you

333
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,583
is that this is a maneuver
only to be approached

334
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:03,218
with utmost caution.

335
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:08,340
But as your friend,

336
00:25:08,392 --> 00:25:11,343
I suggest you forget
you ever thought of it.

337
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,183
They came through the gate like locusts,

338
00:25:18,235 --> 00:25:19,851
Vane and his men.

339
00:25:19,904 --> 00:25:22,154
Brothers of mine being hacked to pieces.

340
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:24,690
I swear to Christ Almighty,

341
00:25:24,692 --> 00:25:27,859
it wasn't the screams that haunt me most.

342
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:30,529
It was their laughter.

343
00:25:30,581 --> 00:25:34,666
I thought they said no one survived
the raid from Captain Hornigold's crew.

344
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:38,337
Well, I guess one of them
must have gotten away.

345
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:42,841
So what do you make of this business
between Captains Flint and Vane?

346
00:25:45,346 --> 00:25:47,963
Thank you. Lovely performance.

347
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:58,523
Hello, friend.

348
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,527
Man around the bend has something to say
about this business at the fort.

349
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:07,399
The fuck's going on in there?

350
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:09,401
Pulled a man out of the water.

351
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:11,403
Up by the north point.

352
00:26:11,455 --> 00:26:13,372
That's lucky.

353
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:15,707
We were just about to send for one of you.

354
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:16,908
Excuse me?

355
00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:18,994
You're a Walrus man, aren't you?

356
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:20,462
Sorry, what are you talking about?

357
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:21,964
He's one of yours.

358
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:58,700
I assume Captain Flint wasn't
amenable to your suggestion.

359
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:01,953
He's not listening to me and
this place is slipping into ruin.

360
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:05,707
It's my commitment to
see this fort protected

361
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,260
from all enemies, all threats.

362
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:10,962
So as you consider where
to lay your support,

363
00:27:11,015 --> 00:27:14,683
consider which of us represents
the greatest threat...

364
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:17,769
my men in this fort or
the madman on the water?

365
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:20,889
- How many criers did you pay?
- Four total, as you asked.

366
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:22,307
Sent to the ends of the camps.

367
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:23,942
But what I don't understand

368
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,861
is why we're supporting
Captain Vane's position.

369
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:27,646
We're not supporting it, we're relaying it.

370
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:31,066
With all due respect,
I can't see the difference.

371
00:27:31,118 --> 00:27:32,734
I think I can live with that.

372
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:34,202
So what do we do now?

373
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:37,050
The only one who can stop this is Flint.

374
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:39,825
I'll just have to find
someone to convince him.

375
00:27:42,546 --> 00:27:45,547
He's moving in a direction
that promises unimaginable chaos.

376
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:48,216
He won't listen to me,

377
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:50,802
but perhaps he would listen
to an appeal from you.

378
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:56,975
I appreciate your frustration.

379
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,450
Were there something I could do to help,
I assure you I would.

380
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,147
You can make him see how
destructive his actions would be.

381
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:04,399
- You can make him...
- If you believe...

382
00:28:04,435 --> 00:28:06,852
if you believe anyone can
make him see anything,

383
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:08,770
you must not know him very well at all.

384
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:13,742
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

385
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:16,161
You weren't here the last time they came.

386
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,830
200 Spanish soldiers walked onto the beach.

387
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:21,867
They burned the huts on the beach
and then the structures in town.

388
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,369
When the whole of Nassau
was a smoking wreck,

389
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:26,421
they turned their eye inland.

390
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:28,924
They raped, they murdered,

391
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,625
they laid waste.

392
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:33,128
And all because there was
no fort to protect the bay.

393
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,881
The men in charge had allowed
it to fall into disrepair.

394
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:41,553
Please, help me to dissuade him

395
00:28:41,605 --> 00:28:43,805
from putting us on that path again.

396
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:46,141
If you're concerned for your safety,

397
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:47,726
perhaps you should request sanctuary

398
00:28:47,778 --> 00:28:49,444
along with your father
at the Underhill estate.

399
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,729
I'd be happy to carry the message.

400
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:52,564
You think this is about me?

401
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:55,817
You asked me for my help
yesterday with Mr. Underhill.

402
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:58,403
I gave it my best efforts.
You asked me today again for my help,

403
00:28:58,455 --> 00:28:59,788
but I'm sorry,

404
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,624
what you ask is simply impossible.

405
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:05,494
You don't give a shit
about the rest of us, fine.

406
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:10,465
But Flint. Don't you care enough about him

407
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:12,918
to at least try to stop
him from doing this?

408
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:16,471
Don't I care about him?

409
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:18,590
He's the one in the most immediate danger.

410
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:20,642
- And you would do nothing...
- You who have enabled him,

411
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,727
encouraged his violence,

412
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:25,764
you ask if I care about him?

413
00:29:25,816 --> 00:29:28,600
How dare you?

414
00:29:30,304 --> 00:29:32,988
Get out of my house.

415
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,132
Yes? What?

416
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,602
- New recruits?
- Mm-hmm.

417
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:07,022
It would appear your reconciliation
with Captain Vane has borne fruit.

418
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:10,275
Though, perhaps,
of the low-hanging variety.

419
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,978
Thank you for your concern.

420
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:16,231
Did you know?

421
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:19,150
Before she opened the door?

422
00:30:21,872 --> 00:30:23,872
No, I didn't know.

423
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:26,741
You must care for her a great deal.

424
00:30:26,793 --> 00:30:30,328
Not once all night did you so
much as look in my direction.

425
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:34,216
I've seen enough to know to
keep my distance from you,

426
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:35,800
thank you very much.

427
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:38,003
The situation was not of my making.

428
00:30:38,055 --> 00:30:39,838
If it was anyone's, it was yours.

429
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,723
I'm sorry, what?

430
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,843
The conflict within her.
I had it under control.

431
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:47,679
Right until the moment you
walked in on her and me.

432
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:51,850
For that was the moment you began
the competition between you and me.

433
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:54,436
What is happening here, the three of us,

434
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:56,238
it is only temporary.

435
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:59,691
A state of denial until
she finally makes a choice.

436
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:02,027
A choice between you and I?

437
00:31:04,748 --> 00:31:07,198
Anne and I have been by each other's sides

438
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,918
since she was 13 years old.

439
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:13,088
We have sailed together.
We've killed together.

440
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:16,041
We have shared things you
couldn't begin to imagine.

441
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:18,793
You've shared a bed with her for a week.

442
00:31:18,845 --> 00:31:22,047
You'd be amazed what can
change in a week in my bed.

443
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:28,219
I understand you're feeling
quite indispensable of late.

444
00:31:28,272 --> 00:31:31,222
But rest assured, it only seems that way.

445
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:33,224
I wouldn't get too comfortable were I you.

446
00:31:33,277 --> 00:31:37,729
And what if I can get you
back on the water with a crew?

447
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:40,949
Would I still only
seem indispensable then, too?

448
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,653
One of the girls has a lead?

449
00:31:44,705 --> 00:31:46,905
Mm, but which one?

450
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:51,042
They're so mistrustful of
male authority figures.

451
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:54,796
It'll take some time before they
report these things to you and not me.

452
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:00,885
Come.

453
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:08,093
Mr. Featherstone.
Been a regular for months now.

454
00:32:08,145 --> 00:32:10,261
The navigator on the Colonial Dawn.

455
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:13,064
Finest on the island, so he says.

456
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,767
He's all right. Go on.

457
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:18,937
Put my tongue in his bum,
he'd tell me anything.

458
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:21,906
So I did and he did.

459
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:24,109
He's looking to move.

460
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:26,911
Said the men were split badly
over the mess on the beach.

461
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:29,114
Some backing Flint,
some saying he'd gone mad.

462
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:31,750
Said the crew been fraying
for some time, anyway.

463
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:36,838
Said in all likelihood, a lot of those men
would follow him wherever he went

464
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:38,506
on account of his skills.

465
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:42,794
And we have a plan
to sway him and his men to our camp?

466
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:44,963
I'm going to fuck the
living shit out of him.

467
00:32:47,017 --> 00:32:50,218
If he chooses to join
Captain Rackham's crew,

468
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,804
that decision must be heartfelt.

469
00:32:52,856 --> 00:32:54,973
It cannot be cast into doubt
the moment the pleasure fades.

470
00:32:55,025 --> 00:32:57,108
And for that, you cannot just fuck him.

471
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:58,643
You must seduce him.

472
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:04,733
Yes, there is a difference.

473
00:33:04,785 --> 00:33:06,951
The breath in his ear.

474
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:10,238
The arch in your back when he
thinks he is making you finish.

475
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,158
The look in your eyes when
you finally breathe again

476
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,044
that tells him you would do
anything he asked in that moment.

477
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,663
Anything at all without hesitation.

478
00:33:18,715 --> 00:33:22,000
The story you tell him that night
about when you were a little girl,

479
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:25,637
about the place you hid from your mother
where the world was quiet.

480
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:30,008
A story you've never told another soul.

481
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,143
The look of confusion you show him

482
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:33,845
when you wake up the next morning

483
00:33:33,897 --> 00:33:36,431
that tells him despite
the thousand other men

484
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:39,851
you've awoken beside, that he is unique.

485
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:42,153
That he has seen you vulnerable.

486
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:44,105
And that you cannot live without him.

487
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:48,827
I completely understand.

488
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:55,250
Just so we're clear,
I still fuck the shit out of him, yes?

489
00:33:57,003 --> 00:33:59,003
Yes.

490
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,840
Is there anything else
you would like to add?

491
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:05,877
Uh, no. No, I don't think so.

492
00:34:17,023 --> 00:34:18,556
Tell me again,

493
00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:20,892
who are those men camped out
in your family's storehouse?

494
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:22,277
What men?

495
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:24,062
Perfect.

496
00:34:28,785 --> 00:34:30,869
We're doing wrong.

497
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:32,954
He can't be on the ship right now.

498
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,824
Captain is holding things
together with both hands

499
00:34:35,876 --> 00:34:38,042
and Billy will, understandably,

500
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:40,745
have some feelings about the
events of this past week.

501
00:34:40,797 --> 00:34:43,465
If those feeling were expressed right now,

502
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,669
it could spoil whatever chances
we have to retrieve the Urca gold.

503
00:34:54,144 --> 00:34:55,760
Where is this?

504
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,931
It's all right. You made it home.

505
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,109
What was that?

506
00:35:12,913 --> 00:35:16,498
Get... Gates.

507
00:35:42,108 --> 00:35:44,893
Featherstone and Idelle?

508
00:35:44,945 --> 00:35:48,062
- Max told me.
- Ah.

509
00:35:48,114 --> 00:35:51,482
Been in there going on three hours.

510
00:35:51,535 --> 00:35:53,535
Do you think she can do it?

511
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,370
Swing him our way?

512
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:58,323
I think I have underestimated my last whore

513
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:00,325
for a while,
given the week I've been having.

514
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:07,966
I've put a lot of bodies in
the ground for you, haven't I?

515
00:36:10,554 --> 00:36:11,669
Excuse me?

516
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:13,388
Watched your back.

517
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:14,672
Cleaned up your messes.

518
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:17,508
Carried out your plans.

519
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:21,512
I didn't always understand.

520
00:36:21,565 --> 00:36:24,265
Didn't always agree.

521
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:27,402
But I did it.

522
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:30,405
Some fucked-up, awful shit
'cause I knew you needed it done.

523
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:33,608
I don't think the night you had last night

524
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,526
comes even close to
something to bitch about.

525
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:39,530
I know you know this is
significantly more complicated

526
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:42,450
than the quantity of tits I have
access to at any given moment.

527
00:36:42,502 --> 00:36:45,620
I know she's dangerous.

528
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:48,289
Especially to me.

529
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:51,292
I ain't in my right head about her.

530
00:36:51,344 --> 00:36:53,378
She knows it.

531
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,296
And it ain't hard to imagine her intent

532
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:57,765
is to play us off one against the other.

533
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:00,852
But I'm asking you to do this for me.

534
00:37:02,606 --> 00:37:04,439
I'm asking you to watch my back

535
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:06,975
on the other side of that door.

536
00:37:07,027 --> 00:37:10,528
'Cause I know as long as you are, there
ain't shit she can do to get between us.

537
00:37:46,983 --> 00:37:50,184
Mr. Featherstone will announce
to his shipmates tomorrow

538
00:37:50,236 --> 00:37:52,186
that he has joined a new crew.

539
00:37:52,238 --> 00:37:53,604
Your crew.

540
00:38:01,164 --> 00:38:02,447
What?

541
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:10,254
He believes a number of
his men will join him

542
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,256
upon hearing this news.

543
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,459
At least 28 men.

544
00:38:16,262 --> 00:38:18,212
That's more than half his crew.

545
00:38:18,264 --> 00:38:19,630
In addition to these new recruits,

546
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:23,468
you will be granted command
of their ship as well.

547
00:38:25,188 --> 00:38:27,555
Congratulations, Captain.

548
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:47,325
A few more men in the fort
now than two hours ago,

549
00:38:47,377 --> 00:38:50,244
though I believe we stemmed the tide there.

550
00:38:50,296 --> 00:38:54,665
The captains I've spoken with are
on firm agreement with our position.

551
00:38:54,718 --> 00:38:56,384
Several of them have
committed men and resources

552
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:58,336
to the final assault up the hill.

553
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:01,723
Though we have yet to hear
from your man Mr. Silver,

554
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:04,058
word has come in from the beach.

555
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:05,593
Support is in our favor,

556
00:39:05,645 --> 00:39:08,513
though division amongst the
remaining crews is rampant.

557
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:12,400
Reports of skirmishes amongst and
within the camps has been arriving...

558
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:14,352
Numbers, please.

559
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,237
Pardon?

560
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:20,691
We're well aware of the discord
caused by Captain Vane's entreaty.

561
00:39:20,744 --> 00:39:23,828
I want to know what we'll be
facing if we go down this road.

562
00:39:29,502 --> 00:39:32,370
Roughly 65 men in the fort,
plus or minus 10.

563
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:34,205
We bring to bear 90 men on our own

564
00:39:34,257 --> 00:39:37,542
plus 50 pledged by sister crews.

565
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:40,094
On rough terrain and
fighting an entrenched enemy,

566
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,680
I think it's safe to assume that casualties

567
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:45,466
will number threescore on our side.

568
00:39:45,518 --> 00:39:47,552
As I've said, we ought harbor no illusions

569
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,520
about the blood that will
be spilled on that hill.

570
00:39:54,277 --> 00:39:56,144
Father, how was your travel
from the country?

571
00:39:58,114 --> 00:40:00,398
Wet.

572
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:04,235
Well, I think you're most optimistic

573
00:40:04,287 --> 00:40:06,487
about the Admiralty's willingness to outfit

574
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:09,574
these ships you assume you can procure.

575
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:11,492
But as for the rest of it,

576
00:40:11,544 --> 00:40:13,628
seems like a reasonable proposal.

577
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:15,630
Do you agree, Lieutenant?

578
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:17,632
Yes. Yes, I would, sir.

579
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:22,503
I see. Well, then, perhaps we can discuss

580
00:40:22,555 --> 00:40:27,225
the one element you so
conveniently elected to ignore.

581
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,310
What about the pirate raiders of Nassau?

582
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:36,767
I want to put them to work.

583
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,736
To work? At what?

584
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:40,571
Tilling, harvesting, coopering,

585
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:42,773
building, smithing, fishing.

586
00:40:42,826 --> 00:40:44,909
What are you talking about, Thomas?

587
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,697
I intend to secure them pardons.

588
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:53,284
A blanket amnesty for any
man who will accept it.

589
00:40:53,336 --> 00:40:55,253
In exchange for his allegiance,

590
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:58,623
his renunciation of violence and his labor.

591
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:05,796
What a piece of work you are.

592
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:08,132
You asked me to formulate a plan.

593
00:41:08,184 --> 00:41:09,851
That's what I've done.

594
00:41:11,304 --> 00:41:14,639
I asked you to formulate a plan

595
00:41:14,691 --> 00:41:18,192
that would secure the support
of the navy in our efforts.

596
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:21,145
Support without which
there is little chance

597
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:24,315
of reversing the catastrophic
downward trend in revenue

598
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:25,983
from the Bahama territories.

599
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:29,203
Support that is almost
certain to disappear entirely

600
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:32,823
and for good the moment they
hear they are to be associated

601
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:36,494
with a plan to reward men who are
in open revolt against the Crown.

602
00:41:36,546 --> 00:41:39,881
This is the solution most likely
to lead to our desired result.

603
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,916
It also has the virtue of
being the right thing to do.

604
00:41:41,968 --> 00:41:44,635
Oh, for God's sake.

605
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:47,171
Lieutenant, am I right to assume

606
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:48,723
that a proposal such as this...

607
00:41:48,758 --> 00:41:50,174
Don't look at him. Talk to me.

608
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:58,015
My son is impertinent, Lieutenant.

609
00:41:58,067 --> 00:42:00,318
My son is indulged.

610
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:02,904
My son is self-righteous.

611
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:05,690
But he's not stupid.

612
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:08,993
Perhaps you could explain to me

613
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:11,362
how you intend to distract the queen

614
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:13,998
from her war to issue these pardons.

615
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:15,666
I wouldn't need her to do anything.

616
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:17,335
A simple act would
accomplish the same thing.

617
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,704
Of Parliament? There aren't four votes

618
00:42:19,756 --> 00:42:21,289
among the lords for
something as absurd as this.

619
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:24,542
Sutton, Dunster, Lewis, Form, Philpott.
There's five.

620
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:26,877
They're easy. I haven't even opened
my mouth to make an argument.

621
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,713
An argument to abet
sedition in times of war?

622
00:42:28,765 --> 00:42:31,766
A war, sir, to ensure that a
Protestant sits on the throne of Spain.

623
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:33,517
Thomas, if I were a rival of this family,

624
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:35,937
I would be shouting from
the rooftops that any man

625
00:42:35,972 --> 00:42:38,723
who proposes to pardon a
traitor in times such as these

626
00:42:38,775 --> 00:42:40,057
is himself a traitor.

627
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:43,110
We are fighting a war in the
service of the son of God.

628
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:45,896
And it is treason to offer forgiveness
to any man who would seek it?

629
00:42:45,949 --> 00:42:47,198
What in the hell is it you
think we're doing here?

630
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:49,066
This isn't your goddamn salon, Thomas.

631
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:52,974
If you do not forgive men their sins,
your father will not forgive your sins.

632
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:55,456
- I don't want to hear it!
- I know you don't.

633
00:43:06,886 --> 00:43:09,503
Lieutenant.

634
00:43:09,555 --> 00:43:12,223
I'll ask you once again,

635
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:14,976
am I to assume by your silence

636
00:43:15,011 --> 00:43:18,145
that you are in agreement
with this proposal?

637
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,983
The lieutenant has dutifully
expressed his reservations...

638
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:24,769
Madam...

639
00:43:24,821 --> 00:43:29,273
you have done enough to damage
the good name of this family.

640
00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:31,442
I would ask that you keep both your mouth

641
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:33,444
and your legs firmly shut going forward...

642
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:35,780
I support it.

643
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:43,004
I found his argument persuasive.

644
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:46,090
I find his intent to be good and true.

645
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,426
And I find yours wanting, sir.

646
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,514
I will be relaying my findings to
Admiral Hennessey in short order.

647
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:56,851
And now I think it's time you left, sir.

648
00:44:13,152 --> 00:44:16,070
Gentlemen.

649
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:36,223
Did you just ask my father

650
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:38,259
to leave his own house?

651
00:44:56,996 --> 00:45:00,197
Right now he will be dispatching
messages to the Sea Lords,

652
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:02,700
the Southern Secretary,

653
00:45:02,702 --> 00:45:04,034
his friends in the Privy Council.

654
00:45:04,087 --> 00:45:07,838
He will stop at nothing to ensure
that this plan never sees the light of day.

655
00:45:07,874 --> 00:45:10,925
And now you're in the line of fire.

656
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,010
People can say what they like about you.

657
00:45:15,848 --> 00:45:17,932
But you're a good man.

658
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,637
More people should say that.

659
00:45:24,891 --> 00:45:27,024
And someone should be willing to defend it.

660
00:45:45,077 --> 00:45:46,827
Pastor.

661
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,130
It's before dawn.

662
00:45:49,165 --> 00:45:51,832
I don't sleep anymore.

663
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:04,929
I've seen you at my service.

664
00:46:04,981 --> 00:46:08,766
I've kept my distance,
but I've seen you there.

665
00:46:08,818 --> 00:46:11,152
Heard of your efforts
to join our community.

666
00:46:11,187 --> 00:46:12,853
To make a fresh start.

667
00:46:12,905 --> 00:46:16,023
I've wanted to believe it to be true.

668
00:46:16,075 --> 00:46:18,325
After...

669
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:20,911
after what happened between you and I,

670
00:46:20,947 --> 00:46:24,081
I wanted to believe that
as vile as the act was,

671
00:46:24,116 --> 00:46:26,784
perhaps it was born of a misguided desire

672
00:46:26,836 --> 00:46:28,836
on your part to change your ways.

673
00:46:28,871 --> 00:46:30,704
To seek a more virtuous path.

674
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:35,843
I do seek a more virtuous path.

675
00:46:35,878 --> 00:46:39,547
Then why am I also hearing that you've
been receiving Mr. Guthrie's daughter?

676
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,800
Making requests
of Mr. Underhill on her behalf?

677
00:46:42,802 --> 00:46:44,435
You don't understand.

678
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:47,771
I understand more than you think, ma'am.

679
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:51,809
I've been to town today.

680
00:46:51,861 --> 00:46:54,612
I hear that one of the
thieves on the beach,

681
00:46:54,647 --> 00:46:57,648
desirous of impressing her,
assaulted another.

682
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,150
Killed him.

683
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:03,821
And in a display for all to see,
mounted his severed head on a pike.

684
00:47:03,823 --> 00:47:06,540
Were this not monstrous enough,

685
00:47:06,576 --> 00:47:09,076
talk is it was all in service
of stealing a young girl

686
00:47:09,128 --> 00:47:11,412
intended to be ransomed to her father.

687
00:47:11,464 --> 00:47:14,999
None other than the governor
of the Carolina colony.

688
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:17,051
An upstanding, God-fearing man

689
00:47:17,086 --> 00:47:19,887
hundreds of leagues from here
is unsafe from their brutality.

690
00:47:19,922 --> 00:47:22,423
These are Miss Guthrie's associates.

691
00:47:22,475 --> 00:47:25,843
These are the men on whose behalf
you would act by doing her bidding.

692
00:47:25,895 --> 00:47:28,812
Men who seek profit
through the most boundless,

693
00:47:28,848 --> 00:47:31,181
wanton, unrepentant barbarism.

694
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:34,685
And I'm to believe that your
desire to repent is genuine?

695
00:47:34,737 --> 00:47:36,520
Lord Ashe?

696
00:47:36,572 --> 00:47:38,572
What?

697
00:47:38,608 --> 00:47:40,491
The governor in Carolina,

698
00:47:40,526 --> 00:47:43,444
it is Lord Peter Ashe, it is not?

699
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:46,614
I believe so, but...

700
00:47:47,867 --> 00:47:50,534
Lord Ashe's daughter, what was her name?

701
00:47:50,586 --> 00:47:53,120
Mrs. Barlow,
what difference does her name make?

702
00:47:53,172 --> 00:47:55,205
Abigail.

703
00:47:55,258 --> 00:47:58,542
Her name is Abigail Ashe.

704
00:47:58,544 --> 00:48:00,544
Absolution.

705
00:48:00,596 --> 00:48:03,213
A clean slate for all
those willing to accept it.

706
00:48:03,266 --> 00:48:05,215
A few hours ago, I informed my father

707
00:48:05,268 --> 00:48:08,802
that this was my intended solution for
the pirate issue on New Providence Island.

708
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:15,059
We've talked in this room, you and I,

709
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:16,560
about reason.

710
00:48:17,863 --> 00:48:19,146
We've talked about justice.

711
00:48:19,198 --> 00:48:21,482
We've talked about virtue and the right.

712
00:48:21,534 --> 00:48:23,233
We've talked and talked.

713
00:48:23,235 --> 00:48:25,402
And now, perhaps, it is time to do that

714
00:48:25,404 --> 00:48:28,072
which we've only spoken
about behind closed doors.

715
00:48:28,074 --> 00:48:30,407
I am committed to this end.

716
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:34,161
But it is a long road and I will
need your help to see it through.

717
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:21,041
How can I help?

718
00:49:23,212 --> 00:49:25,295
I don't believe you've
been properly introduced.

719
00:49:25,348 --> 00:49:27,097
Lieutenant McGraw...

720
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,185
my good friend Lord Peter Ashe.

721
00:50:09,225 --> 00:50:10,924
What the fuck is this?

722
00:50:16,015 --> 00:50:18,182
I heard the news today.

723
00:50:18,184 --> 00:50:21,485
I thought it a sign it was
time to come and see you.

724
00:50:23,189 --> 00:50:25,105
You're kidding me.

725
00:50:25,157 --> 00:50:26,857
Coming to gloat now?

726
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,744
You don't see it, do you?

727
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,081
You're so close to having
everything you've wanted.

728
00:50:34,116 --> 00:50:37,201
Everything I told you you'll never have.

729
00:50:37,253 --> 00:50:39,169
It's within your reach.

730
00:50:39,205 --> 00:50:41,505
I came to help you get it.

731
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:55,519
I remember when I first saw it.

732
00:50:55,554 --> 00:50:58,021
I'd never seen a structure like it.

733
00:50:58,057 --> 00:51:00,974
It seemed indestructible.

734
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:05,395
If you would have told me then
the decision you face today,

735
00:51:05,448 --> 00:51:09,233
I don't know if I would
have believed it possible.

736
00:51:12,238 --> 00:51:16,206
Richard Guthrie sat on the throne
of commerce when I arrived.

737
00:51:16,242 --> 00:51:18,959
Made men rich, they said.

738
00:51:20,796 --> 00:51:24,214
Then his daughter took his place,
made Nassau strong.

739
00:51:25,918 --> 00:51:27,918
Everyone knows this.

740
00:51:29,672 --> 00:51:31,922
I wonder how many know
that there was one man

741
00:51:31,974 --> 00:51:34,925
standing behind them.

742
00:51:34,977 --> 00:51:37,644
Standing behind both thrones,

743
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,596
keeping the world spinning.

744
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:46,186
You're as invested in the
future of this place as any.

745
00:51:48,357 --> 00:51:49,823
What would you do?

746
00:51:54,947 --> 00:51:57,030
I know Eleanor's argument.

747
00:51:57,082 --> 00:52:00,450
And I know why you think it is weak
and I do not disagree with you.

748
00:52:00,503 --> 00:52:04,004
Her judgment about
Captain Vane has never been right.

749
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:06,290
But because she is compromised,

750
00:52:06,342 --> 00:52:09,510
it does not necessarily
follow that she is wrong.

751
00:52:09,545 --> 00:52:11,628
I fear that to take that fort

752
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:15,432
will be to divide this island
in a most dangerous way.

753
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:18,135
To force men to take
sides against each other

754
00:52:18,187 --> 00:52:21,855
at a time when our very survival
demands the very opposite.

755
00:52:23,475 --> 00:52:25,192
I fear that if we go down that road,

756
00:52:25,227 --> 00:52:27,561
by the time Spain or England arrive,

757
00:52:27,613 --> 00:52:29,279
they will find their job done for them.

758
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:32,866
They will find Nassau has destroyed itself.

759
00:52:34,954 --> 00:52:36,620
The world changes.

760
00:52:36,655 --> 00:52:38,655
It is inevitable.

761
00:52:38,707 --> 00:52:41,491
Perhaps the only thing that is inevitable.

762
00:52:43,162 --> 00:52:45,712
If it were me facing this decision,

763
00:52:45,748 --> 00:52:47,998
I would make peace with that.

764
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:52,085
I would teach myself to see Captain Vane

765
00:52:52,137 --> 00:52:55,839
as an unfortunate but unavoidable change

766
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:57,507
in our landscape.

767
00:52:59,345 --> 00:53:04,348
And I would ensure that we all live
to see the sunrise again tomorrow.

768
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:05,899
Were it me.

769
00:53:55,901 --> 00:53:57,868
What say you, Captain?

770
00:54:09,672 --> 00:54:11,889
Fire.

771

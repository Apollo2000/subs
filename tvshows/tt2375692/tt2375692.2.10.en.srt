1
00:00:06,263 --> 00:00:08,104
I discovered a plan to reclaim a prize

2
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:10,328
so large that it would
upset our world here.

3
00:00:10,414 --> 00:00:12,797
Go get us our prize.

4
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,499
- Are you Underhill?
- I am.

5
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:17,302
We've no quarrel with you.
We will be taking the girl.

6
00:00:17,337 --> 00:00:19,888
This is Eleanor Guthrie,
the trade boss in Nassau.

7
00:00:19,973 --> 00:00:23,842
Imagine, sir, how London would react
to the arrival of the queen of thieves.

8
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:26,011
Flint stole from me and
I'm making it right.

9
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:29,347
You hate Flint. I hate Flint.

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,434
Right now,
Flint's plan is the only plan.

11
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:34,936
- You destroyed our lives!
- Miranda.

12
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:38,356
I want to see that noose around your
neck and I want to pull the lever

13
00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:40,942
with my own two ha...

14
00:00:41,028 --> 00:00:45,196
Pirate vessel, what follows
is a message from the lord governor.

15
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:47,082
I have placed Captain Flint
under arrest.

16
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:49,868
His trial will be swift and final.

17
00:00:49,953 --> 00:00:53,371
I suggest we get him
the hell out of there.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

19
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,747
Abigail.

20
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:14,562
Abigail, I've made arrangements

21
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:18,316
for you to be shuttled
to Savannah today.

22
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:28,159
What?

23
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:29,861
You'll be taken to Mr. Ashford's house.

24
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:32,530
I'd like you to stay there
for a few days.

25
00:03:32,616 --> 00:03:36,000
Why would you want me to stay there?

26
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:41,840
You know what's going
to happen in the square.

27
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:46,177
Yes, you're going to kill Mr. McGraw.

28
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:51,299
When these trials take place,

29
00:03:51,384 --> 00:03:53,802
they arouse a great deal of passion.

30
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:55,804
It is natural.

31
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,358
But it's also something
I'm not comfortable exposing you to.

32
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:03,394
Is it for my welfare
that you want me to leave

33
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,979
or your own?

34
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:07,115
What?

35
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,236
You raised me to respect the truth.

36
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:13,955
To know it is the root of all virtue.

37
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:18,960
I'm asking if you're sending me away

38
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:21,830
because you're afraid
someone might ask me

39
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:24,999
what happened in this house last night
and that I would tell them.

40
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:27,669
Abigail, I understand that you're upset.

41
00:04:27,754 --> 00:04:29,671
Why aren't you?

42
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:34,759
A man and a woman rescued me,

43
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:37,929
cared for me, delivered me home.

44
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:41,349
Now one of them is dead.
The other is about to be.

45
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:43,484
And the only man, it seems to me,

46
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,603
to have committed a crime in all this...

47
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:49,574
still works for you.

48
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,329
Is that not the truth?

49
00:05:04,457 --> 00:05:07,258
What does it matter whether
they hang him or not?

50
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:10,011
We came here to retrieve this ship.

51
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:11,346
We've done so.

52
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:14,098
Ought that not to be the
end of the conversation?

53
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:15,934
We can say what we will about Flint,

54
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:18,603
and I've said my share,

55
00:05:18,638 --> 00:05:21,522
but the world knows his name,
they know him.

56
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:24,976
And his body swinging over
the harbor of this place

57
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:26,644
sends a powerful message.

58
00:05:26,696 --> 00:05:29,314
No one surrenders to a dying thing.

59
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,367
And that's exactly what
we'll be if we don't act.

60
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:37,238
Where are the men about it?

61
00:05:37,324 --> 00:05:39,958
Well, those who think
saving Flint's a good idea,

62
00:05:39,993 --> 00:05:41,626
you're taking ashore with you.

63
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:42,941
Well, it wouldn't make much sense

64
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:44,662
to take the ones who
think it's a bad idea.

65
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:47,665
No, you're leaving them with me.

66
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:50,919
And what exactly do you expect
me to say to them, do you think,

67
00:05:51,004 --> 00:05:53,838
when they ask me why we
don't just turn around,

68
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,673
leave you here

69
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:58,977
rather than attempt to fight a fight
we are far from certain to win?

70
00:05:59,012 --> 00:06:01,679
Tell them that this endeavor
is in their best interests.

71
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:05,900
Whether they can see that or not.

72
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:09,020
And then when they're
through having their laugh,

73
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:11,856
then what do you expect me to say?

74
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,111
Tell them that if this ship
tries to run on a skeleton crew,

75
00:06:17,197 --> 00:06:19,530
they're going to get chased,
they're going to get caught,

76
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:21,032
and they're going to get killed.

77
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:22,784
See if that convinces them.

78
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:38,599
They're resolved to rescue our captain.

79
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:40,718
Yet, from the look of things,
they seem as likely

80
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,887
to slaughter us
as the Charles Town militia.

81
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:46,557
If not more so.

82
00:06:46,643 --> 00:06:48,776
Who said anything about rescuing anyone?

83
00:06:50,363 --> 00:06:52,230
Didn't Captain Vane?

84
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,735
There's a significant difference
between preventing Ashe

85
00:06:57,787 --> 00:07:02,040
from making a trophy of Flint
and saving Flint's life.

86
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:04,575
Who's to say Vane doesn't
help Flint escape from shore

87
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:08,413
and then slit his throat the
moment we're in open water?

88
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:10,581
Along with all of ours?

89
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:13,918
That was dark.

90
00:07:32,405 --> 00:07:34,939
You and your men are going
to remain under guard

91
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:36,824
while I go ashore.

92
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,243
You know,
we could help if you let us go.

93
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,113
You can also try and take back
this ship if I let you go.

94
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,750
We share an interest in
seeing Flint rescued,

95
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:49,704
but make no mistake,
this ship belongs to my men now.

96
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:52,507
It was bargained to us.
We claimed it and we intend to keep it.

97
00:07:52,592 --> 00:07:54,959
What the fuck do you want from me?
Why are you here?

98
00:07:56,596 --> 00:07:59,764
You could make this
difficult if you wanted.

99
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,549
Riling up your crew,

100
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:04,802
forcing me to divert
more men to guard you.

101
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:08,473
But if you meant what you said,

102
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:11,059
then we all face a war

103
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:14,812
that we must somehow face together.

104
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:17,398
And causing trouble wouldn't
make much sense, would it?

105
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:22,620
You want me to help you keep
my men under guard here?

106
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:26,157
So that, what,
you can kill us without having to hurry?

107
00:08:28,495 --> 00:08:32,914
In a few hours,
when I leave that square with Flint,

108
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:36,384
it will be to a different
world than when I entered it.

109
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:38,336
And in that world,

110
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:41,339
killing 50 strong men of Nassau

111
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:43,341
able to stand up and defend her...

112
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:46,677
what kind of sense does that make?

113
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:49,730
What about your men?

114
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:55,603
'Cause I'm not sure they
share that assessment.

115
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:58,906
Some of them are,
understandably, displeased,

116
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:01,859
but there aren't enough
of them to sail the ship.

117
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:04,996
If you can keep your
men from provoking them,

118
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:08,749
I am confident things
will stand until I return.

119
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:17,425
Wait.

120
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,886
It isn't gonna work.

121
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:33,774
Your plan to rescue
Flint isn't gonna work.

122
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:39,814
But there may be
something I can give you

123
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,816
to make it work.

124
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:49,907
And of all the villains on the sea

125
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:52,293
to which we have become
accustomed to fearing,

126
00:09:52,378 --> 00:09:55,546
is there a name spoken more frequently

127
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:58,416
or with more revulsion than Flint?

128
00:10:03,756 --> 00:10:08,059
Until today
and then potentially never again.

129
00:10:08,094 --> 00:10:09,310
Burn in hell!

130
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:15,149
Now cast your gaze upon
this once fearsome animal,

131
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:18,102
brought down by his
own hubris and folly.

132
00:10:18,188 --> 00:10:20,988
The villain Flint who perverts the law,

133
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:25,193
kidnaps our women,
and slays our blessed sons.

134
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:28,412
I meant what I said earlier.

135
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:31,949
This outcome, it's not at all
what I would have wanted.

136
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:39,290
Vice Admiral Lord Kensington.

137
00:10:39,342 --> 00:10:42,009
I don't need to explain to
you his interest in achieving

138
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:44,629
the greatest possible
exposure for this proceeding.

139
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:46,464
String him up!

140
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:48,849
He's going to put on a show.

141
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:53,521
And once it begins, I fear I will
not be able to control where it goes.

142
00:10:53,606 --> 00:10:57,558
Unless you give me
what I need to stop it.

143
00:10:58,645 --> 00:11:01,479
Sign a confession

144
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:05,983
for crimes that you have already
tacitly admitted to me anyway.

145
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:07,902
I'll see this process stopped.

146
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:09,987
The sentence will be
carried out quietly,

147
00:11:10,073 --> 00:11:12,740
privately tomorrow.

148
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:15,576
Spare yourself the humiliation.

149
00:11:16,663 --> 00:11:18,246
Spare her.

150
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:26,420
I'll see she's interred
with proper respect,

151
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:29,674
her name clear.

152
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,592
Let her go to her rest peacefully.

153
00:11:31,678 --> 00:11:34,312
You cannot tell me that isn't
what she would have wanted.

154
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,850
She was clear about what she wanted

155
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:41,819
and I don't think it had anything to do

156
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:43,854
with begging your forgiveness.

157
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:48,609
What she wanted was
the truth to be known.

158
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:53,030
What was the truth of it, my lord?

159
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:57,668
Why did you betray those closest
to you all those years ago?

160
00:11:57,704 --> 00:12:01,706
Was it really so small
and vile as a bribe?

161
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:05,042
The promise of lording over
other men in this place?

162
00:12:08,014 --> 00:12:12,049
Or were you simply too weak to say no?

163
00:12:12,135 --> 00:12:14,969
Too cowardly to do the harder thing

164
00:12:15,054 --> 00:12:18,472
and preserve your decency?

165
00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:20,558
Tell me it was the latter.

166
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,861
Tell me this is all happening
because of your cowardice.

167
00:12:25,782 --> 00:12:28,482
I could accept that.

168
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:30,951
I might forgive that.

169
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:35,206
We want justice. Hang him now!

170
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,743
And from this day...

171
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:40,745
I suppose there's my answer.

172
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:43,714
Even in this moment,

173
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,550
alone with a condemned man,

174
00:12:46,586 --> 00:12:49,587
you are unable to speak the truth.

175
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:54,475
...one we must put down
to teach a lesson

176
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,977
to all those who brazenly follow

177
00:12:57,063 --> 00:12:59,764
his villainous desires.

178
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:03,684
And lest you thought you knew
just how evil and devious he was,

179
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:08,105
you will hear of schemes
almost impossible to believe.

180
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:12,026
Employing his minions to dastardly ends.

181
00:13:12,111 --> 00:13:15,246
Including a woman he conspired with

182
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:17,748
to murder our lord governor

183
00:13:17,784 --> 00:13:19,450
in his own home

184
00:13:19,535 --> 00:13:22,286
- and in front of his own daughter's eyes.
- Burn him!

185
00:13:22,372 --> 00:13:25,506
Behold his minion...

186
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:28,876
who tried and failed
to help Captain Flint

187
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:32,296
spread his evil deeds
here in Charles Town.

188
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:50,698
Go on.

189
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:53,818
I say I have the
situation completely under control.

190
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:56,404
- I doubt that.
- Enough, we must not act in haste.

191
00:13:56,489 --> 00:13:58,072
And most importantly, we must not panic.

192
00:13:58,157 --> 00:13:59,573
Nothing here is under control, sir.

193
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:01,409
That much is painfully clear.

194
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:04,295
How is it you are the only
one of us that cannot see it?

195
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,416
I'm sorry, sir.

196
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:10,941
Miss Guthrie did not tell me
there was a meeting this morning.

197
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:12,670
I would have set up...

198
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:17,508
Where is Miss Guthrie?

199
00:14:19,345 --> 00:14:21,562
She's gone?

200
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:24,565
Started spreading on
the street a few hours ago.

201
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,517
Word is Hornigold arrested her,

202
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:29,019
handed her over to the navy.

203
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:31,689
And what do they think of this news?

204
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:33,908
Depends which "they"
we're talking about.

205
00:14:33,993 --> 00:14:36,026
The beach is drinking in celebration.

206
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:38,946
The queen is dead, so on and so forth.

207
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:40,614
And the merchants?

208
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,616
You know how they get.

209
00:14:42,702 --> 00:14:46,036
A little unrest among the crews and
they sleep with one eye open for a week.

210
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:49,373
I think this is more than a
little unrest, wouldn't you say?

211
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:54,011
Yes, I'd say so.

212
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:00,100
Are you all right?

213
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:02,803
I'm wondering if they
will try her for piracy.

214
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,775
Do you think they would
do that to a woman?

215
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,560
Hang her in front of a mob

216
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:11,812
the same as they do to a man?

217
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:16,901
I know this must be difficult for you.

218
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:20,654
Less than you think.

219
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:26,577
How much coin do we have on reserve?

220
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:29,079
Reserve?

221
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:31,916
How much money can I have
on hand if I needed it?

222
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:34,385
The kitchen's funds, today's receipts,

223
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,754
the girls' stashes that we know about?

224
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,422
How would I know that?

225
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:40,474
Find out for me, please.

226
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,093
And have it made ready
for me immediately.

227
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:45,262
To buy what?

228
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:55,990
This journey
will be a strange one, gents.

229
00:15:56,075 --> 00:15:59,109
Unlike any we've taken before.

230
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:02,947
Because of that,
I have been coy with certain details.

231
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:06,834
Namely what it is
exactly we'll be hunting.

232
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,452
That ends now.

233
00:16:11,374 --> 00:16:13,173
Brace yourselves, gents,

234
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:15,626
and let me tell you a story

235
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:18,379
about a Spaniard named Vazquez.

236
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:20,464
Intelligence man...

237
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:31,308
But...

238
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:34,311
What?

239
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:38,649
Last night you said you'd
thought about not returning...

240
00:16:40,152 --> 00:16:41,902
but...

241
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:49,543
Standing there on the
jetty in Port Royal...

242
00:16:51,664 --> 00:16:53,664
I realized that was the
first time you and I

243
00:16:53,716 --> 00:16:56,967
had been separated by that much
water since we was fucking kids.

244
00:16:57,003 --> 00:16:59,003
Huh.

245
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:01,922
Being that far away,
you see things differently.

246
00:17:04,226 --> 00:17:06,310
Helped me see what we are.

247
00:17:08,814 --> 00:17:10,648
Maybe what we ain't.

248
00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:17,905
You saved me from something awful, Jack.

249
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,524
And I owe you my life for it.

250
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,778
Maybe there's some part of
that you just can't owe.

251
00:17:29,535 --> 00:17:31,669
But you can owe it to Max?

252
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,790
I don't feel that way with her.

253
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,263
I was at every tavern in that town

254
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:45,382
trying to find us spies,

255
00:17:45,468 --> 00:17:48,052
build out this thing we started.

256
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:52,690
And every time I said my name,

257
00:17:52,725 --> 00:17:54,475
they knew my name.

258
00:17:55,645 --> 00:17:58,195
The first thing they said every time

259
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,398
was your name.

260
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,951
Like we was two halves
of the same thing.

261
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:09,039
I can't be your wife, Jack.

262
00:18:18,084 --> 00:18:21,468
But you and I are gonna be partners
till they put us in the fucking ground.

263
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:26,140
As long as you feel the same.

264
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:45,609
If we run and they chase us,

265
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:46,944
what are our prospects?

266
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:50,330
Against two of them and shorthanded?

267
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,117
I'd call our chances roughly even.

268
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:55,119
Against three trained hunters,

269
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:58,789
if they have any idea
what they're doing,

270
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:01,175
I'd say we're about a
dozen skilled men short

271
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,128
of having any fucking
prayer of surviving that.

272
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:06,880
The captain says we wait, trust him.

273
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:08,882
Says this is all in our interests.

274
00:19:08,968 --> 00:19:12,553
But the only thing he gives
a shit about is his own ends.

275
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:16,356
And there's not a goddamn
thing we can do about it.

276
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:31,989
Hey. Hey.

277
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:39,546
I think I can help you
get out of this place.

278
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,670
You've got about eight votes.

279
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:50,224
What?

280
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:54,011
Eight votes for quartermaster.

281
00:19:55,898 --> 00:19:57,815
What the hell are you talking about?

282
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,267
If you hadn't have cut that forestay,

283
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:03,904
there's an argument to be made that Vane
would have set sail right away

284
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:06,106
and probably killed us all.

285
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:09,026
They know it

286
00:20:09,078 --> 00:20:11,361
and it's having an effect.

287
00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:16,583
I'm sorry, but I think you're wrong.

288
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:18,919
They all seem quite
content with Mr. Scott.

289
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,708
Two kinds of quartermasters
on a crew like this.

290
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:27,878
The one you feel you're
supposed to vote for,

291
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,214
and the one you want to vote for.

292
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,800
And the former always
gives way to the latter.

293
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:35,719
And you're comfortable with this?

294
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:38,188
Not remotely.

295
00:21:00,462 --> 00:21:02,913
This one. Get him up.

296
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:06,444
What the fuck is this about?
What are you doing with him?

297
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:07,801
Shut up.

298
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:27,104
Hey, that's our brother you got there.

299
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:29,489
Put him down.

300
00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:50,878
Move, you fuckin' die!

301
00:21:57,853 --> 00:22:01,271
Affidavits given by sailors
on ships you attacked.

302
00:22:01,307 --> 00:22:05,726
Testimonials of widows and orphans

303
00:22:05,811 --> 00:22:09,313
rendered into that
state by your actions.

304
00:22:09,398 --> 00:22:12,816
And these are insurance petitions

305
00:22:12,902 --> 00:22:16,820
for the loss or destruction of property,

306
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:19,823
again caused by your hand.

307
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:24,211
You stand before this court

308
00:22:24,296 --> 00:22:27,047
accused of wreaking untold havoc

309
00:22:27,132 --> 00:22:29,466
throughout the New World,

310
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:33,971
of clawing at the very fabric

311
00:22:34,006 --> 00:22:37,507
of civilization that holds us together

312
00:22:37,593 --> 00:22:41,011
with malice

313
00:22:41,096 --> 00:22:43,597
and without regret.

314
00:22:43,682 --> 00:22:46,350
Do you dispute this?

315
00:22:49,438 --> 00:22:54,074
Do you have any response to
these allegations at all?

316
00:22:55,995 --> 00:23:00,197
This forum is your
opportunity to be heard.

317
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,533
And the world is listening.

318
00:23:05,704 --> 00:23:07,704
Deny.

319
00:23:07,756 --> 00:23:09,373
Repent.

320
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:14,378
No one else is going to
speak on your behalf.

321
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,048
Will you say nothing
in your own defense?

322
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,355
You see? These crimes are so vile

323
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:27,474
that even their perpetrator

324
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,894
is struck dumb when
given a chance to speak.

325
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,946
I have one regret.

326
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,401
I regret ever coming to this place

327
00:23:37,453 --> 00:23:41,571
with the assumption that a
reconciliation could be found.

328
00:23:41,657 --> 00:23:45,909
That reason could be
a bridge between us.

329
00:23:47,162 --> 00:23:50,464
Everyone is a monster to someone.

330
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:54,918
Since you are so
convinced that I am yours,

331
00:23:55,004 --> 00:23:57,087
I will be it.

332
00:23:59,591 --> 00:24:01,508
Sir! Sir!

333
00:24:06,648 --> 00:24:08,315
What's going on?

334
00:24:10,152 --> 00:24:11,449
Who is this man?

335
00:24:11,506 --> 00:24:14,040
He says his name is Charles Vane,
my lord.

336
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,440
Charles Vane?

337
00:24:21,447 --> 00:24:23,080
What, and you captured him?

338
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:24,948
He turned himself over, my lord.

339
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,751
I came to offer testimony

340
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:29,920
in defense of Captain Flint.

341
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:33,757
It is his right, is it not?

342
00:24:37,546 --> 00:24:39,679
He was carrying this.

343
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:50,140
If you are who you say you are,

344
00:24:50,192 --> 00:24:52,192
why would anybody

345
00:24:52,277 --> 00:24:55,112
consider you a credible
character witness?

346
00:24:55,147 --> 00:24:58,565
It isn't my testimony I came to offer.

347
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:03,487
It's your daughter's.

348
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:15,632
"I fear the stories I have heard

349
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:18,418
may have clouded the truth
more than clarified it.

350
00:25:18,504 --> 00:25:20,470
As so many of the stories

351
00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:22,756
were relayed to me by my father,

352
00:25:22,841 --> 00:25:26,009
I am forced to wonder
if he is simply mistaken

353
00:25:26,095 --> 00:25:29,896
or if his motives are something
more deliberate than that."

354
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:43,827
There's no way of keeping
that out of the record?

355
00:25:43,862 --> 00:25:45,829
Could you?

356
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:47,414
Of course you could.

357
00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:49,950
You could just throw it into the fire.

358
00:25:50,035 --> 00:25:51,701
But should you?

359
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:57,040
It was produced in front of
your entire constituency.

360
00:25:57,126 --> 00:26:01,211
You are the protector
of the law in this place

361
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:04,464
and you brazenly disregard
that at your own peril.

362
00:26:08,103 --> 00:26:11,221
All it takes is one juror
to be taken in by this,

363
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:14,975
one juror to be seduced by
the scandal of it all...

364
00:26:17,563 --> 00:26:19,312
and Flint goes free.

365
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:22,149
Flint isn't going anywhere.

366
00:26:22,234 --> 00:26:25,902
That book might engender a couple
of unpleasant months for you here,

367
00:26:25,954 --> 00:26:28,121
raise a couple of
uncomfortable questions,

368
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:29,956
but what it will not do

369
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:32,409
is affect the outcome of Flint's trial.

370
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:34,661
Not with the jury we have empaneled.

371
00:26:36,582 --> 00:26:40,500
The situation is well in hand,

372
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:42,219
I assure you.

373
00:26:42,254 --> 00:26:43,837
And once Flint is swinging,

374
00:26:43,922 --> 00:26:46,139
we'll turn our attention
to his associate

375
00:26:46,225 --> 00:26:49,309
and have him installed right beside him.

376
00:27:16,338 --> 00:27:17,537
A moment's peace?

377
00:27:17,623 --> 00:27:19,623
Far from it.

378
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:25,462
I heard the Guthrie shipping
concern was officially disbanded.

379
00:27:25,514 --> 00:27:29,683
Captains Naft and Lawrence's
crews scattered to the wind.

380
00:27:29,768 --> 00:27:34,354
And Mr. Frasier left to
preside over its remains,

381
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:37,307
empty warehouses, and this tavern.

382
00:27:40,362 --> 00:27:42,112
Were I in your situation,
I might be willing

383
00:27:42,147 --> 00:27:44,481
to consider selling whatever
interests I had left here

384
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:47,984
and moving on to a more civilized place.

385
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,453
I've heard I ought to expect this visit.

386
00:27:50,489 --> 00:27:52,539
Heard that the madame from the inn

387
00:27:52,624 --> 00:27:54,958
has been taking advantage
of the panic in the street,

388
00:27:54,993 --> 00:27:57,460
offering the merchants
pennies for their interests.

389
00:27:57,496 --> 00:28:00,580
For a few whose faith in
this place was truly waning,

390
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:04,334
the chance to leave with anything to
show for their interests was a blessing.

391
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:08,505
You'll find me less eager
to sell than the others,

392
00:28:08,557 --> 00:28:10,807
for I know that your faith in this place

393
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:12,676
is derived from the secret knowledge

394
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:15,645
that it is soon to be
awash with Spanish gold.

395
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:17,430
Even if the gold does return,

396
00:28:17,516 --> 00:28:20,817
it does not alter the reality
of what this place is becoming.

397
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:22,852
If anything, it will aggravate it,

398
00:28:22,938 --> 00:28:24,988
especially for you.

399
00:28:25,023 --> 00:28:26,740
Is that so?

400
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:28,775
The pirates of New Providence Island

401
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,445
are about to become more powerful
than they have ever been before

402
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:35,081
at a time when they
would be less restrained

403
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,250
than they have ever been before.

404
00:28:37,336 --> 00:28:41,004
And this tavern will
still be the crossroads

405
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,540
where their world connects to ours.

406
00:28:43,592 --> 00:28:45,759
Where their disputes are aired.

407
00:28:45,844 --> 00:28:49,179
Where their business is conducted.

408
00:28:49,214 --> 00:28:52,632
Where their passions are expressed.

409
00:28:52,718 --> 00:28:56,219
Is that truly something you want
the responsibility of managing?

410
00:28:56,305 --> 00:28:58,855
So that's it.

411
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:02,058
You believe you can leap
into Miss Guthrie's shoes

412
00:29:02,144 --> 00:29:04,728
and lord over what remains
of their family's enterprise.

413
00:29:04,813 --> 00:29:08,315
I have no interest in making
the same mistakes Eleanor did.

414
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,784
No interest in fencing their plunder.

415
00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:13,903
No interest in lording
over them in any way.

416
00:29:13,989 --> 00:29:16,956
For people like us, power in this place

417
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:21,244
is most effective when
it is least perceived.

418
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:25,081
That is my offer to purchase your
inherited interest in this tavern.

419
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:28,802
It is more generous than any of the
others received by your colleagues.

420
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:32,088
I will expect your
response by nightfall.

421
00:29:37,262 --> 00:29:40,930
Why is this so important to you?

422
00:29:40,982 --> 00:29:43,683
Why offer more for this
place than the others?

423
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:07,791
Sit.

424
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:18,301
The conflict ahead
promises much risk for us

425
00:30:18,387 --> 00:30:21,104
and very little reward
to compensate for it.

426
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:24,641
And so we would like
to leave this place.

427
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:26,443
Now, your friend over here

428
00:30:26,478 --> 00:30:29,729
says you're just the
man to help us do it.

429
00:30:29,815 --> 00:30:32,232
My problem is a shortage of manpower.

430
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:35,652
I need more men than I have
to fully crew this ship.

431
00:30:35,737 --> 00:30:39,322
And I can't simply release your
crewmates indiscriminately.

432
00:30:39,374 --> 00:30:42,125
I'd be inviting a counterattack
to reclaim the ship.

433
00:30:43,962 --> 00:30:45,628
So I want names.

434
00:30:45,664 --> 00:30:47,664
Names?

435
00:30:47,716 --> 00:30:51,334
One list, 10 men.

436
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,838
Those most likely to
consent to join my crew,

437
00:30:54,923 --> 00:30:57,223
help me sail this ship away from here.

438
00:30:59,227 --> 00:31:02,395
And the men whose names
aren't on that list?

439
00:31:09,104 --> 00:31:12,188
I told them we ain't got no
real connection to this crew.

440
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,825
You help him, we both get
safe passage back to Nassau.

441
00:31:26,838 --> 00:31:28,955
No.

442
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
No?

443
00:31:31,092 --> 00:31:32,542
I won't do it.

444
00:31:36,381 --> 00:31:38,631
No!

445
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:49,976
Do not doubt my seriousness.

446
00:31:50,061 --> 00:31:53,897
In a short while,
escaping from this place

447
00:31:53,982 --> 00:31:57,283
will be far harder than it is right now.

448
00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:00,653
Right now,
the only thing preventing a clean escape

449
00:32:00,739 --> 00:32:02,539
is the men to make it work.

450
00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:04,624
And you're gonna give me those men.

451
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:08,578
Now, if you kill me,
what good will that do you?

452
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,964
None whatsoever.

453
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:14,167
No.

454
00:32:23,228 --> 00:32:25,762
You'll let me know when
I might have those names.

455
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:27,514
Wait, wait! Stop! Stop!

456
00:32:30,602 --> 00:32:34,938
"I am forced to wonder
if he is simply mistaken

457
00:32:35,023 --> 00:32:36,489
or if his motives

458
00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:39,776
are something more deliberate than that.

459
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:42,612
I fear the stories I carry with me

460
00:32:42,664 --> 00:32:44,948
are my sole comfort.

461
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,917
From across an ocean, it is hard to know

462
00:32:47,953 --> 00:32:49,919
what the New World is.

463
00:32:49,955 --> 00:32:53,540
All I knew were the stories I was told

464
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,458
of monsters and valiant men..."

465
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:58,378
What the fuck are you doing here?

466
00:32:58,463 --> 00:33:00,964
Came to take your ship.

467
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:04,300
Stayed to get you out of all this.

468
00:33:04,352 --> 00:33:07,136
Figured if anyone was going
to make a trophy of you,

469
00:33:07,188 --> 00:33:09,188
it really ought to be me.

470
00:33:09,274 --> 00:33:11,524
So this is your plan?

471
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,943
Walk in here and read a girl's diary?

472
00:33:13,979 --> 00:33:16,145
More or less.

473
00:33:17,282 --> 00:33:18,698
I see.

474
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:23,736
So now you have everyone's
eyes where you want them,

475
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:27,740
on the two of us, what happens next?

476
00:33:53,518 --> 00:33:57,153
"So much lies ahead
in Charles Town, a future..."

477
00:33:57,188 --> 00:33:59,188
When it happens,

478
00:33:59,274 --> 00:34:02,191
once I'm free, whenever it is,

479
00:34:02,243 --> 00:34:04,193
you won't want to get in my way.

480
00:34:04,245 --> 00:34:07,864
When it happens,
we will be moving to the jetty

481
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:09,832
and out of this place.

482
00:34:09,868 --> 00:34:13,336
Didn't come all this way to have
them kill you steps from the gallows.

483
00:34:17,175 --> 00:34:20,043
They're all trying so
hard to convince themselves

484
00:34:20,095 --> 00:34:23,096
that they have nothing to be afraid of.

485
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:25,048
How is running gonna change that?

486
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:27,550
What do you suggest?

487
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:30,687
That we remind them

488
00:34:30,722 --> 00:34:33,189
that they were right to be afraid.

489
00:34:35,193 --> 00:34:38,227
"I have to tell you what I know.

490
00:34:38,313 --> 00:34:41,564
The ship was set upon by Captain Flint."

491
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:42,732
What are you doing?

492
00:34:42,817 --> 00:34:47,286
I wish to speak on
behalf of the defendant.

493
00:34:47,372 --> 00:34:49,412
You have not been recognized.
Sit back and you'll...

494
00:34:49,457 --> 00:34:51,991
These men convinced you
that they speak for you.

495
00:34:52,077 --> 00:34:54,210
- How dare you?
- That the power you've given them

496
00:34:54,245 --> 00:34:55,962
is used in your interests.

497
00:34:56,047 --> 00:34:58,831
I will not have the order in my
court usurped by your foul desires.

498
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:02,335
That the prisoner before you is
your enemy and they your friends.

499
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,887
For those of you who
live to see tomorrow...

500
00:35:07,976 --> 00:35:11,761
know that you had a
choice to see the truth

501
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:14,814
and you let yourselves
be convinced otherwise.

502
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:16,182
That's enough!

503
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:18,317
Bailiffs, remove him.

504
00:35:19,938 --> 00:35:22,605
I said remove him from the dais.

505
00:35:43,178 --> 00:35:46,429
- Stay down!
- Fire!

506
00:36:13,575 --> 00:36:16,659
Wait! James!

507
00:36:29,507 --> 00:36:33,092
Her word will be the
last word for this place.

508
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:40,066
Move!

509
00:36:54,415 --> 00:36:56,866
Give me the names!

510
00:36:58,369 --> 00:36:59,702
What?!

511
00:36:59,788 --> 00:37:02,004
They've engaged the blockade.

512
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,707
The patrol ships are scrambling.

513
00:37:04,793 --> 00:37:06,592
Weigh the anchor.

514
00:37:06,678 --> 00:37:09,011
I'll take my chances sailing
over taking on those ships.

515
00:37:16,221 --> 00:37:18,604
What?!

516
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,140
I gave you an order.
What is your fucking problem?

517
00:37:21,226 --> 00:37:23,309
The question you should be asking is

518
00:37:23,394 --> 00:37:25,111
where are his keys...

519
00:37:28,032 --> 00:37:31,284
and has he seen them since
he took me away from my men?

520
00:37:56,477 --> 00:37:58,811
- Get down.
- Stay where you are.

521
00:37:58,897 --> 00:38:00,646
Get canvas out quickly.

522
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:02,899
Set the full sail.

523
00:38:05,486 --> 00:38:06,769
Take him to Howell.

524
00:38:09,274 --> 00:38:10,606
Help me.

525
00:38:12,777 --> 00:38:15,745
If those ships flank us,
they'll have us.

526
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,197
Then let's make sure they
don't get that chance.

527
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:20,032
Gun crews at the ready.

528
00:38:20,118 --> 00:38:22,034
Gun crews at the ready!

529
00:38:24,422 --> 00:38:25,788
Fire at will.

530
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:36,465
Incoming!

531
00:38:39,187 --> 00:38:40,187
Ah!

532
00:39:03,044 --> 00:39:05,161
There they are!

533
00:39:05,246 --> 00:39:07,213
They're over there!

534
00:39:07,298 --> 00:39:09,215
Ah!

535
00:39:24,432 --> 00:39:27,183
- The buildings on the right!
- Every building!

536
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,403
Look down there.

537
00:39:32,023 --> 00:39:33,489
Quickly.

538
00:39:53,044 --> 00:39:55,544
- Open the door!
- Set us free!

539
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:58,047
Let's go!

540
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:00,549
There they are!

541
00:40:02,603 --> 00:40:04,470
- Move!
- Ah!

542
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:29,962
Come on!

543
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:34,083
Target that launch. Go! Go!

544
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:40,172
Hurry, lads. Hurry.

545
00:40:43,594 --> 00:40:45,594
- Fire!
- Get them both!

546
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:49,765
Men!

547
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:52,101
- Take aim.
- Behind them.

548
00:41:20,465 --> 00:41:22,298
Bring him. Bring him, quickly.

549
00:41:24,802 --> 00:41:26,802
Gently. Gently. Easy.

550
00:41:26,888 --> 00:41:28,209
It'll be all right.

551
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:33,192
That's it. Someone give him some rum.

552
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:40,950
Come on.

553
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:51,660
Oh, come on.

554
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:54,046
I'm sure we've all seen worse.

555
00:41:57,218 --> 00:41:59,385
I'll do what I can.

556
00:42:01,756 --> 00:42:03,206
What does that mean?

557
00:42:03,841 --> 00:42:05,674
What does that mean?

558
00:42:08,179 --> 00:42:09,179
God.

559
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:19,021
A bit of turmoil since you left.

560
00:42:19,073 --> 00:42:21,657
But it's under control now.

561
00:42:25,246 --> 00:42:26,745
Release those men.

562
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:28,280
What?

563
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:30,449
Captain.

564
00:42:30,535 --> 00:42:32,918
I know what happened and I don't care.

565
00:42:33,004 --> 00:42:35,087
I'll not hold pirates
prisoner on this ship,

566
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:36,455
not after today.

567
00:42:39,594 --> 00:42:41,210
Keep your men in line.

568
00:42:42,597 --> 00:42:44,213
Take us back towards the sandbar.

569
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:45,681
Southwest corner of the bay.

570
00:42:45,716 --> 00:42:48,050
We'll start from there.

571
00:42:48,102 --> 00:42:50,553
Ready the guns! Full complement.

572
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,890
What's the target, Captain?

573
00:42:54,942 --> 00:42:57,226
Whatever's left.

574
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,113
Heave!

575
00:43:08,823 --> 00:43:10,573
Would you like me to clear the room?

576
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:13,159
Why would I want you to clear the room?

577
00:43:16,714 --> 00:43:19,915
When the shock sets in,
you may lose faculties.

578
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:21,584
Some men lose their bowels.

579
00:43:21,636 --> 00:43:23,502
I can do it with as few
as three or four men.

580
00:43:23,588 --> 00:43:25,671
We're not going anywhere.

581
00:43:29,093 --> 00:43:30,809
I don't want this.

582
00:43:30,895 --> 00:43:32,928
If it doesn't come off quickly,
you won't make it three days.

583
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,731
Did you not fucking hear me?!
I said I do not want this!

584
00:43:35,766 --> 00:43:38,400
You'll die.

585
00:43:38,436 --> 00:43:40,569
This way, there's a very good chance
to prevent it.

586
00:43:40,605 --> 00:43:43,739
The crew will look after you.
Don't worry about that.

587
00:43:47,828 --> 00:43:49,778
Hold him down.

588
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,330
It'll be all right, mate. Come on.

589
00:43:51,415 --> 00:43:52,865
Cannonballs!

590
00:43:54,118 --> 00:43:56,452
- Three, six!
- Heave!

591
00:43:56,537 --> 00:43:59,121
- No! No!
- Steady.

592
00:44:00,758 --> 00:44:02,291
No!

593
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:04,126
Why don't you move it?!

594
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:12,801
- Ready?
- No! No!

595
00:46:37,832 --> 00:46:41,083
Where are we?

596
00:46:41,169 --> 00:46:44,220
Just south of Inagua.

597
00:46:44,255 --> 00:46:47,056
Winds blew us east.

598
00:46:47,091 --> 00:46:50,092
We stopped off in Tortuga to refit

599
00:46:50,144 --> 00:46:53,429
and garner news,
of which there was plenty.

600
00:46:57,568 --> 00:46:59,435
Eleanor Guthrie's been arrested.

601
00:47:01,606 --> 00:47:04,023
Currently on her way back to London

602
00:47:04,108 --> 00:47:07,326
in the custody of Her
Majesty's Navy to stand trial.

603
00:47:09,947 --> 00:47:11,997
For the first time since I've known it,

604
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:14,533
there is no Guthrie in Nassau.

605
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:20,339
One gets used to a state of
affairs for such a long time,

606
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:23,175
it's easy to forget that
they're all just transitions.

607
00:47:24,712 --> 00:47:26,795
Specks of dust suspended in the air

608
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:30,099
until a strong enough gust comes
along and rearranges everything.

609
00:47:31,886 --> 00:47:34,136
A strong gust has come to this place.

610
00:47:34,222 --> 00:47:36,305
The men can feel it.

611
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,807
Know it will upset everything
they thought they understood

612
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:40,809
just a few days ago.

613
00:47:40,895 --> 00:47:43,479
They'll need to lean on something solid.

614
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:47,316
On the men who can reassure them

615
00:47:47,401 --> 00:47:49,318
that in times like these,

616
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,654
there are some things
that can be counted on.

617
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:54,540
They'll look to me for that.

618
00:47:56,244 --> 00:47:59,712
But they'll also look to
their new quartermaster.

619
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:05,167
They voted?

620
00:48:05,253 --> 00:48:07,002
A few days ago.

621
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:10,506
I...

622
00:48:10,558 --> 00:48:12,758
I think the men wanted to
tell you when you awoke,

623
00:48:12,843 --> 00:48:15,511
so try and act surprised.

624
00:48:19,267 --> 00:48:20,849
It's a funny thing.

625
00:48:20,935 --> 00:48:25,271
The more those men need you,
the more you need them.

626
00:48:25,356 --> 00:48:28,490
And it drives us to do the
most unexpected things.

627
00:48:37,335 --> 00:48:40,669
There's something you ought to
know before we reach Nassau.

628
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:46,625
About what we'll likely face there.

629
00:48:49,797 --> 00:48:52,431
Before my misfortune

630
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:55,100
at the hands of Vane's lieutenant,

631
00:48:55,186 --> 00:48:58,520
our friend, the scout you sent
to oversee the Urca beach,

632
00:48:58,556 --> 00:49:00,105
confessed something to me.

633
00:49:00,191 --> 00:49:03,058
He told me that the news he brought us

634
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,561
about the gold having been recovered...

635
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:08,063
was a lie.

636
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:12,534
A falsehood he perpetuated himself

637
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:15,487
so that he could sell the
gold's location to another crew

638
00:49:15,573 --> 00:49:18,407
in exchange for a larger
share of the prize.

639
00:49:20,911 --> 00:49:23,295
He told you this?

640
00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:34,173
I'm sorry, I'm...

641
00:49:34,258 --> 00:49:36,342
I'm having a hard time...

642
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:43,816
He lied to us all?

643
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:48,604
And then he sold the
information to another crew

644
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:51,273
so that they could retrieve the gold?

645
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:54,243
Yes.

646
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,997
Who the fuck did he sell it to?

647
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:31,113
Where have you been?
What took you so long?

648
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:37,119
The information we were given was...

649
00:50:37,154 --> 00:50:39,371
incomplete at best.

650
00:50:39,457 --> 00:50:42,491
There were still healthy
Spanish soldiers on that beach

651
00:50:42,543 --> 00:50:44,076
and they fought...

652
00:50:44,161 --> 00:50:45,411
like hell.

653
00:50:51,168 --> 00:50:52,918
Is that the Walrus?

654
00:50:53,003 --> 00:50:55,087
It is. We found her there.

655
00:50:55,172 --> 00:50:57,840
Needed to get her seaworthy
before we could depart.

656
00:50:57,925 --> 00:51:01,009
You needed to?
Why would you need a second ship?

657
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:03,812
We needed the hold space.

658
00:51:06,183 --> 00:51:08,851
Would you like to see something shiny?

659
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,385

1
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:13,683
There is no life here.
There is no joy here.

2
00:00:13,684 --> 00:00:16,135
- There is no love here.
- What are you talking about?!

3
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:18,054
What do you think
I'm out there fighting for

4
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:20,973
if not to make all
those things possible here?

5
00:00:20,974 --> 00:00:23,359
The fort controls the bay,
I control the fort.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,111
So I will be your partner.

7
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:27,647
(Grunting)

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,699
I'm afraid I'm simply enjoying myself

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,118
way too much to consider
leaving this place.

10
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,704
I know his crew hold an asset
from their last prize

11
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:36,122
that they deem of great value.

12
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:37,824
- What asset?
- I don't know.

13
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:39,709
We'll procure a ship,
we'll recruit men

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,161
and we'll create
from nothing a new crew.

15
00:00:42,162 --> 00:00:44,213
You asked for better captains,

16
00:00:44,214 --> 00:00:46,249
I give you Captain Jack Rackham.

17
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,469
In less than two days, I
intend to be a captain again.

18
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,587
Fire!

19
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:55,641
You orchestrated it all.
The deaths, the destruction.

20
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:58,226
Is it possible a man
could do such a thing?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN

22
00:02:32,206 --> 00:02:33,905
(Bell tolling)

23
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:37,343
THOMAS:
Herein lies the problem we face

24
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:39,879
if we are to secure Nassau's future.

25
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,651
It is a problem that has festered
for more than a generation.

26
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:47,452
And it's a problem most insidious.

27
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:50,990
Illiteracy?

28
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:52,659
Her husband.

29
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,577
Governor Robert Thompson,

30
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:57,046
the one accepting bribes
from pirate captains

31
00:02:57,047 --> 00:03:00,750
as fast as they can pay them in exchange
for catering to their every need.

32
00:03:00,751 --> 00:03:04,470
Meanwhile, he's sending word back to
his pamphleteer friends in London

33
00:03:04,471 --> 00:03:06,973
about the scourge
of the pirate menace,

34
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:09,509
which garners him
sympathy and support,

35
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,927
which solidifies his position,

36
00:03:10,928 --> 00:03:12,812
and which only fuels
the underlying problem.

37
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:15,398
That's true, but I don't see how
we can do anything about it.

38
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:18,484
We can't get an honest man
appointed governor in the Bahamas?

39
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:20,353
We can get him appointed.
The problem seems to be

40
00:03:20,354 --> 00:03:21,738
keeping him honest thereafter.

41
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,439
Well, what stands in the way of it?

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,024
Well, the Atlantic Ocean.

43
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:26,993
Put a man on an island,

44
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:28,278
give him power over other men,

45
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:29,862
and it won't be long before he realizes

46
00:03:29,863 --> 00:03:31,864
that the limits of that power
are nowhere to be seen.

47
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:35,368
And no man given that kind of influence
will remain honest for very long.

48
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:37,286
- (Knocks on door)
- Yes?

49
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:40,373
Came to make sure
you two were still alive.

50
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:43,009
No one's heard from you in hours.

51
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,595
The lieutenant was
just recounting to me

52
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:49,299
his belief that the only thing that
stands between us and a prosperous Nassau

53
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,603
is an ocean, 100 years of
history, and human nature.

54
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:55,772
Has he been like this all day?

55
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:57,273
More or less, ma'am, yes.

56
00:03:57,274 --> 00:03:59,441
(Chuckles)

57
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:05,782
A gift. One of my favorites.

58
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:08,067
And you might find it helpful

59
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:10,703
in dealing with
my husband going forward.

60
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:12,155
THOMAS:
Thank you, dear. Well played.

61
00:04:12,156 --> 00:04:14,574
Although that edition is in Spanish.

62
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:16,242
I don't think
the lieutenant speaks it.

63
00:04:16,243 --> 00:04:17,994
Perhaps he should learn.

64
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:21,913
In his profession, you never
know when it might be useful.

65
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,399
- (Thumping)
- (Men laughing)

66
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,901
SILVER:
Stop jacking off on the figurehead.

67
00:04:41,902 --> 00:04:43,769
Joji!

68
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,442
- Last item.
- (Stomping)

69
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:52,412
The powers that be have chosen
a spot for our anchorage.

70
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:55,748
One mile north-northeast of
the western tip of the Hog

71
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:57,834
well beyond the view of Nassau town.

72
00:04:57,835 --> 00:05:00,119
Watches will continue on schedule

73
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,288
while provisions
are secured via longboat.

74
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:04,089
Well, why ain't there been a vote?

75
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:06,626
I beg your pardon?

76
00:05:06,627 --> 00:05:08,845
Well, I want to go home.
Back in the bay.

77
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:11,180
Ain't no one ask
what I think about it.

78
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:14,434
We vote that fuck of a captain
back into his station

79
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:17,135
and he's already skirting
the fucking rules.

80
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:21,640
We're sailing a Spanish warship.

81
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,145
Captain Hornigold's fort protects
the bay from Spanish warships.

82
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,452
I imagine the captain
and quartermaster

83
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:35,788
thought it self-evident that
someone must go ahead and explain

84
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:37,990
so as to avoid a reactionary
attack from the fort.

85
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:41,326
We're flying the black.
Doesn't it identify us?

86
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:46,666
You mean behind the giant
red crosses on the sails?

87
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:47,883
(Men laughing)

88
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:53,172
I want to vote.

89
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:54,891
(Men clamoring)

90
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:57,676
Hey, don't worry. We'll sort it out.

91
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:00,763
MAN:
Land ho!

92
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:02,848
(Clamoring)

93
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:23,869
(Grunting)

94
00:06:50,564 --> 00:06:52,899
(Gasping)

95
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,567
(Chuckles)

96
00:06:56,703 --> 00:06:58,955
Almost took my fucking head off.

97
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:01,373
(Laughing)

98
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:20,476
I've made camp at Port Royal,

99
00:07:20,477 --> 00:07:22,595
Tortuga, Kingston.

100
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:25,764
No matter where I've been,
one thing is true.

101
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,101
There's always one.

102
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:30,987
The one you don't cross.

103
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:33,322
It would seem readily
apparent that in this place,

104
00:07:33,323 --> 00:07:35,441
that would be you.

105
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:37,609
Thank you for noticing.

106
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,414
What the fuck are you doing here?

107
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:44,367
I think it's no secret
that since my arrival

108
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:46,869
I've been repeatedly provoked and
harassed by the Guthrie woman.

109
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,256
And, as her aggression
seems to be escalating,

110
00:07:50,257 --> 00:07:52,592
I thought it wise to speak
of this in the open.

111
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:54,510
Her aggression towards you?

112
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:57,713
Conspiracy with my
quartermaster to depose me.

113
00:07:57,714 --> 00:08:00,433
And a provocation by her man-at-arms.

114
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:01,914
I think you and I
have both seen enough

115
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,636
of these things to know
they never end well.

116
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:05,021
What are you telling me for?

117
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:08,941
I saw you that day in the tavern.

118
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:12,945
I hear you and she have a connection.

119
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:16,232
And if things were to deteriorate
even further between us,

120
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:19,952
I'd just like to know whether
I'll have you to deal with, too.

121
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:23,289
I can't imagine what we'd have
to gain by taking an interest

122
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,158
in the affairs of the Guthrie woman.

123
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:28,159
Would you, Captain?

124
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:33,382
- Not that I can see.
- LOW: You certain?

125
00:08:33,383 --> 00:08:36,168
I only ask again
in that I know myself,

126
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,005
and I know when confronting
threats like these,

127
00:08:39,006 --> 00:08:40,806
I tend to be a bit
of a blunt instrument.

128
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:43,009
Try as I may to be rational,

129
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,677
there's an instinct
towards the extreme

130
00:08:44,678 --> 00:08:46,512
that always gets the better of me.

131
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:48,598
So that we're clear,

132
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:51,984
no matter how bloody this
feud gets between she and I,

133
00:08:51,985 --> 00:08:55,737
I can rest soundly knowing
you'll take no part in it?

134
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,774
None whatsoever.

135
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:03,529
However...

136
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,865
commerce here relies upon her.

137
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:08,167
Should you move against her,

138
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:11,504
you may find no shortage of
new enemies on the street.

139
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:13,421
Perhaps.

140
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:18,210
Although, from what I understand,

141
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:20,596
confidence in her new venture

142
00:09:20,597 --> 00:09:23,683
is tepid at best.

143
00:09:23,684 --> 00:09:26,935
Who knows how much she'll
be missed if at all?

144
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:36,445
What's that?

145
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:38,230
Tribute.

146
00:09:38,231 --> 00:09:40,483
And the respect of my crew.

147
00:09:40,484 --> 00:09:43,318
10% of our most recent haul.

148
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:46,872
Would have been a little heavier,

149
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:50,075
only she taxed us over the
state of the containers.

150
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:36,581
Are they still in there?

151
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:39,116
Far as I know. Door hasn't
opened all morning.

152
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:43,253
When she finally emerges,
tell her I've left.

153
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:50,928
(Moaning)

154
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:09,897
(Panting)

155
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:44,349
I'll make contact
with Captain Hornigold,

156
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,352
inform him of our arrival, and
arrange safe passage into harbor.

157
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:49,854
I'll then attempt to persuade him

158
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:52,190
to assign the bulk
of his crew and his ship

159
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,741
to sail in consort with us.

160
00:11:53,742 --> 00:11:55,326
(Groans)

161
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:57,996
With a little luck,
we'll be on our way back

162
00:11:57,997 --> 00:12:01,533
to the Urca wreck
within a matter of days.

163
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:04,369
And how do you plan
to answer the question?

164
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,004
What question is that?

165
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:10,091
Why is this request coming
from you, Captain Flint,

166
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:12,092
and not from Mr. Gates?

167
00:12:14,964 --> 00:12:19,433
When in doubt, the truth
is a good place to start.

168
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:22,854
Oh, matter of ship business.

169
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:25,890
I've noticed the berths for the
vanguard are less than ideal.

170
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:27,525
I'd like to have them set in here.

171
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:29,110
Give the men a little
more space to breathe.

172
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:32,530
You want the vanguard to quarter
in the captain's cabin?

173
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:34,566
I'm not a tyrant, Mr. Dufresne.

174
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,484
The ship belongs to all of us.

175
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:39,037
This seems a way to ensure that
we all benefit from it equally.

176
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:41,956
It also seems a way to
ensure that the next time

177
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:44,158
someone raises a pistol towards you,

178
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,044
well, the vanguard
has a rooting interest.

179
00:12:48,497 --> 00:12:50,548
After my departure,
please ensure that mine

180
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:53,134
is the only longboat that ferries
anyone to and from the island.

181
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:56,004
- The men will resist.
- Then you resist them right back.

182
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:58,556
They all know that we're headed
back for the Urca's gold.

183
00:12:58,557 --> 00:12:59,891
They all know where it is.

184
00:12:59,892 --> 00:13:02,677
They all know that its
defenses are weakened.

185
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:06,096
We simply cannot allow that information
leaking out onto the beach.

186
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,517
Or let them go if you like.

187
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:11,436
To whatever extent
you're comfortable competing

188
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:14,022
with a dozen other crews
to retrieve that gold.

189
00:13:14,023 --> 00:13:18,109
Mr. Silver should be back aboard
with provisions within a few hours.

190
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,277
That ought to keep tempers in check.

191
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:29,037
Are these the ones?

192
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:30,787
Handpicked.

193
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:34,042
You understand what
I'm asking you to do?

194
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:35,293
Go back and watch the gold.

195
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,128
Keep watch on the Spanish soldiers

196
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:38,680
who are watching the gold.

197
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:41,933
You'll depart as soon as a
longboat can be made ready.

198
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:44,852
Return to Division Bay.
Approach from the south.

199
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:46,354
Stay inland and out of sight.

200
00:13:46,355 --> 00:13:48,640
Keep constant watch on that
beach until we arrive.

201
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:51,392
I should be no more
than two days behind you.

202
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:52,977
At which point I'll need
to know everything

203
00:13:52,978 --> 00:13:55,863
about their routines,
schedule, watch strength.

204
00:13:55,864 --> 00:13:59,233
Then we'll reconnoiter,
plan our final assault,

205
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:01,619
secure the gold. Is that clear?

206
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,320
Go.

207
00:14:05,074 --> 00:14:07,625
You certain they're the men for this?

208
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:10,294
They're the only ones who didn't
ask for more than I offered.

209
00:14:10,295 --> 00:14:11,796
So they had that in their favor.

210
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:13,665
Jesus.

211
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,418
I thought we needed to get back to
the ship as quickly as possible.

212
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:19,721
You're bringing something to read?

213
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:22,172
It isn't for me.

214
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:26,978
(Cow moos)

215
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:29,012
(Chickens clucking)

216
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:39,239
(Hoofbeats approaching)

217
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:57,592
Strange.

218
00:14:57,593 --> 00:14:59,961
You and I have never shared
more than a few words,

219
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:03,181
and yet I feel like we're old friends.

220
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:04,716
Do you?

221
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:06,467
Of course.

222
00:15:06,468 --> 00:15:08,885
James talks about you all the time.

223
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,640
Captain Flint.

224
00:15:15,277 --> 00:15:17,528
He's told me what you've
accomplished in this place.

225
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:20,397
With those men. In spite of them.

226
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:25,153
It's no small feat.

227
00:15:25,154 --> 00:15:26,904
And I admire it.

228
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:29,490
Do you know what
he told me about you?

229
00:15:29,491 --> 00:15:30,741
What's that?

230
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:35,079
Nothing.

231
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,832
When I ask him, all I get
is a shrug or a laugh

232
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,586
or an innocent suggestion that
he has a longtime companion.

233
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:43,921
Her name is Barlow
and nothing more.

234
00:15:43,922 --> 00:15:45,840
Is that possible?

235
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:47,809
Is it possible that
you're so unremarkable

236
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,926
as to resist any further
description than that?

237
00:15:51,263 --> 00:15:53,397
Certainly possible.

238
00:15:53,398 --> 00:15:56,350
You conspire with my father
to sabotage our plans.

239
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:58,186
You betray our trust.

240
00:15:58,187 --> 00:16:00,571
You cause almost irreparable
damage as a result.

241
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:02,940
And when Flint, the most feared
captain in all creation,

242
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:05,026
comes to confront you about it,

243
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:06,943
you destroy him.

244
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:10,782
Now I hear in the wind
that in his absence

245
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:14,452
you've begun to forge new
alliances with his enemies.

246
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:16,504
With the farmers of the interior.

247
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:19,090
With Mr. Underhill,
the man sheltering

248
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:20,791
my shit of a father as we speak.

249
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,130
It's true I've joined Pastor
Lambrick's congregation

250
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:28,466
and that Mr. Underhill is a member.

251
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:32,052
Yet here you sit, brewing tea
as if none of it ever happened.

252
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:35,273
And I'm forced to wonder
exactly what it is

253
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:37,974
you hold over Flint that makes
everything I've seen possible.

254
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:41,445
You don't know what you've seen.

255
00:16:41,446 --> 00:16:43,314
You didn't betray him?

256
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:45,783
I don't believe I did, no.

257
00:16:45,784 --> 00:16:48,319
And if he's being honest,
neither does he.

258
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,488
I'm sorry.
I saw the look on his face

259
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:52,609
the last night he left this
place and I beg to differ.

260
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:58,913
Every man has his torments.

261
00:16:58,914 --> 00:17:01,332
Demons born of past wrongs

262
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,501
that hound and harass him.

263
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:06,838
You perceive the effects
of Captain Flint's demons.

264
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,173
Echoes of their voices.

265
00:17:09,174 --> 00:17:11,509
But I know their names.

266
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,178
I was there when they were born.

267
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:16,180
I know the things

268
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:18,516
they whisper to him at night.

269
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:21,319
So you can believe me when I tell you

270
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,988
that within his chorus of torments...

271
00:17:26,658 --> 00:17:29,242
none of them look or sound like me.

272
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:34,115
I don't know what it is
that you owe Flint

273
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:36,117
or that he owes you.

274
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:37,702
But after the damage you've caused,

275
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:40,621
I know what you owe me and
I've come here to collect.

276
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:42,840
I need to speak with Underhill.

277
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:46,093
As a result of your actions, my
business interests are now vulnerable.

278
00:17:46,094 --> 00:17:49,547
Acquiring the partnership of a
plantation the size of Mr. Underhill's

279
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:51,632
could help bolster commerce
on my side of the island.

280
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:54,769
My attempts to reach him by
letter have gone unanswered.

281
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,771
And considering your new friendship,

282
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:59,056
I would like for you
to help arrange a meeting.

283
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,392
I thought he was an enemy of yours.

284
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:04,478
Perhaps I'm willing to see
things in a different light.

285
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:06,646
Will you do it?

286
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:10,400
I'll try.

287
00:18:19,244 --> 00:18:20,911
(Door slams)

288
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:28,803
This isn't enough.

289
00:18:28,804 --> 00:18:30,504
It's all there are funds for.

290
00:18:30,505 --> 00:18:32,056
Then less flour and more rum.

291
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:33,925
Mr. Dufresne was right.

292
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:36,727
The men will expect some time
in town before we depart.

293
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:40,348
I want them as contented as possible
when I inform them otherwise.

294
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:43,184
The Spanish soldiers
guarding the Hulk

295
00:18:43,185 --> 00:18:46,270
are four days removed by
longboat from St. Augustine.

296
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:47,688
By my reckoning, we got a week,

297
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:50,524
two at the most, before
King Philip takes his gold back.

298
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:52,575
There's no time for delay.

299
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:56,998
Get those supplies as quickly as
you can and meet me back here.

300
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,000
I'll engage Captain Hornigold

301
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:01,284
and make way for the ship
to enter the bay.

302
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:05,506
At least you won't have a
hard time finding him.

303
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:07,874
Isn't that Hornigold's flag?

304
00:19:13,382 --> 00:19:15,932
Why isn't he in his fort?

305
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,310
What the fuck happened here?

306
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:34,901
(Gasps)

307
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,063
(Sighs)

308
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:09,020
I hear this is once again a place

309
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:10,821
where men come with coins
in their pockets

310
00:20:10,822 --> 00:20:13,190
and secrets in their heads

311
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:15,192
and leave with less of both.

312
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:17,494
And I hear you're the one
doing the collecting.

313
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:21,866
You can relax.

314
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:23,701
I'm not here to stop it.

315
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:25,702
Your place, do as you like.

316
00:20:27,756 --> 00:20:30,674
But there is a secret you
wish my help in obtaining?

317
00:20:30,675 --> 00:20:32,793
New crew on the island,

318
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:34,678
captained by a man named Low.

319
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,798
They're hiding something.
A piece from their last prize.

320
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,851
Something unique.
Something of great value.

321
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:44,305
Seeing as his crew makes
frequent use of your girls,

322
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:47,190
I'd like you to find out what it is.

323
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,148
The other day I had
a moment with Eleanor.

324
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:58,235
Told her all the things I wanted
to say to her for so long.

325
00:20:58,236 --> 00:21:00,871
That I was unbroken by her.

326
00:21:00,872 --> 00:21:03,908
And I saw that it shook her.

327
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:06,377
And I felt happy.

328
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:10,080
And the moment she turned to walk away
from me, do you know what I felt?

329
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:15,136
The urge to go after her
and hold her again.

330
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:18,556
It's amazing, isn't it,
the spell she casts on us.

331
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:20,257
What are you talking about?

332
00:21:20,258 --> 00:21:21,809
You're right.

333
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,762
Captain Low's men
are familiar faces here.

334
00:21:24,763 --> 00:21:27,598
Just today I heard all the
captain was talking about

335
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,517
were the awful things he'd like
to visit upon Eleanor Guthrie.

336
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:34,105
Given the timing of your request,

337
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:36,606
I assume you've heard the same thing.

338
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:42,246
Jack and Anne have no idea what
they're up against with you, do they?

339
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:43,948
The only question that remains

340
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:48,202
is what difference does it
make what his cargo is worth?

341
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:51,122
Though I suppose if the
value is great enough,

342
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:54,008
it would give you pretense to move
against him and call it business

343
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:56,759
instead of calling it
what it actually is.

344
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:02,265
I'm going to assume
we have an agreement.

345
00:22:08,306 --> 00:22:10,807
It's not enough.

346
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,978
The money is generous,

347
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:16,564
but I'd rather have
something else from you.

348
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:18,566
Such as?

349
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:20,985
Your former shipmates,

350
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:24,238
they wish to sail again
under their own banner.

351
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:27,491
But so long as they bear the
black mark you put upon them,

352
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:29,292
their prospects will remain dim.

353
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:32,829
I'd like you to remove it.

354
00:22:46,428 --> 00:22:48,846
I found a way
to stop caring about her.

355
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:50,898
Would you like to know how?

356
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:52,599
No.

357
00:22:54,186 --> 00:22:56,144
You understand
the job I'm looking to fill?

358
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:57,522
Yes, ma'am.

359
00:22:57,523 --> 00:22:59,657
And you understand what happened
to the last man who held that job?

360
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:02,193
- Yes, ma'am.
- What happened to him?

361
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:05,028
(Speaks foreign language)

362
00:23:06,414 --> 00:23:09,032
He said the captain
put a sword in his mouth.

363
00:23:10,418 --> 00:23:12,503
You should know that captain
is still a threat to me.

364
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:14,838
You're not concerned about
stepping into the way of that?

365
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,373
No, ma'am.

366
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:17,958
EME:
I know him, ma'am.

367
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:20,543
I knew his sister before
they put us on the ship.

368
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,432
You asked me to bring one
I would trust with my life.

369
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:27,350
This is him.

370
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:36,309
(Chatter stops)

371
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:55,578
(Whispers)
I didn't get it.

372
00:24:07,642 --> 00:24:10,427
I led myself to believe that I
would either never see you again

373
00:24:10,428 --> 00:24:13,264
or that all our problems
would be solved.

374
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:16,432
I never made space in my mind
for something in between.

375
00:24:17,986 --> 00:24:21,355
But I'm so very glad you're alive.

376
00:24:21,356 --> 00:24:22,940
You were missed.

377
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:25,025
What do we do now?

378
00:24:25,026 --> 00:24:26,777
Now?

379
00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:29,280
Bloody go back and retrieve the gold.

380
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:31,782
Refit, hire a consort, finish the job.

381
00:24:31,783 --> 00:24:33,417
Is that possible?

382
00:24:33,418 --> 00:24:35,919
Well, it might have been possible

383
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,372
when I had someplace to
bring it all back home to.

384
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:41,041
Before the bay fell
into the hands of a madman.

385
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:43,010
Fucking Hornigold.

386
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:45,429
He told me Vane killed 30 of his men.

387
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,097
That he was prepared
to take back the fort,

388
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:49,049
but that you sabotaged his efforts.

389
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,551
I told him he must be mistaken.

390
00:24:50,552 --> 00:24:52,936
Eleanor Guthrie would never
be so wantonly reckless

391
00:24:52,937 --> 00:24:54,388
with the security of this place.

392
00:24:54,389 --> 00:24:56,056
- I understand your concern, but...
- Do you?

393
00:24:56,057 --> 00:24:59,026
Because what I find most
troubling about all of this

394
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:01,779
is the sense that you don't share it.

395
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,897
He came through the interior.

396
00:25:03,898 --> 00:25:05,866
There was no warning.

397
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:08,952
Before I or Hornigold or
anyone knew what was going on,

398
00:25:08,953 --> 00:25:11,288
he and his men were firmly
positioned up there

399
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:12,740
and threatening to sink
every ship in the bay

400
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:14,241
the moment we made
any move against him.

401
00:25:14,242 --> 00:25:16,627
- So you did nothing?
- What would you have had me do?

402
00:25:16,628 --> 00:25:18,662
Something! Anything!

403
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:21,298
Surprise him at night.
Use the tunnels.

404
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:22,633
He'd have sunk every ship in the bay.

405
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:24,001
He'd have sunk a few ships in the bay

406
00:25:24,002 --> 00:25:25,753
and it would have been
a price worth paying.

407
00:25:25,754 --> 00:25:29,723
You weren't here. And he isn't
the problem you think he is.

408
00:25:29,724 --> 00:25:32,843
He has no interest in
disrupting the flow of trade.

409
00:25:32,844 --> 00:25:35,846
You look me in the eye and
tell me that you're certain

410
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:38,065
that if I brought the Urca gold
back here past those guns,

411
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:42,101
he wouldn't use his position to
rob me of every last ounce of it.

412
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,825
I had to make a quick judgment.

413
00:25:47,826 --> 00:25:50,494
And in the moment it was clear that
the sacrifice it would have taken

414
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:53,029
to get him out of that fort
was simply too great.

415
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:11,515
A Spanish warship fell upon us

416
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:14,217
before we'd found our way to the Urca.

417
00:26:17,272 --> 00:26:21,774
At that point, Mr. Gates'
faith in our mission...

418
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:27,780
his faith in me was lost.

419
00:26:29,234 --> 00:26:31,702
I had to use my judgment

420
00:26:31,703 --> 00:26:35,013
whether to let him abort
our entire endeavor

421
00:26:35,014 --> 00:26:38,041
and see my plans,
your plans, evaporate

422
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:41,661
or to stop him.

423
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:45,381
I stopped him.

424
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,001
What did you do?

425
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:53,223
What was necessary.

426
00:26:53,224 --> 00:26:57,060
Because I knew that the future
of this place is everything.

427
00:26:57,061 --> 00:26:59,763
And that there is no sacrifice

428
00:26:59,764 --> 00:27:02,599
too great to secure that future.

429
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,985
I thought you and I were
in agreement about that.

430
00:27:13,611 --> 00:27:15,446
I'm sorry you were put to that choice.

431
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:18,365
I know what he meant to you.

432
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:21,835
So we are in agreement, then?

433
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:24,454
He must be removed from that fort.

434
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,878
You've been through hell.

435
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:34,381
There's nothing about any of this
that can't wait till tomorrow.

436
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:38,184
Get some rest and we can discuss
this further in the morning.

437
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,812
I saw her today.

438
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:53,901
Mrs. Barlow.

439
00:27:53,902 --> 00:27:56,819
She seemed concerned for your welfare.

440
00:27:58,656 --> 00:28:00,991
I know you and her

441
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:02,876
didn't part on pleasant terms.

442
00:28:02,877 --> 00:28:05,237
And perhaps
if you went to see her today...

443
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:10,217
Lady Hamilton.

444
00:28:10,218 --> 00:28:13,052
I asked the carriage
driver for your address.

445
00:28:16,508 --> 00:28:18,558
Lieutenant, it's rather cold out here.

446
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:22,261
I beg your pardon. Please, come in.

447
00:28:29,854 --> 00:28:32,905
It's... tidy.

448
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:41,114
Lady Hamilton, it's very generous
of you to come visit me,

449
00:28:41,115 --> 00:28:43,867
but perhaps I could now escort
you back to your carriage.

450
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:47,537
Are you familiar with Jonathan
and Margaret Grey, Lieutenant?

451
00:28:48,706 --> 00:28:50,541
The Duke and Duchess of Surrey?

452
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:53,010
As you may or may not be aware,

453
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:54,595
they hold one of
the largest collections

454
00:28:54,596 --> 00:28:56,880
of Egyptian artifacts
in all of Europe.

455
00:28:56,881 --> 00:29:00,717
I thought perhaps today you'd join
me in viewing them as my guest.

456
00:29:00,718 --> 00:29:03,637
You mean yours and your husband's?

457
00:29:03,638 --> 00:29:05,389
Thomas is otherwise engaged.

458
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,890
It would just be you and I.

459
00:29:09,777 --> 00:29:11,445
I don't think that's a very good idea.

460
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:14,997
Why wouldn't it be a good idea?
Would you not enjoy my company?

461
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:20,704
That would seem
to be beside the point.

462
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:22,372
- The point is...
- How it would look.

463
00:29:22,373 --> 00:29:24,408
Yes, ma'am. Exactly.

464
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:27,327
Are you happy, Lieutenant?

465
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:30,414
Happy? In what regard?

466
00:29:30,415 --> 00:29:33,667
In my experience, there is
an inverse relationship

467
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:35,669
between the degree
of one's happiness

468
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,171
and the concern one suffers
for what the neighbors think.

469
00:29:38,172 --> 00:29:40,390
This isn't an abstraction, ma'am.

470
00:29:40,391 --> 00:29:43,760
- Were your husband to hear...
- I love my husband.

471
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:46,096
I know what's said
about me behind my back.

472
00:29:46,097 --> 00:29:49,349
Whispers of infidelities.
My husband's heard them.

473
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,351
And I suspect, given
the look on your face,

474
00:29:51,352 --> 00:29:53,937
you've heard them, too.

475
00:29:53,938 --> 00:29:57,106
Thomas and I are not
bothered by them.

476
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:01,360
The only question that remains is...

477
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:05,498
are you?

478
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:15,626
It doesn't concern you?

479
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:16,793
Pardon?

480
00:30:16,794 --> 00:30:19,463
When you set sail,
my friend had his ear

481
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:21,965
and you were ballast.

482
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:25,135
Then he calls my friend a
mutineer and puts him in the sea.

483
00:30:25,136 --> 00:30:27,688
Now he's giving you his ear.

484
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:31,525
How can you stand so close to him
knowing what he's capable of

485
00:30:31,526 --> 00:30:34,276
and that sooner
or later you'll be next?

486
00:30:37,815 --> 00:30:39,900
Five million pieces of eight.

487
00:30:39,901 --> 00:30:43,369
Why? How do you do it?

488
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:49,493
You were right.

489
00:30:49,494 --> 00:30:51,545
I don't know where her loyalties lie.

490
00:30:51,546 --> 00:30:53,497
Told you as much.

491
00:30:53,498 --> 00:30:55,465
Either we act now to
remove him or no one will.

492
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:57,501
We don't have time for this.

493
00:30:57,502 --> 00:31:01,138
Every day wasted dealing with this
is a day closer to losing that gold.

494
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:03,222
Then I suggest we act quickly.

495
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:16,103
...and as many prizes
as I can capture.

496
00:31:16,104 --> 00:31:18,989
And as for captain, well,
you're looking at him.

497
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:23,025
(Men laughing, murmuring)

498
00:31:33,287 --> 00:31:34,538
ANNE:
Who were they?

499
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:37,040
Men wise enough to know
that on this island

500
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,458
three things are known to be true.

501
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:41,294
Number two is Jack Rackham
is a crew killer.

502
00:31:41,295 --> 00:31:43,130
It'll turn.

503
00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:45,132
I admire your optimism.

504
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:48,135
- Why didn't you wait for me?
- You were preoccupied.

505
00:31:48,136 --> 00:31:50,887
If you're angry about the whore
and me, just fucking say so.

506
00:31:50,888 --> 00:31:53,557
You have an itch that needs scratching.
Go with God.

507
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:55,392
My trouble isn't that she
knows how to play the thing

508
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:58,395
between your legs better than I,
but the one between your ears.

509
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:00,447
Do you honestly not see it?

510
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:03,033
That your judgment with
her is clouded at best.

511
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:04,735
That she knows it
and intends to use it

512
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:07,487
to drive a wedge between us, because
it is painfully obvious to me.

513
00:32:07,488 --> 00:32:10,207
And there's nothing
I can do to counter it

514
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:12,825
when I'm on the wrong
side of that door.

515
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,748
Of course I can see it.

516
00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:20,382
Then why don't you stop it?

517
00:32:25,006 --> 00:32:26,972
I can't.

518
00:32:30,228 --> 00:32:32,845
(Loud chatter)

519
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:41,270
VANE:
Join me.

520
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,240
Won't you?

521
00:32:46,661 --> 00:32:48,327
(Chatter quiets)

522
00:32:58,706 --> 00:33:00,506
Sit down.

523
00:33:05,213 --> 00:33:07,097
What's happening exactly?

524
00:33:07,098 --> 00:33:10,133
I'm repairing your reputations.

525
00:33:10,134 --> 00:33:12,719
Public display of reconciliation.

526
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,055
So just sit there,

527
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:17,641
smile,

528
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:18,941
and let it happen.

529
00:33:23,197 --> 00:33:24,613
To Mr. Hamund.

530
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:28,367
We hardly knew ye.

531
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:37,460
Look at the two of you.

532
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:40,497
Every reason to run
screaming from each other.

533
00:33:40,498 --> 00:33:42,999
And yet you're still as thick
as the moment I first found you

534
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,051
fucking behind the galley.

535
00:33:45,052 --> 00:33:47,003
You'll either be
the death of each other

536
00:33:47,004 --> 00:33:49,339
or we'll all end up
working for you someday.

537
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,007
Doubt there's any third outcome.

538
00:33:55,646 --> 00:33:58,514
Why? Why now?

539
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,110
(Whispers)
I know what Low's cargo is.

540
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:20,452
No shit?

541
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:28,711
Stand up.

542
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,825
(Grunts)

543
00:35:03,464 --> 00:35:05,498
Will that do?

544
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:06,882
I believe so.

545
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:10,387
Congratulations, Jack.

546
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:13,055
Now you know what it's like
to rise from the grave.

547
00:35:24,526 --> 00:35:26,069
SILVER:
Well, it's not exactly a feast,

548
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,238
but the food I've procured
should be waiting by the jetty.

549
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,857
Get rid of it. Dump it. Sell it.
I don't care.

550
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:33,276
- What about the crew?
- Tell them the truth.

551
00:35:33,277 --> 00:35:35,195
It was stolen from them
by Charles Vane

552
00:35:35,196 --> 00:35:37,330
and the horde of barbarians
he now commands.

553
00:35:37,331 --> 00:35:39,749
They've run amok on the island
and no one's been spared.

554
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,167
Didn't you notice?

555
00:35:41,168 --> 00:35:43,670
I want them boiling over
by the time I return.

556
00:35:43,671 --> 00:35:45,955
Where are you going?

557
00:35:47,124 --> 00:35:48,924
I see.

558
00:35:55,383 --> 00:35:57,050
MIRANDA:
Where are we going?

559
00:35:57,051 --> 00:35:59,769
I'm quite certain this isn't the
way to the Greys' residence.

560
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,888
I quietly instructed the
driver to take you home.

561
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,310
Propriety.

562
00:36:07,311 --> 00:36:09,362
Lady Hamilton, do you know
what would happen in my world

563
00:36:09,363 --> 00:36:12,615
if people just did as they please
with no regard for convention?

564
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:15,702
Columbus would still be sailing in
circles off the coast of Spain.

565
00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:17,569
(Chuckles)

566
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:23,960
I imagine there are two kinds of
men who make their life at sea.

567
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:27,130
Those whose sense of duty forces them

568
00:36:27,131 --> 00:36:31,051
to leave any sense of permanence
or identity behind them

569
00:36:31,052 --> 00:36:33,669
and those for whom
that is the attraction.

570
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:36,423
Which do you think I am?

571
00:36:36,424 --> 00:36:39,559
I think you're someone
who's very good

572
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,428
at managing how you're perceived.

573
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:43,980
And perhaps getting
what you want

574
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:46,516
without anyone ever
knowing how you did it

575
00:36:46,517 --> 00:36:48,651
or perhaps if it ever happened at all.

576
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:50,819
Perhaps...

577
00:36:56,694 --> 00:37:00,529
Don't tell me propriety has worked
its evils on you, too, now.

578
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:04,700
I was going to say...

579
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:08,788
that perhaps you're more
concerned with whether or not

580
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:12,708
people talk about what you and I do
may be doing behind closed doors...

581
00:37:14,128 --> 00:37:16,345
than with what we actually are doing.

582
00:37:38,152 --> 00:37:40,652
(Clavichord playing)

583
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:54,416
(Children giggling)

584
00:38:13,354 --> 00:38:15,271
MIRANDA:
All right, start again

585
00:38:15,272 --> 00:38:16,772
at the beginning of the measure.

586
00:38:32,623 --> 00:38:34,756
(Bell rings)

587
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:43,599
(Man shouting)

588
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:57,063
(Man whistles)
State your name!

589
00:38:57,064 --> 00:38:58,814
What's going on?

590
00:39:27,344 --> 00:39:28,810
May I?

591
00:39:42,026 --> 00:39:44,944
I admire you for coming
to see me earlier.

592
00:39:44,945 --> 00:39:47,530
Showed you were a man
who knows his place.

593
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:50,250
That quality alone puts you ahead

594
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:52,417
of practically every other
captain on this island.

595
00:39:53,537 --> 00:39:55,538
So I'd like to make you an offer.

596
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:57,373
An offer?

597
00:39:57,374 --> 00:40:01,009
Partnership between
your crew and mine.

598
00:40:04,765 --> 00:40:06,099
I'm not interested.

599
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,883
But you haven't heard the deal yet.

600
00:40:11,138 --> 00:40:13,473
I took the fort to control the bay,

601
00:40:13,474 --> 00:40:16,693
but I have no desire
to waste away in it.

602
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:18,561
My place is at sea.

603
00:40:18,562 --> 00:40:20,446
But as I'm certain you've heard,

604
00:40:20,447 --> 00:40:22,398
I was recently deprived of my ship.

605
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:24,817
Which means I need a new one.

606
00:40:24,818 --> 00:40:27,453
Were she to come with a
strong crew, all the better.

607
00:40:27,454 --> 00:40:29,706
Let me stop you there.

608
00:40:29,707 --> 00:40:33,826
Before I came to see you this morning,
I will admit I was concerned.

609
00:40:33,827 --> 00:40:37,413
It's painfully clear you've got
feelings for the Guthrie woman.

610
00:40:37,414 --> 00:40:40,216
If you could bring all your
men to bear to protect her,

611
00:40:40,217 --> 00:40:42,252
to retaliate against anyone
who would move against her,

612
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:45,470
that might be reason enough
to let this whole matter go.

613
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,341
But do you know what I think now?

614
00:40:48,342 --> 00:40:51,261
I think your men couldn't care
less about Eleanor Guthrie.

615
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:54,764
I think they find your feelings
for her to be pathetic.

616
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:57,433
I think you're powerless
to do anything about this.

617
00:40:57,434 --> 00:40:59,602
And for all these reasons,
I think my feelings

618
00:40:59,603 --> 00:41:01,938
about Eleanor scare you to death.

619
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:06,576
And I must say, coming out
here alone like this,

620
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:09,695
it only serves to confirm my suspicions.

621
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:14,116
Do your men even know you're here?

622
00:41:42,613 --> 00:41:46,366
I recommend you get up
and get off my ship.

623
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:49,319
Don't you want to hear
the rest of my terms first?

624
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,904
By all means.

625
00:41:51,905 --> 00:41:54,490
I get your ship.

626
00:41:54,491 --> 00:41:56,241
I get your cargo.

627
00:41:57,961 --> 00:41:59,579
I get your weapons.

628
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,464
(Grunts)

629
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:04,666
I get it all.

630
00:42:05,753 --> 00:42:07,920
And what exactly

631
00:42:07,921 --> 00:42:10,639
would I get in exchange for all that?

632
00:42:12,426 --> 00:42:14,393
A head start.

633
00:42:16,764 --> 00:42:18,730
Mr. Holmes.

634
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:27,689
Mr. Holmes doesn't work here anymore.

635
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,777
(Grunts)

636
00:42:34,531 --> 00:42:36,748
(Shouts)

637
00:42:40,037 --> 00:42:41,920
(Groans)

638
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,496
(Screams)

639
00:43:28,218 --> 00:43:29,751
(Door opens)

640
00:43:56,497 --> 00:43:58,831
Found the prize they was hiding.

641
00:43:58,832 --> 00:44:01,249
Just where the whore said she'd be.

642
00:44:06,423 --> 00:44:08,457
(Men chatting)

643
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,461
BOY:
Tobacco?

644
00:44:11,462 --> 00:44:13,628
Tobacco, sir?

645
00:44:15,682 --> 00:44:17,633
Tobacco?

646
00:44:17,634 --> 00:44:19,634
Sir?

647
00:44:22,806 --> 00:44:24,556
No, thank you.

648
00:44:27,895 --> 00:44:29,478
Mr. Scott.

649
00:44:54,338 --> 00:44:56,138
I apologize.

650
00:44:56,139 --> 00:44:57,640
Didn't imagine your new crewmates

651
00:44:57,641 --> 00:44:59,225
would appreciate you
and I speaking directly.

652
00:44:59,226 --> 00:45:02,178
No, I don't imagine they would.

653
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:04,730
How have they taken to you?
Any better?

654
00:45:04,731 --> 00:45:07,682
Hmm, small moves.

655
00:45:10,187 --> 00:45:11,654
Flint came to see me today.

656
00:45:11,655 --> 00:45:14,574
- I know he and Hornigold spoke.
- Eleanor.

657
00:45:14,575 --> 00:45:17,860
And I have to believe that he went
to see him after he left my office.

658
00:45:17,861 --> 00:45:19,495
- Were you there when...
- Eleanor.

659
00:45:19,496 --> 00:45:22,415
I would ask you not to
put me in this position.

660
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:25,668
I swore an oath. I have an obligation
to Captain Hornigold's crew.

661
00:45:25,669 --> 00:45:29,037
You don't have to respond.
Just listen.

662
00:45:30,757 --> 00:45:33,342
I know Flint wants
Vane out of the fort.

663
00:45:33,343 --> 00:45:35,011
I know Hornigold wants it, too.

664
00:45:35,012 --> 00:45:36,679
Ordinarily, it would be bad enough

665
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,764
having them spinning
each other up about it.

666
00:45:38,765 --> 00:45:41,716
But something was different today.

667
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,387
When I saw Flint, something
was different about him.

668
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,441
You know what happened
out there, don't you?

669
00:45:51,695 --> 00:45:54,063
What happened to Mr. Gates.

670
00:45:54,064 --> 00:45:56,899
I've never been under any illusions
of what he's capable of,

671
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,818
- but this is just too...
- Eleanor.

672
00:45:58,819 --> 00:46:00,785
Where are you?

673
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:03,656
What?

674
00:46:03,657 --> 00:46:04,907
For as long as I can remember,

675
00:46:04,908 --> 00:46:06,876
you have told me how
important Captain Flint is

676
00:46:06,877 --> 00:46:09,912
to the future of this
place, to your future.

677
00:46:09,913 --> 00:46:11,297
You have put money behind him.

678
00:46:11,298 --> 00:46:13,583
You have put your
credibility behind him.

679
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:15,585
And now you would resist him?

680
00:46:15,586 --> 00:46:17,920
Join with Captain Vane against him?

681
00:46:17,921 --> 00:46:19,639
This isn't about taking sides.

682
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,090
It's about protecting
the fort, protecting Nassau.

683
00:46:21,091 --> 00:46:24,310
Eleanor, you need to ask yourself

684
00:46:24,311 --> 00:46:27,146
what you want,

685
00:46:27,147 --> 00:46:29,180
where your loyalties are...

686
00:46:30,317 --> 00:46:32,267
and whom do you trust?

687
00:46:35,822 --> 00:46:38,357
(Woman screams)

688
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:40,442
(Men clamoring)

689
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,111
__

690
00:47:11,441 --> 00:47:13,358
(Man whistles)

691
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:31,826
I didn't do it for you.

692
00:48:01,074 --> 00:48:03,158
(Breathing heavily)

693
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:20,792
(Panting)

694
00:48:32,606 --> 00:48:35,441
Six men. Maybe seven.

695
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:38,194
That should be achievable now.

696
00:48:38,195 --> 00:48:40,563
And with just this week's till,

697
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:42,782
we can most likely acquire a piragua.

698
00:48:42,783 --> 00:48:44,567
(Whooshes)

699
00:48:44,568 --> 00:48:46,651
It'll be a small start.

700
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:50,789
We're gonna sail again.

701
00:49:02,302 --> 00:49:03,918
What the fuck are you waiting for?

702
00:49:35,001 --> 00:49:37,035
Did he see you come up?

703
00:50:39,316 --> 00:50:41,599
What is it?

704
00:50:42,936 --> 00:50:44,853
There's something I need to show you.

705
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,848
VANE:
That is the crown jewel

706
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:14,934
taken from the Good Fortune prize.

707
00:51:14,935 --> 00:51:17,720
Her father is Lord Peter Ashe,

708
00:51:17,721 --> 00:51:20,556
governor of the Carolina colony.

709
00:51:20,557 --> 00:51:23,943
Low recorded in his log the ransom
amount he intended to demand.

710
00:51:23,944 --> 00:51:26,728
£250,000.

711
00:51:28,315 --> 00:51:29,531
They sedated her.

712
00:51:29,532 --> 00:51:31,734
Soon as she wakes,
I'll get her particulars

713
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:33,202
and go ransom her myself.

714
00:51:33,203 --> 00:51:35,404
Lord Ashe won't be trifled with.

715
00:51:35,405 --> 00:51:37,656
I have no intentions
of trifling with him.

716
00:51:37,657 --> 00:51:41,210
He's hanged men for merely
suspecting them of piracy.

717
00:51:41,211 --> 00:51:44,413
He's fanatical about
exterminating men like you.

718
00:51:44,414 --> 00:51:47,333
Eleanor, I wasn't asking permission.

719
00:51:47,334 --> 00:51:49,918
I know what I'm doing.

720
00:52:02,098 --> 00:52:04,266
I told the men what you asked.

721
00:52:04,267 --> 00:52:06,317
They're not pleased.

722
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:14,326
Good.

723
00:52:14,327 --> 00:52:16,111
Is it?

724
00:52:16,112 --> 00:52:18,030
Once you go down this road,

725
00:52:18,031 --> 00:52:20,498
what if there's no turning back?

726
00:52:39,302 --> 00:52:41,602
I know how you all must feel.

727
00:52:43,473 --> 00:52:45,891
How desperate you must be to go home

728
00:52:45,892 --> 00:52:50,396
and be embraced by Nassau again.

729
00:52:50,397 --> 00:52:53,565
But I'm here to tell you,

730
00:52:53,566 --> 00:52:56,735
that place no longer exists.

731
00:52:56,736 --> 00:53:00,823
It has been taken from us by a madman.

732
00:53:00,824 --> 00:53:03,993
Held hostage by threat of force

733
00:53:03,994 --> 00:53:06,711
that no one on the island
seems able to resist.

734
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:11,000
Now I would like to say

735
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:13,419
that the Urca beckons us.

736
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,971
That we should look the other way.

737
00:53:15,972 --> 00:53:19,675
That the affairs of the beach
should never take precedence

738
00:53:19,676 --> 00:53:21,760
over those of the purse.

739
00:53:21,761 --> 00:53:26,514
But in this case, these issues
would seem to be one and the same.

740
00:53:28,151 --> 00:53:31,020
Even if we could
make it ashore safely,

741
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:34,940
even if we could refit amidst
the chaos that has been sown,

742
00:53:34,941 --> 00:53:37,026
even if we could ignore all of this

743
00:53:37,027 --> 00:53:39,777
and go on to win the Urca's
gold, what then?

744
00:53:41,364 --> 00:53:45,367
We return home only to have
Vane extort from us

745
00:53:45,368 --> 00:53:49,120
the very prize that we have
sacrificed so much to win?

746
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:55,127
Nassau was unable to resist him.

747
00:53:55,128 --> 00:53:57,262
But we have yet to have our say.

748
00:53:57,263 --> 00:54:01,216
So at sunrise tomorrow,

749
00:54:01,217 --> 00:54:04,470
we make our terms clear with no room

750
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:06,221
for bargain or compromise.

751
00:54:06,222 --> 00:54:09,608
Charles Vane
and the animals he commands

752
00:54:09,609 --> 00:54:13,979
have until sunrise tomorrow
to vacate that fort

753
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,364
or so help me God...

754
00:54:18,568 --> 00:54:21,153
I will rain holy hell down upon him.

755
00:54:21,154 --> 00:54:23,905
(Men cheering)

756
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:34,048

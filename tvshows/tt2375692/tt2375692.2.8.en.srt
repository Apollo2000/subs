00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,980
<i>When you return, are
you going to explain to Peter</i>

4
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,698
what it is you're trying
to accomplish here?

5
00:00:14,784 --> 00:00:16,784
A Nassau
that can self-govern.

6
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:18,579
This is not a man
that we can negotiate with,

7
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:20,237
- that I can negotiate with.
- Of course you can.

8
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:23,374
Because you will have just presented
him with his only daughter.

9
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:25,659
I can only scavenge
leads for so long.

10
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:28,162
I have an appetite for
something larger than that.

11
00:00:28,214 --> 00:00:30,414
<i>For this, I need
a partner I can trust.</i>

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,750
<i>A launch landed on
the beach a short while ago.</i>

13
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:35,219
They told Flint the gold was gone.
What did they tell you?

14
00:00:35,304 --> 00:00:37,388
The Urca gold
is on that beach.

15
00:00:37,473 --> 00:00:40,007
<i>It is almost
entirely undefended.</i>

16
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:43,310
Do you know of a crew who might be
willing to aid in this endeavor?

17
00:00:43,346 --> 00:00:45,146
<i>Abigail, you are
no longer a hostage.</i>

18
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:46,461
<i>I'm going to
get you out of here.</i>

19
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:47,681
<i>So, what's the plan?</i>

20
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:49,100
Leave me to answer
for this among the men?

21
00:00:49,185 --> 00:00:53,737
My death sentence.
You will hear from me again.

22
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:56,574
- You're Captain Flint?
<i>-  My name is James.</i>

23
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:58,075
James McGraw.

<i>It's all right.
You're all right.</i>

26
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:58,445
<i>I'm here.</i>

27
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:06,120
Shh, shh.

28
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,661
Shh.

29
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:40,654
No! No!

30
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,073
No! No!

31
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:48,195
Shh, it's all right.
I'm here.

32
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:50,948
Shh, you're all right.

33
00:03:56,505 --> 00:04:01,208
<i>Last night was
the first of my journey home.</i>

34
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,212
<i>Still, my dreams are haunted
by the faces of those pirates</i>

35
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:06,880
<i>that first captured me.</i>

36
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:15,973
<i>Now I
find myself in the custody</i>

37
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:18,642
<i>of another band
of pirates.</i>

38
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:20,861
<i>I'm told
they're different,</i>

39
00:04:20,896 --> 00:04:23,731
<i>and I will say
that so far these men</i>

40
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:27,568
<i>have treated me civilly,
even courteously.</i>

41
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:32,072
<i>They've even afforded me the
tools to keep this journal.</i>

42
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:33,991
<i>And though they will
almost certainly</i>

43
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:36,910
<i>destroy these pages
before we disembark,</i>

44
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:38,879
<i>eliminating any record</i>

45
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:42,082
<i>of their activities
or their identities...</i>

46
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:46,553
<i>just the act of putting
my thoughts to paper</i>

47
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:49,723
<i>has helped me
feel myself again.</i>

48
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,676
<i>To construct for myself
an illusion</i>

49
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:55,262
<i>that I'm still
on the Good Fortune</i>

50
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:58,482
<i>nearing the end
of a long voyage,</i>

51
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:02,436
<i>recent events were themselves
the nightmare,</i>

52
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:05,105
<i>and that these men
are simply sailors</i>

53
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:07,408
<i>tasked with
delivering me home.</i>

54
00:05:09,862 --> 00:05:11,195
Get off me, I tell you!
I'll kill you!

55
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,414
Hey, hey, come on!
Stop, you!

56
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:15,199
<i>I said cut it out.</i>

57
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:17,368
<i>I don't know who started it,
but it stops right now.</i>

58
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:19,586
<i>Take him away!
Get back to work!</i>

59
00:05:19,622 --> 00:05:21,622
<i>But it is only an illusion.</i>

60
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,511
<i>And a fragile one at that.</i>

61
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:35,135
<i>My father
told me about these men,</i>

62
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:38,272
<i>about their natures,</i>

63
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:41,809
<i>so I know that any appearance
of civility from them</i>

64
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:44,778
<i>is but a glimpse
of the men they once were.</i>

65
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:48,949
<i>A ghost that shows itself
only while the darker things</i>

66
00:05:48,984 --> 00:05:53,070
<i>that now govern
their souls lay dormant.</i>

67
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:55,038
<i>Though I'm forced to wonder</i>

68
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:58,158
<i>if this illusion
is no accident at all,</i>

69
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,411
<i>but theater
for my benefit,</i>

70
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:03,414
<i>orchestrated
by someone so awful,</i>

71
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:06,333
<i>even monsters such as these
have no choice</i>

72
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:09,636
<i>but to dance to the tune
he plays for them.</i>

73
00:06:11,757 --> 00:06:13,891
<i>Which leads me
to the one thought</i>

74
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:15,976
<i>I find most frightening</i>

75
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:18,562
<i>and most difficult
to dismiss.</i>

76
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:22,232
<i>What happens if that man
decides the theater</i>

77
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:25,352
<i>no longer
serves his purposes</i>

78
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:27,571
<i>and he lets
the monsters loose?</i>

79
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:38,749
Everything all right?

80
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:43,120
Yes.

81
00:06:43,205 --> 00:06:44,838
I'm all right.

82
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:57,468
She was
writing about me.

83
00:06:57,553 --> 00:06:59,553
Do you think?

84
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:02,222
I suppose
I can't blame her.

85
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:04,858
A girl her age with what
she's been through.

86
00:07:04,894 --> 00:07:07,528
It's a credit to her that
she can function at all.

87
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:11,732
Look at her.

88
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:13,784
<i>When I first learned
she was on the island,</i>

89
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:17,204
<i>I saw in my mind
a five-year-old child</i>

90
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,373
<i>hiding behind
her mother's dress.</i>

91
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:21,375
Then I saw her.

92
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:26,380
I realized
she's a woman.

93
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:28,749
<i>It's like she's
some sort of clock</i>

94
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:30,751
<i>that's finally
struck its chime</i>

95
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:34,588
<i>and woken me from this
dream we've been living,</i>

96
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,926
<i>reminded me how many
years separate me</i>

97
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:41,144
from a world
I still think of as home.

98
00:07:44,183 --> 00:07:46,650
How unrecognizable
the woman I am now

99
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:49,937
would be to the woman
I was then.

100
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:01,999
I recognize you.

101
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:04,418
You recognize me?

102
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:06,787
Yes.

103
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,172
So that's in our favor.

104
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,764
The question is...

105
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,634
will Peter recognize
either one of us?

106
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:28,642
Five million pieces.

107
00:08:28,694 --> 00:08:32,112
Five million
fucking pieces.

108
00:08:32,147 --> 00:08:34,281
Five million pieces.

109
00:08:36,702 --> 00:08:37,985
Jesus Christ.

110
00:09:01,677 --> 00:09:03,510
How in the fuck

111
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:05,596
am I supposed
to prepare to carry

112
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:08,015
five million pieces
of eight across an ocean

113
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,900
without anybody
knowing I'm doing it?!

114
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:11,935
I don't know, but perhaps if
you asked a little louder,

115
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:15,355
there might be someone on
the moon who could help you.

116
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:18,609
Why don't we lower our
voices and begin again?

117
00:09:18,694 --> 00:09:21,028
Have you begun the men
clearing the ship's hold?

118
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,696
Everything that
isn't bolted down

119
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:24,414
is being moved
onto the sand.

120
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,700
I told him
I needed to refigure

121
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:28,368
how she was
carrying her weight.

122
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:30,587
- Is that something one does?
- No.

123
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:33,874
It's all I could think of given
that there's no good reason

124
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,043
to empty a ship
while she's in the bay

125
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:39,129
unless you're making room to fill
that space with something else.

126
00:09:39,214 --> 00:09:41,254
"Oi, Featherstone, what is
it we're making space for

127
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,599
by emptying
all this stuff?"

128
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:44,205
"Oh, nothing, gents.
I just want to..."

129
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:45,719
Try to refigure how she's
carrying her weight?

130
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:48,221
"...refigure how she's
carrying her weight," exactly.

131
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:50,557
Fuck!

132
00:09:50,643 --> 00:09:53,060
Even if somehow
we can set sail

133
00:09:53,145 --> 00:09:55,729
<i>to retrieve this gold
without anyone knowing it,</i>

134
00:09:55,814 --> 00:09:58,982
even if the intelligence is correct
and the gold is retrievable,

135
00:09:59,068 --> 00:10:01,818
we haven't even begun
to address the issue

136
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:03,236
of where we'll put
all that gold,

137
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:05,539
much less defend it.

138
00:10:05,574 --> 00:10:07,574
I mean...

139
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,327
is this really something
we're capable of doing?

140
00:10:10,412 --> 00:10:13,413
- Yes.
- Yes?

141
00:10:13,465 --> 00:10:18,085
Yes, we are capable
of doing this and more.

142
00:10:18,137 --> 00:10:21,555
We will have that prize,
Mr. Featherstone.

143
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:25,809
We've all come too far to let an
opportunity like this pass us by.

144
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:27,477
Would you not agree?

145
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:29,479
I humbly suggest

146
00:10:29,565 --> 00:10:31,481
you continue
unloading the hold.

147
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:34,434
By the time anyone
expects to reload it,

148
00:10:34,486 --> 00:10:38,238
you will be close enough to departure
to tell them the truth, yes?

149
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:54,454
Is it possible
for two men

150
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:56,373
days removed
from unending wealth

151
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,041
to be any less happy?

152
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:05,098
All right, I can see
that you are angry.

153
00:11:06,518 --> 00:11:08,685
But are you angry
with Anne for leaving

154
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:12,022
or are you angry with me for
offering her the opportunity?

155
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:14,641
It would help me to understand
with which I am dealing.

156
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:25,152
For so many years,
I knew her.

157
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:27,537
Perhaps the only one
who truly knew her.

158
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:32,826
But for weeks, with everything
we've been through,

159
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:34,745
everything she's done...

160
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,000
she's a fucking
mystery to me.

161
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:44,111
So now I realize
two things are possible--

162
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:46,506
One, something
has changed within her,

163
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:49,392
something so significant that she's
turned into someone I barely recognize,

164
00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:51,061
or, two...

165
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:55,232
it was a fantasy that
I ever knew her at all.

166
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:58,268
And the most disturbing
thing about it is,

167
00:11:58,353 --> 00:12:00,103
because it's Anne...

168
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:06,026
I will likely
never know which it is.

169
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:09,029
Am I angry
that she's gone?

170
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:14,367
Maybe with everything that lies ahead
of us, perhaps it's for the best.

171
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:52,322
I'm here to see
the lady of the house.

172
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:53,790
She's occupied.

173
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:55,375
Tell her
it's news from home.

174
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,244
Use those words,
please.

175
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:11,558
<i>Good morning, dear.</i>

176
00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:15,812
What do you have for me?

177
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:18,064
The quartermaster,
Featherstone,

178
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,517
met with Max and Rackham
behind closed doors again.

179
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:22,152
Entered in a huff,
left in a huff.

180
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:24,321
Could you make out
their words?

181
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:28,408
No, and I fear if I pressed any
closer, they'd have found me out.

182
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:30,944
Ma'am, you know I am
eternally in your debt

183
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:32,779
for how you treated me
when you oversaw the inn,

184
00:13:32,865 --> 00:13:36,116
but please don't ask me to
delve into this any further.

185
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:41,922
It's all for a good cause,
rest assured.

186
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:44,291
You haven't even told me what
this is all in service of.

187
00:13:44,376 --> 00:13:47,294
Who the information's
being purchased for.

188
00:14:02,394 --> 00:14:04,311
When last we spoke, you
said you were still undecided

189
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:06,813
as to who would assume control
ostensibly of the operation.

190
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:09,199
I was just wondering
if you'd reached a decision.

191
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:12,736
Not yet.
Shortly.

192
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:15,655
- Is that all?
- Yes, ma'am.

193
00:14:17,993 --> 00:14:20,577
No news from the fort?

194
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:22,996
The doors are still shut.
No word from inside.

195
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:24,664
Either they're plotting
some sort of reprisal

196
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,417
against us over the
disappearance of Miss Ashe or--

197
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:29,669
Or they're still
choosing a new captain.

198
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,756
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,850
Ma'am, the lady is here.

200
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:45,685
She's here right now?

201
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:48,355
Yes, ma'am.
Said it was urgent.

202
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:50,607
All right.

203
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:57,497
Were we scheduled
to see each other today?

204
00:14:57,532 --> 00:15:00,367
No, ma'am.

205
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:03,787
But I have news I think you'll
want to hear without delay.

206
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:06,373
<i>May I sit?</i>

207
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:14,547
When you engaged me to monitor
the goings on across the way,

208
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:18,218
for a generous stipend,
I might add,

209
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,389
I must confess, I thought you'd
overestimated our young friend Max,

210
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:26,026
<i>worrying that she was clever enough
to create any real trouble--</i>

211
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:27,727
I'm sorry, is there a point
you are trying to make?

212
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:30,397
I was wrong.

213
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:33,566
There is something
afoot at the inn.

214
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:35,735
I believe
I know what it is.

215
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:38,071
<i>And I believe you'll
want to know it, too.</i>

216
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:46,663
Next item!

217
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:53,086
I know my role here is to
recount information to you.

218
00:15:53,138 --> 00:15:55,805
But with what lies ahead,

219
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:59,559
I'm hoping you'll indulge me
in a personal account.

220
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:03,847
About five years ago,
I served on a merchant vessel

221
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:06,766
<i>running slaves in and out
of Charles Town.</i>

222
00:16:06,852 --> 00:16:11,571
I remember the first time
I saw those walls,

223
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:14,357
those patrol ships,

224
00:16:14,443 --> 00:16:17,494
and those fucking guns.

225
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,279
The first mate leans in

226
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:22,449
as he sees that look
on my face.

227
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:26,252
He says,
"That, son,

228
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:30,423
is a town resolved
never to be fucked with."

229
00:16:31,676 --> 00:16:33,460
<i>And as we're
unloading our cargo,</i>

230
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:37,630
we watch a gathering
in the square-- a gallows.

231
00:16:37,682 --> 00:16:40,934
<i>And we watch
as they haul up a man</i>

232
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:43,636
named Solomon Little.

233
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,973
And they announced
to the crowd that this man...

234
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:49,309
When Captain Flint first
arrived on this island,

235
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:52,445
he gained influence faster
than any man I'd seen before.

236
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:54,447
Or since.

237
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,783
I heard men say it was
because of the violence.

238
00:16:56,818 --> 00:16:59,569
I heard them say
it was his charm.

239
00:16:59,654 --> 00:17:01,404
But it was clear
to me the reason why

240
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,656
he was so good at bending
men towards his will

241
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,159
was he knew
the power of a story

242
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:09,045
<i>and how to harness it
to his own ends.</i>

243
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:11,464
That man there,
I would argue,

244
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
may very well
be his equal.

245
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:17,220
...as they put the rope
around his neck.

246
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:19,422
And I listened
to that excited talk...

247
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:21,341
You know it
isn't even his.

248
00:17:21,393 --> 00:17:23,510
What do you mean?

249
00:17:23,562 --> 00:17:26,479
The pirate story
is Bernard's.

250
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:28,014
I've heard him
tell it before.

251
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,517
This man was no more
than an animal...

252
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:32,852
Jeffries, I think.
Can't remember.

253
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:37,657
Can't trust a fucking
thing out of his mouth.

254
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:41,027
Yeah, the story's his,
the story isn't his.

255
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,080
But the power
of the telling...

256
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,583
that is clearly his.

257
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:50,920
At the moment, he's using
it to help the captain.

258
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:52,505
But God help us
if he ever realizes

259
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,874
what else he could
use it to accomplish.

260
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,844
<i>And as he swung,</i>

261
00:17:57,879 --> 00:17:59,963
I watched the crowd
jeer at him.

262
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:04,884
I watched them laugh
and celebrate.

263
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:07,470
Women, children,
all of them.

264
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:11,107
I tell you, friends,

265
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:14,027
what lies ahead
isn't just the governor

266
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:17,230
nor his lieutenants
or his soldiers or their guns.

267
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:20,483
The people
of Charles Town

268
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:24,237
are eager
to see you and me dead.

269
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,659
If Captain Flint is
to come through this alive,

270
00:18:29,744 --> 00:18:32,579
we will need to be focused
and at our best.

271
00:18:42,224 --> 00:18:44,057
What the hell was that?

272
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,310
What?

273
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:49,729
When you two returned and the
three of us stood on that beach,

274
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:51,564
what did I say to you?

275
00:18:53,068 --> 00:18:55,768
You said if we told Flint
the gold was gone,

276
00:18:55,854 --> 00:18:57,604
you'd get another crew
to go back and get it

277
00:18:57,656 --> 00:19:00,273
and we could have
a bigger share.

278
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:05,828
Well, there we go.

279
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:08,031
There's the problem.

280
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:11,117
It seems you only heard half
of what I said that night.

281
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:14,204
I also said
that if anyone,

282
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:18,124
anyone even remotely suspected
something was off about our story,

283
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,343
if they even detected
the faintest whiff of it,

284
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:22,629
we would all
be dead men.

285
00:19:22,714 --> 00:19:25,215
That sounds familiar,
does it not?

286
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,217
<i> All right.</i>

287
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,470
- I understand.
- Do you?

288
00:19:30,522 --> 00:19:34,307
The men on this ship
face grave danger ahead.

289
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:38,478
So when you sit behind them
grinning like a fucking child,

290
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,481
you can see how
that presents a problem.

291
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:43,483
How it might elicit
the very questions

292
00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:46,703
we came on this fucking trip to
avoid in the fucking first place.

293
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:48,955
I said I understand.

294
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,373
No one's asking questions.

295
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,826
No one knows shit, so
leave me alone about it.

296
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:04,420
That man has the potential
to be a very real problem

297
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:05,805
for the two of us.

298
00:20:09,894 --> 00:20:13,429
The other day, I received
word from one of Max's girls

299
00:20:13,515 --> 00:20:16,849
that Charlotte
had left the island,

300
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:18,851
ran off with a man
in the middle of the night.

301
00:20:18,903 --> 00:20:21,854
So in love, they say,
with a man from Flint's crew,

302
00:20:21,906 --> 00:20:23,573
a man named Logan,

303
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:27,610
that they started a life
together in Providence.

304
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:35,918
What is that?

305
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:38,087
Charlotte's savings.

306
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,792
Charlotte didn't trust
the other girls,

307
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:45,128
didn't trust the turns.

308
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:48,548
So she entrusted it
to me to watch it for her.

309
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,100
She and this man
leave the island

310
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:54,220
on the eve of securing
an unprecedented prize

311
00:20:54,306 --> 00:20:58,191
with no warning,
no witnesses, and no money.

312
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:00,310
I'm sorry,
I'm not following.

313
00:21:00,395 --> 00:21:02,729
Why did you engage
my services, ma'am?

314
00:21:02,781 --> 00:21:05,732
To monitor a brothel madam

315
00:21:05,784 --> 00:21:07,867
intent on stealing
information

316
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:09,736
to use for her benefit.

317
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:12,455
A member of Flint's crew,

318
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,408
with knowledge of the
whereabouts of the Urca gold,

319
00:21:15,493 --> 00:21:17,410
walks into her inn.

320
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:20,913
He promptly disappears under
suspicious circumstances,

321
00:21:20,965 --> 00:21:23,082
and less than a day later,

322
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:27,053
news arrives that the Urca
gold is no longer to be won,

323
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:30,306
but is safely
on its way back to Spain.

324
00:21:34,763 --> 00:21:36,813
You're asking
me to believe

325
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:38,681
that Max somehow
got the information

326
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:40,600
about the Urca
out of this man's head,

327
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:43,903
murdered him and then
one of her own girls,

328
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:47,240
and then somehow managed to convince
Captain Flint and the rest of his crew

329
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:50,326
that the Urca gold
had disappeared?

330
00:21:50,412 --> 00:21:52,028
How the fuck
would she do that?

331
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:54,364
I don't know.

332
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,452
But this morning,
Captain Rackham's ship

333
00:21:59,504 --> 00:22:03,122
emptied the entire contents
of its hold onto the island,

334
00:22:03,174 --> 00:22:05,758
<i>started loading up
with fresh water,</i>

335
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:07,877
<i>preparing to set sail.</i>

336
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:09,796
<i>Wherever he's going,</i>

337
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:12,765
<i>he anticipates bringing
something very large back.</i>

338
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:16,636
I believe Max
learned about the prize.

339
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:18,805
I believe somehow
she managed

340
00:22:18,857 --> 00:22:20,940
to convince the island
it had disappeared.

341
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:24,360
<i>I believe that right now
she and her partners</i>

342
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:26,646
<i>are preparing
to retrieve it</i>

343
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:28,564
<i>and bring it back
to this place.</i>

344
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,952
<i>Were that to happen, the thieves
and their like would flourish here</i>

345
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:36,289
<i>and your plans for this place
would be doomed to failure.</i>

346
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:44,714
I want the Nassau
you are trying to build.

347
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,000
But if that Nassau
is ever to be,

348
00:22:48,052 --> 00:22:50,553
you have to stop her.

349
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:04,817
Captain?

350
00:23:08,356 --> 00:23:10,857
Winds are more favorable
than we anticipated.

351
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:13,359
De Groot wants to tack earlier
through the wind than you suggested.

352
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:16,028
Might take some maneuvering. He'd
prefer not to do it in the dark,

353
00:23:16,114 --> 00:23:17,354
but he thinks
the men are, um...

354
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:21,667
up to it.

355
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:25,788
So, as long as you're in agreement,
he'll make preparations.

356
00:23:25,874 --> 00:23:27,206
Tell him
I'm in agreement.

357
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:29,292
The sooner we get her
home, the better.

358
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:45,024
His name is Billy,
in case you were wondering.

359
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,310
I beg your pardon.

360
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:49,445
He just...

361
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:51,564
seems so
out of place here.

362
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:54,150
Like someone I might have
known back home in London.

363
00:23:54,235 --> 00:23:55,785
He may easily have been.

364
00:23:56,955 --> 00:24:00,072
His parents were
Levelers in Kensington.

365
00:24:00,158 --> 00:24:03,743
Spoke out against
impressment, kidnappings.

366
00:24:03,795 --> 00:24:06,913
Printed pamphlets
from their home.

367
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:09,298
Insisted that Billy
was lettered

368
00:24:09,384 --> 00:24:12,218
so that he could understand
the cause and contribute.

369
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:17,757
That winter, when the press
gangs came through town,

370
00:24:17,842 --> 00:24:21,761
they found Billy distributing
those pamphlets in the street.

371
00:24:21,846 --> 00:24:25,398
I suppose they found
it funny, snatching him

372
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:28,100
and leaving only the pamphlets
for his parents to find.

373
00:24:30,488 --> 00:24:32,071
Did he ever
see them again,

374
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:34,023
his mother and father?

375
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:37,326
When we found Billy,
we freed him,

376
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:39,912
and when given the opportunity
to confront the man

377
00:24:39,948 --> 00:24:42,999
that had taken him
from his family,

378
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:45,284
held him in bondage
for three years

379
00:24:45,336 --> 00:24:48,337
without wages
or reprieve,

380
00:24:48,423 --> 00:24:50,623
he slew that man.

381
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,795
<i>After that, he said he couldn't
face his father again.</i>

382
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:59,465
Didn't think he'd be able to
accept a murderer for a son.

383
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,139
Coming through
the wind again, gents.

384
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:08,357
This one's
gonna be tight.

385
00:25:08,443 --> 00:25:09,976
Watch yourselves, eh?

386
00:25:10,061 --> 00:25:12,812
Tyson, foremast,
Howard, mizzen,

387
00:25:12,864 --> 00:25:15,531
Irving, main.

388
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:43,309
What lies ahead, I'm afraid I
might be wholly unprepared for.

389
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:46,562
I always thought this journey
would end in battle.

390
00:25:46,648 --> 00:25:50,516
A fight to preserve
the things we held dear.

391
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:55,187
I understood that.
I was ready for that.

392
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:57,356
Now, as it turns out,

393
00:25:57,442 --> 00:25:59,775
something else lies
at the end of this road.

394
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,862
Judgment.

395
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:06,032
Not of Nassau,
but of me

396
00:26:06,117 --> 00:26:08,000
and the man
that I've become.

397
00:26:08,036 --> 00:26:10,286
And this entire endeavor

398
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:12,955
hangs in the balance
of that judgment.

399
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:16,008
You can defend that man.

400
00:26:16,044 --> 00:26:18,878
There are good arguments
in defense of him.

401
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,632
For some of his deeds,
perhaps for most of them.

402
00:26:22,717 --> 00:26:25,267
But there are some things
that Captain Flint has done

403
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:27,553
that cannot be defended.

404
00:26:27,605 --> 00:26:30,272
<i>I will make my argument</i>

405
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:33,275
<i>having no sense
of my footing with him.</i>

406
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:36,362
<i>No sense of the things
he knows about me,</i>

407
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:39,532
<i>the lower things.
The darker things.</i>

408
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,236
<i>And the moment he reveals
that he knows these things</i>

409
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:47,073
<i>may be the moment that this
all comes crashing down.</i>

410
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:51,327
He is going
to render judgment.

411
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:55,748
And it all depends on what he
sees standing before him--

412
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,552
Me or my name.

413
00:27:12,016 --> 00:27:13,566
I just want you to know,

414
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:15,317
I appreciate the
opportunity you gave us.

415
00:27:16,904 --> 00:27:20,406
It's all right.
I'm not stupid.

416
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:22,742
Neither is he, honestly.

417
00:27:22,777 --> 00:27:24,860
<i>He's torn up inside.</i>

418
00:27:24,946 --> 00:27:28,114
Betraying the other men,
it's making him act foolish.

419
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:31,200
Like you've seen.

420
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:33,586
That may very well be.

421
00:27:33,621 --> 00:27:35,705
But he won't matter for much if
he gets the three of us killed.

422
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,039
I know.

423
00:27:38,626 --> 00:27:41,010
I know.

424
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:44,130
Sometimes he's just
so fucking stubborn.

425
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:47,933
Always been like that, long
as we've sailed together.

426
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:51,804
It's a goddamn
shame, truly.

427
00:27:51,856 --> 00:27:53,889
I wish it
were otherwise.

428
00:27:53,975 --> 00:27:56,726
Well, if you can think of something to
say to him to get him to fall in line,

429
00:27:56,811 --> 00:27:58,861
now would be a good time.

430
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:02,148
Say to him?

431
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:04,366
Ain't we past that now?

432
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:07,486
Past it?

433
00:28:07,538 --> 00:28:08,821
What you asked me to do,

434
00:28:08,873 --> 00:28:10,990
wasn't the point to solve
the problem for good?

435
00:28:14,912 --> 00:28:16,829
What the hell
are you talking about?

436
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:19,498
Nicholas was scheduled
for duty on the mainmast.

437
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,024
It seemed the perfect chance to
make it look like an accident.

438
00:28:36,234 --> 00:28:37,850
- Clear out!
- Who is it?

439
00:28:37,902 --> 00:28:40,686
Who is it?

440
00:28:48,196 --> 00:28:50,696
What about this?
Ahem.

441
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:54,366
Upon our return, we anchor the
ship off the southern coast.

442
00:28:54,418 --> 00:28:57,203
A team of men excavate
a trench inland.

443
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,424
We leave the bulk of
the coin in the trench,

444
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,210
keep the location secret,

445
00:29:04,262 --> 00:29:07,379
and rotate men in watches
to keep it under guard?

446
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:11,517
Your answer as where to secure
five million pieces of eight

447
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,135
is to dig a hole?

448
00:29:16,307 --> 00:29:18,607
All right,
how about this?

449
00:29:18,693 --> 00:29:21,727
It is astonishing
how much damage

450
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:24,780
a woman can do once you
let her in the door.

451
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,650
Is he talking about you?

452
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:28,901
He's talking
about Miss Bonny.

453
00:29:28,953 --> 00:29:30,286
I'm talking about
Miss Guthrie.

454
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:32,071
We all know what happened
up at that fort.

455
00:29:32,123 --> 00:29:33,789
He lets her in,
she walks off

456
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:36,075
with a prize
worth a fortune,

457
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:37,710
leaving him to swing
in the wind for it.

458
00:29:37,745 --> 00:29:41,330
Right now Charles is either
fighting to preserve his captaincy

459
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:43,575
and looking for any good
argument to win them a fortune,

460
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:47,002
and quickly, or he's dead
and some new captain

461
00:29:47,088 --> 00:29:48,888
is wrestling with
the same question.

462
00:29:48,923 --> 00:29:50,422
What are you saying?

463
00:29:50,474 --> 00:29:53,642
Where does one store
a fortune in gold coins?

464
00:29:53,728 --> 00:29:55,761
In a goddamn fort.

465
00:29:55,813 --> 00:29:59,648
What, you're just gonna walk
up there, knock on the door,

466
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:02,401
and ask whoever answers
if they'll let us use

467
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:04,904
your half-demolished fort
as a treasury?

468
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:10,860
Please go with him
so he doesn't get killed.

469
00:30:10,945 --> 00:30:13,445
Oh, for fuck's sakes.

470
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:21,503
Ma'am.

471
00:30:26,294 --> 00:30:29,795
It's been a day since Mrs. Mapleton
told us of the plot next door.

472
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:31,847
For the past day,
I have watched the crew

473
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:34,099
of the Colonial Dawn
loading supplies.

474
00:30:34,135 --> 00:30:38,103
They are now nearly through and likely
less than a day away from setting sail.

475
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:41,307
I've wanted to give you the
time you needed to deliberate,

476
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:43,642
but now I'm concerned
you may not appreciate

477
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:45,311
how precarious
things will be here

478
00:30:45,396 --> 00:30:47,563
should that gold
reach our shores.

479
00:30:49,734 --> 00:30:52,618
Ma'am, pirates flush with Spanish
gold will be encouraged.

480
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:54,119
They will be empowered.

481
00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:56,038
But what they will never be,
under any circumstances,

482
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:59,792
<i>is partners in a plan
to reconcile with England.</i>

483
00:30:59,827 --> 00:31:02,294
<i>From where I sit,
I think it is clear</i>

484
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,913
that we must act
to prevent--

485
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:05,631
We?

486
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:10,669
I'm fairly certain that you aren't
suggesting that<i> we</i> do anything.

487
00:31:10,755 --> 00:31:12,972
The only way
to truly ensure

488
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:14,590
that the Urca gold
doesn't return here

489
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:17,009
is to eliminate everyone
with the knowledge

490
00:31:17,094 --> 00:31:19,011
of where it is
and how to retrieve it.

491
00:31:21,015 --> 00:31:24,316
You are suggesting that I have
all of these people killed.

492
00:31:24,352 --> 00:31:26,268
Captain Rackham,
his leadership,

493
00:31:26,354 --> 00:31:28,520
any of his men who've
been made aware of it.

494
00:31:31,192 --> 00:31:33,108
Max.

495
00:31:34,612 --> 00:31:36,528
With all due
respect, ma'am,

496
00:31:36,614 --> 00:31:39,198
it's not as if
you haven't done it before.

497
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:45,704
I have done what I have done
to arrive at this point.

498
00:31:45,756 --> 00:31:47,873
I have done what I've done
and I will live with it.

499
00:31:47,925 --> 00:31:50,292
But do not for a moment
believe that that defines me.

500
00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:53,045
<i>I will not be that person.</i>

501
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,157
<i>God rest his soul.</i>

502
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:49,852
Why?

503
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:51,854
I thought you'd made it
clear what I was to do.

504
00:32:51,939 --> 00:32:53,906
How the fuck could
you have thought that?

505
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:55,824
You said he could sink us.

506
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,443
Then you gave me a look.

507
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:02,531
Let me see
if I have this.

508
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:05,084
Flint gives an order, but to
get you men to follow it,

509
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,319
<i>I need to come down here, put on a show,
and convince you it's in your interests.</i>

510
00:33:09,957 --> 00:33:13,258
But I give you a look

511
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:15,294
and you're willing to
murder a man over it?

512
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:19,631
I listen to Flint because you
tell me it's in my interests.

513
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:23,435
I listen to you because I know you
give a shit about my interests

514
00:33:23,471 --> 00:33:25,771
and I ain't the only one
thinks that way.

515
00:33:34,231 --> 00:33:37,149
<i>...be turned into corruption,</i>

516
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:40,369
<i>looking for the
resurrection of the body</i>

517
00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:43,956
<i>,</i>

518
00:33:43,991 --> 00:33:46,408
<i>and the life
of the world to come</i>

519
00:33:46,494 --> 00:33:48,544
<i>through our Lord
Jesus Christ.</i>

520
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:50,412
<i>Amen.</i>

521
00:33:50,498 --> 00:33:52,331
Amen.

522
00:33:56,837 --> 00:34:00,255
<i>We therefore commit
his body to the deep.</i>

523
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:02,724
Nicholas Irving.

524
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,682
<i>From across an ocean,</i>

525
00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:13,402
<i>it is hard to know
what the New World is.</i>

526
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:19,992
<i>All I knew
were the stories I was told</i>

527
00:34:20,027 --> 00:34:23,912
<i>of monsters and valiant men
sworn to slay them.</i>

528
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,167
<i>But now that I've nearly
traversed the ocean</i>

529
00:34:28,202 --> 00:34:30,869
<i>that separates
New World from old,</i>

530
00:34:30,955 --> 00:34:34,339
<i>I fear that the stories
I've heard</i>

531
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:38,210
<i>may have clouded the truth
more than clarified it.</i>

532
00:34:39,597 --> 00:34:43,182
<i>It would seem
these monsters are men--</i>

533
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:46,385
<i>Sons, brothers,</i>

534
00:34:46,437 --> 00:34:48,387
<i>fathers.</i>

535
00:34:51,725 --> 00:34:53,725
<i>And it would
seem these men</i>

536
00:34:53,777 --> 00:34:56,895
<i>fear their own monsters--</i>

537
00:34:58,232 --> 00:35:00,782
<i>An empire...</i>

538
00:35:00,868 --> 00:35:03,035
<i>a navy...</i>

539
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,570
<i>a king.</i>

540
00:35:06,323 --> 00:35:08,240
<i>My father.</i>

541
00:35:14,548 --> 00:35:17,382
<i>So much
I've left behind me--</i>

542
00:35:17,418 --> 00:35:19,835
<i>London, my youth,</i>

543
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,055
<i>and comfortable stories.</i>

544
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,507
<i>So much lies ahead
in Charles Town--</i>

545
00:35:25,593 --> 00:35:29,261
<i>A future
and harder truths.</i>

546
00:35:30,598 --> 00:35:34,900
<i>I feel I must
face it honestly, bravely.</i>

547
00:35:34,935 --> 00:35:39,521
<i>I must face it
as my father's daughter,</i>

548
00:35:39,607 --> 00:35:42,941
<i>and I believe that
in order to do that,</i>

549
00:35:42,993 --> 00:35:46,945
<i>I have to tell these people
that which I've kept from them.</i>

550
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:49,998
<i>I have to tell them
what I know.</i>

551
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,038
I've told you my father
is a reasonable man,

552
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:59,374
and that is true
about most things.

553
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,595
At one point,
he was even reasonable

554
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:06,598
about the issue
of quelling piracy.

555
00:36:06,634 --> 00:36:09,551
Until I received
a letter from him

556
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:11,520
years ago

557
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:14,523
in which he recounted to me
the story of a ship...

558
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:18,310
headed for Charles Town

559
00:36:18,362 --> 00:36:21,063
attacked by pirates.

560
00:36:21,148 --> 00:36:25,150
<i>The ship which was attacked
was named the Maria Aleyne.</i>

561
00:36:30,491 --> 00:36:32,991
<i>The ship was set upon
by Captain Flint and his men.</i>

562
00:36:35,713 --> 00:36:38,497
And in the midst
of the bloody assault,

563
00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:41,550
there was one
particular victim,

564
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:43,835
a very important man

565
00:36:43,921 --> 00:36:45,504
traveling under
an assumed name.

566
00:36:47,141 --> 00:36:50,175
His name
was Alfred Hamilton.

567
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,150
<i>Given the lengths
to which this man had gone</i>

568
00:36:58,185 --> 00:37:00,519
to protect himself,

569
00:37:00,571 --> 00:37:04,156
the fact that he fell under
Captain Flint's sword...

570
00:37:05,993 --> 00:37:08,160
suggested
he'd been hunted,

571
00:37:08,195 --> 00:37:11,747
<i>pursued, and then
executed in cold blood</i>

572
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:14,032
<i>and with great
malice aforethought.</i>

573
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,341
<i>The motive unclear,</i>

574
00:37:22,376 --> 00:37:26,845
<i>but the intent apparently
dark and awful,</i>

575
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,715
<i>monstrous.</i>

576
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,852
<i>He said the act was completely
incompatible with civilized society.</i>

577
00:37:33,887 --> 00:37:36,438
<i>That he would dedicate
his life to eradicating it.</i>

578
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:41,443
And that there would be law
in the Americas...

579
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:46,281
the day Captain Flint
swung over Charles Town.

580
00:37:48,152 --> 00:37:51,737
I appreciate
what you've done for me.

581
00:37:51,822 --> 00:37:54,072
I respect what you hope
to accomplish,

582
00:37:54,158 --> 00:37:56,158
so I ask you,

583
00:37:56,243 --> 00:37:58,960
when you return me
to Charles Town,

584
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:02,331
turn around
and sail away.

585
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:26,271
Do you think those patrol
ships have clearance to fire?

586
00:38:26,357 --> 00:38:29,741
Not while we're out
of range of that fort.

587
00:38:29,777 --> 00:38:32,944
As long as we don't come any
further, they know we're no threat.

588
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:38,617
I don't want to see a single
one of our gun ports open.

589
00:38:38,669 --> 00:38:42,120
I don't want to see a single man
on deck with a weapon in his hand.

590
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:43,922
This only works
if we can make it clear

591
00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:48,176
that we have absolutely no intention
of shooting at anyone today.

592
00:38:48,262 --> 00:38:50,128
What if they
start shooting at us?

593
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,381
Duck.

594
00:38:55,135 --> 00:38:56,718
<i>Prepare to drop anchor!</i>

595
00:39:00,474 --> 00:39:01,807
I've made arrangements.

596
00:39:01,892 --> 00:39:03,252
You'll be safe here
until I return.

597
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:05,117
What are you talking about?
I'm going with you.

598
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:07,062
You heard what she said.
It's too dangerous.

599
00:39:07,147 --> 00:39:10,148
If I'm standing next to you, he's far more
likely to see you as the man you were.

600
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,317
He's more likely
to see you as a woman

601
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:14,903
abetting a known pirate
and hang you alongside me.

602
00:39:14,988 --> 00:39:17,239
- I see no reason for you to take that risk.
- Of course there is reason.

603
00:39:17,324 --> 00:39:19,364
- None that I am willing to take.
- It was my fault.

604
00:39:21,378 --> 00:39:24,830
I'm the one who learned Alfred
Hamilton was a passenger on that ship.

605
00:39:24,915 --> 00:39:28,166
I knew the moment I told you
what it would drive you to do.

606
00:39:28,218 --> 00:39:30,218
I knew the danger
it would put you in,

607
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,837
knew the horrors
it would incite.

608
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:35,424
I told myself to remain
silent and spare him,

609
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:39,394
spare you those horrors,

610
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,063
and yet I told you anyway.

611
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:45,233
If you're going to face
judgment behind those walls,

612
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:46,852
then so should I,

613
00:39:46,904 --> 00:39:49,938
for if anyone is responsible
for what happened that day,

614
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:51,323
it's me.

615
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,743
<i>Captain Vane!</i>

616
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:11,209
Captain Vane!

617
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:18,300
Are you Captain Vane?

618
00:40:18,385 --> 00:40:22,220
<i>We received your letter
and your demands.</i>

619
00:40:22,306 --> 00:40:25,140
We are prepared to pay
the sum you requested

620
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:27,225
for Abigail Ashe.

621
00:40:27,277 --> 00:40:29,895
I am not Charles Vane.

622
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,063
I have no demands.

623
00:40:32,149 --> 00:40:35,734
But I do have a request.

624
00:41:18,495 --> 00:41:20,529
Captain James Flint.

625
00:41:25,586 --> 00:41:27,118
You're Captain Flint?

626
00:41:29,122 --> 00:41:30,422
I am.

627
00:41:30,457 --> 00:41:33,458
And you wish an audience
with Lord Ashe?

628
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:36,962
I do.

629
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,133
This was a different place
before the governor arrived.

630
00:41:42,185 --> 00:41:44,719
Raiders routinely
hit our shipping.

631
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:47,105
All up and down
the coast

632
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,607
as far north
as Mt. Pleasant,

633
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:50,976
as far south as
the Cumberland Sound.

634
00:41:51,028 --> 00:41:53,778
It took him a short while to
learn how to deal with it.

635
00:41:53,814 --> 00:41:57,032
<i>But once he committed to fighting
the problem, things changed.</i>

636
00:41:57,117 --> 00:42:00,118
<i>You see, he made these
people unafraid.</i>

637
00:42:00,153 --> 00:42:03,622
<i>Everyone realized, like just about
anything else in this life...</i>

638
00:42:05,075 --> 00:42:07,325
the moment
you stop fearing it,

639
00:42:07,377 --> 00:42:09,160
it loses all its power.

640
00:42:11,548 --> 00:42:13,381
No!

641
00:42:13,467 --> 00:42:15,000
<i>The governor is a friend!</i>

642
00:42:15,052 --> 00:42:16,835
<i>The governor gave
very specific instructions.</i>

643
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:20,171
- No, don't!
- If we were able to get our hands on Captain Vane,

644
00:42:20,257 --> 00:42:21,673
he never leaves
this place again.

645
00:42:21,725 --> 00:42:24,009
Stop.

646
00:42:24,061 --> 00:42:27,178
<i> I don't see any reason those
instructions don't apply to you, too.</i>

647
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,930
- <i> If anything--</i>
- Stop!

648
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,685
They're telling the truth.

649
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,320
He's an old friend
of my father's.

650
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:37,489
<i>I remember him.
I know him.</i>

651
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:42,577
And if you strike him again,
my father will know

652
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:45,447
you did so after I made
this clear to you.

653
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:14,953
Welcome to Charles Town.

654
00:44:21,461 --> 00:44:25,296
Charles Vane corralled 40 of the
hardest men in the New World,

655
00:44:25,348 --> 00:44:28,717
brought them in line, brought
them across an ocean to this fort

656
00:44:28,802 --> 00:44:31,352
and conquered it

657
00:44:31,438 --> 00:44:33,972
with no support
from the water,

658
00:44:34,024 --> 00:44:36,608
no siege engineering,
just the will to take it,

659
00:44:36,643 --> 00:44:38,643
and throughout
all that time,

660
00:44:38,729 --> 00:44:40,945
through danger
and peril and blood,

661
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:43,198
the greatest
threat he faced,

662
00:44:43,283 --> 00:44:45,817
the one enemy who may ultimately
have been his undoing,

663
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:49,654
was, you know, someone
I once heard him

664
00:44:49,706 --> 00:44:51,656
refer to as Lady Honeypot.

665
00:44:53,994 --> 00:44:57,162
Beware the women, Mr. Featherstone.
They bite.

666
00:44:57,214 --> 00:44:59,497
I'm in love
with a good woman, sir.

667
00:44:59,549 --> 00:45:00,832
I'm not concerned.

668
00:45:02,502 --> 00:45:03,885
Idelle?

669
00:45:06,006 --> 00:45:07,172
Yes.

670
00:45:13,897 --> 00:45:16,598
It stands to reason
that if those 40 men

671
00:45:16,683 --> 00:45:20,185
were mean enough to take this
fort under Vane's leadership,

672
00:45:20,237 --> 00:45:22,020
were they
to ever turn on him,

673
00:45:22,072 --> 00:45:24,239
it would be
an ugly sight.

674
00:45:24,324 --> 00:45:28,326
May I suggest that whatever is going
on in the bowels of this fort,

675
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:30,862
perhaps it's best
left alone for now.

676
00:45:30,947 --> 00:45:33,364
Perhaps.

677
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,010
- What are you doing?
- I'm wondering why it's so quiet in there.

678
00:45:36,036 --> 00:45:39,037
Because they're occupied
plotting some sort of awfulness.

679
00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:42,290
That is one possibility. The other
is that they're no longer in there.

680
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:44,209
What are you talking about?
Their ship is still in the bay.

681
00:45:44,294 --> 00:45:46,761
It is, but I'm less intrigued
by what's in the bay

682
00:45:46,847 --> 00:45:48,596
than what's up there.

683
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,130
This was found
pinned onto him.

684
00:47:52,806 --> 00:47:54,589
<i>I was once a slave.</i>

685
00:47:54,674 --> 00:47:57,675
<i>I know too well the pain of
the yoke on my shoulders</i>

686
00:47:57,727 --> 00:48:01,012
<i>and of the freedom
of having cast it off.</i>

687
00:48:01,064 --> 00:48:03,932
<i>So I'm resolved,
I will be no slave again.</i>

688
00:48:05,685 --> 00:48:09,938
<i>And as I am free, I hereby
claim the same for Nassau.</i>

689
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:11,572
<i>She is free today,</i>

690
00:48:11,658 --> 00:48:15,526
<i>and so long as I draw breath,
she shall remain free.</i>

691
00:48:17,197 --> 00:48:18,997
<i>Richard Guthrie
was engaged in an effort</i>

692
00:48:19,032 --> 00:48:21,616
<i>to see her return
to the rule of a king,</i>

693
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:23,701
<i>to see the yoke returned.</i>

694
00:48:23,787 --> 00:48:26,788
<i>He betrayed Nassau,
and thus,</i>

695
00:48:26,873 --> 00:48:29,290
<i>as always,
to traitors.</i>

696
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:32,794
<i>As far as you and I,
I was warned about you,</i>

697
00:48:32,879 --> 00:48:35,380
<i>warned you would
betray me.</i>

698
00:48:35,432 --> 00:48:37,382
<i>I'd hoped
you and I shared a love</i>

699
00:48:37,467 --> 00:48:39,384
<i>to make such a thing
unthinkable.</i>

700
00:48:39,436 --> 00:48:42,103
<i>I'd hoped those warnings
were wrong.</i>

701
00:48:42,188 --> 00:48:44,439
<i>But I know you too well,</i>

702
00:48:44,524 --> 00:48:48,142
<i>so I prepared
in case they were right.</i>

703
00:48:52,032 --> 00:48:54,532
<i>You removed the girl
from my possession,</i>

704
00:48:54,567 --> 00:48:57,068
<i>but in turn,
the man-of-war</i>

705
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,903
<i>moved on from the bay,</i>

706
00:48:58,989 --> 00:49:03,708
<i>moved on from a position
of heightened security.</i>

707
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,960
<i>Moved on to a place
where its attention,</i>

708
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:08,079
<i>Captain Flint's attention,</i>

709
00:49:08,131 --> 00:49:11,049
<i>will be so very occupied</i>

710
00:49:11,084 --> 00:49:13,418
<i>on the danger
that is Charles Town</i>

711
00:49:13,503 --> 00:49:15,503
<i>and in the state
of apprehension</i>

712
00:49:15,588 --> 00:49:19,257
<i>in which the last thing
any of them will be watching</i>

713
00:49:19,842 --> 00:49:21,559
<i>is the water.</i>

714
00:49:23,646 --> 00:49:26,597
<i>I made clear
the price for the girl.</i>

715
00:49:26,649 --> 00:49:29,434
<i>You should have known me
well enough to know,</i>

716
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:32,487
<i>one way or another,
I was going to claim it.</i>

717
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,859
<i>And once I do,
I'll be returning to Nassau</i>

718
00:49:37,944 --> 00:49:40,695
<i>to settle the rest
of my accounts.</i>

719

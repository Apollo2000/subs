(Men shouting)

5
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:24,656
Are you certain this is wise, sir?

6
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,545
Stories I hear about the
raiders in these waters,

7
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:32,213
their brutality...

8
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:34,999
Cui bono, Mr. Fogg.

9
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,001
These men profit nothing from blood.

10
00:01:37,003 --> 00:01:39,504
They profit from cargo.
And they profit most

11
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:42,223
when that cargo is
least costly to win.

12
00:01:42,225 --> 00:01:45,009
Those stories you've heard...

13
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:46,728
tools of the trade,

14
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,230
self-applied
by the pirates themselves,

15
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:51,900
intended to separate us
from our cargo

16
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:54,068
by surrender rather than sword.

17
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,572
These are men, Mr. Fogg,
not monsters.

18
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:03,278
If we behave rationally and civilly,

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,029
so will they.

20
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:25,016
(Men yelling)

21
00:02:25,018 --> 00:02:27,218
MAN:
Down to the well, move!

22
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,636
The ship is yours, sir.

23
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:30,888
Our manifest.

24
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,724
Everything that would be
of value to you

25
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:35,026
is accounted for, and its
location in the hold.

26
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:39,113
Eight barrels, marked "JP,"

27
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:42,033
forward hold, port side.
Mr. Neustadt, step to it.

28
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:44,068
Pardon me, Captain.
May I ask,

29
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,955
are you one of the pirates that
calls the port of Nassau home?

30
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,656
MEEKS:
Three barrels, tea...

31
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:50,825
I'm a recent arrival to Nassau.

32
00:02:50,827 --> 00:02:55,079
I only ask inasmuch as it's become
something of a fascination of mine.

33
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:57,131
They say the reality of the place

34
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,083
is far more interesting
than the myth.

35
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:02,253
The business there is so
efficient, so enlightened,

36
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:06,007
that all trade is managed
by a teenaged girl.

37
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:07,892
Tell me, is that true?

38
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:14,565
What is it?

39
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:19,771
Ashe.

40
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:22,073
As in Lord Ashe.

41
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,113
Then let's get on with it.

42
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:40,041
(Whistles)
Everyone up!

43
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:56,641
Oh, no, please.

44
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:05,149
Go ahead!

45
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,992
- MAN: Mercy! Merc...
- (Gunshots)

46
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:23,584
I'd like to thank you for the
orderly surrender of your ship.

47
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:26,554
It's truly amazing to me how
many men in your position

48
00:04:26,556 --> 00:04:28,056
lack the sense to do the same.

49
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:32,143
Ordinarily I would
return the courtesy,

50
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:35,730
relieve you of your cargo
and be on my way.

51
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:37,565
But your ship is about
to yield a prize

52
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:41,152
of far, far greater value
than our wildest expectation,

53
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:44,105
a far greater prize

54
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:47,825
for which I'd rather not
leave witnesses to the taking.

55
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:50,495
Please, please, sir.
I have a wife and a son.

56
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:52,580
- (Gunshot)
- (Body thuds)

57
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:01,089
(Men barking orders)

58
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,800
Hell of a prize, Mr. Meeks.

59
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:15,720
Hell of a prize.

60
00:05:55,195 --> 00:05:57,829
(Theme music playing)

61
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:32,773
SILVER:
Captain.

62
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:42,583
Captain.

63
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:51,876
Captain, before we're seen...

64
00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:55,680
Don't call him that.

65
00:07:58,134 --> 00:07:59,600
Well?

66
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:03,104
Well what?

67
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:07,141
The crimes you've committed
against your crew are undisputed.

68
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:10,061
The only reason the sentence
hasn't been carried out

69
00:08:10,063 --> 00:08:12,396
is that I've been delaying the vote

70
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:15,700
in hopes that you might help me
find a way to get that gold,

71
00:08:15,702 --> 00:08:18,819
or as much of it as
possible, off that beach.

72
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:22,623
Why would I do that?

73
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,125
Because if you do,

74
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:27,578
I'll personally guarantee
your sentences are commuted.

75
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:31,832
You'll guarantee that, will you?

76
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:34,752
You underestimate
your men yet again.

77
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,671
They will hear reason,

78
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:39,757
especially when it comes
from a voice they can trust.

79
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,844
The men feel they're entitled
to leave this ordeal

80
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:46,013
- with something to show for...
- Fuck those men.

81
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:50,985
Fuck them for their shortsightedness.

82
00:08:50,987 --> 00:08:53,237
Fuck them for their ingratitude.

83
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:56,157
And fuck them for siding
with a cowardly,

84
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,693
sniveling shit of a mutineer.

85
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:01,996
There are over 100
soldiers on that beach,

86
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:04,999
sworn upon their lives
to protect that gold.

87
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:07,168
In a matter of hours,

88
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,620
they'll dispatch teams
to search for threats.

89
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:11,505
In a matter of days,

90
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:14,792
they'll locate our wreck
and our camp,

91
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:19,764
and they will kill every
last member of your crew.

92
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:22,850
And they'll deserve it,

93
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:24,969
none more so than you.

94
00:09:31,644 --> 00:09:34,645
Bring them back.

95
00:09:34,647 --> 00:09:36,981
We'll ready the nooses.

96
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,496
Wait.

97
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:01,839
The Urca's gold is secure.

98
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:03,808
A full complement of soldiers,

99
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,728
reinforced batteries...
18-pounders, all of them...

100
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,680
and men who know how to use them.

101
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:13,017
There's no way of approaching
that beach from the land.

102
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,902
Why the fuck are we
listening to him?

103
00:10:14,904 --> 00:10:16,320
- (Men shouting)
- Yeah, why?

104
00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:18,155
We should be cutting
your goddamn tongue out

105
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:20,024
for all the lies you've told us.

106
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:21,909
Gentlemen!

107
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:25,029
No one is angrier about
Mr. Flint's crimes than I.

108
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:26,747
Which is why you must trust me

109
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:29,033
when I ask you to hear
what he has to say.

110
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:34,205
And even if it weren't
for the soldiers,

111
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:36,757
even if it weren't for the guns,

112
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:40,127
there's a fucking warship watching
over every inch of the bay...

113
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:44,181
a fucking warship that has
already killed half your number,

114
00:10:44,183 --> 00:10:47,218
a fucking warship that
would prevent any approach

115
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,020
to that beach via the sea.

116
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:53,224
There's simply no way
of stealing that gold.

117
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:58,612
But there might be something
else you can steal.

118
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:03,067
The fucking warship.

119
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:05,820
(Man chuckles)

120
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:07,071
What?

121
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:12,159
Too many soldiers
on the beach, which means

122
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:14,962
that the watch on the ship is spare.

123
00:11:14,964 --> 00:11:17,882
Two men approach quietly,

124
00:11:17,884 --> 00:11:20,134
evade a handful of sentries

125
00:11:20,136 --> 00:11:23,087
and eliminate the watch
on the mainmast.

126
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:24,805
Now at this point,

127
00:11:24,807 --> 00:11:27,057
while the sun is failing

128
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:29,059
but before the night watch arrives,

129
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:31,228
an assault could be made.

130
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:35,566
That ship

131
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:37,768
is your only means of escape.

132
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,271
And that ship is your only means

133
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:42,656
of taking anything of value

134
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:44,942
out of this ordeal.

135
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:47,077
And once it is in your possession...

136
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,946
- Enough of this.
- Once that ship is in your possession...

137
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:50,948
- Do none of you remember his crimes?
- Mr. De Groot!

138
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,034
Once that ship is in your
possession, you will be invincible!

139
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,964
Now the risk

140
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:09,934
falls almost entirely
on the first two men out.

141
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:13,804
I would volunteer

142
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:15,773
in exchange for your pardon.

143
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:19,109
That leaves one man to go.

144
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:24,698
One volunteer...

145
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,033
I'll do it.

146
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:32,957
I'll... I'll go.

147
00:12:37,914 --> 00:12:39,997
(Sighs)

148
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:42,833
DUFRESNE: Then let's put
Mr. Flint's plan to a vote.

149
00:12:42,835 --> 00:12:44,218
All in favor?

150
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:52,226
MEN:
Aye! Aye! Aye!

151
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:54,011
- (Tower bells ringing)
- (Gavel banging)

152
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:55,846
MAN:
The ayes have it.

153
00:12:55,847 --> 00:13:00,068
__

154
00:13:04,406 --> 00:13:06,406
Whoa.

155
00:13:19,888 --> 00:13:22,005
Lord Thomas Hamilton?

156
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:24,557
Ah.

157
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,559
Are you the liaison
sent by the Admiralty?

158
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,763
I am, my lord.

159
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:33,016
They say it started with
a man named Henry Avery.

160
00:13:33,018 --> 00:13:36,019
Sailed into the port of Nassau,

161
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:38,855
bribed the colonial governor
to look past his sins,

162
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:40,990
encamped his crew upon the beach,

163
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:44,494
and thus began the pirate issue
on New Providence Island.

164
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:47,330
Where and when will it all end?

165
00:13:47,332 --> 00:13:50,366
I suppose that's where you
and I come into the story.

166
00:13:50,368 --> 00:13:53,002
As I'm sure you're aware, my
father the earl holds great sway

167
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:54,704
amongst his peers in Whitehall.

168
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:57,540
He has asked for the assistance
of Her Majesty's Navy

169
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:00,543
in pacifying the island
to which he holds title.

170
00:14:00,545 --> 00:14:02,512
He was assured that this
request would be considered

171
00:14:02,514 --> 00:14:05,098
- a matter of the utmost importance.
- Undoubtedly, my lord.

172
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,052
Then perhaps you can tell me
why they decided to send you.

173
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:10,687
Beg pardon, my lord?

174
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,725
A number of your superiors are
former schoolmates of mine.

175
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:18,695
I canvassed them
about your reputation...

176
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:20,814
the son of a carpenter,

177
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:22,565
no record of any formal schooling,

178
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:26,953
and yet more literate than any
three boys I knew at Eton.

179
00:14:26,955 --> 00:14:29,239
You are a rising star

180
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:31,458
with a bright future
in the Admiralty.

181
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,959
You can understand my concern.

182
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:34,961
Not really.

183
00:14:34,963 --> 00:14:36,746
Perhaps my lack of
education is showing.

184
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:42,418
I intend to accomplish
something here, Lieutenant.

185
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,256
I intend to save Nassau
before she's lost forever.

186
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:48,258
And I cannot do that with a partner

187
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,310
who might be more concerned
about advancing his career

188
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:52,929
than he is about realizing this goal.

189
00:14:57,736 --> 00:14:59,986
- You want to save Nassau, my lord?
- Very much so.

190
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:03,773
Then perhaps my job is to make certain
you know what you're getting into.

191
00:15:38,777 --> 00:15:41,394
(Woman moaning loudly)

192
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:45,815
(Man grunting)

193
00:15:45,817 --> 00:15:48,735
(Both sigh)

194
00:15:48,737 --> 00:15:50,954
You can go in now.

195
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:11,758
I'll go get us some rum.

196
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:16,679
Where the fuck were you today?

197
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:19,732
Here.

198
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:21,985
You wanted to be a partner to
the consortium, did you not?

199
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:24,320
You wanted to take Hornigold's
seat at the table?

200
00:16:24,322 --> 00:16:26,656
Then that means you assume
Hornigold's responsibilities,

201
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:28,908
first among them... turning
up for the fucking meetings.

202
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,527
Is this really what
you came up here for...

203
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:33,746
scold me for truancy?

204
00:16:33,748 --> 00:16:35,615
This morning somebody
killed two watchmen

205
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:38,668
and stole 500 pounds' worth
of cargo from the warehouse.

206
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,953
Sorry to hear that.

207
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:42,255
Don't be sorry.
Do your fucking job.

208
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:44,674
And what job is that exactly?

209
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:47,710
Hornigold provided security for
the consortium's operations.

210
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:51,347
And you'd like me to fill
that role for you now?

211
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:54,183
If your friends aren't capable
of protecting themselves,

212
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:56,953
then I argue they aren't
worth protecting.

213
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:58,955
What the fuck
are you talking about?

214
00:16:58,957 --> 00:17:01,458
You were the one who decided you
wanted to be a part of this.

215
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,293
To protect the bay.

216
00:17:03,295 --> 00:17:05,345
But to play the role of constable

217
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:09,299
for the benefit of Captains
Naft and Lawrence?

218
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:11,718
Your problem isn't with me.

219
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,805
Your problem... you need
stronger partners.

220
00:17:14,807 --> 00:17:16,973
I had stronger partners, you shit.

221
00:17:16,975 --> 00:17:18,775
What are you doing
down there, Eleanor?

222
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:21,311
Corporate charters?
Mandatory meetings?

223
00:17:21,313 --> 00:17:22,779
The woman who stole ship and
crew out from underneath me

224
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:24,948
has no appetite for any of that.

225
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,867
I think that's why you're
so frustrated with me...

226
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,286
because you know all this,
because you know I know this,

227
00:17:29,288 --> 00:17:31,822
and because you know
you are so much more like me

228
00:17:31,824 --> 00:17:33,651
than anyone you've ever met
in your entire life.

229
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:36,460
Jesus Christ, enough. Stop telling me
what it is you think I think.

230
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:38,829
You sound fucking ridiculous.

231
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:40,831
Do you know what it is I want?

232
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,333
I want to figure out a way of
selling everyone's shit here

233
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:45,552
for more tomorrow
than I did yesterday.

234
00:17:45,554 --> 00:17:48,338
I want to establish a future here
that isn't measured in months.

235
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,309
And I want you to show up for a
meeting when you're fucking told.

236
00:17:52,311 --> 00:17:54,511
- Can't leave yet.
- Watch me.

237
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:56,646
You haven't asked me
the question yet.

238
00:17:56,648 --> 00:17:59,015
You haven't asked me if
I'm gonna let him in...

239
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:01,518
Flint.

240
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,489
Am I going to permit him to enter
the bay with his Spanish treasure?

241
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:08,525
Assuming, that is,
he returns with it at all.

242
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,667
Be very careful, Charles,

243
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:20,003
because at a certain point

244
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:22,956
I will remove you from this place,
no matter what the consequences.

245
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,592
You'd do that? For him?

246
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,797
How is it you see such a partner
in him and such a villain in me?

247
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,299
He wants what I want.

248
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:34,351
Are you quite certain about that?

249
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:37,020
Let's put it to a test.

250
00:18:37,022 --> 00:18:39,890
Let's say I do separate
Flint from his gold

251
00:18:39,892 --> 00:18:41,358
when he returns.

252
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,978
And let's say you and I split it.

253
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:47,814
What?

254
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:50,283
Mm, see?

255
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:52,235
Not so easy.

256
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:54,738
Think about it... I kill Flint,

257
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,957
give you half a fortune,
and then no more Naft,

258
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:58,959
no more Lawrence,
no more compromises.

259
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:01,328
You could do whatever you like.

260
00:19:02,631 --> 00:19:04,714
We could do whatever we like.

261
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:08,635
How important is Flint to you now?

262
00:19:11,924 --> 00:19:14,341
Fuck you.

263
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:16,309
Fuck you, too.

264
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:26,319
Once the mainmast watch
has been eliminated,

265
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:27,854
hoist your signal.

266
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:29,823
If there is no signal
before the reinforcements

267
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:31,608
for the night's watch
depart the beach,

268
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,945
I'll assume failure and begin
our escape down the coast.

269
00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:38,331
What if the signal is in time?

270
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,584
Then we'll launch our assault.

271
00:19:42,621 --> 00:19:46,339
There is something about which
I want to be very clear...

272
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:48,291
even in success

273
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:51,294
you will be expelled from the crew,

274
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:52,762
cast out.

275
00:19:55,551 --> 00:19:57,717
Are we understood?

276
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:23,493
You shit.

277
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:26,963
Um, beg pardon?

278
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:29,716
I needed a fighter,

279
00:20:29,718 --> 00:20:33,503
someone I could count on to
make a difference on that ship.

280
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:35,505
What the fuck were you doing
volunteering?

281
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:39,092
I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.

282
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:42,062
Why wouldn't I volunteer?
If we're to try and...

283
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:45,849
Hang on.

284
00:20:45,851 --> 00:20:48,018
You're serious
about taking the ship?

285
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,653
What the fuck did you think?

286
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:51,438
I thought this was how
you intended to escape.

287
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,523
(Sighs)

288
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:56,359
Sure, it would be a few days of
walking or so to St. Augustine,

289
00:20:56,361 --> 00:20:58,028
but at least we'd have a chance.

290
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:03,533
You really mean to board that ship.
Jesus Christ.

291
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:05,702
I'm not doing it.

292
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:07,370
I don't need to return to Nassau.

293
00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:10,373
I am happy to find some
other place to survive.

294
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,676
St. Augustine is that way.

295
00:21:16,381 --> 00:21:18,431
It's at least a week on foot,

296
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:21,768
Tequesta tribes in between.

297
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,387
I doubt you'll survive
to see sunrise tomorrow.

298
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:28,608
How are you even gonna get
out there with one arm?

299
00:22:04,846 --> 00:22:08,315
HAMILTON: What is this exercise
intended to prove, Lieutenant?

300
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:10,600
FLINT: You want to understand
why piracy flourishes

301
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:12,018
in the West Indies.

302
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,321
I'm about to show you.

303
00:22:14,323 --> 00:22:16,606
- (Crowd shouting)
- Have you seen one of these before?

304
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:18,108
I'm afraid I haven't, no.

305
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,693
Who is he?

306
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:21,328
Davey someone-or-other.

307
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,030
High seas piracy, treason,
so on and so forth,

308
00:22:24,032 --> 00:22:26,032
same as the last, same as the next.

309
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:28,585
He's being asked
if he wants to confess,

310
00:22:28,587 --> 00:22:31,921
beg forgiveness in the eyes
of God and Queen Anne.

311
00:22:31,923 --> 00:22:34,874
- Suck my cock!
- (Crowd shouting)

312
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:36,343
I assume that was a "no."

313
00:22:38,096 --> 00:22:40,296
So this is the lesson...

314
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:42,966
the pirates of New Providence Island

315
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:45,301
are incorrigible,
dedicated to mayhem.

316
00:22:45,303 --> 00:22:48,638
To attempt to address this subject
is doomed to defeat from the outset.

317
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,974
It's not him I wanted you to see.

318
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:55,528
- (Crowd cheering)
- MAN: No mercy!

319
00:22:58,066 --> 00:23:00,450
Go all the way to hell!

320
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:02,369
It's them.

321
00:23:03,622 --> 00:23:06,456
Civilization needs its monsters.

322
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,042
You think Whitehall wants piracy
to flourish in the Bahamas?

323
00:23:09,044 --> 00:23:11,294
No, I don't think they want
it, but I think they're aware

324
00:23:11,296 --> 00:23:13,997
of the cost associated
with trying to fight it.

325
00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:16,416
And I think that that sound

326
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:19,386
travels.

327
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:22,422
You're an educated man, my lord,
but I think it worth reminding you

328
00:23:22,424 --> 00:23:25,091
that in most cases a man trying
to change the world fails

329
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:28,511
for one simple
and unavoidable reason...

330
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:30,013
everyone else.

331
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:09,051
Do as I say when I say,

332
00:24:09,053 --> 00:24:11,303
or I'll kill you myself.

333
00:24:47,508 --> 00:24:49,424
Well, that was easy.

334
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:09,361
(Flies buzzing)

335
00:25:09,363 --> 00:25:11,864
(Donkey braying)

336
00:25:17,788 --> 00:25:20,873
- (Knocks on door)
- MAN: Hurry up!

337
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:23,292
(Quietly) I will fucking kill you.
Shut up.

338
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:28,463
(Knocks on door)

339
00:25:28,465 --> 00:25:30,465
For crying out loud!

340
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,887
10 minutes I've been waiting.

341
00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:36,939
A moment's peace, my friend.

342
00:25:36,941 --> 00:25:39,308
Surely you can empathize.

343
00:25:45,866 --> 00:25:48,367
Jack Rackham.

344
00:25:49,987 --> 00:25:51,987
The crew killer.

345
00:26:11,342 --> 00:26:14,843
That's right.

346
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:40,786
Jesus.

347
00:26:40,788 --> 00:26:42,537
What happened?

348
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,373
Same as yesterday,

349
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:46,458
though it would appear
things have escalated.

350
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:51,130
When I came here, I had nothing

351
00:26:51,132 --> 00:26:53,349
but my name and my wits.

352
00:26:53,351 --> 00:26:55,351
A man in a place like this

353
00:26:55,353 --> 00:26:58,053
surviving on those
two things alone...

354
00:26:58,055 --> 00:27:00,055
he suffers indignities,

355
00:27:00,057 --> 00:27:03,058
slights, ridicule.

356
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,977
But I overcame it.

357
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:07,029
I used the wits to build the name.

358
00:27:07,031 --> 00:27:10,483
I became quartermaster to a crew

359
00:27:10,485 --> 00:27:12,401
that struck fear into the hearts

360
00:27:12,403 --> 00:27:15,488
of many, many men.

361
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,573
Jesus Christ,

362
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:19,742
what's become of my name?

363
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,130
(Sniffs)

364
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:26,165
They pissed on me.

365
00:27:29,137 --> 00:27:30,970
Tell me who did this.

366
00:27:30,972 --> 00:27:33,139
(Laughs)

367
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:35,591
So you can murder them all?

368
00:27:35,593 --> 00:27:37,593
What a wonderful idea.
Why didn't I think of that?

369
00:27:37,595 --> 00:27:39,512
Tell me, though,
how many men do you think

370
00:27:39,514 --> 00:27:42,431
you can safely lure into the
wrecks to their deaths?

371
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:44,600
Unfortunately, I'm afraid
eight won't cut it,

372
00:27:44,602 --> 00:27:47,903
as I am pariah to just about
every able-bodied man

373
00:27:47,905 --> 00:27:50,606
on this fucking island!

374
00:27:57,248 --> 00:27:59,114
They pissed on me.

375
00:28:21,522 --> 00:28:24,473
I will send someone
upstairs to tend to him.

376
00:28:24,475 --> 00:28:26,642
He is angry, but this will pass.

377
00:28:26,644 --> 00:28:28,611
Stay the fuck away from me.

378
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:40,015
(Muffled cry)

379
00:29:59,737 --> 00:30:01,987
- Wait.
- You almost got us killed.

380
00:30:01,989 --> 00:30:05,157
- Almost. Almost.
- For a fucking bauble.

381
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:06,742
It's a boatswain's whistle.

382
00:30:06,744 --> 00:30:08,911
Look.

383
00:30:08,913 --> 00:30:11,246
Doesn't it make more sense for us
to prompt the lookout to come down,

384
00:30:11,248 --> 00:30:14,833
than for us to go
up there after him?

385
00:30:14,835 --> 00:30:16,919
You are truly amazing,
you know that?

386
00:30:16,921 --> 00:30:19,638
We're both better off now
than we were two minutes ago,

387
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,591
yet you're angry about it because
it didn't happen your way.

388
00:30:22,593 --> 00:30:25,010
Might you consider
for a fucking moment

389
00:30:25,012 --> 00:30:28,230
that your distrust of me
is completely unwarranted?

390
00:30:28,232 --> 00:30:31,183
I warned you about Billy.
Was I right?

391
00:30:31,185 --> 00:30:33,152
I found you over Mr. Gates's body,

392
00:30:33,154 --> 00:30:36,071
and did I do anything
but defend you?

393
00:30:36,073 --> 00:30:38,691
When you were sinking
to the bottom of the sea,

394
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:41,193
who do you imagine it was who
dragged you onto that beach?

395
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,580
Brace yourself,

396
00:30:44,582 --> 00:30:47,616
but I'm the only person within
a hundred miles of here

397
00:30:47,618 --> 00:30:50,098
- who doesn't want to see you dead.
- (Men speaking Spanish)

398
00:31:05,186 --> 00:31:06,802
(Thuds)

399
00:31:16,814 --> 00:31:18,781
(Blows whistle)

400
00:32:53,077 --> 00:32:55,711
But this is the rate I can
offer you for this material.

401
00:32:55,713 --> 00:32:58,297
If it's unsatisfactory,
feel free to go elsewhere.

402
00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:02,084
This is absurd. There's absolutely
nothing wrong with the cargo itself.

403
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:03,802
What's going on here?

404
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:06,922
Ma'am, these goods were
presented for consignment,

405
00:33:06,924 --> 00:33:09,258
but your man here refuses
to pay full freight for it,

406
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,926
owing to the condition
of the barrels they're in.

407
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:12,811
Put up a fight, did they?

408
00:33:12,813 --> 00:33:15,764
Once we were on board, the crew
turned, gave us no choice.

409
00:33:15,766 --> 00:33:17,566
There was no malice in it.

410
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,101
Mister...

411
00:33:19,103 --> 00:33:21,270
Meeks, ma'am. Quartermaster
of the Fancy.

412
00:33:21,272 --> 00:33:24,823
Mr. Meeks, do you have
any idea what happens

413
00:33:24,825 --> 00:33:27,826
when a marginally reputable cargo
ship enters a civilized port

414
00:33:27,828 --> 00:33:31,280
and attempts to unload 50 barrels
full of cargo covered in blood?

415
00:33:31,282 --> 00:33:33,582
This material all must be unboxed

416
00:33:33,584 --> 00:33:37,619
and reboxed into clean containers before
I can even think about shipping it out.

417
00:33:37,621 --> 00:33:40,589
Between you and I, which of us
should bear the cost of that?

418
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:45,210
Whatever happened on that ship,
it was a costly fuck-up.

419
00:33:45,212 --> 00:33:47,796
But it wasn't my fuck-up, and
I'm not about to pay for it.

420
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:51,550
Ma'am, I must beg your understanding.

421
00:33:51,552 --> 00:33:53,802
My crew is new to this place.

422
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:56,188
Going forward, we'll certainly
keep this issue in mind.

423
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,640
Mr. Meeks, who is
the captain of the Fancy?

424
00:33:58,642 --> 00:34:00,559
Ned Low.

425
00:34:02,062 --> 00:34:03,812
Please relay to Captain Low

426
00:34:03,814 --> 00:34:06,198
that it is his responsibility
to manage the taking of prizes

427
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,317
to avoid situations like
this in the future.

428
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:10,652
If there are any savings in
the repacking of these goods,

429
00:34:10,654 --> 00:34:12,154
I'll be sure to pass them on to you.

430
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:13,956
Good afternoon.

431
00:34:26,503 --> 00:34:28,086
Madam Guthrie.

432
00:34:29,506 --> 00:34:30,839
You wished to speak with me?

433
00:34:31,842 --> 00:34:33,559
Sit.

434
00:34:43,187 --> 00:34:45,520
Do you know Captain Hallendale
of the Straight Arrow?

435
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:47,189
Yes.

436
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:49,441
Not terribly strong or daring,

437
00:34:49,443 --> 00:34:51,827
but knows how to manage a
prize, reliable in that way.

438
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:53,829
Sorry, what has this
got to do with me?

439
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:55,447
The Good Fortune
was captured yesterday

440
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:57,866
but by a different captain
who found her first,

441
00:34:57,868 --> 00:35:00,202
beat Hallendale to her,

442
00:35:00,204 --> 00:35:02,504
and then, instead of
managing her surrender,

443
00:35:02,506 --> 00:35:05,207
he put her entire crew
to the sword.

444
00:35:05,209 --> 00:35:06,708
I give Hallendale a lead.

445
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,628
Hallendale spends all his time in here.

446
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,631
And somehow that lead ends up in
the hands of a fucking maniac.

447
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:14,850
Madam Guthrie,
isn't it just as possible

448
00:35:14,852 --> 00:35:17,052
this is a rather unfortunate but not
at all implausible coincidence?

449
00:35:17,054 --> 00:35:18,553
I sold it.

450
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,608
To Captain Low.
He paid 90 pieces for it.

451
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,562
- Why would you do...?
- Why wouldn't I?

452
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:33,068
Valuable information walks in the
door, I should let it walk out?

453
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:36,405
Why? Because it bothers you?

454
00:35:42,212 --> 00:35:44,546
Stay out of my fucking business.

455
00:35:44,548 --> 00:35:47,466
Consider this the only warning
you're ever gonna get.

456
00:35:50,504 --> 00:35:53,555
- You fucking ingrate.
- Now that's not helpful.

457
00:35:53,557 --> 00:35:55,674
You mewed and whimpered
in that fucking tent

458
00:35:55,676 --> 00:35:57,592
till you had me all turned around.

459
00:35:57,594 --> 00:36:00,512
Got me thinking you were some
helpless thing they was beatin' on.

460
00:36:00,514 --> 00:36:02,564
I get you out, and you pull this shit.

461
00:36:02,566 --> 00:36:05,517
- Starting shit without telling us.
- Let me explain.

462
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,153
- Don't you fucking talk back to me.
- All right.

463
00:36:08,155 --> 00:36:10,856
Either she's on her back,
or she's out on the streets.

464
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:13,525
But if it ain't one of
the two come tomorrow,

465
00:36:13,527 --> 00:36:15,577
I'm gonna deal with it my way.

466
00:36:26,457 --> 00:36:30,042
I will be very honest with you.

467
00:36:30,044 --> 00:36:33,011
I could torture the two of you
to find out who you are,

468
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:34,680
how many more of you there are

469
00:36:34,682 --> 00:36:36,682
and what you're hoping
to accomplish here.

470
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:40,469
I could find it out
and you would both suffer.

471
00:36:40,471 --> 00:36:44,773
But today is your lucky day,
at least for one of you.

472
00:36:44,775 --> 00:36:46,641
My commander arrives

473
00:36:46,643 --> 00:36:48,777
to relieve the watch
in less than an hour.

474
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:51,480
I need this matter
resolved before then.

475
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:54,232
So neither of you will
be here when he arrives.

476
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:56,818
One of you will tell me
what I want to know,

477
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,236
receive this gold as reward,

478
00:36:58,238 --> 00:37:00,205
be escorted to the beach
for your escape.

479
00:37:00,207 --> 00:37:01,707
And the other will be quite dead.

480
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:03,658
My name is John Silver.
His name is James Flint.

481
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,961
We came here to steal the gold
from the treasure galleon,

482
00:37:05,963 --> 00:37:08,830
but he was deposed from his
captaincy by a man named Dufresne,

483
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:10,916
who is now waiting with the
rest of our crew in longboats.

484
00:37:10,918 --> 00:37:12,834
You'll likely find them behind
the promontory to the south.

485
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:15,670
I believe there are 32 of them.

486
00:37:15,672 --> 00:37:17,172
You fucking...!

487
00:37:25,232 --> 00:37:26,982
Suיltalo.

488
00:37:38,495 --> 00:37:39,528
Sorry.

489
00:37:54,545 --> 00:37:56,545
Huh-uh.

490
00:38:01,218 --> 00:38:02,968
Shoot this one.

491
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,386
He'll get to the pistol.

492
00:38:04,388 --> 00:38:06,381
This one has more scars...
more fights.

493
00:38:06,382 --> 00:38:07,977
You've got a better chance
against this one.

494
00:38:07,978 --> 00:38:10,640
- Not if he shoots me first.
- Then beat him to it. Do it, quickly.

495
00:38:10,645 --> 00:38:12,444
So I actually have to fight him?

496
00:38:12,446 --> 00:38:14,613
Well, what the fuck did you
think was gonna happen?

497
00:38:14,615 --> 00:38:16,982
Do it! Do it!

498
00:38:58,326 --> 00:39:00,609
(Men shouting in Spanish)

499
00:39:03,364 --> 00:39:05,331
Bolt the door.

500
00:39:12,456 --> 00:39:16,542
Busquen algo para derrimbar
la puerta, apתrense!

501
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:18,010
Table.

502
00:39:25,603 --> 00:39:27,553
So what now?

503
00:39:27,555 --> 00:39:30,022
They'll have to converge through
the door, roughly a dozen of them,

504
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:32,141
and three pistols at our disposal.

505
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:33,976
And then what?

506
00:39:48,492 --> 00:39:50,492
(Whistle blows)

507
00:39:55,299 --> 00:39:59,635
(Man shouting in Spanish)

508
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,307
Hold your fire.

509
00:40:22,026 --> 00:40:24,109
Mr. Logan, weigh the anchor!

510
00:40:24,111 --> 00:40:27,279
We must get underway before they
loose those cannons on the beach.

511
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:31,033
Up the braces! Up the braces!
Unfold the canvas!

512
00:40:32,703 --> 00:40:34,620
Come on!

513
00:40:43,297 --> 00:40:46,715
- Return fire!
- Return fire!

514
00:40:53,441 --> 00:40:56,108
DUFRESNE:
Cannons are loaded!

515
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:59,394
Get us underway! Get us underway!

516
00:41:04,285 --> 00:41:06,235
Prepare to take fire!

517
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:12,374
MAN:
Incoming!

518
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:47,609
BONNY:
...the fucking island.

519
00:41:47,611 --> 00:41:51,029
...that Guthrie cunt...

520
00:41:51,031 --> 00:41:52,531
Now get the fuck out.

521
00:41:52,533 --> 00:41:55,117
RACKHAM:
All right. Fuck!

522
00:42:05,796 --> 00:42:08,797
You have absolutely
nothing to worry about.

523
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:11,466
Though I would recommend
avoiding her for a while.

524
00:42:33,157 --> 00:42:34,740
Get the fuck out.

525
00:42:46,303 --> 00:42:50,088
If we are all going to make
something of this place,

526
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:53,091
perhaps it is in
everyone's best interest

527
00:42:53,093 --> 00:42:56,478
that you and I find a way
past all of this,

528
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,513
past your anger towards me.

529
00:42:58,515 --> 00:43:01,149
I'm not gonna warn you again.

530
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,438
Your anger... it is understandable.

531
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,574
You killed your own crew
to free me.

532
00:43:08,576 --> 00:43:12,494
You suffered indignity
in my defense.

533
00:43:12,496 --> 00:43:15,414
Perhaps that is enough
to warrant your feelings.

534
00:43:19,169 --> 00:43:22,421
But perhaps there is something
else underlying it,

535
00:43:22,423 --> 00:43:26,091
something hiding in a place
not even you can see.

536
00:43:28,429 --> 00:43:31,179
Perhaps...

537
00:43:31,181 --> 00:43:34,049
we would do well to...

538
00:43:34,051 --> 00:43:36,018
bring it into the light.

539
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:39,554
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

540
00:43:39,556 --> 00:43:41,974
Huh?

541
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:18,593
Ma'am.

542
00:44:22,232 --> 00:44:23,932
May I buy that for you, miss?

543
00:44:23,934 --> 00:44:27,269
My bar. Thank you anyway.

544
00:44:28,605 --> 00:44:30,989
I confess,

545
00:44:30,991 --> 00:44:33,108
I knew it was your bar.

546
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,577
Just a gesture for a pretty lady.

547
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,362
You must be new here.

548
00:44:37,364 --> 00:44:38,997
I am, in fact. How could you tell?

549
00:44:40,951 --> 00:44:42,668
I don't fuck customers.

550
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:45,671
Everybody here knows it.
Now you do, too.

551
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:47,673
A sound rule.

552
00:44:47,675 --> 00:44:50,509
Unfortunate for me,
but sound nonetheless.

553
00:44:50,511 --> 00:44:53,628
Still, it is unthinkable to me

554
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:56,965
that someone this beautiful is
forced to spend her nights alone.

555
00:44:56,967 --> 00:44:59,134
What's your name?

556
00:44:59,136 --> 00:45:00,185
Ned Low.

557
00:45:01,972 --> 00:45:04,306
You met my quartermaster
Meeks this morning.

558
00:45:04,308 --> 00:45:06,224
From what I understand,
we were shortchanged

559
00:45:06,226 --> 00:45:07,976
a fair amount on a prize haul

560
00:45:07,978 --> 00:45:10,112
owing to the condition
of its containers.

561
00:45:10,114 --> 00:45:12,030
I understand
Mr. Meeks told you

562
00:45:12,032 --> 00:45:14,149
the episode on the Good Fortune
was a case of self-defense.

563
00:45:14,151 --> 00:45:15,984
I apologize for that.

564
00:45:15,986 --> 00:45:17,736
When I heard he told you
that, I knew instantly

565
00:45:17,738 --> 00:45:20,455
that a woman of your stature
would see right through it.

566
00:45:20,457 --> 00:45:24,159
And if you're anything like me,
you simply cannot abide a liar.

567
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:27,162
So I thought if I came
here to tell the truth,

568
00:45:27,164 --> 00:45:32,217
perhaps we might reach
a more favorable outcome.

569
00:45:32,836 --> 00:45:34,719
The truth is,

570
00:45:34,721 --> 00:45:38,006
I'm not a particularly
skilled captain.

571
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:39,674
Navigation is foreign to me.

572
00:45:39,676 --> 00:45:41,676
I have no gift for politics.

573
00:45:41,678 --> 00:45:43,845
So what am I good at?

574
00:45:43,847 --> 00:45:47,098
This is going to sound
absurd, but...

575
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,018
I make the men feel better
about themselves.

576
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,020
See, every man here
has served under a captain

577
00:45:52,022 --> 00:45:53,855
who uses violence
to achieve an end...

578
00:45:53,857 --> 00:45:57,191
to terrorize, to advertise.

579
00:45:57,193 --> 00:45:59,827
When the men see that,
they can spot the lie.

580
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:03,114
They know that that captain
is, in some part of his soul,

581
00:46:03,116 --> 00:46:06,451
sickened by his own actions.

582
00:46:06,453 --> 00:46:09,037
And the lie infects
everyone who sees it.

583
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:11,039
But with me,

584
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:13,541
when the men see me slaughter
the crew of the Good Fortune,

585
00:46:13,543 --> 00:46:16,711
when they see me cut out a man's
tongue from his mouth for lying,

586
00:46:16,713 --> 00:46:18,963
when they see me burn a boy alive
in front of his father's eyes,

587
00:46:18,965 --> 00:46:22,717
they know, they can
see it in my eyes...

588
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,852
there's no lie there.

589
00:46:24,854 --> 00:46:27,639
There's no secret remorse there.

590
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:32,560
I simply don't have it in me.

591
00:46:35,565 --> 00:46:39,534
At any rate, I hope
that clarifies things

592
00:46:39,536 --> 00:46:41,703
and illustrates why it is only fair

593
00:46:41,705 --> 00:46:45,623
to compensate my men fully
for their latest haul,

594
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:49,794
as it was an honest haul
taken by an honest captain.

595
00:46:49,796 --> 00:46:51,913
I intend to be here some time.

596
00:46:51,915 --> 00:46:54,666
It would be a shame to
make enemies of each other

597
00:46:54,668 --> 00:46:56,801
over such a small amount of money.

598
00:46:58,722 --> 00:47:00,838
Get out of my place.

599
00:47:23,279 --> 00:47:25,580
(Men chattering)

600
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:31,619
MAN:
I say get rid of him.

601
00:47:48,605 --> 00:47:50,605
It's very lucky.

602
00:47:53,693 --> 00:47:56,444
I rather envy you.

603
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:08,322
I remember what it was like
the first time I met him.

604
00:48:08,324 --> 00:48:10,658
There's a feeling one gets
when in the presence

605
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:13,244
of the truly great men.

606
00:48:13,246 --> 00:48:16,831
It's something quite indescribable.

607
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:19,884
I imagine you're
having it as we speak.

608
00:48:19,886 --> 00:48:22,253
"Indescribable" is a good word.

609
00:48:22,255 --> 00:48:24,172
You question my husband's motives?

610
00:48:24,174 --> 00:48:26,174
Not on the least, ma'am,

611
00:48:26,176 --> 00:48:28,393
though I may question the
outcome he's likely to achieve.

612
00:48:28,395 --> 00:48:30,428
The game he is entering into

613
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,930
is a brutal and unforgiving one.

614
00:48:32,932 --> 00:48:35,733
- Piracy?
- Politics.

615
00:48:35,735 --> 00:48:39,187
What's your name, Lieutenant?

616
00:48:39,189 --> 00:48:42,240
McGraw... James McGraw.

617
00:48:42,242 --> 00:48:45,743
Great men aren't made great by
politics, Lieutenant McGraw.

618
00:48:45,745 --> 00:48:49,363
They aren't made great
by prudence or propriety.

619
00:48:49,365 --> 00:48:51,365
They are, every last one of them,

620
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:55,286
made great by one thing
and one thing only...

621
00:48:55,288 --> 00:48:59,090
the relentless pursuit
of a better world.

622
00:48:59,092 --> 00:49:01,375
The great men don't
give up that pursuit.

623
00:49:01,377 --> 00:49:03,377
They don't know how.

624
00:49:03,379 --> 00:49:06,347
And that is what makes
them invincible.

625
00:49:26,035 --> 00:49:29,036
17 yea votes against 15 nays.

626
00:49:30,406 --> 00:49:33,157
The crew has commuted your sentences

627
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:36,744
by the narrowest of margins.

628
00:49:36,746 --> 00:49:40,248
You will both be
transported back to Nassau,

629
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:43,334
at which point you will be removed
from this ship permanently

630
00:49:43,336 --> 00:49:45,419
and without severance.

631
00:49:47,307 --> 00:49:50,391
There'll be no further
negotiation on the matter.

632
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,406
You were right, for what it's worth.

633
00:50:05,408 --> 00:50:07,158
Beg pardon?

634
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,362
If your interests and mine
were adverse to each other,

635
00:50:11,364 --> 00:50:14,949
there's a good chance I'd
cross you to save myself.

636
00:50:14,951 --> 00:50:17,451
Then why didn't you?

637
00:50:17,453 --> 00:50:19,837
Because at the moment

638
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,206
I don't believe our interests
are adverse to each other.

639
00:50:28,464 --> 00:50:31,299
I don't believe you did
any of this for a pardon,

640
00:50:31,301 --> 00:50:34,135
or a passage to Nassau,

641
00:50:34,137 --> 00:50:37,471
or to be able to walk away
from anything.

642
00:50:37,473 --> 00:50:41,475
I think you intend
to reclaim your captaincy.

643
00:50:41,477 --> 00:50:46,113
I think you intend to take
control of this ship.

644
00:50:46,115 --> 00:50:47,865
And then I think you intend

645
00:50:47,867 --> 00:50:50,484
to return to that beach,
armed to the teeth,

646
00:50:50,486 --> 00:50:53,487
and seize every last
ounce of gold off of it.

647
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:58,075
And I think you're going
to need my help to do it.

648
00:51:06,302 --> 00:51:08,252
Tell me I'm wrong.

649
00:51:14,544 --> 00:51:17,245

1
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:09,375
When my father arrives,
I would like to propose to him

2
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,544
that we don't hang the pirates
but we pardon them.

3
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:14,630
Any man who proposes to pardon
a traitor is himself a traitor.

4
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:18,300
I find his argument persuasive
and I find yours wanting, sir.

5
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:20,603
You're so close to having
everything you've wanted.

6
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,021
I came to help you get it.

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,390
I hear that one of the thieves
assaulted another.

8
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,642
It was all in service
of stealing a young girl

9
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:28,360
intended to be ransomed to her father.

10
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,279
Miranda:
Her name was Abigail Ashe.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,032
Lieutenant McGraw, my good
friend Lord Peter Ashe.

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,035
Mr. Featherstone will announce
to his shipmates tomorrow

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,455
that he has joined a new crew.
Your crew.

14
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,207
He can't be on the ship right now.

15
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,243
It could spoil whatever chances
we have to retrieve the Urca gold.

16
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:47,246
I am fully committed to the removal
of Captain Vane from that fort.

17
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,632
You are talking about rendering Nassau
completely unprotected.

18
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,051
- I know.
- What say you, Captain?

19
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,835
Fire.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

21
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,599
(Moaning)

22
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:16,028
(Cannon fire)

23
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,029
(People shouting)

24
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,233
(Bell ringing)

25
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,568
It would appear we lost track of time.

26
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,156
(Bell continues ringing)

27
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,047
(Cannon fire continues)

28
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,006
- Man: Fire!
- Man #2: Fire!

29
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,845
- Take cover!
- (Screaming)

30
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,740
(Cannon fire echoing)

31
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,716
Please.

32
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,364
Please, stop.

33
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:11,250
Surely you must realize
this is a fruitless errand.

34
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,585
The time for conciliation is well past.

35
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,537
I must try.

36
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:17,122
(Horse whinnies)

37
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,208
Why?

38
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,626
I'm the only one
who can stop him, Pastor.

39
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,014
I'm the only one who
knows why he's doing it.

40
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,888
(Thunder rumbling)

41
00:04:56,407 --> 00:04:58,489
__

42
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:07,755
(Thunder crashes)

43
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,810
Your father said he would never
let your proposal come to a vote.

44
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,345
I do believe he meant it.

45
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,931
Tell me what chance this has of success.
Be honest.

46
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:18,600
Ultimately there is tremendous support
for every part of the package.

47
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:21,320
This entire battle is being waged
over the pardon provision.

48
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,072
Without it, I could get this
passed in a matter of hours.

49
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,574
The rest of it is meaningless
without the pardons.

50
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,025
They're the only hope
for redeeming Nassau.

51
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,778
I know, which is why
we'll keep on fighting.

52
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,531
I know your father
is a formidable adversary.

53
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,915
So am I.

54
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:40,756
What is it?

55
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,173
A moment please?

56
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,632
I'm going to make arrangements
to leave for the country.

57
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:53,719
Leave? Leave when?

58
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,687
Now.

59
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,524
- Tonight.
- May I ask why?

60
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,143
This fight with your father.

61
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:04,113
The more public it gets,
the more visible it gets,

62
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,647
the greater the liability
I will be for you.

63
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:07,533
Liability? How could you possibly...

64
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,619
The lieutenant's ship
arrived this morning.

65
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,287
Returned from the Bahama Islands.

66
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,326
I received word not long ago.

67
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,828
The rumors about me and
my relationship with him

68
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:21,880
have gone quiet the past
few months he's been away

69
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,299
and I'm concerned that when he returns

70
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,884
people will start whispering again.

71
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,336
Let them whisper.

72
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:30,055
It's not the rumors that concern me.

73
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,474
It's the scrutiny that follows that.

74
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,177
And what that scrutiny might unearth.

75
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:37,679
So someone might discover
you and he shared a bed.

76
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,732
I'm concerned they might dig past that

77
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,101
and discover something

78
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,904
far more damaging

79
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,572
than that.

80
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:52,743
(Cannon fire continues)

81
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,535
Silver:
I can assure you, Mr. Gates' death

82
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:01,503
is not one the captain took lightly.

83
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,705
When I arrived

84
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:07,259
just after the deed was done,

85
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,511
I saw the look on his face.

86
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,681
The pain it caused him
to do what he did.

87
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,969
But in that moment,
he believed it necessary

88
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,103
to preserve the hunt
for the Urca and her gold.

89
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,392
Flint killed him?

90
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,981
Yes.

91
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,402
And he's still captain?

92
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,706
How?

93
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,458
After a brief interlude,

94
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,461
the men saw what I am hoping
you will see.

95
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,796
That with the gold still
sitting on that beach,

96
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,083
he represents our best, perhaps
our only chance of retrieving it.

97
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:50,302
Once this business with Vane
and the fort is over,

98
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,170
that is what the rest of us intend.

99
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,255
Rest of us?

100
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:57,259
That's why I'm here.

101
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,228
You didn't want me with the men.

102
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,064
You're worried I'll challenge Flint.

103
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,816
Well, the thought crossed my mind.

104
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,102
But I'm hoping

105
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:10,239
that once you have a moment
to process all of this,

106
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,325
you'll remember that you are
the same man

107
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:17,195
who when handed a blank page pulled
from Mr. Singleton's corpse,

108
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:21,083
stood by the captain for the
sake of the bigger picture.

109
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,751
Then you'll realize you were right then.

110
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,203
And the same kind of perspective
is what's called for now.

111
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,254
Enough!

112
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,959
I'm going to see my brothers now.

113
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,130
(Chain clanks)

114
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:44,106
Until I know what you're
going to say to the men,

115
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,807
I can't let you say anything to the men.

116
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:50,444
(Horse whinnies)

117
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:08,963
(Bell ringing)

118
00:09:25,682 --> 00:09:27,848
(Thunder rumbling)

119
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,355
He returns at last. It's good
to have you back, Lieutenant.

120
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:35,690
- Sir.
- Welcome home.

121
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,912
Three months.

122
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:45,474
Feels like twice as long.

123
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:49,037
Our campaign against
my father and Whitehall

124
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:51,707
has reached a most critical stage.

125
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:55,711
If you were able to secure the support
of the royal governor in Nassau,

126
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:58,263
it might just be the thing that
turns the tide in our favor.

127
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,047
There is no governor in Nassau.

128
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,050
What do you mean?

129
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,606
I understand the dispute
arose over a bribe.

130
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,225
Money that Governor
Thompson felt he was owed

131
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:12,444
by a particular pirate captain.

132
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,946
That captain recruited others.

133
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,900
They demanded the governor
leave the island at once.

134
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:21,953
Thompson refused, at which point

135
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,289
a dozen armed men broke into his home,

136
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,242
dragged his wife and nine-year-old
son out into the street

137
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:28,793
and slit their throats.

138
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,556
They let him live, so I'm told,

139
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,258
so he would tell the tale

140
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,761
and so that there would be
no misunderstanding

141
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:47,596
about who is running Nassau now.

142
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:50,482
Stupid fuckers.

143
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,769
By the time I left, men were
beginning to occupy the fort.

144
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,854
Had I stayed another day, I'm not sure

145
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,273
they would have let me
leave with my ship.

146
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:00,158
But what is clear is this,

147
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,411
right now, there's no law in Nassau.

148
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:13,121
I'm trying to imagine
standing up before the lords

149
00:11:13,122 --> 00:11:15,540
and suggesting pardons
for these people.

150
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,294
I'm having a difficult time of it.

151
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:23,298
The men responsible for this
crime deserve to be punished.

152
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:25,517
But we cannot, we must not

153
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,104
allow their actions to condemn the rest.

154
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,307
As a matter of political reality,

155
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:33,892
our plan is dead.

156
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,444
Not necessarily.

157
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,862
Beg your pardon?

158
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,065
The navy hasn't made its case yet.

159
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,983
Peter:
The navy isn't going to make a case.

160
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:45,153
The navy will do whatever
Parliament tells it to do.

161
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:47,656
We're in a time of war.
If the Sea Lords

162
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:50,075
were to recommend a change of
strategy, who would ignore them?

163
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,244
- The war has got nothing to do with it.
- Doesn't it?

164
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:55,913
Isn't a lawless Nassau a weakness
that Spain could exploit?

165
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:01,552
- How would you do it?
- (Scoffs)

166
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,505
By offering our plan
directly to the Sea Lords.

167
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,357
Making our case to them.

168
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,143
- They'd hear you?
- Yes, I think they would.

169
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:11,602
Miranda:
Ahem, Lieutenant.

170
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:15,934
May I speak with you
in private, please?

171
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,768
Now.

172
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:31,867
It's clear to me now that what
lies ahead is the road to ruin.

173
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:34,202
And I'm asking you
to stop this right now

174
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:36,787
before we've all gone
too far to turn back.

175
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,262
Man:
What do you see, lad?

176
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,598
Leeward tower just lost
another 10 foot of her wall.

177
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,050
The dust is still clearing.

178
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:51,218
(People murmuring)

179
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:02,364
- You don't like it?
- No. No, no, no.

180
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,400
It's quite good.

181
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:08,620
But here's the thing...

182
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,040
the crew's banner is a sacred thing.

183
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,960
It must simultaneously strike fear

184
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,329
in the hearts of hardened men

185
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,249
while inspiring and unifying
all those who sail under it.

186
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,136
It must be something
approaching perfection.

187
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,223
Any idea what direction that might be?

188
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,392
Darling, I think we'll
both know it when we see it.

189
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,592
Don't you?

190
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:39,434
Charlotte.

191
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:41,602
Oh.

192
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:49,109
Never sailed with a captain
this particular before.

193
00:13:50,947 --> 00:13:53,081
We all have the same swords out there.

194
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,699
We all have the same guns.

195
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,502
- But great art...
- (Cannon echoes)

196
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,421
has felled empires

197
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,289
and therein lies all the difference.

198
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,758
I don't understand what that means.

199
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,127
No, but I do. So not to worry.

200
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:09,014
While the rest of this island
sits about gawking

201
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,933
at the chaos of the day
contemplating the end of the world,

202
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,718
we would do well to use
this time to prepare.

203
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,971
I'd like to be first men back in
the water when the smoke clears

204
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:17,856
with every detail accounted for.

205
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,192
Well, while we're on it,
we still got details to sort

206
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,144
of a much bigger size than all that.

207
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:25,680
Stores ain't procured,
articles ain't signed.

208
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:27,795
I've seen the draft articles.
I'm fine with them as is.

209
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:29,276
But the men ain't.

210
00:14:29,277 --> 00:14:31,620
They got some changes
you and I ought to discuss.

211
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,571
Ooh, changes.

212
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,656
Yes.

213
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:38,376
You two making any progress?

214
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,077
Jack:
Slowly but surely.

215
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,967
I'm sorry, you were saying
something about the articles.

216
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,086
It can wait.

217
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,137
That ain't letting up anytime soon.

218
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:53,674
Excuse me.

219
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,978
(Explosion)

220
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,180
Fucking nightmare it must be up there.

221
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:01,266
You think he's still in it?

222
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,851
Who, Charles?

223
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:04,853
He could get out of that
fort without being seen.

224
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:07,155
He's stubborn but he ain't stupid.

225
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,108
No, I'd say he's terribly stupid
when it comes to being stubborn.

226
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,994
Given a choice between
capitulation and survival,

227
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,497
I don't image that to be much
of a choice for him at all.

228
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,698
He's in that fort, I assure you.

229
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,200
You think he'll make it?

230
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:21,953
(Sighs) I think Charles Vane
is something you and I survived.

231
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,705
What happens to him now
is no longer of any concern to me.

232
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:32,546
This morning, you and Max.

233
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,386
You know what? I ain't got no right.

234
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:40,855
We'll get through it.

235
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,390
Always do, don't we?

236
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,986
- (Whinnies)
- Steady.

237
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,122
Stand.

238
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:00,208
Ma'am. Ma'am, are you hurt?

239
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,593
(Muttering)
Help me.

240
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,079
(Woman crying)

241
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,112
Walk on. Walk on.

242
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,575
Flint: It's all right.
I see a way through this.

243
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,412
A way towards the end
which we have all been seeking.

244
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,049
Thomas, he sees only the principle.

245
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,884
The right.

246
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:44,919
It's inspiring.

247
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,338
It can be intoxicating.

248
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,674
It's why I love him.

249
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,560
But you, you see the world as it is.

250
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:54,896
You see its truths
and how to navigate them.

251
00:16:54,897 --> 00:16:56,681
How to bend them to your will.

252
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,765
It's why I love you.

253
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:02,203
Men like Thomas need men like you.

254
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:03,872
To protect them from the world.

255
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:05,790
And that is what I am asking you to do.

256
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,959
The danger is simply too great.

257
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,711
Anything that has ever
been worth doing

258
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:12,380
has been worth doing in
the face of a little danger.

259
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:15,216
I have been the subject of
enough ridicule and innuendo

260
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:17,719
to know the difference between
a little danger and mortal danger,

261
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,055
and I'm telling you that
what you and Thomas and I

262
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:22,390
face right now is the latter.

263
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:24,959
What's been going on in this
house isn't just some affair.

264
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,729
No. No, it isn't.

265
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,648
But since when did you care
what people think?

266
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,317
This isn't a question of scandal.

267
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:36,037
It isn't a state of mind.
They hang men for this.

268
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:37,082
Don't be naive.

269
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,373
When they have political motive,

270
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:41,242
they use it as a pretense to hang men.

271
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:44,245
Don't treat me like I'm someone else.
I know what London is, too.

272
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:48,583
Alfred Hamilton does not
want those pardons issued.

273
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:52,253
He has committed himself to doing
everything in his power to prevent it.

274
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:54,973
And when he finds out what's
been going on in this house,

275
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,257
he will use it to ruin us.

276
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:59,310
Even if he were to find out,
he wouldn't use it against us.

277
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,845
Now who's being naive?

278
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,370
It would be just as
embarrassing for the earl

279
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:03,515
as it would be for any of us.

280
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,768
Do you really think he wants that?

281
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:08,436
You are underestimating him.

282
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:11,106
He will find a way to exploit it.

283
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:14,159
Why take the risk?

284
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,161
For the sake of the pirates of Nassau?

285
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,862
Miranda, I saw it. I was there.

286
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,117
Thomas was right about its promise.

287
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:25,620
And once the pirate issue has abated,

288
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:28,455
it'll need help to rebuild.
Help from people like us.

289
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:34,295
You're suggesting we go there.

290
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,965
A restored New Providence Island
will need a governor.

291
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:39,467
Who better qualified
to oversee the building

292
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:40,969
of the New World than Thomas?

293
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,272
With these pardons, we can accomplish
that and leave London behind.

294
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:47,224
- (Thunder rumbling)
- (Rain pattering)

295
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:57,651
I've known Admiral Hennessey
since I was a boy.

296
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:02,123
He's the closest thing
I have to a father.

297
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:03,908
Let me raise the plan with him.

298
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,410
Seek his counsel.
There's no risk in that.

299
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,000
This is too important not to try.

300
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:18,338
(Cannon fire continues)

301
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:21,608
Fire!

302
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,734
- Man: Reload the cannons.
- Reload! Reload!

303
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:32,903
Quickly, boys, quickly.

304
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:35,122
Let's go. Let's go.

305
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:37,658
Two-six, heave!

306
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:40,027
- Men: Heave!
- Fire!

307
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:49,969
(Men shouting)

308
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:55,843
(Men cheering)

309
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:58,396
- Two-six!
- Heave!

310
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,863
Cease fire!

311
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:02,099
Cease fire!

312
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,068
- Cease fire!
- Cease fire!

313
00:20:06,522 --> 00:20:09,323
Prepare to move ashore.

314
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:11,492
Ready the longboats.

315
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:13,827
(Men shouting)

316
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:24,371
- (Wood creaking)
- (Water dripping)

317
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,466
(Man coughing)

318
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:00,458
The courtyard wall's destroyed.

319
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,493
A breach in the northwestern corridor.

320
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,078
Seaward-facing batteries are gone

321
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,997
as are most of the westward guns.

322
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,582
How many did we lose?

323
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,634
Seven.

324
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,752
Another nine injured.

325
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:14,388
How long do you expect?

326
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:16,841
Before the men are massing
themselves on the beach

327
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,091
to begin their assault?

328
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:20,792
Two hours.

329
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:24,644
Maybe less.

330
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:34,975
Larson.

331
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:37,311
Take her back to the cell.

332
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:40,275
Make sure she remains
safe while I'm gone.

333
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:44,902
No one is to touch her. Understood?

334
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:45,936
Aye.

335
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:51,359
While you're gone?
Where are you going?

336
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,612
No matter how many of his men
we kill, he can find more.

337
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:58,115
Eventually they breach

338
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,501
and we die.

339
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:02,036
So you're leaving?

340
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:04,005
It's too great of a force to defeat

341
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:06,174
if we attempt to fight the body of it.

342
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:08,960
Only way to beat it

343
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,178
is to cut off its head.

344
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,048
(Chatter)

345
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,720
Richard: I had the misfortune
of being in his presence

346
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:22,557
when Mr. Underhill received
word of your proposal

347
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,393
to form a partnership to sell
his goods on your ships.

348
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:27,228
He said no.

349
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:30,565
But it was the manner in which he
said no that is most promising.

350
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:32,867
I don't understand what it
is he hopes to achieve by...

351
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:35,570
His anger, I believe,
was due to the fact

352
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:37,405
that he wanted to say yes.

353
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:39,574
- Ma'am.
- What is it?

354
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:41,542
Ma'am, an errant shot from the warship

355
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:43,878
hit a set a stores outside the
southwest gates. Set it ablaze.

356
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:45,630
How close to the Intrepid's
storehouse there?

357
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:47,248
A few hundred yards, ma'am.

358
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:49,300
The problem is it's been
freshly stocked with...

359
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,837
With powder, I know.
Inform Mr. Lawrence

360
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,340
he needs to move his powder stock
to my warehouse here immediately.

361
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:57,976
And ask Virgil to take five men
to help put out that fire.

362
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:01,146
- Any sign of capitulation?
- Ma'am?

363
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:04,816
Captain Vane, has he made
any signal to surrender?

364
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:06,818
No, ma'am.

365
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,070
You're dismissed.

366
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:11,906
What the fuck does that mean?
He wants to say yes.

367
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:14,776
You desire legitimacy
in the eyes of London.

368
00:23:14,777 --> 00:23:17,028
But you cannot have it
until you find a way

369
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,863
to ship something
other than stolen goods.

370
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:23,618
The landowners want greater profits.

371
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:26,087
But they cannot have them
until they find a way

372
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:28,256
to ship their products
out of the port of Nassau

373
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:32,460
free from the danger of the pirates.

374
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:34,045
There is a partnership to be had here.

375
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,013
I can broker it.

376
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:39,016
And there is only one thing
standing in the way.

377
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,769
If you were to appear
to divest yourself

378
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,971
of your association with
the crews on account...

379
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:45,890
You are unbelievable.

380
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,942
All I'd have to do is give up the fence

381
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:49,727
and you can make
all my dreams come true.

382
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,313
You're a smart girl, Eleanor.

383
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:54,782
And though I know
you're standing there,

384
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:56,784
parsing this, trying to identify

385
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:59,737
how my interests
diverge from yours here,

386
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,739
I suspect you're not finding it.

387
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,157
And it's because
it isn't there to be found.

388
00:24:13,698 --> 00:24:17,376
You want me to prove to Underhill
that I can be his partner?

389
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,404
That I can be trustworthy?

390
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:23,817
Then you have to prove the same to me.

391
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:27,398
I have spent a lifetime exposed
to your self-serving lies.

392
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,318
They're the manure
from which I sprouted.

393
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,522
And if I can identify
the specific motive or not,

394
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:38,692
I still come to expect that stench
anytime you darken my door.

395
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,865
(Chatter)

396
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:00,798
Find Mr. Silver for me, if you please.

397
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,383
Captain.

398
00:25:02,384 --> 00:25:05,603
You've explained to your men
their responsibilities here?

399
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:09,057
Aye, they know your plans to recover the
gold must be kept secret and silent.

400
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:10,558
If it were to be discovered
by another crew,

401
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,395
they could become competition
for its retrieval.

402
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:16,898
You know how to keep a
secret between three men?

403
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:17,981
Shoot two of them.

404
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:22,052
What kind of fool tries to
keep a secret amongst 100?

405
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,871
The faster we retake the fort,

406
00:25:23,872 --> 00:25:25,456
the faster you'll be back on the water

407
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,625
en route to the Urca
with my men in your service.

408
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,543
Even if the information
were to be divulged

409
00:25:29,544 --> 00:25:32,046
that the gold is still to be won,

410
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:34,131
even if another crew could
discern its specific location,

411
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:37,084
even if they could refit rapidly
enough to get out there ahead of you,

412
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:39,920
they'd still be facing a warship
standing between them and their prize.

413
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:43,340
Adhere to our plan,
you will have your gold

414
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,392
and I'll have my fort.

415
00:25:58,704 --> 00:25:59,754
What are you doing here?

416
00:25:59,755 --> 00:26:02,423
I need to speak with you alone.

417
00:26:02,424 --> 00:26:03,758
You need to leave here right now.

418
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,042
I will see you when I am able.

419
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,948
I have come upon some information
which changes things for you.

420
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:10,117
You must not move against that fort.

421
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:12,586
Miranda, you don't
understand what's going on.

422
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:15,790
I understand why you need that fort.

423
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,842
I understand why you need that gold.

424
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:19,460
I understand why you need this island.

425
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:22,129
I understand it all because I was there

426
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,799
the day our lives ended
and all of this began.

427
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,886
But I have been devoted
to you since that day.

428
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,638
I have been loyal

429
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:33,057
and protective and fucking
committed to you since that day,

430
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,643
and I am asking you to come with me

431
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:38,445
so that I can save your life.

432
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:47,655
Flint:
There's an opportunity here today.

433
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:50,207
An opportunity that may not
present itself again.

434
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,242
If we act right now,

435
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:55,379
we can prevent a catastrophic
loss to the Empire.

436
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,581
We can make England stronger
tomorrow than she is today.

437
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,416
We can save Nassau and all it takes

438
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:03,220
is for us to do
a very reasonable thing.

439
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,505
Military pardons?

440
00:27:04,506 --> 00:27:05,923
I know how it will be perceived, sir.

441
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:10,261
I know how it looks for me to even
raise the subject with you here.

442
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:13,264
But this is too important to be
deterred by dangers imagined.

443
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,349
And if I have learned
anything from you,

444
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,901
it is that it is moments like these

445
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:20,020
that are the precise
measure of a man's courage.

446
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:21,906
Good God.

447
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:25,692
You perceive the danger
about this to be imagined.

448
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:33,167
I told you when this began
to be careful of those people.

449
00:27:33,168 --> 00:27:35,536
To be aware of just how
sharp and unexpected

450
00:27:35,537 --> 00:27:38,588
the knife would be if you
discounted that danger.

451
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:44,210
I'd thought you'd heard me, son.

452
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,185
I heard you, sir.

453
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:54,387
But I've come to see that you
and I were wrong about him.

454
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:57,358
Lord Hamilton isn't someone
we should be wary of,

455
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,360
he is exactly the kind of man
we should be listening to.

456
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:02,112
On the day I was made an officer,

457
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,032
you pulled me aside.

458
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:08,986
You told me how proud you were of me.

459
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,788
You told me that a measure of a man

460
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,541
is in the moment when he is
confronted by himself.

461
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:15,125
By opposing voices in his head,

462
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,860
both arguing that they are
right, but one has to be wrong.

463
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,164
To know the difference in that moment,
that is what makes an officer.

464
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,333
What makes a man.

465
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:27,171
Well, I see the difference here, sir.

466
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,222
I know it.

467
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:38,765
(Bell tolling)

468
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,942
He arrived just before you did.

469
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:50,110
And he told me what you did.

470
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:52,863
After he invited you into his home,

471
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,033
trusted you to assist
his son and daughter,

472
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,851
and you flagrantly violated that trust.

473
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:00,454
Sir, I don't know
what he told you, but...

474
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:03,374
Yes, you do.

475
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,292
Hennessey:
I would like to defend you.

476
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:08,712
I would like to remind myself
that every man has his flaws,

477
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:12,299
his weaknesses that torment him.

478
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,053
I would like to help you
recover from yours.

479
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,689
But not this. It is too profane.

480
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,943
It is too loathsome to be dismissed.

481
00:29:22,944 --> 00:29:24,812
This is your end.

482
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:26,230
Sir, please let me explain.

483
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:29,617
Be grateful it didn't happen
on the gallows.

484
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:32,319
Alfred: You thought I wouldn't
hear what you'd done?

485
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,621
In my own house?

486
00:29:33,622 --> 00:29:37,657
That not even the faintest
whisper of it would reach me?

487
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:42,729
Now, this ends quietly,

488
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,480
permanently,

489
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:47,316
and in the manner of my choosing.

490
00:29:48,492 --> 00:29:51,609
You are summarily
discharged from service.

491
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:54,613
No charges will be drawn against you

492
00:29:54,614 --> 00:29:57,116
provided you leave London quietly

493
00:29:57,117 --> 00:30:00,201
and are neither seen
nor heard from again.

494
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,768
If either the earl or I

495
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:06,676
feel that this bargain
has been breached,

496
00:30:06,677 --> 00:30:11,276
the charges brought against you
will be swift and unyielding.

497
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,363
(Clock chiming)

498
00:30:23,372 --> 00:30:25,323
Where's Thomas?

499
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,993
They came. The earl's men.

500
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,495
It happened quickly before I
could do anything to stop it.

501
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,547
- They took him.
- Took him? Took him where?

502
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,670
Bethlem Royal Hospital.

503
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,839
He is to be committed there,

504
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,008
owing to his uncontrollable grief

505
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,011
over having learned
of my affair with you.

506
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,939
- Our affair?
- That is what the story will be.

507
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,565
I have been given until nightfall

508
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,695
to vacate this house.

509
00:30:55,696 --> 00:30:58,817
And then you and I are to disappear.

510
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:03,563
Ashe: I have friends in
Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels.

511
00:31:03,564 --> 00:31:05,398
I can get you set up comfortably.

512
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:08,901
Perhaps at some point, I can figure
out a way to get you back here.

513
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:10,987
- I'm not leaving.
- Miranda: James.

514
00:31:10,988 --> 00:31:12,738
- We're gonna get him out of there.
- We can't.

515
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:14,907
- You watch me.
- You think you're angry about this?

516
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:17,959
- I'm beyond that.
- I am enraged!

517
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:24,297
He is my husband.

518
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:29,337
Before they took him away,
he made me promise him...

519
00:31:31,508 --> 00:31:34,559
that no matter what happened
next, that you and I...

520
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:40,666
would take care of each other.

521
00:31:41,268 --> 00:31:44,270
The danger here is real.

522
00:31:44,271 --> 00:31:46,689
Thomas is gone.

523
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,741
And now you and I
must leave this place.

524
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,947
Ashe:
We need to get you moving.

525
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:57,450
When we get to the harbor,
I'll arrange passage for you.

526
00:31:57,451 --> 00:32:00,202
Anything you need that you don't
have, I'll see sent to you.

527
00:32:00,203 --> 00:32:02,321
In the meantime, my friends

528
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:06,158
will ensure that you're taken care of.

529
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,193
We won't be with your friends.

530
00:32:11,448 --> 00:32:12,915
We're not going to Paris.

531
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:16,002
Or Brussels or Amsterdam.

532
00:32:16,003 --> 00:32:18,231
Ashe:
Then where are you going?

533
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:22,618
- Man: Open the crate.
- (Chatter)

534
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:27,462
Man #2:
Pass 'em down. Pass 'em down.

535
00:32:41,244 --> 00:32:43,245
Idelle said you were looking for me?

536
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:45,581
To your knowledge,
have any of Flint's crew

537
00:32:45,582 --> 00:32:49,285
made their way up to the
brothel since coming ashore?

538
00:32:49,286 --> 00:32:51,319
Not that I'm aware of.

539
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:57,460
Back from a lengthy journey

540
00:32:57,461 --> 00:33:01,897
and not one of them has
felt the need to have a go?

541
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:03,482
Preparing for battle.

542
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,901
Perhaps they have set
pleasure aside for the moment.

543
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:10,740
Mmm, or maybe they was told to
stay the fuck away from here.

544
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:13,775
To prevent them
from divulging a secret.

545
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:19,147
(Laughing)

546
00:33:21,685 --> 00:33:24,570
- Rackham: Charlotte.
- Don't.

547
00:33:24,571 --> 00:33:27,023
- What?
- You're crowding me.

548
00:33:27,024 --> 00:33:30,091
I understand this is very important
to you, but I can't work like this.

549
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,724
You have regular custom with the men
of Captain Flint's crew, yes?

550
00:33:48,845 --> 00:33:51,347
It's all right.

551
00:33:51,348 --> 00:33:54,116
Just one.
He won't let the others near me.

552
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:57,036
Has he paid you a visit yet
since his recent arrival?

553
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:59,622
No, but he will.

554
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:01,557
Can't stay away for long, that one.

555
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:04,577
If or when he finally
decides to visit you,

556
00:34:04,578 --> 00:34:07,813
I'd like to know what he has
to say about the Urca gold.

557
00:34:07,814 --> 00:34:09,881
You haven't heard?

558
00:34:14,538 --> 00:34:16,739
Everyone's saying it wasn't there.

559
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,975
They ran into a man of war instead,
managed to nick that ship.

560
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:23,345
Yes, I know.
Just indulge me, will you?

561
00:34:23,346 --> 00:34:25,264
- Mr. Rackham.
- Mm.

562
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:28,934
- A word.
- With me?

563
00:34:28,935 --> 00:34:29,935
(Knocks)

564
00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:36,506
Thank you, love.

565
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,542
"Thank you, love?"

566
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:45,768
- What's this?
- We need to talk about these articles.

567
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:48,104
And I thought it best if we
could have the conversation

568
00:34:48,105 --> 00:34:50,155
just you and I.

569
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:01,951
All right. What's the
matter with the articles?

570
00:35:01,952 --> 00:35:05,721
A few things.

571
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:07,790
- Max...
- Let me stop you there.

572
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:11,127
Yes, it's unorthodox to entitle a
woman to a share of the profits,

573
00:35:11,128 --> 00:35:13,479
but this is clearly a special case.

574
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,364
That particular woman is a font

575
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:17,700
of prostitutional intelligence.

576
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:21,787
And believe me, if I could see
a way to replace her, I would.

577
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:24,573
But at the moment, she is worth
far, far more to this crew

578
00:35:24,574 --> 00:35:26,158
than the share it costs to have her.

579
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,328
I understand,
but you must understand

580
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:32,381
that's not an easy thing
to sell men on a new ship

581
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:34,133
used to a certain way of doing things.

582
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:35,634
Are you saying you can't sell it?

583
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:40,172
No, I might be able to with
a great deal of cajoling.

584
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:42,391
The problem is Max's share

585
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:44,425
ain't the only item
the men took issue with.

586
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:49,597
- (Geese honking)
- (Men shouting)

587
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:04,529
(Dog barking)

588
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:11,286
(Flies buzzing)

589
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:17,960
Fuck's your problem?

590
00:36:17,961 --> 00:36:19,795
The crew have elected to set sail.

591
00:36:19,796 --> 00:36:20,880
Yeah?

592
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:22,715
Small prize nearby.

593
00:36:22,716 --> 00:36:24,133
Probably not much by way of profit,

594
00:36:24,134 --> 00:36:28,186
but an easy prize to consummate
our new arrangement.

595
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:34,109
That's good news, then, yeah?

596
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:36,861
So again, fuck's your problem?

597
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,570
There was a complication

598
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:46,989
in the finalizing of the articles.

599
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,241
Opposition from the men

600
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:51,293
on two particular issues.

601
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:54,914
Shit. I knew this was gonna happen.

602
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:56,916
- It's the whore's share, ain't it?
- It is.

603
00:36:56,917 --> 00:37:00,085
Resistance to the idea of formalizing
her interest in writing.

604
00:37:00,086 --> 00:37:02,972
It's the second of the two
issues I find more troubling.

605
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:05,925
- What's that?
- You.

606
00:37:05,926 --> 00:37:08,594
It would appear that while the
crew seems able to forgive

607
00:37:08,595 --> 00:37:10,396
or at least forget my part

608
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:13,649
in the Mr. Hamund situation,

609
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,101
they are aware that you were
the prime mover behind it

610
00:37:16,102 --> 00:37:20,189
and they are less willing to forgive it
or forget it in your case.

611
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:23,242
They don't want me nor the whore?

612
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:28,113
It was put to me that they will accept
one or the other, but not both.

613
00:37:28,114 --> 00:37:30,032
Fucking hell.

614
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:31,834
How are we gonna get her
to keep turning out those leads

615
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:34,869
when she finds out she ain't
getting her own share?

616
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:42,867
What?

617
00:37:42,868 --> 00:37:45,644
It's only temporary.
Till I gain their trust.

618
00:37:45,645 --> 00:37:48,634
Sooner than later, I'll be able to
make the case to them directly.

619
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:53,389
And you'll be back sailing with us
like this never happened.

620
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,274
You chose her.

621
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:57,142
They gave me a choice,
but it was no choice.

622
00:37:57,143 --> 00:37:58,527
Had I gone the other way,

623
00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:01,313
they'd be stewing about how I
value my relationship with you

624
00:38:01,314 --> 00:38:02,815
over securing their leads.

625
00:38:02,816 --> 00:38:05,484
It would have cost me their
trust and then the captaincy.

626
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:07,620
Most assuredly soon there after.

627
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:10,372
This is what is best for both
of us in the final analysis.

628
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:12,491
We will sail at the head of this crew,

629
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:15,878
it just requires this sacrifice
in the short term to ensure it.

630
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:18,913
Anne? Anne?

631
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:30,092
Silver: Perhaps it would help
if we went back to the beginning?

632
00:38:30,093 --> 00:38:31,677
You said you were
captured by the navy.

633
00:38:31,678 --> 00:38:33,846
You said you escaped their
custody, made your way back here,

634
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:36,348
but you didn't mention the means
by which you managed that escape.

635
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:38,517
- Why are you here?
- I beg your pardon?

636
00:38:38,518 --> 00:38:41,437
Why are you the one
here defending him?

637
00:38:41,438 --> 00:38:44,023
Oh, yes. I suppose it must
come as some surprise

638
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:47,192
given the state of things
when last we saw each other.

639
00:38:47,193 --> 00:38:50,529
But it's become clear to me that a
crew requires two men to function.

640
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,867
One to tell them what to do and another
to tell them why they should want to do it.

641
00:38:54,868 --> 00:38:58,704
In Mr. Gates' absence,
the latter role was unfilled.

642
00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:00,873
And I thought I could fill it.

643
00:39:00,874 --> 00:39:02,708
How the fuck did you manage that?

644
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:06,595
I tried to tell you once,
I'm a hard man not to like.

645
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:08,714
And at the end of the day,
and all else being equal,

646
00:39:08,715 --> 00:39:11,117
liked is just as good as feared.

647
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:15,636
We like him.

648
00:39:19,225 --> 00:39:22,194
You thought Flint
killed both me and Gates

649
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:25,114
and then you queued up to be
the next to fill the post.

650
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:28,567
I don't know if you're either
very dangerous or very stupid.

651
00:39:28,568 --> 00:39:30,536
Silver:
Possibly a bit of both.

652
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:34,490
But I am certain I will avoid
the mistake you both made.

653
00:39:34,491 --> 00:39:37,659
I don't believe in him.

654
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,380
To me, he is a means of
securing a very valuable prize.

655
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:43,916
No more, no less.

656
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:46,598
Which is why I need to know...

657
00:39:48,338 --> 00:39:50,923
when asked by the men,

658
00:39:50,924 --> 00:39:54,727
what will you tell them happened on
the bow of the Walrus that night?

659
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:57,262
How did you end up in the water?

660
00:39:57,263 --> 00:40:00,314
You keep focusing on how I went in.

661
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:06,487
Perhaps you should be more worried
about the thing that took me out.

662
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:11,944
I can see how the men could've
been taken in by you...

663
00:40:11,945 --> 00:40:14,863
with what they've been through.

664
00:40:14,864 --> 00:40:16,665
But know this...

665
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,867
had I been here,

666
00:40:18,868 --> 00:40:23,038
I doubt it would have been
this easy for you.

667
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:27,292
- (Sighs)
- Sooner or later, you need to release me.

668
00:40:27,293 --> 00:40:29,962
You have no choice.

669
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:31,697
And the longer you delay,

670
00:40:31,698 --> 00:40:34,299
the more likely I might choose

671
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,169
to take it personally.

672
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:40,221
I would say I have some choice.

673
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:48,730
Not while he's here you don't.

674
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:50,765
We like him, too.

675
00:41:39,726 --> 00:41:42,734
Richard: You must understand, though
you perceive my actions in recent weeks

676
00:41:42,735 --> 00:41:45,404
to have been taken with little
regard for your welfare,

677
00:41:45,405 --> 00:41:47,656
the truth is exactly the opposite.

678
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:50,943
All of my attempts to regain
control of this place

679
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:52,744
have been with an eye
towards protecting you.

680
00:41:52,745 --> 00:41:55,080
You really have no idea
what this is about, do you?

681
00:41:55,081 --> 00:41:57,323
- Eleanor.
- You left me.

682
00:41:58,718 --> 00:42:01,686
After mother was killed in the
Rosario raid, you left me here.

683
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,058
What kind of a reprehensible shit

684
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:08,877
does something like that
to a little girl

685
00:42:08,878 --> 00:42:12,698
and then asks her to trust him again?

686
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,566
Your mother's loss

687
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:17,486
was almost unbearable to me.

688
00:42:17,487 --> 00:42:19,071
I must confess that in that moment,

689
00:42:19,072 --> 00:42:21,456
the only way I could think to carry on

690
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:23,325
was to immerse myself in business.

691
00:42:23,326 --> 00:42:25,744
And to remove myself from this place.

692
00:42:25,745 --> 00:42:27,466
From her memory.

693
00:42:30,149 --> 00:42:33,368
And for that, I am sorry.

694
00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:35,105
Bullshit.

695
00:42:36,205 --> 00:42:38,183
It wasn't about Mother.

696
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:41,028
It wasn't about an oversight.

697
00:42:43,413 --> 00:42:45,463
You left me here
because I wasn't your son.

698
00:42:52,772 --> 00:42:54,935
Yes.

699
00:42:57,443 --> 00:42:59,361
I was focused on the work

700
00:42:59,362 --> 00:43:01,830
and I saw no future in which a daughter

701
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:04,865
would have a meaningful part in that.

702
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:10,122
But, Eleanor,

703
00:43:10,123 --> 00:43:12,412
look how wrong I was.

704
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:16,428
Look at what you've accomplished here.

705
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:17,679
Pirate crews...

706
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,383
repurposed as merchant
shippers and showing profits.

707
00:43:21,384 --> 00:43:24,019
You have proved the conceit possible.

708
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,804
You are making real

709
00:43:25,805 --> 00:43:28,607
what was for decades a fantasy.

710
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:31,393
The idea that this place
can be transformed,

711
00:43:31,394 --> 00:43:35,397
made profitable, redeemed from
within and on its own terms?

712
00:43:35,398 --> 00:43:39,368
You are doing this
without any help from me,

713
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:42,821
nor from Whitehall, nor from
anyone in London at all.

714
00:43:42,822 --> 00:43:47,459
It is entirely of your own making.

715
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,878
And it is miraculous.

716
00:43:49,879 --> 00:43:51,630
One day, years from now,

717
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:53,548
someone in London will sit down,

718
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:55,667
light his pipe and tell his children

719
00:43:55,668 --> 00:44:00,422
of the unlikely success story
that was Nassau.

720
00:44:00,423 --> 00:44:02,975
And he will say
it all began with a woman

721
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:06,244
who decided to make it so.

722
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:10,816
You have proven me so very wrong.

723
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:14,047
And I could not be
prouder of you for it.

724
00:44:15,772 --> 00:44:18,690
- (Knocks on door)
- Man: Miss Guthrie? Miss Guthrie?

725
00:44:18,691 --> 00:44:19,691
(Chatter, laughter)

726
00:44:25,365 --> 00:44:28,416
I have Flint here. It would
be best if we could be alone.

727
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,920
You can use the parlor upstairs.

728
00:44:43,049 --> 00:44:46,435
Everyone out.

729
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:47,886
Now!

730
00:44:47,887 --> 00:44:48,887
(Murmuring)

731
00:45:13,413 --> 00:45:15,163
While you were gone,

732
00:45:15,164 --> 00:45:16,615
Captain Vane and his men

733
00:45:16,616 --> 00:45:20,118
slaughtered another
pirate crew in the bay.

734
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:22,921
There are whispers it was to avenge
an offense against Eleanor Guthrie.

735
00:45:22,922 --> 00:45:24,790
There are also whispers

736
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:27,492
that it was to steal a hostage
being held by that crew.

737
00:45:27,493 --> 00:45:30,245
A girl who is now held in that fort.

738
00:45:30,246 --> 00:45:32,914
A girl who would be in harm's way
if you were to launch your attack.

739
00:45:32,915 --> 00:45:35,751
You pulled me away from my men
out of concern for a girl?

740
00:45:35,752 --> 00:45:38,753
The girl's name is Abigail Ashe.

741
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:46,228
Peter's daughter?

742
00:45:46,229 --> 00:45:48,513
You need to obtain her
from Captain Vane.

743
00:45:48,514 --> 00:45:50,315
Alive and unharmed.

744
00:45:50,316 --> 00:45:52,818
And you need to return her
to Carolina, to her father.

745
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:55,270
I understand you have feelings
over the girl's welfare, however...

746
00:45:55,271 --> 00:45:57,656
And when you return her,

747
00:45:57,657 --> 00:46:00,075
you're going to explain to Peter

748
00:46:00,076 --> 00:46:03,411
what it is you are trying to
accomplish here.

749
00:46:03,412 --> 00:46:06,164
A Nassau that can self-govern,

750
00:46:06,165 --> 00:46:07,866
pardons for your men, and a
stake in their own future.

751
00:46:07,867 --> 00:46:10,919
What you want. What Thomas wanted.

752
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,538
What we all wanted.

753
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:14,790
And he is going to help you achieve it.

754
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:17,008
- He's gonna help me?
- Yes.

755
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:19,294
And how exactly is he gonna do that?

756
00:46:19,295 --> 00:46:21,963
Thomas knew no one more
skilled or effective

757
00:46:21,964 --> 00:46:25,016
at maneuvering an agenda
through Parliament than Peter.

758
00:46:25,017 --> 00:46:26,318
If he wanted to convince them

759
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,820
to support your vision for
this place, he could do that.

760
00:46:28,821 --> 00:46:30,822
You know he could do that.

761
00:46:30,823 --> 00:46:32,324
We tried it before, it didn't work.

762
00:46:32,325 --> 00:46:35,327
It was a different time.

763
00:46:35,328 --> 00:46:37,662
There's no Alfred Hamilton now.

764
00:46:37,663 --> 00:46:39,664
There's no war with Spain now.

765
00:46:39,665 --> 00:46:42,450
Peter was faced with both those
things and almost succeeded.

766
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:44,836
Without them,
it is well within his reach.

767
00:46:44,837 --> 00:46:47,489
Miranda, Peter Ashe isn't
the man that you remember.

768
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:51,343
Six months ago, he hanged
four men in his harbor

769
00:46:51,344 --> 00:46:53,995
for possession of pirated goods.

770
00:46:53,996 --> 00:46:56,081
This is not a man
that we can negotiate with...

771
00:46:56,082 --> 00:46:59,167
- that I can negotiate with.
- Of course you can.

772
00:46:59,168 --> 00:47:02,337
Because you will have just presented
him with his only daughter.

773
00:47:02,338 --> 00:47:05,974
Safe and unharmed
and without conditions.

774
00:47:05,975 --> 00:47:08,510
And you will have reminded him
that you are still the man

775
00:47:08,511 --> 00:47:10,779
who sat in Thomas' salon and spoke of

776
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,813
virtue and reason and forgiveness.

777
00:47:18,037 --> 00:47:20,087
That found inspiration in him.

778
00:47:30,016 --> 00:47:33,635
And you will remind Peter
that somewhere in his heart,

779
00:47:33,636 --> 00:47:35,187
so is he.

780
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:36,438
This is too important

781
00:47:36,439 --> 00:47:38,890
to put all our fates
in the hands of one man.

782
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:40,392
Especially a man so committed

783
00:47:40,393 --> 00:47:43,812
to seeing me and everyone else
I know hanged in his harbor.

784
00:47:43,813 --> 00:47:45,380
There is no other way to achieve
what you want to achieve...

785
00:47:45,381 --> 00:47:47,098
Yes there is!

786
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:49,317
It is sitting on a beach
filled with Spanish soldiers,

787
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:51,319
- and I'm through delaying.
- There is no other way

788
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:56,324
once you're willing to tell the
truth about your intentions here.

789
00:47:56,325 --> 00:47:58,960
I think that I've made
my intentions very clear.

790
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:00,495
No.

791
00:48:01,664 --> 00:48:05,250
You've been anything but clear.

792
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:08,420
You say you fight for the sake of
Nassau, for the sake of your men,

793
00:48:08,421 --> 00:48:12,390
for the sake of Thomas and his memory.

794
00:48:12,391 --> 00:48:15,093
But the truth of the matter is,
it isn't for any of those things.

795
00:48:15,094 --> 00:48:17,012
What the fuck do you think
I am fighting for?

796
00:48:17,013 --> 00:48:20,765
I think you are fighting
for the sake of fighting.

797
00:48:20,766 --> 00:48:23,518
Because it's the only state
in which you can function.

798
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:26,154
The only way to keep
that voice in your head

799
00:48:26,155 --> 00:48:27,489
from driving you mad.

800
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:30,524
What are you talking about?
What voice?

801
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:37,399
The one telling you
to be ashamed of yourself...

802
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,433
for having loved him.

803
00:49:24,246 --> 00:49:26,834
You were told that it was shameful.

804
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:29,796
And part of you believed it.

805
00:49:31,562 --> 00:49:33,572
Thomas was my husband.

806
00:49:33,573 --> 00:49:36,558
I loved him and he loved me.

807
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,644
But what he shared with you...

808
00:49:39,645 --> 00:49:43,648
it was entirely something else.

809
00:49:43,649 --> 00:49:47,084
It's time you allowed
yourself to accept that.

810
00:49:52,525 --> 00:49:54,525
The only thing I am ashamed of...

811
00:49:57,697 --> 00:50:01,416
is that I didn't do
something to save him

812
00:50:01,417 --> 00:50:03,450
when we had the chance.

813
00:50:08,257 --> 00:50:11,291
That instead I listened to you.

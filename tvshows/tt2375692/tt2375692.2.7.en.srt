1
00:00:03,808 --> 00:00:07,309
Tonight I will submit myself
as captain of this combined crew.

2
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:09,644
I intend to lead the men
in retaking the fort,

3
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:12,314
having ended your tyranny
over this place for good.

4
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:15,150
MAX: She's adrift.
Alone in the most terrifying way.

5
00:00:15,152 --> 00:00:16,985
You know who I am?

6
00:00:16,987 --> 00:00:19,654
I think you know who that is.
I will protect you.

7
00:00:19,656 --> 00:00:21,323
The captain of Scarborough,

8
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:24,993
he offered me and nine men
of my choosing full pardons

9
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:28,630
if I would aid him in the capture
of a fugitive from justice.

10
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:30,465
You understand what
I'm asking you to do?

11
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:31,633
Go back and watch the gold.

12
00:00:31,635 --> 00:00:33,301
Keep watch on the Spanish soldiers

13
00:00:33,303 --> 00:00:34,636
who are watching the gold.

14
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:36,805
FLINT:
Her father is a very influential man.

15
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:40,475
If I return her to him,
I believe that I can win him as an ally.

16
00:00:40,477 --> 00:00:43,311
Courting Lord Ashe and
retrieving the Urca gold

17
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:44,646
are working against each other.

18
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:46,648
If you prevent any further
attack on the fort,

19
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,483
I will bring the girl down from the hill

20
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:49,818
and deliver her to you.

21
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,140
You are no longer a hostage.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

23
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:32,299
ABIGAIL:
I remember music...

24
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,175
in her home.

25
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:43,131
It was always so warm there, so lovely.

26
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:45,967
(Men chatting)

27
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:50,472
ABIGAIL: And I remember when I would
visit there with Mother and Father,

28
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:52,307
how she would lean down

29
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:54,526
so her face was very near mine

30
00:02:54,528 --> 00:02:56,895
- and she's smile.
- (Rats squeaking)

31
00:02:58,698 --> 00:03:02,534
I remember hoping
I'd be so beautiful one day.

32
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:08,490
And I remember watching her talk
with my mother from across the room

33
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:11,159
and how she'd make my mother laugh.

34
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:19,300
And you're saying she's here?

35
00:03:19,302 --> 00:03:21,302
Lady Hamilton is on this island?

36
00:03:21,304 --> 00:03:24,138
She is. She's a friend

37
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,974
and she wants to help
rescue you from this place.

38
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:27,976
But I don't understand.

39
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:31,980
Captain Vane gave me his word
I'd be unharmed here.

40
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:33,982
Things have changed.

41
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:36,484
Things are changing as we speak tonight.

42
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:38,653
You are now worth more to him as part

43
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:40,655
of a very dangerous
game here on the island.

44
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:42,156
As such, he has no intention

45
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,326
of returning you to your
father any time soon.

46
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:49,447
Trust me. Trust Mrs. Hamilton

47
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:51,783
and know that we must
leave this place now.

48
00:03:51,785 --> 00:03:54,202
How?

49
00:03:54,204 --> 00:03:56,704
There is a network of tunnels
that run beneath the fort.

50
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:59,040
And the entrance to
one of them isn't far.

51
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:00,708
By the time anyone
realizes you are gone,

52
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,378
you will be safely away from here
and in the care of Captain Flint.

53
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,013
(Gasps)

54
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:13,021
I remember Lady Hamilton's face.

55
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:17,976
But I know Captain Flint's name.

56
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:20,478
My father's mentioned it in his letters.

57
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,615
He says Captain Flint is the most
wicked of the New World pirates.

58
00:04:23,617 --> 00:04:26,284
That he's evil.

59
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:30,622
Promise me that my escape
isn't some awful ruse

60
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:33,658
to deliver me from one madman
into the hands of another.

61
00:04:36,296 --> 00:04:38,997
Captain Flint is a good man.

62
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:44,802
If you don't trust my word about it...

63
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:47,005
trust hers.

64
00:04:52,812 --> 00:04:55,013
Where do we go?

65
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:58,016
(Men clamoring)

66
00:04:58,018 --> 00:05:00,234
Shut up. Just get it done.

67
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,667
BILLY:
Where's your count?

68
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,287
Hard to tell.

69
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:22,790
Everyone's holding this one close.

70
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:25,460
Well, I'm hearing you're up three.

71
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:27,629
I have it as four.

72
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:29,130
- You have Dobson as a nay.
- Yes.

73
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:30,798
- Brewer's a nay.
- Yes.

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
- Winslow?
- Winslow?

75
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:34,469
No, he's a yea vote.

76
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:36,304
When did you ask him?

77
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:39,140
A little while ago.
Why, has something happened?

78
00:05:39,142 --> 00:05:41,643
He got into it with
Muldoon over last mess,

79
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:44,646
said Muldoon was chewing
too loud or something.

80
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:47,482
Muldoon brought his mother into it.

81
00:05:47,484 --> 00:05:50,818
Muldoon's in your camp,
so Winslow flipped as a "fuck you."

82
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:55,373
- Seriously.
- (Scoffs)

83
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,542
- That's a good one.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:57,544 --> 00:05:59,043
My seamanship,

85
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:02,664
my prospects for garnering plunder,

86
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,799
my skill in a fight,
the sound of my voice,

87
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:06,634
the sound of another man's eating.

88
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:08,803
I suppose at the end of the day,

89
00:06:08,805 --> 00:06:10,805
they're all functionally equivalent.

90
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:14,842
A man casts his vote for the same
reason he does anything in his life.

91
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,479
Why's that?

92
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:21,482
Because it feels good.

93
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:24,485
Three votes, four votes.

94
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:27,855
30 of them will change their minds
before they raise their hands tonight.

95
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,659
The thing that will decide this vote

96
00:06:31,661 --> 00:06:33,027
hasn't happened yet.

97
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:37,448
You're going to convince
them they'll feel better

98
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,783
about voting for you over him.

99
00:06:38,785 --> 00:06:41,953
I think I've got a pretty strong case.

100
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:44,288
His way, a lot of them will die tonight.

101
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,958
My way, they won't
and we'll gain the favor

102
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,845
of a man who could move this place
a step closer to sustainability.

103
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:55,550
BILLY:
Perhaps.

104
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:58,720
Though, still, his argument
would seem to be the easier one.

105
00:06:58,722 --> 00:07:01,389
- You think?
- Sure.

106
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:05,476
"Captain Flint will betray
anyone to get what he wants."

107
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:09,113
Yesterday it was Mr. Gates,
today it was me.

108
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:11,649
"Which one of you would
like to be tomorrow?"

109
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:16,320
DUFRESNE:
Captain?

110
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:20,992
They're ready.

111
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:27,832
(Men chatting)

112
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:35,673
There's only one item for
consideration tonight.

113
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,510
Captain Hornigold?

114
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:54,859
HORNIGOLD:
A man asks for your trust,

115
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:58,863
he asks and offers you
things in the future.

116
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:02,533
And the brighter those things may be,
the more you must ask yourself,

117
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:06,504
"What is it they are intended
to blind me to in the present?"

118
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:12,960
It's no surprise that that man

119
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:16,130
wants to shift your
attention to the future.

120
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:18,966
To the things he says he can give you.

121
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:21,636
To the hardships he can remove.

122
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:25,807
A most shining future
it would have to be

123
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:28,309
for him to blind you to the cowardly

124
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,978
and devious acts of his past...

125
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,649
theft, betrayal, lies, murder!

126
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:36,317
(Men shouting)

127
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:38,820
HORNIGOLD: When we first elected
to merge these crews...

128
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:40,321
Where the fuck have you been?

129
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:42,490
A launch landed on the
beach a short while ago.

130
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:44,826
The news it brings is of
the upmost importance.

131
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:46,994
More important than losing
our ship to Captain Hornigold?

132
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:48,796
Yes.

133
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:52,466
HORNIGOLD: ...have been wrenched from us
by men of the worst sort...

134
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:55,002
They're supposed to be watching
over the gold until we arrive.

135
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:56,671
What the fuck are they doing back?

136
00:08:56,673 --> 00:08:59,006
Because there's no longer
any gold to watch over.

137
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:01,509
It's gone.

138
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:02,677
- MAN: It's gone.
- MAN #2: Did he say gone?

139
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,145
MAN #3:
Did someone say gone?

140
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:06,314
The gold is gone.
You hear that? It's gone!

141
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:08,850
(Men clamoring)

142
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,320
- MAN: The gold is gone!
- MAN #2: I don't believe it.

143
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:14,021
MAN #3:
Who could've taken it?

144
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:30,004
This is clean.

145
00:09:50,643 --> 00:09:53,144
It is as if it never happened.

146
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:56,781
Anything tying you to
yesterday's events is gone.

147
00:09:56,783 --> 00:09:59,116
There will be questions, of course,

148
00:09:59,118 --> 00:10:00,952
but should any find their way to you,

149
00:10:00,954 --> 00:10:04,956
know that the other girls are
discussing openly downstairs

150
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,626
Charlotte and her lover's decision
to escape together to Providence.

151
00:10:08,628 --> 00:10:11,329
All you need to do is say the same.

152
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:28,596
These will not fit you,
but they are clean.

153
00:10:28,598 --> 00:10:32,099
When you are ready, I will be downstairs

154
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:35,486
and we can discuss what comes next.

155
00:10:41,444 --> 00:10:44,161
I was married to a man once.

156
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:49,450
Rotten fuck...

157
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:52,119
raised his hands at me,

158
00:10:52,121 --> 00:10:54,872
burned me,

159
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:57,091
shared me with his men.

160
00:10:58,044 --> 00:11:00,845
I didn't know any different,

161
00:11:00,847 --> 00:11:02,880
didn't know I could
do anything about it.

162
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:06,634
Even if I had,

163
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:08,970
I wouldn't have thought I had it in me.

164
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,808
One day, we were in a tavern.

165
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,144
He was hurting me.

166
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:20,147
And a man saw it.

167
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:23,651
And he walked over...

168
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:25,653
and he slit his throat.

169
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,826
That was Jack.

170
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:37,498
I was 13.

171
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:44,638
I always thought
he saved me from something.

172
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,008
Always been so fucking grateful.

173
00:11:48,644 --> 00:11:50,678
Now I wonder...

174
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:54,515
maybe Jack took me from something

175
00:11:54,517 --> 00:11:57,068
I was supposed to figure
my own way out of.

176
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:03,240
Maybe he took away the chance
to get strong enough to save myself.

177
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:07,995
To grow up.

178
00:12:11,284 --> 00:12:13,617
Instead, I went with him,

179
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:16,287
did what he did,

180
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:18,672
did what the others did.

181
00:12:21,794 --> 00:12:23,677
Thought I'd become one of them.

182
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,138
If I'm not what I was when I was born,

183
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,857
and I ain't what I've become instead...

184
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:41,312
what the fuck am I?

185
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:57,244
She's going to rest for now.

186
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:02,383
I know this is the last
thing you need to hear,

187
00:13:02,385 --> 00:13:04,668
but me and the girls were talking.

188
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:09,974
We know what risks
we face with the turns.

189
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:13,177
How to avoid them, protect against them.

190
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:16,931
- What she did to Charlotte...
- Don't.

191
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:19,600
That's not something we
know how to protect against.

192
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:21,936
Shouldn't we be focusing on
getting her out the door right now

193
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:24,438
before it's one of us next?

194
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,108
Please don't be the voice of this.

195
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,610
If you're concerned that by
removing her from this place

196
00:13:29,612 --> 00:13:31,946
she could get violent with you,

197
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:34,115
there are men we can talk to

198
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,783
about making sure she can't hurt you.

199
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:37,952
I don't want to hear that again.

200
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:40,671
Not from you,
not from the other girls, ever.

201
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,126
When no one in the world...

202
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:48,963
no one... no one...

203
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:52,466
could care less about what those men
were doing to me on the beach,

204
00:13:52,468 --> 00:13:54,685
she did.

205
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:57,021
That means something to me.

206
00:13:57,023 --> 00:14:02,026
So for as long as she desires,
this place will be a safe place for her.

207
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:06,313
And those men you would talk
to about solving this problem?

208
00:14:06,315 --> 00:14:08,482
They value their relationship with me

209
00:14:08,484 --> 00:14:11,652
far more than they do
yours or Isabella's

210
00:14:11,654 --> 00:14:15,156
or anyone on that floor.

211
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:18,826
If I hear from those men that
inquiries have been made about them,

212
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:22,329
I will not receive that news well.
Is that clear?

213
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:31,505
Idelle...

214
00:14:35,478 --> 00:14:38,679
please let the girls know
I understand their concern.

215
00:14:40,316 --> 00:14:43,317
If any one of them wish to come to me,

216
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:45,653
my door is open.

217
00:14:45,655 --> 00:14:47,521
I will.

218
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:56,530
Two guardacosta men-of-war sitting
right in the bay when we arrived.

219
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:58,365
We made our way down to
the ridge and watched

220
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,534
while they ferried it
all into their holds.

221
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:04,455
Watched that gold disappear
from that beach piece by piece,

222
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:06,624
and watched them weigh
anchor and set sail.

223
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:09,793
When it was all clear,
we walked the beach.

224
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:11,795
Not a fucking piece left behind.

225
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:14,632
Not a fucking piece.

226
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:16,350
Thank you.

227
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:28,279
What's happening out there?

228
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:31,282
They've called council to
debate how they wish to proceed.

229
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:32,950
That should be productive.

230
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:35,452
DUFRESNE: The good news for you
is Hornigold's support

231
00:15:35,454 --> 00:15:37,454
has disappeared completely.

232
00:15:37,456 --> 00:15:39,957
There's not a soul among
them that has any appetite

233
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,792
for fighting over the fort tonight.

234
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:44,628
Without the gold,
it all seems rather pointless.

235
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,132
- And the bad news?
- It's chaos out there.

236
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:50,801
Likely to be for some time.

237
00:15:50,803 --> 00:15:55,055
There are as many proposals for
what ought to be our next score

238
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:56,724
as there are men to voice them,

239
00:15:56,726 --> 00:15:59,560
including ransoming that
hostage girl of yours

240
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:01,845
for cash instead of favors.

241
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:04,148
If she's ever delivered to us.

242
00:16:05,768 --> 00:16:08,769
One way or the other,
those men want to get paid.

243
00:16:08,771 --> 00:16:10,154
And soon.

244
00:16:11,774 --> 00:16:14,675
May we have the room, please?

245
00:16:21,784 --> 00:16:24,118
What a fucking mess.

246
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,121
We have to think very carefully

247
00:16:27,123 --> 00:16:30,791
about how to navigate these next steps.

248
00:16:30,793 --> 00:16:32,960
The case for returning
the girl to Charles Town

249
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:36,130
in exchange for reconciliation
cannot come from me.

250
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:38,465
I've just had my authority challenged.

251
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:41,468
Even on it's merits,
the argument would seem desperate

252
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,471
and invite doubt and suspicion.

253
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:48,309
But if it came from you,
we might just stand a chance...

254
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:50,477
SILVER:
Let me stop you right there.

255
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:53,147
There is no "we."

256
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:56,033
We stopped being a thing of any
relevance about an hour ago.

257
00:16:56,035 --> 00:16:57,868
Is that so?

258
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,205
I believe I've been clear about
the nature of my investment here.

259
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:03,991
The gold was the inducement.

260
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:06,827
- Now no gold...
- It's an unfortunate development

261
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,796
that we have to adapt, and quickly.

262
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,132
Adapt? I've had about my
fill of adapting lately.

263
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:14,468
Doing your bidding,
keeping the crew in line for you.

264
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,303
I wasn't the only one
to benefit from that.

265
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:18,305
It certainly seemed that way.

266
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:20,474
Even now you're the only
one benefitting from it.

267
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:23,143
What are you saying,
that I'm benefitting

268
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:24,812
from the gold having disappeared?

269
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:27,514
It certainly solved a number
of problems for you, didn't it?

270
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:31,151
I have half a mind to wonder
if you didn't orchestrate

271
00:17:31,153 --> 00:17:33,487
this whole thing to your advantage.

272
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:35,989
Listen to me.

273
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:38,492
I understand your disappointment
at this recent news.

274
00:17:38,494 --> 00:17:40,611
I share it.

275
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:42,780
But I need your help.

276
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:45,616
- They need your help.
- Oh, please.

277
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:48,285
Don't try to convince me to do it
for the sake of their futures.

278
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,670
For the sake of your own.

279
00:17:51,457 --> 00:17:54,875
Those men listen to you. They give
a shit about what you have to say.

280
00:17:54,877 --> 00:17:57,211
What you think,
what you want them to think.

281
00:17:57,213 --> 00:18:00,381
Where else in the world is that true?

282
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:03,384
Where else would you wake up
in the morning and matter?

283
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:09,022
You walk out on this,
and where the fuck are you going?

284
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:17,981
You'll address the men?

285
00:18:20,286 --> 00:18:21,618
Yeah.

286
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,121
Many of them won't want to hear it.

287
00:18:24,123 --> 00:18:26,990
Don't you want to discuss
how you'll approach them?

288
00:18:30,963 --> 00:18:33,497
I know what I'm doing.

289
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:40,337
(Men chatting)

290
00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:44,975
(Thuds)

291
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:46,844
(Chatter stops)

292
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:53,567
Some fuckin' day, huh?

293
00:18:57,523 --> 00:19:01,358
I'm sure you idiots had half
that money spent already.

294
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,445
What were you gone do with it?

295
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:06,280
- SILVER: Me?
- Mm.

296
00:19:06,282 --> 00:19:09,450
I was gone walk away from all
you people and never look back.

297
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:11,785
(Scattered laughter)

298
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:14,288
I mean it. That money was license

299
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,623
for me to leave all of this

300
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,960
and all of you behind.

301
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:22,963
And any one of you who says he didn't
at least consider doing the same

302
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:25,466
is a lying sack of shit.

303
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:27,801
Truth is,
there's only one kind of person

304
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:32,139
who'd want to do what we do
if there was an easier way to survive.

305
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:36,643
And because I don't believe there is
a rotten, murdering fuck amongst you,

306
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:39,813
I don't imagine I'm alone
in having taken some comfort

307
00:19:39,815 --> 00:19:42,816
in the idea of all of
this coming to an end.

308
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,156
But now...

309
00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:50,657
no gold.

310
00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:57,631
We're back to the same two choices
we've known our entire lives...

311
00:19:57,633 --> 00:20:00,968
toil for another man's benefit

312
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,837
or steal for our own.

313
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:09,009
Unless...

314
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,014
Captain Flint just
showed us a third way.

315
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,186
Reconciliation.

316
00:20:22,658 --> 00:20:24,658
Pardons.

317
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,995
And not because we need to
apologize for what we've done.

318
00:20:29,615 --> 00:20:32,833
Not because we got any desire to
go back to where we came from.

319
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:38,121
But because maybe...

320
00:20:38,123 --> 00:20:40,958
with a little help...

321
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,511
this place could be the reason
we never have to do either again.

322
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:49,967
The question then becomes

323
00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:53,136
what do we have to lose?

324
00:20:53,138 --> 00:20:55,375
Truly amazing.

325
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,892
With that one and the captain aligned,

326
00:20:58,894 --> 00:21:00,694
there would seem to be no
limits to their ability

327
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:03,063
to manipulate sentiment among the men.

328
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:10,120
Perhaps the men are swayed
by the strength of the argument.

329
00:21:10,122 --> 00:21:14,458
A political alliance with the most
dogged pirate hunter in the New World?

330
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,994
Because once they were friends?

331
00:21:18,964 --> 00:21:22,332
I think it's clear what
needs to happen next, Billy.

332
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:29,306
So easy for you to betray your oath?

333
00:21:29,308 --> 00:21:32,509
I'm aware of my oath.

334
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,599
Those men are my brothers,
same as yours.

335
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:41,768
But because they would
march blindly to their end,

336
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,771
does that mean we must as well?

337
00:21:44,773 --> 00:21:49,109
If you and I know we have the opportunity
to save eight of them from that fate,

338
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:51,612
give eight of them a real future,

339
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:54,698
and we can actually deliver,

340
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,868
doesn't our oath compel us to do so?

341
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,088
Are those eight men not
our brothers as well?

342
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:09,630
Do you think you could find eight men
that would see things the same way?

343
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:12,466
I do.

344
00:22:12,468 --> 00:22:17,137
Men who would be willing
to betray the captain,

345
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:19,306
assist us in subduing him,

346
00:22:19,308 --> 00:22:22,476
and deliver him to the Navy by force?

347
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:27,147
I do.

348
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:35,989
Then find them.

349
00:22:35,991 --> 00:22:38,158
We'll meet at the bluffs in an hour,

350
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,993
then we move.

351
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:19,332
(People chatting, laughing)

352
00:23:44,476 --> 00:23:46,359
Sit.

353
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:54,901
(Speaking French)

354
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:03,043
I have some business to attend to.

355
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:04,628
Eat.

356
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,664
When I return,
you and I will discuss the road ahead.

357
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:25,982
MAN:
It's better on Wednesdays.

358
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:38,945
Alice gets the leavings
from the tavern on Tuesdays,

359
00:24:38,947 --> 00:24:41,665
so on Wednesdays, it is a bisque.

360
00:24:43,118 --> 00:24:46,670
Friday, it's more of a stew.

361
00:24:47,956 --> 00:24:49,790
And Saturday... I'm not even sure Alice

362
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:52,125
knows what to call that
for her Saturday's.

363
00:24:52,127 --> 00:24:54,377
Don't you know who I am?

364
00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:57,047
No, why? You famous?

365
00:24:58,684 --> 00:25:01,685
- No.
- Me, either.

366
00:25:01,687 --> 00:25:03,637
Though I am working on it.

367
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:09,810
Jacob Garret,
carpenter's mate with the Intrepid.

368
00:25:13,148 --> 00:25:15,482
So you don't want to tell me your name?

369
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:19,820
All right, suit yourself.

370
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:23,156
Yeah, a couple of the guys
and I are working on a plan

371
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:26,159
to split off and start our own crew.

372
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:27,961
Now, I only tell you this
so when you start hearing

373
00:25:27,963 --> 00:25:29,462
Captain Jacob Garret stories,

374
00:25:29,464 --> 00:25:31,298
you'll be able to put a face to a name.

375
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,801
Jesus Christ, Jacob.
She don't need your life story.

376
00:25:34,803 --> 00:25:37,971
Take her upstairs, fuck her already.

377
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:40,507
We ain't got all night.

378
00:25:42,311 --> 00:25:44,978
If it makes you feel any better,
Captain Jacob Garret

379
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,180
would never have a man
like that on his crew.

380
00:25:52,988 --> 00:25:55,405
Why me?

381
00:25:56,358 --> 00:25:58,191
Because you're new.

382
00:25:58,193 --> 00:26:00,243
And you seem nice.

383
00:26:02,698 --> 00:26:03,997
What do you think?

384
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:43,620
(Groans)

385
00:26:43,622 --> 00:26:45,488
So, aren't you gonna tell me the rules?

386
00:26:48,293 --> 00:26:49,826
No?

387
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:52,963
You're supposed to
tell me what's allowed.

388
00:26:52,965 --> 00:26:54,381
I tell you what I want.

389
00:26:54,383 --> 00:26:57,550
You tell me how much it costs.

390
00:26:57,552 --> 00:27:00,887
No? All right. Not a problem.

391
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:02,889
Well, why don't we...

392
00:27:02,891 --> 00:27:04,975
look, all right,

393
00:27:04,977 --> 00:27:07,310
usually the girls would
charge me five pieces...

394
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:09,145
(Jacob's voice fades)

395
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:14,818
I'm thoroughly boring, not into any
of the weird or controversial stuff.

396
00:27:19,274 --> 00:27:21,107
What do you think?

397
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:23,994
Does that sound fair to you?

398
00:27:49,304 --> 00:27:52,138
IDELLE:
Are you kidding me?

399
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,859
You can't do this.
I'm sorry, she's new.

400
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:58,862
Left another man downstairs under the
impression he was her guest for the night.

401
00:27:58,864 --> 00:28:01,031
Look, I wasn't trying to
make any trouble, all right?

402
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,400
This is her fault, not yours.

403
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:06,820
In fact,

404
00:28:06,822 --> 00:28:09,322
the management would like
me to make it up to you.

405
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:14,327
On account of the confusion.

406
00:28:17,466 --> 00:28:19,833
(Laughs)

407
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,807
I'm sorry, ma'am, but may I ask,

408
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:53,143
how did you arrive in this place?

409
00:29:53,145 --> 00:29:56,096
My father brought me
here when I was a child.

410
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:58,098
Was he one of them?

411
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,650
(Chuckles) No, he was most assuredly
not one of them.

412
00:30:02,437 --> 00:30:04,604
I remember when my father

413
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:06,990
told me he was leaving for Carolina.

414
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,276
He left me behind.

415
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:13,947
He said Charles Town was far
too coarse and violent a place

416
00:30:13,949 --> 00:30:15,498
to bring a child into.

417
00:30:17,953 --> 00:30:20,286
But you seem a formidable woman, ma'am.

418
00:30:20,288 --> 00:30:23,123
Perhaps it was exposure to
the challenges of this place

419
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,508
that made you the person you are.

420
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,296
I suppose that's one way to look at it.

421
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:58,074
(Grunts)

422
00:31:03,331 --> 00:31:07,167
(Grunting)

423
00:31:08,637 --> 00:31:10,837
(Panting)

424
00:31:19,814 --> 00:31:21,814
We staggered our departures from camp

425
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:23,816
so as not to arouse suspicion.

426
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:25,852
Did you secure the skiff?

427
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:31,191
Billy, someone's coming.

428
00:31:41,786 --> 00:31:44,504
What is this?

429
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:49,125
Have you ever been tortured?

430
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:50,960
What?

431
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:54,047
Suffered pain applied by men

432
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:56,382
who saw you as less than a man?

433
00:31:56,384 --> 00:31:58,551
Saw you as an animal?

434
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:03,389
'Cause it isn't actually
the pain they're inflicting

435
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:04,807
that's the most frightening part of it.

436
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:08,111
It isn't the fear of future pain.

437
00:32:08,113 --> 00:32:11,114
It's the knowledge

438
00:32:11,116 --> 00:32:13,283
that even when the pain stops,

439
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:16,452
even if they were to let you go,

440
00:32:16,454 --> 00:32:18,154
that they've changed you.

441
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:24,294
That pain, that fear,

442
00:32:24,296 --> 00:32:26,496
that despair...

443
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:30,967
has made you someone else,

444
00:32:30,969 --> 00:32:34,470
someone you barely recognize.

445
00:32:34,472 --> 00:32:36,339
Against your will.

446
00:32:39,644 --> 00:32:43,596
I said what I had to say
to get out of that place,

447
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:47,150
but I have no intention
of honoring their offer.

448
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:53,573
10 pardons.

449
00:32:57,028 --> 00:33:00,363
I would fight to the death
to ensure not a single one

450
00:33:00,365 --> 00:33:03,499
of my brothers ever has
to face what I faced.

451
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,954
Now, if there's a man on this
crew that feels differently,

452
00:33:07,956 --> 00:33:09,455
that feels as though he'd be willing

453
00:33:09,457 --> 00:33:12,125
to accept another brother
suffering that fate

454
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:15,461
so that he might avoid it,

455
00:33:15,463 --> 00:33:18,464
then that's a man I need
to remove from my crew.

456
00:33:20,802 --> 00:33:23,970
Right now, Mr. Dufresne here
has identified you men

457
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:26,806
as the most likely to
represent such a problem.

458
00:33:29,144 --> 00:33:30,810
Was he right?

459
00:33:30,812 --> 00:33:32,979
MAN: Don't appreciate
being fucked with, Billy.

460
00:33:32,981 --> 00:33:35,982
If you ain't got the balls to
stand up to Flint, maybe you...

461
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,819
(Grunts)

462
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,159
(Coughs)

463
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:47,994
(Man groans)

464
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:57,553
There will be no more dissent
against Captain Flint.

465
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:03,176
There will be no
subversion of his plans.

466
00:34:03,178 --> 00:34:05,645
There will be nothing but adherence

467
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:09,649
to the principal that
we are none of us safe

468
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:12,852
until we are all safe.

469
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:18,524
Does anyone have a problem with that?

470
00:34:23,281 --> 00:34:25,164
Then be on your way.

471
00:34:39,464 --> 00:34:41,013
(Door clanging)

472
00:34:43,635 --> 00:34:45,635
Fuck!

473
00:34:45,637 --> 00:34:46,969
Is there another way around?

474
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:49,639
Not without going back
through the courtyard.

475
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:51,641
And if they haven't checked
your cell yet, they will soon.

476
00:34:51,643 --> 00:34:52,975
When they see that you've gone,

477
00:34:52,977 --> 00:34:54,694
they'll search every inch
of this fort until they...

478
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:56,562
- (Distant clang)
- (Gasps)

479
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:04,153
(Clanging)

480
00:35:08,126 --> 00:35:09,325
They're coming.

481
00:35:10,962 --> 00:35:13,830
Oh, God.

482
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:24,006

- (Creaking)

484
00:35:45,613 --> 00:35:47,663
(Groaning)

485
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,423
Let me help.

486
00:36:04,466 --> 00:36:06,132
Now go.

487
00:36:08,303 --> 00:36:09,802
Here, take this.

488
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:17,477
(Creaking)

489
00:36:19,814 --> 00:36:21,981
(Footsteps approaching)

490
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:35,127
(Lock clicks)

491
00:36:35,129 --> 00:36:37,830
(Gasps)

492
00:36:52,313 --> 00:36:55,348
- VANE: I saved your life.
- (Abigail whimpers)

493
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,352
I killed him for you.

494
00:36:59,354 --> 00:37:01,521
Low and his crew.

495
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:03,990
I killed them all to protect you.

496
00:37:03,992 --> 00:37:06,692
You didn't do it for me.

497
00:37:08,446 --> 00:37:11,831
You will turn on absolutely anyone,
won't you?

498
00:37:13,785 --> 00:37:15,952
So what's the plan?

499
00:37:15,954 --> 00:37:18,955
Leave me to answer for
this among the men?

500
00:37:18,957 --> 00:37:20,790
Assume they'll tear me to pieces

501
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:23,125
for granting access to the woman

502
00:37:23,127 --> 00:37:26,128
who stole the girl out from under us?

503
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,464
My death sentence?

504
00:37:28,466 --> 00:37:31,017
Listen to me clearly.

505
00:37:33,137 --> 00:37:37,139
Put down that key,
walk back through that gate,

506
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:39,475
return the girl,

507
00:37:39,477 --> 00:37:42,278
and I will sort this with the men.

508
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,947
You have my word.

509
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:47,116
But lock that gate

510
00:37:47,118 --> 00:37:51,153
and there is no walking back
through it, ever.

511
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,708
And I assure you,

512
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,744
you will hear from me again.

513
00:38:11,142 --> 00:38:13,175
(Lock clicks)

514
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,790
MAX:
I know how you feel.

515
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:48,461
Not that long ago, I was lost.

516
00:38:48,463 --> 00:38:50,129
Without friends.

517
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:52,798
Without identity.

518
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,351
I thought there was no life
for me that I understood

519
00:38:55,353 --> 00:38:59,522
and I felt as though that
meant there was no life at all.

520
00:38:59,524 --> 00:39:01,357
But I was wrong.

521
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,143
Especially in this place.

522
00:39:04,145 --> 00:39:06,312
There is always a life,

523
00:39:06,314 --> 00:39:09,315
there is always a future,

524
00:39:09,317 --> 00:39:12,818
as long as one is willing
to build it for themselves.

525
00:39:14,155 --> 00:39:15,988
Now, though,
I am beginning to understand

526
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,491
there are limits to what
one can build alone.

527
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:24,630
I can only scavenge leads
generated by Eleanor for so long.

528
00:39:24,632 --> 00:39:26,966
I have an appetite for
something larger than that,

529
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:29,335
and it requires expanding.

530
00:39:31,472 --> 00:39:33,305
Proper spies.

531
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:36,475
Perhaps off the island as well.

532
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:39,145
For this, I need a partner
with knowledge of the sea

533
00:39:39,147 --> 00:39:41,514
and I need a partner I can trust.

534
00:39:53,494 --> 00:39:56,112
No word?

535
00:39:56,114 --> 00:39:57,496
No, no word.

536
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:04,120
If Eleanor says she'll come
down that hill with Abigail,

537
00:40:04,122 --> 00:40:06,122
she will.

538
00:40:06,124 --> 00:40:08,624
I understand that once
the girl is delivered

539
00:40:08,626 --> 00:40:11,794
and Captain Flint's set sail
to return her to Charles Town

540
00:40:11,796 --> 00:40:14,296
that you intend to join
them for the voyage.

541
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:16,966
Is that true?

542
00:40:16,968 --> 00:40:20,803
With all due respect, Mr. Guthrie,

543
00:40:20,805 --> 00:40:22,805
what concern is it of yours?

544
00:40:22,807 --> 00:40:26,976
Charles Town, ma'am, is not London.

545
00:40:26,978 --> 00:40:29,445
It may appear to you to
be a civilized place,

546
00:40:29,447 --> 00:40:33,616
but rest assured,
it only appears that way.

547
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:37,787
Governor Ashe and his militia
are men of the most brutal kind

548
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:40,322
when it comes to
enforcement of the laws.

549
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:07,316
Hello, Abigail.

550
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:13,322
I'm Miranda Hamilton.
Do you remember me?

551
00:41:18,112 --> 00:41:20,329
(Sobbing)

552
00:41:42,303 --> 00:41:44,970
(Door opens)

553
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:56,876
I don't suppose
you'd mind sharing that bottle?

554
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:03,632
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer to be alone.

555
00:43:03,634 --> 00:43:06,802
Shame.

556
00:43:06,804 --> 00:43:10,189
Because there is something
we really ought to discuss.

557
00:43:11,475 --> 00:43:13,976
If this is about Charlotte
and Mr. Logan, I assure you...

558
00:43:13,978 --> 00:43:16,979
I heard on the beach
they're in Providence.

559
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,983
Why, did you hear something different?

560
00:43:22,787 --> 00:43:25,154
Then what is it you wish to discuss?

561
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:30,492
Best we do this in private.

562
00:43:32,964 --> 00:43:35,664
(Waves lapping)

563
00:43:46,477 --> 00:43:47,977
BILLY:
Can I have a word?

564
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:54,066
Of course.

565
00:43:57,188 --> 00:43:59,188
I'm waiting on a final tally,

566
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:03,242
but I believe we've lost around
18 defectors over the last few hours.

567
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:08,781
Some due to loss of the gold,

568
00:44:08,783 --> 00:44:11,951
some following Hornigold out
the door out of loyalty to him.

569
00:44:11,953 --> 00:44:14,286
Anyone we'll miss?

570
00:44:14,288 --> 00:44:15,955
Mr. Dufresne.

571
00:44:15,957 --> 00:44:17,790
Really?

572
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:20,292
He saw the crew's
overwhelming support for you,

573
00:44:20,294 --> 00:44:22,628
felt his resentment towards
you had become an impediment

574
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,630
in his existing amongst them.

575
00:44:24,632 --> 00:44:28,300
So we are without a quartermaster.

576
00:44:28,302 --> 00:44:31,971
For the moment.
We should take care to steer the men

577
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:34,139
towards a replacement
from Hornigold's men.

578
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:36,141
Someone to fold the two crews together

579
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:38,978
but not someone who's gone offer
you any personal resistance.

580
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,480
I was thinking Mr. Scott
might be an ideal candidate.

581
00:44:41,482 --> 00:44:44,817
Billy, I don't mean to be blunt,
but what the fuck are you doing?

582
00:44:45,987 --> 00:44:47,653
Why am I supporting your captaincy?

583
00:44:47,655 --> 00:44:49,321
Yes.

584
00:44:50,825 --> 00:44:54,376
When I went into the water that night

585
00:44:54,378 --> 00:44:56,495
after Andromache,

586
00:44:56,497 --> 00:45:01,166
I remember losing my
footing on the bowsprit.

587
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:03,469
I remember as I was falling,

588
00:45:03,471 --> 00:45:07,473
reaching out, grasping your hand.

589
00:45:07,475 --> 00:45:10,809
And the last thing I remember
before I went into the water

590
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:13,312
was feeling it slip away.

591
00:45:13,314 --> 00:45:17,483
Now, I told the men
you tried to save me.

592
00:45:17,485 --> 00:45:19,651
But the truth is

593
00:45:19,653 --> 00:45:23,822
it's just as likely you let go

594
00:45:23,824 --> 00:45:26,492
and dropped me into the sea.

595
00:45:26,494 --> 00:45:29,278
Which do you think it was?

596
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,781
Doesn't much matter,
as far as I can tell.

597
00:45:32,783 --> 00:45:35,284
I'll likely never know for certain.

598
00:45:35,286 --> 00:45:38,287
It's possible you'll never
even know for certain.

599
00:45:38,289 --> 00:45:40,789
And right now, I'm more focused

600
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:44,126
on what comes next than what's passed.

601
00:45:44,128 --> 00:45:47,629
I believe you were right.

602
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:49,798
I believe that for what comes next,

603
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,135
the men of this crew will
need your leadership.

604
00:45:53,137 --> 00:45:55,220
So I will do what needs to be done

605
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:57,556
to preserve it and protect it.

606
00:45:57,558 --> 00:46:01,026
Mr. Gates turned his back on you.

607
00:46:01,028 --> 00:46:04,446
Don't think for a second
I'll make the same mistake he did.

608
00:46:04,448 --> 00:46:08,951
- MULDOON: Captain?
- Yes?

609
00:46:08,953 --> 00:46:11,987
Word from the tavern.
Miss Guthrie's asked for you.

610
00:46:52,613 --> 00:46:55,414
Why don't you introduce yourself?

611
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:16,969
Don't be frightened.

612
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,807
I'm a friend of your family's.

613
00:47:23,477 --> 00:47:26,311
And I'm a friend of yours.

614
00:47:30,651 --> 00:47:32,484
You're Captain Flint?

615
00:47:32,486 --> 00:47:35,320
My name is James.

616
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:40,826
James McGraw.

617
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,224
Where are you headed?

618
00:47:57,178 --> 00:48:00,345
That's a very good question.

619
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:04,149
I'm far too recognizable
for the English colonies.

620
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:06,985
I'd spend the rest of my days
looking over my shoulder.

621
00:48:06,987 --> 00:48:09,154
It's shameful...

622
00:48:09,156 --> 00:48:12,658
for a man who's defended
this place for so long.

623
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,159
Cast aside by it.

624
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:16,612
Perhaps it has cast me aside.

625
00:48:16,614 --> 00:48:19,615
Or perhaps it's just taken me this long

626
00:48:19,617 --> 00:48:22,501
to realize this place has
been dying for a long time.

627
00:48:23,954 --> 00:48:26,788
I may be an old man, but I see no reason

628
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:29,958
to allow it to drag me into my grave.

629
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,628
What if you didn't have to go anywhere?

630
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:34,630
Oh, England will have
her island back, son.

631
00:48:34,632 --> 00:48:37,966
The day that happens,
it'll be a bad day to be a pirate here.

632
00:48:37,968 --> 00:48:40,802
Unless we had something to offer them

633
00:48:40,804 --> 00:48:44,139
that might change their
thinking about us.

634
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:45,807
You think there's
something valuable enough

635
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:48,477
to make the British Navy forget
that you and I are pirates?

636
00:48:50,281 --> 00:48:53,699
And what do you think would
have that kind of value to them?

637
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:55,701
Not what.

638
00:48:55,703 --> 00:48:57,569
Who.

639
00:49:02,876 --> 00:49:05,627
How soon before you can sail?

640
00:49:05,629 --> 00:49:08,497
First light. No need to delay.

641
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,301
My father has left for the
interior to lay the groundwork

642
00:49:12,303 --> 00:49:14,803
with Mr. Underhill for the partnership.

643
00:49:14,805 --> 00:49:17,639
With any luck, by the time you return,

644
00:49:17,641 --> 00:49:20,926
you and Governor Ashe will be
greeted by a group of handsome men,

645
00:49:20,928 --> 00:49:24,763
pretty wives, and rosy-cheeked children.

646
00:49:24,765 --> 00:49:27,432
Lawful citizens of
New Providence Island,

647
00:49:27,434 --> 00:49:30,269
who, after decades of struggle,
have finally have found a way

648
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:32,988
to sell their sugarcane
to honest markets.

649
00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:38,277
You know, if you and I aren't careful,

650
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:40,829
we might actually see
this thing through.

651
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:47,452
I took her.

652
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:49,338
Without his consent.

653
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:52,958
You know that, don't you?

654
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,127
I had the thought.

655
00:49:57,131 --> 00:50:00,632
His men warned him not to trust me.

656
00:50:00,634 --> 00:50:03,302
They told him that I
would betray them all.

657
00:50:06,974 --> 00:50:09,141
Do you think there's any
chance he'll survive this?

658
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:19,651
The things I have destroyed
to reach this moment...

659
00:50:21,322 --> 00:50:24,489
everything and anything
that stood in it's way.

660
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:29,127
And for all that effort,
for all that sacrifice,

661
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:32,664
it is now entirely reliant upon you.

662
00:50:34,301 --> 00:50:36,635
SILVER:
Trust is a funny thing.

663
00:50:36,637 --> 00:50:38,970
When I pledged my
support to Captain Flint,

664
00:50:38,972 --> 00:50:42,140
I believed the trust between
us to be of the strongest kind.

665
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:45,477
We both desperately
wanted the same thing.

666
00:50:45,479 --> 00:50:48,146
And that makes for good partners.

667
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:50,482
But over the past few days,
it's become clear to me

668
00:50:50,484 --> 00:50:51,983
that the prize we both wanted

669
00:50:51,985 --> 00:50:55,737
is becoming less a prize to
him and more an obstacle.

670
00:50:57,191 --> 00:50:59,358
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

671
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,860
The Urca gold.

672
00:51:01,862 --> 00:51:04,279
I have feared for days that Flint

673
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:06,782
might not want that
gold to ever be found,

674
00:51:06,784 --> 00:51:10,452
that it would interfere with plans
he held more important than gold,

675
00:51:10,454 --> 00:51:12,120
more important than wealth.

676
00:51:12,122 --> 00:51:15,841
And I have felt the ground
rushing towards us ever since.

677
00:51:17,127 --> 00:51:19,294
And my greatest fear has
been that in the moment

678
00:51:19,296 --> 00:51:22,464
he decided to end the
hunt for the Urca gold,

679
00:51:22,466 --> 00:51:26,685
the moment he decided it was in
his interest to betray my trust...

680
00:51:27,971 --> 00:51:30,639
that he would find a way to do so

681
00:51:30,641 --> 00:51:32,474
by deception, by force,

682
00:51:32,476 --> 00:51:34,476
by who the fuck knows how.

683
00:51:34,478 --> 00:51:38,780
But what I do know is that he would
ask my help to make it happen.

684
00:51:38,782 --> 00:51:43,118
And by that point,
the gold would be as good as gone.

685
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,289
Any resistance I offered would be futile

686
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:49,124
and I would be just another tool

687
00:51:49,126 --> 00:51:52,461
that he'd used and then
promptly discarded.

688
00:51:52,463 --> 00:51:55,414
Why are you telling me this?

689
00:52:04,308 --> 00:52:07,476
A few hours ago, a launch arrived.

690
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:12,264
Two of our men who were
scouting the Urca gold

691
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:15,267
were returning to the island
against their instructions.

692
00:52:15,269 --> 00:52:18,270
You see, they had been told
very clearly by Captain Flint

693
00:52:18,272 --> 00:52:20,939
to remain with the Urca until we arrived

694
00:52:20,941 --> 00:52:25,110
to help us prepare our assault
on the Spanish beach.

695
00:52:25,112 --> 00:52:28,280
So the moment I saw them approaching,

696
00:52:28,282 --> 00:52:31,783
my first thought was that the only
reason they'd be returning early

697
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:34,953
was if the gold was no longer there.

698
00:52:34,955 --> 00:52:37,172
And I thought, "My God...

699
00:52:38,792 --> 00:52:40,792
did Flint do this?

700
00:52:42,129 --> 00:52:46,131
Through some kind of luck
or guile or fucking sorcery,

701
00:52:46,133 --> 00:52:47,966
did he reach across an ocean

702
00:52:47,968 --> 00:52:51,636
and make $5 million in gold vanish?"

703
00:52:53,307 --> 00:52:55,524
And sure enough,
just a few minutes later,

704
00:52:55,526 --> 00:52:57,359
those scouts were standing
in front of Captain Flint

705
00:52:57,361 --> 00:52:59,861
reporting to him the gold was gone,

706
00:52:59,863 --> 00:53:02,714
on its way back to Spain.

707
00:53:02,716 --> 00:53:06,818
They told Flint the gold was gone.

708
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,321
Yes.

709
00:53:09,323 --> 00:53:11,323
What did they tell you?

710
00:53:13,827 --> 00:53:15,460
The two scouts reported to me

711
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:18,129
what they had observed on the beach,

712
00:53:18,131 --> 00:53:21,132
what had driven them to leave
their post ahead of schedule

713
00:53:21,134 --> 00:53:24,836
and return to Nassau
with the utmost haste.

714
00:53:34,982 --> 00:53:39,017
That a tropical disease had
befallen the Spanish camp.

715
00:53:39,987 --> 00:53:41,987
Dozens dead or dying.

716
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:44,356
Many more suffering, weakened.

717
00:53:46,493 --> 00:53:50,829
Only a handful of men defending it,
most barely even able to stand.

718
00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:58,870
The Urca gold is on that beach

719
00:53:58,872 --> 00:54:02,541
exactly where we left it.

720
00:54:02,543 --> 00:54:05,627
And owing to a most
fortuitous act of God,

721
00:54:05,629 --> 00:54:09,347
it is almost entirely undefended.

722
00:54:11,468 --> 00:54:14,970
So I offered those two scouts a deal
they simply could not reject.

723
00:54:14,972 --> 00:54:18,139
Help me tell a very simple lie,

724
00:54:18,141 --> 00:54:22,110
I will employ a smaller
crew to retrieve the gold,

725
00:54:22,112 --> 00:54:24,613
and our three shares

726
00:54:24,615 --> 00:54:27,148
increase five-fold.

727
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,288
So, do you know of a crew

728
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:35,490
who might be willing to
aid in this endeavor?

729
00:54:50,807 --> 00:54:52,807
(Horses whinnies)

730
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,986
Go have a look.

731
00:55:48,982 --> 00:55:51,149
(Horse whinnies)

732
00:55:56,156 --> 00:55:59,424

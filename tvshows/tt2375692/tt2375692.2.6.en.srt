1
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:12,927
I have committed men and resources

2
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:15,418
to aid you in retrieving the Urca gold

3
00:00:15,453 --> 00:00:17,003
in exchange for which you assured me

4
00:00:17,038 --> 00:00:19,839
expelling Captain Vane from that fort.

5
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:21,341
Back from a lengthy journey,

6
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:23,626
and not one of them has
felt the need to have a go.

7
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:25,962
Maybe they was told
to stay away from it.

8
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:28,381
To prevent them from divulging a secret.

9
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:31,384
Max's share ain't the only
item the men took issue with.

10
00:00:31,436 --> 00:00:32,852
You chose her.

11
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:34,470
They gave me a choice,
but it was no choice.

12
00:00:34,522 --> 00:00:36,889
Anne? Anne!

13
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:39,142
Until I know what
you're going to say to the men,

14
00:00:39,144 --> 00:00:41,194
I can't let you say anything to the men.

15
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:43,196
The girl's name is Abigail Ashe.

16
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:44,897
You need to obtain
her from Captain Vane.

17
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:46,783
And when you return her to her father,

18
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:49,485
you're going to explain what it is
you're trying to accomplish here...

19
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:51,704
a Nassau that can self-govern.

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,140
It's too great of a force to defeat.

21
00:00:53,158 --> 00:00:54,824
We attempt to fight the body of it.

22
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:57,388
The only way to beat it
is to cut off its head.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

24
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:30,813
Had I two rounds left,

25
00:03:30,865 --> 00:03:33,316
I would shoot both of you
and be done with all of this.

26
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:35,701
Can't avoid it any longer.
It's time you made a choice.

27
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:37,320
Enough.

28
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:38,988
You two will resolve this.

29
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,490
This isn't going to end
the way you want it to.

30
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:43,159
This ends in this room right now.

31
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:45,995
He can't let it, and neither can I.

32
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:50,500
Sit down.

33
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:53,252
Why the fuck should I sit?

34
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:58,341
There is a girl in your possession.

35
00:03:58,343 --> 00:04:01,561
Her name is Abigail.

36
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:03,563
Give her to me and I
will stand down my men.

37
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:04,981
You can have the fort.

38
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:10,937
You'd give all this up
for a little money?

39
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:15,074
She's worth more to me than money.

40
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:20,446
She's the future of this place.

41
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:29,705
Send word for your father.

42
00:04:29,757 --> 00:04:31,791
He should hear this as well.

43
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:56,782
We're through the Twin Pass and
well into the zone on schedule.

44
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:02,371
- Captain?
- Listen.

45
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,242
Do you hear it?

46
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:10,546
No women.

47
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:15,001
Yes, well...

48
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,919
in any event, according to the whore,

49
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:18,671
the True North should be here.

50
00:05:18,723 --> 00:05:20,673
According to the whore,
the ship is insured

51
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:22,341
up, down, and sideways,

52
00:05:22,393 --> 00:05:24,927
so they should surrender the
moment they see the black,

53
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,229
netting the men a quick
and painless score,

54
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:29,682
and you an auspicious debut.

55
00:05:29,734 --> 00:05:31,350
Now it's just a matter of whether or not

56
00:05:31,402 --> 00:05:33,486
the whore's information proves accurate.

57
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:40,743
And if there's anything you
need assistance with today,

58
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,496
please don't hesitate to ask me.

59
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:46,666
- Such as?
- Well, I've heard things.

60
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:48,451
Heard the role you played on the Ranger

61
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,620
was almost entirely a political one.

62
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:55,174
Heard Captain Vane was
the sailor among you.

63
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,677
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

64
00:05:57,712 --> 00:05:59,512
You certainly would not be the first man

65
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,097
to learn how to captain a ship

66
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:02,932
after being named captain of a ship.

67
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:06,018
- I see.
- Look, Jack.

68
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:08,220
I vouched for you.

69
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:11,774
We are both invested in this...

70
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:14,644
experiment working out.

71
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:17,530
Sails!

72
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:20,199
Sails!

73
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:22,284
West, northwest!

74
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,288
It's the True North!

75
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:26,956
Right where she's supposed to be.

76
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:29,825
- All right, gents! Let's go get her!
- Come to starboard.

77
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:32,995
Make a heading west,
nor-west to intercept her.

78
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:36,499
Chop it off on the braces and
strike the mainsail and foresail.

79
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:43,055
Today!

80
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,047
Bit of a surprise to them,
that one, wasn't it?

81
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:59,355
Not to blame them,

82
00:06:59,357 --> 00:07:01,490
seeing as that you just opened a pursuit

83
00:07:01,526 --> 00:07:03,743
where speed will be of the essence

84
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:08,864
by releasing the sails and
steering us in the wrong direction.

85
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,701
Though I suppose there's a chance

86
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:14,370
you struck the sails to make us nimbler.

87
00:07:14,422 --> 00:07:18,591
Tack hard to starboard to
alter our angle of approach.

88
00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:21,711
Come up right behind
her and steal her wind.

89
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:28,851
Sails!

90
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:30,269
Heard you the first time!

91
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:32,521
Second set!

92
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:34,523
West, south-west!

93
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:39,895
Two prizes.

94
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:41,897
Not likely.

95
00:07:48,873 --> 00:07:50,990
It's pursuing ours.

96
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:53,159
Another hunter.

97
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:55,628
We have competition it would seem.

98
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:23,272
Fuck this.

99
00:08:23,274 --> 00:08:25,858
Where are you going?

100
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,194
I'll be back in an hour.

101
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:29,495
Anyone asks, I'm taking a shit.

102
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,663
Who shits for an hour?

103
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:32,665
I do.

104
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,667
Captain says anyone walks
away from this beach

105
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:37,336
with this fight looming
don't need to ever come back.

106
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:38,621
Shut the fuck up.

107
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:40,122
And what's worse, you're going to go

108
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:42,842
to the one place on the island
he said we're not allowed to go.

109
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:44,426
He said the whores there work too hard

110
00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:46,178
taking secrets from men's heads.

111
00:08:46,214 --> 00:08:48,848
Mate, I'm so close, I can smell her.

112
00:08:48,883 --> 00:08:51,851
So either I'm going up
there and fucking Charlotte,

113
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:53,686
or I'm fucking you down here

114
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:55,471
imagining I'm fucking
Charlotte up there.

115
00:08:57,108 --> 00:08:58,557
Tell her I said hello.

116
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:00,476
Right.

117
00:09:00,478 --> 00:09:02,561
Fuck.

118
00:09:02,613 --> 00:09:04,563
Men cannot be kept in this state.

119
00:09:04,615 --> 00:09:06,115
Sooner or later, they must fight

120
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,817
or they must know
there will be no fight.

121
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:10,653
And now he's nowhere to be found.

122
00:09:10,705 --> 00:09:12,321
Much can be said about Captain,

123
00:09:12,373 --> 00:09:14,824
but shying away from a fight
isn't one of them.

124
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:17,409
Whatever he's doing up
there in that tavern,

125
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:20,996
I'm certain it's towards the
end of prevailing in this fight.

126
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:23,415
At a certain point I'll cease
to care what his ends are

127
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:26,001
and lead these men up that hill myself.

128
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:32,174
I don't think that's going
to be an option anytime soon.

129
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:33,976
What are you talking about?

130
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:58,510
It will likely start with three ships,

131
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:01,263
maybe four.

132
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:04,233
A tactical assault to retake the bay.

133
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:07,770
Once England decides she
wants this place back,

134
00:11:07,822 --> 00:11:12,825
the resources that she will
commit towards that end

135
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,994
are inexhaustible.

136
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:17,997
Sooner or later, we'll be driven inland,

137
00:11:18,032 --> 00:11:20,833
forced to fight as
rebels from the interior

138
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:23,836
hoping to inflict enough damage

139
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:26,171
and expense to compel the new governor

140
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:29,208
to negotiate with what's left of us.

141
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,795
For years I prepared for that fight.

142
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:36,598
Now it would appear that
there is another way,

143
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:41,220
a way in which we can control
our futures without that fight.

144
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,773
And as fate would have it,

145
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:48,978
you are holding the key
to make that possible.

146
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:52,698
The girl.

147
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:55,317
Her father is a very powerful,

148
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:57,486
very influential man.

149
00:11:57,538 --> 00:12:00,289
If I return her to him unharmed,

150
00:12:00,324 --> 00:12:03,575
I believe that I can win him as an ally,

151
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:05,160
an advocate in London

152
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:09,298
to argue for a
reconciliation with England

153
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:13,669
where we keep our assets,
maintain control,

154
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:16,338
and name a governor of our own choosing.

155
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,675
I believe that there is
an opportunity at hand,

156
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:24,313
an opportunity where we
control our own futures.

157
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:29,852
We just all need to agree to take it.

158
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:31,770
Peter Ashe.

159
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:35,190
Returning his daughter
might gain his ear,

160
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:37,026
but there is no man in the Americas

161
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:39,995
with a more strident
contempt for piracy than he.

162
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:44,033
No amount of appreciation is
going to make him forget that.

163
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:47,453
A long time ago, he and I were friends.

164
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:49,505
Good friends.

165
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,208
We fought alongside each
other towards this very end...

166
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:58,263
a stable and prosperous Nassau.

167
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:00,549
We're talking about a man

168
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:03,218
who took a struggling Carolina colony

169
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,721
and turned it into a commercial success.

170
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:09,191
And from what I'm told
by friends in London,

171
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:11,193
is unparalleled in his ability

172
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:14,480
to maneuver the avenues
of power in Parliament.

173
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:18,567
If that man could be persuaded,
as you say,

174
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:22,654
if that man chose to be our advocate,

175
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:24,990
that would certainly argue
well for our prospects.

176
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:27,910
What do I get?

177
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:30,913
If this, if that.

178
00:13:30,915 --> 00:13:33,582
Yet it all relies on an
asset you do not possess.

179
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:36,385
What do you get?
You get what we all get... a future.

180
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,920
Show it to me.

181
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:39,755
Hand me my future here in this room.

182
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:45,260
What? It isn't just your words, is it?

183
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:48,397
The promise of a thing hard to
define and impossible to deliver...

184
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:51,266
that is what you're suggesting I get

185
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:52,768
in exchange for surrendering an asset

186
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,236
worth what that girl is worth?

187
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:55,854
If you're looking for
something more immediate,

188
00:13:55,906 --> 00:13:58,323
then how about your own survival?

189
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:01,076
If we cannot agree to do this together,
then I walk out of here

190
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:03,495
and I lead my men in cutting down

191
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:04,997
what remains of yours.

192
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:07,666
This girl is so valuable to you,

193
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:10,419
and you would risk her death
just to punish me?

194
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:12,871
You want her? You have two choices.

195
00:14:12,923 --> 00:14:15,624
Try and take her and hope
she survives the fight

196
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:19,461
or pay me what she's worth.

197
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:22,097
And what exactly do you
estimate that to be?

198
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:26,185
One Spanish Man of War.

199
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:31,140
He can't do that even if he wanted to.

200
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:32,524
That ship belongs to his men.

201
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,309
Says the woman who managed

202
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:36,061
to separate me from my last ship

203
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:37,646
with just a few choice words.

204
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:39,948
You want to see that girl alive,

205
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:42,484
I suggest you not try and stop me.

206
00:14:42,536 --> 00:14:44,536
Among the men she is
surrounded by right now,

207
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:48,740
I am quite certainly
the most reasonable one.

208
00:14:50,044 --> 00:14:52,161
I believe my terms are clear.

209
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:58,167
You know where to find me
to deliver your response.

210
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:15,317
Stop.

211
00:15:15,352 --> 00:15:17,152
You can't walk away from this.

212
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,108
Were it anyone else in the world,

213
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,994
you would see right through this.

214
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,415
But that man starts talking
and you'll believe anything.

215
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,117
You have a choice to make.

216
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:34,620
It's long past due.

217
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:38,874
Until then, there's nothing
for you and I to say.

218
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:53,438
What are you doing?

219
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:56,608
Parsing leads from the girls.

220
00:15:56,644 --> 00:15:58,560
Why? Should I be doing something else?

221
00:15:58,562 --> 00:16:01,480
You're telling me you
haven't heard what happened?

222
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:06,451
The crew of the Eagle was
recruiting by the beach.

223
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:09,571
Anne Bonny showed up looking to join.

224
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:15,077
Quartermaster tells
her if Jack Rackham's

225
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,578
got no appetite for her on his crew,

226
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,914
they for fucking certain don't either.

227
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:24,253
What did she do?

228
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:27,556
She grabbed a marling spike
and plunged it in his jaw.

229
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:29,224
Took out three teeth.

230
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,394
Which brings me to my original question.

231
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:34,813
What the hell are you doing here?

232
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:36,765
Why aren't there men at your door?

233
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:38,267
You are afraid she will come here

234
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:40,435
and attempt to harm me.

235
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:42,938
Everyone's heard what happened.

236
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,325
Jack had a choice, pay you or keep her.

237
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,826
He chose you.

238
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:50,329
She's gone fucking mad over it.

239
00:16:50,364 --> 00:16:52,781
Idelle, how would you feel

240
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:56,034
if the one man you thought
would never betray you did?

241
00:16:56,086 --> 00:16:59,454
If he purchased for himself a
future through that betrayal?

242
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:02,174
If you were told by a world full of men

243
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:04,509
that that betrayal confirmed for them

244
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:08,463
that they were right to see
you as a monster to be shunned?

245
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:12,467
She's not mad.

246
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:13,935
She is adrift.

247
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:17,856
Alone in the most terrifying way.

248
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:20,892
What she will do next, I do not know.

249
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:23,528
But I refuse to proclaim myself

250
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:25,230
to be yet another one of her enemies

251
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:28,483
by acting like I have
something to fear from her.

252
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,455
If she returns, if the girls see her,

253
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,124
tell them to allow her a wide berth

254
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,627
and tell me at once.

255
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:45,917
Logan's come up from the beach.

256
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,757
Mr. Rackham was right.

257
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:55,594
Flint forbade any of the
Walrus men from coming here.

258
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:58,430
If the secret they are
hiding is that important,

259
00:17:58,482 --> 00:18:01,016
perhaps this is something
we should let alone.

260
00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:04,186
He has already brought
you into his confidence.

261
00:18:04,238 --> 00:18:07,272
Just show him you are calm.

262
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:11,443
Let him talk and
everything will be fine.

263
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:13,078
Hmm?

264
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:32,381
I assume you're the one
who fetched Eleanor?

265
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:38,637
Why didn't you just leave me there?

266
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,226
I couldn't.

267
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:48,897
Thank you.

268
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:54,286
What happens in London?

269
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:59,241
Assume your appeal to
Lord Ashe is persuasive.

270
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:00,992
Assume you bring him here,

271
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:02,794
show him that everything necessary

272
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,081
to make Nassau a viable,
permanent colony

273
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:08,417
is already in place and functioning.

274
00:19:08,469 --> 00:19:12,254
Then he has to make the
case to Parliament, yes?

275
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:14,089
Yes.

276
00:19:14,141 --> 00:19:15,757
But while he's trying to persuade them

277
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:19,428
that there are reasonable men
among the pirates of Nassau,

278
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,432
men ready to govern themselves
responsibly and peacefully,

279
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:24,933
no one will be listening,

280
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:27,102
because in the next room

281
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:30,272
the ambassador to the court
of King Philip of Spain

282
00:19:30,274 --> 00:19:33,408
will be shaking his fists with rage,

283
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:37,279
screaming about how
these same reasonable men

284
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:41,283
just stole five million Spanish
dollars from the king's treasury.

285
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:44,286
He'll be demanding
Whitehall denounce the act

286
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:49,291
or risk losing the hard-won
peace between both nations.

287
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:53,628
If Lord Ashe is to have
any prayer of succeeding

288
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,131
in what you are asking of him,

289
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:59,468
not only can you not
retrieve the Urca gold,

290
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,103
no one else here can retrieve it either.

291
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:03,805
They saw it with their own eyes.

292
00:20:03,807 --> 00:20:07,142
In their minds,
half of it is spent already.

293
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:12,364
To persuade them to let it go at
this point is an impossibility.

294
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:14,783
I don't dispute that.

295
00:20:14,818 --> 00:20:19,287
But I would argue it is also
indisputable that these two plans,

296
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:22,624
courting Lord Ashe and
retrieving the Urca gold,

297
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:24,960
are working against each other.

298
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:27,629
Perhaps even mutually
exclude each other.

299
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:30,298
- I will make it work.
- How could you possibly?

300
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,968
I don't know...

301
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:34,003
yet.

302
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:40,475
He agreed.

303
00:20:40,511 --> 00:20:42,677
He agreed?

304
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:44,179
Abigail Ashe will be surrendered to you

305
00:20:44,231 --> 00:20:45,764
in exchange for which you will agree

306
00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:49,067
to make no further move
against him or the fort.

307
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:51,436
He lives.

308
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:53,522
I'm sorry,
but I'm having a difficult time

309
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:55,023
believing that he agreed.

310
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:56,608
He agreed, he didn't agree.

311
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,276
What difference does it make?

312
00:20:58,328 --> 00:21:00,078
I am guaranteeing that the exchange

313
00:21:00,113 --> 00:21:01,696
you offered will be honored.

314
00:21:01,698 --> 00:21:03,665
Do you understand?

315
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,617
You want me to go to my men

316
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:07,202
and deny them a fight

317
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:09,337
that I have led them
to believe is critical

318
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:10,839
for the future of this place

319
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:12,874
and do so based upon your word

320
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:16,428
that Charles Vane will
compensate them for it?

321
00:21:16,463 --> 00:21:19,381
That is exactly what
I'm asking you to do.

322
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:21,683
I'll say it again.

323
00:21:21,718 --> 00:21:24,553
I am guaranteeing the
terms of this deal.

324
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:28,773
If you deliver on your promise,

325
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:31,226
if you prevent any further
attack on the fort,

326
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:33,478
I will bring the girl down from the hill

327
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,063
and deliver her to you.

328
00:21:37,484 --> 00:21:39,568
Will you fulfill your
end of this bargain?

329
00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:44,573
Yes or no?

330
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:19,190
- Do you recognize it?
- No.

331
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:20,742
Not a Nassau crew.

332
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:40,762
Let's get this underway, shall we?

333
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,885
Captain Jack Rackham
of the Colonial Dawn.

334
00:22:48,138 --> 00:22:50,188
Never heard of you.

335
00:22:50,223 --> 00:22:51,973
Well, perhaps you should get out more.

336
00:23:04,705 --> 00:23:06,556
Good one.

337
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:10,075
Captain Linus Harcourt of the Goliath.

338
00:23:12,162 --> 00:23:16,164
Your ship is named after the greatest
disappointment in the history of warfare?

339
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:21,469
I like how it sounds.

340
00:23:21,505 --> 00:23:23,838
Pleasure to meet you.

341
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:28,226
Have you ever done one of these before?

342
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:31,930
Split a baby? No. No, I haven't.

343
00:23:31,982 --> 00:23:34,099
We've had a few.

344
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:36,601
One of three outcomes, in my experience.

345
00:23:36,653 --> 00:23:39,604
One, crews fight it out.

346
00:23:39,656 --> 00:23:44,025
Seeing our obvious advantage
in strength of numbers,

347
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:47,445
you're wise enough to forgo that option.

348
00:23:47,497 --> 00:23:50,415
Two, captains fight it out.

349
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,450
Don't know about you,

350
00:23:52,502 --> 00:23:55,253
but this doesn't seem like a
haul worth dying over to me.

351
00:23:55,288 --> 00:23:56,371
Yeah, what's three?

352
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:00,375
Reasonable men agree.

353
00:24:04,681 --> 00:24:06,522
The first thing I remember
is being in the hold

354
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,100
of that ship, shackled.

355
00:24:09,136 --> 00:24:13,555
Then, um, a man came in.

356
00:24:15,308 --> 00:24:17,559
The Scarborough's captain.

357
00:24:19,312 --> 00:24:20,779
And he just said one thing.

358
00:24:20,814 --> 00:24:23,064
He said,

359
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:27,035
"Yesterday, you were a free man.

360
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,372
Today you are a thief
condemned to die."

361
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:35,243
I saw a garrison on Harbour Island.

362
00:24:35,295 --> 00:24:37,912
200 men.

363
00:24:37,964 --> 00:24:42,417
I saw an armory, some barracks.

364
00:24:42,469 --> 00:24:46,254
They weren't passing through.

365
00:24:46,306 --> 00:24:49,390
The navy is, this moment,

366
00:24:49,426 --> 00:24:53,094
fully encamped 40 miles
away from where you stand.

367
00:24:58,985 --> 00:25:02,654
Eventually, the man
who guarded me got careless,

368
00:25:02,689 --> 00:25:04,322
let me get too close...

369
00:25:04,357 --> 00:25:09,444
Billy, we're all relieved
beyond words that you're here,

370
00:25:09,446 --> 00:25:12,781
but the question on all of
our minds in this moment

371
00:25:12,783 --> 00:25:16,751
is how did you end up in the
water in the first place?

372
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:21,623
Mr. Gates assumed,
I assumed, we all assumed,

373
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:24,292
the captain had a hand in your fall

374
00:25:24,294 --> 00:25:26,878
to silence your opposition to him.

375
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:32,467
Do you remember what happened
on the bow of the Walrus that night?

376
00:25:41,778 --> 00:25:43,228
You ought to go.

377
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,780
It'll take me a while to
straighten things out down there,

378
00:25:45,816 --> 00:25:49,901
but when I do, I'll be home...

379
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:53,121
if you'll have me.

380
00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:56,875
I'm not going anywhere.

381
00:25:57,994 --> 00:25:59,577
What?

382
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:02,297
Abigail doesn't know you.

383
00:26:02,332 --> 00:26:05,466
She doesn't know Miss Guthrie.

384
00:26:05,502 --> 00:26:07,669
She did know me once.

385
00:26:07,721 --> 00:26:11,089
There's a good chance she
might even recognize me.

386
00:26:11,141 --> 00:26:12,924
I would assume your plan would work best

387
00:26:12,976 --> 00:26:16,261
if she were cooperative in it,
if she felt safe.

388
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:17,762
There's no better way to ensure that

389
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:19,597
than having me be a part of it.

390
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:22,016
Part of it? For how long?

391
00:26:22,068 --> 00:26:24,736
I don't know.

392
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:27,739
Aren't we all just
figuring this out as we go?

393
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,277
You and Peter weren't the only ones

394
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,362
committed to seeing Nassau set aright.

395
00:26:34,414 --> 00:26:38,499
You weren't the only one who paid
a heavy toll towards that end.

396
00:26:38,535 --> 00:26:41,035
I stood aside too long.

397
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,790
If you and I are to be partners...

398
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:50,094
then we ought to be partners.

399
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:54,015
Very well.

400
00:26:55,302 --> 00:26:57,218
Captain.

401
00:27:05,228 --> 00:27:07,278
There's been a development.

402
00:27:07,314 --> 00:27:10,114
I'm on my way down to the
beach to inform the men.

403
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,116
Before you do that,

404
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:14,903
there is something you need to know.

405
00:27:14,955 --> 00:27:17,572
There's been a development
down there, too.

406
00:27:57,447 --> 00:27:59,948
Where the fuck are you going?

407
00:28:02,786 --> 00:28:06,337
You got Flint's man up there,
is what I hear.

408
00:28:06,373 --> 00:28:07,789
I'm looking for Max.

409
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:10,591
- I'm really not supposed to...
- Get him to talk?

410
00:28:13,513 --> 00:28:15,630
Are you fucking serious?

411
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:17,632
You going to play games with me?

412
00:28:17,634 --> 00:28:19,801
What did he say to you?

413
00:28:19,803 --> 00:28:22,854
He said the gold is still out there.

414
00:28:24,474 --> 00:28:27,058
He said that Flint still
plans to go get it.

415
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:31,029
Out there? Where the fuck is it?

416
00:28:31,064 --> 00:28:32,814
He wouldn't say.

417
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:35,283
But he's coming back later tonight.

418
00:28:35,318 --> 00:28:36,784
Tonight.

419
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,036
They cut me loose.

420
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:40,038
But something this
important needs doing,

421
00:28:40,073 --> 00:28:42,290
leave a fucking whore to do it.

422
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:44,792
I can go get it. I'm just being careful.

423
00:28:44,828 --> 00:28:46,077
Wait!

424
00:28:47,914 --> 00:28:51,249
Charlotte, I can't find my belt anywhere.

425
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:52,717
You know who I am?

426
00:28:52,752 --> 00:28:55,003
I sure as shit know who you are.

427
00:28:55,005 --> 00:28:56,504
Fuck's the gold?

428
00:28:56,506 --> 00:28:57,672
Please don't.

429
00:28:57,724 --> 00:28:59,173
God damn it, Charlotte.

430
00:28:59,225 --> 00:29:00,508
Where the fuck is the gold?

431
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,759
I'm getting Max.

432
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:05,263
Don't move. I won't say it again.

433
00:29:05,315 --> 00:29:07,398
You want me to believe
you won't betray your men?

434
00:29:07,434 --> 00:29:09,150
Your friends?

435
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:11,652
All men betray when it suits them.

436
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:14,072
And right now I'd say
it'd fucking suit you.

437
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:16,074
Fuck you.

438
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:21,662
You won't fucking touch me.

439
00:29:21,698 --> 00:29:25,533
You know who my captain is?
Who my brothers are?

440
00:29:25,535 --> 00:29:27,001
Who the fuck are you?

441
00:29:27,037 --> 00:29:30,254
Some skinny little cunt without a crew.

442
00:29:31,424 --> 00:29:32,957
Not a fucking soul...

443
00:29:37,547 --> 00:29:39,464
What did you do?

444
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:40,965
You fucking lunatic!

445
00:29:41,017 --> 00:29:42,433
What the fuck is wrong with you?

446
00:30:08,661 --> 00:30:10,912
First day as captain, is it?

447
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:12,964
What makes you say that?

448
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:14,799
Little things.

449
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:16,501
A few looks from your men.

450
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:19,420
They're curious how you'll handle this.

451
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Your banner.

452
00:30:22,892 --> 00:30:25,677
Something in the way
your men reacted to...

453
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:28,312
The banner?
What's the matter with the banner?

454
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:31,482
Well, it's new. Lightly traveled.

455
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:42,192
Why? What do you think is wrong with it?

456
00:30:43,663 --> 00:30:45,696
It's fine.

457
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:50,118
There. What do you think?

458
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:10,638
Is this supposed to be a joke?

459
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,722
What do you mean?

460
00:31:11,774 --> 00:31:14,142
This isn't remotely an even split.

461
00:31:14,194 --> 00:31:16,777
You get almost half the total tonnage.

462
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:18,396
Yeah.

463
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:20,148
The shit half.

464
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,567
You get the tobacco and
sugar and I get what?

465
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:25,987
Blankets, pots and pans.

466
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:28,156
Your half of the tonnage

467
00:31:28,158 --> 00:31:31,075
is worth nine-tenths the value.

468
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:34,328
It's closer to four-fifths.

469
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:37,999
We agreed we would reach a
reasonable settlement here.

470
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:40,501
As in an equitable result.

471
00:31:40,503 --> 00:31:43,888
As in a result based on reason.

472
00:31:45,842 --> 00:31:47,808
Had we come to blows over this prize,

473
00:31:47,844 --> 00:31:51,312
there's no doubt my men
would have won it whole.

474
00:31:51,347 --> 00:31:53,397
I'm offering you a meaningful share

475
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:56,317
just for having got here first.

476
00:31:56,352 --> 00:31:57,818
It's the most I can spare

477
00:31:57,854 --> 00:32:00,354
without losing my men's faith in me.

478
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:05,693
I know we have the advantage here.

479
00:32:05,745 --> 00:32:09,247
I can see your numbers.
I can see you.

480
00:32:12,702 --> 00:32:14,452
Did Billy say what happened?

481
00:32:14,504 --> 00:32:16,787
He was fished from the
water by the Scarborough,

482
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:19,006
tortured, escaped.

483
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:20,958
Did he say how he went into the water?

484
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:24,295
Said he lost his footing. Said he fell.

485
00:32:24,347 --> 00:32:26,964
He said you tried to save him.

486
00:32:27,016 --> 00:32:29,350
And how did the crew
react to hearing that?

487
00:32:29,385 --> 00:32:31,185
Stunned surprise, I would say.

488
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:36,057
Before the captain gets here,
there are some things

489
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:37,942
I would like to discuss in private.

490
00:33:19,185 --> 00:33:21,769
It's good to have you back again.

491
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:27,275
Captain!

492
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:40,371
107 men have been standing on
this beach awaiting your return,

493
00:33:40,423 --> 00:33:43,541
waiting to complete the task to
which we've all bound ourselves.

494
00:33:43,593 --> 00:33:44,593
Waiting.

495
00:33:44,594 --> 00:33:46,294
Perhaps now that you are here,

496
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:48,963
we might at long last reclaim my fort.

497
00:33:55,305 --> 00:33:57,972
Farad, take this to Hassan.

498
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:34,975
I should go get the doorman.

499
00:34:35,011 --> 00:34:38,095
No. Stay there until I come out.

500
00:34:39,182 --> 00:34:40,765
You can't be in there alone.

501
00:35:08,177 --> 00:35:10,594
I think you know who that is.

502
00:35:13,182 --> 00:35:17,101
And who his friends are,
who his captain is.

503
00:35:19,939 --> 00:35:22,857
I think you know what this will provoke.

504
00:35:22,892 --> 00:35:24,558
I think you know how dangerous

505
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,610
the consequences promise to be,

506
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:30,398
and I think you knew that
before you took up the knife.

507
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,616
I think I know why you did it,

508
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:34,235
and I don't think it had anything to do

509
00:35:34,237 --> 00:35:38,873
with him or with her or with gold.

510
00:35:38,908 --> 00:35:42,243
I think it had to do with
something entirely different...

511
00:35:44,664 --> 00:35:46,580
and I understand.

512
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,418
So I will not let those
consequences touch you.

513
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:58,642
I will stand in between you and them,

514
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:00,644
and I will protect you.

515
00:36:04,934 --> 00:36:07,685
So Vane stays in the fort.

516
00:36:07,737 --> 00:36:09,270
A fort with no ability

517
00:36:09,272 --> 00:36:12,106
to threaten the bay for weeks,
if not months.

518
00:36:12,158 --> 00:36:13,607
And therefore no ability

519
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:16,444
to stop us bringing back
the Urca gold safely.

520
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:20,448
As for Vane, I don't like leaving
him up there any more than you do.

521
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,583
It's an awful compromise to be sure,

522
00:36:22,618 --> 00:36:26,454
but one well worth making given
what is being offered in return

523
00:36:26,506 --> 00:36:28,622
and what it promises for
the future of this place.

524
00:36:28,674 --> 00:36:31,926
How unsurprising that you
cast aside our arrangement

525
00:36:31,961 --> 00:36:33,594
the first moment it suited your whim.

526
00:36:33,629 --> 00:36:37,097
My priority has always
been and will always be

527
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:39,884
the welfare of my men.

528
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:42,970
And your good word being no
priority at all it would seem.

529
00:36:42,972 --> 00:36:44,638
A hard choice, sir,

530
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,974
but one that any responsible
captain must make

531
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,310
given the changing circumstances.

532
00:36:49,312 --> 00:36:52,480
I'm only sorry that you cannot see
past your own pride to join me.

533
00:36:52,482 --> 00:36:53,814
My pride?

534
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:57,151
I've been a captain of men at sea
going on three decades,

535
00:36:57,153 --> 00:36:58,652
survived a war with Spain,

536
00:36:58,654 --> 00:37:01,205
an insurrection against a queen,

537
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,873
a decade as an outlaw in a place

538
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:05,075
where the weak and the
dead are one and the same.

539
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:07,828
So the idea that you could choose
to discard our arrangement,

540
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,630
that I would demur in the face

541
00:37:09,665 --> 00:37:12,166
of your unassailable rhetoric,

542
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:14,552
either you've overestimated
yourself, sir,

543
00:37:14,587 --> 00:37:16,170
or you've underestimated me.

544
00:37:16,222 --> 00:37:17,805
Mr. Dufresne,

545
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,307
as quartermaster of the
surviving Walrus crew,

546
00:37:20,343 --> 00:37:23,177
consider this notice and
relay to whom you must.

547
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:25,145
Tonight I will call counsel

548
00:37:25,181 --> 00:37:27,982
and submit myself as captain
of this combined crew.

549
00:37:28,017 --> 00:37:29,733
My argument will be plain.

550
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:33,487
I intend to lead the men in
retaking the fort as promised.

551
00:37:33,523 --> 00:37:36,156
I intend to hold Charles Vane
to account as promised.

552
00:37:36,192 --> 00:37:39,827
And then I intend
to sail for the Urca gold

553
00:37:39,862 --> 00:37:43,030
having ended your tyranny
over this place for good.

554
00:38:00,716 --> 00:38:03,350
Don't say a fucking word.
Just sit there and listen.

555
00:38:07,857 --> 00:38:09,473
You're right about me,

556
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:11,809
about what I am.

557
00:38:11,861 --> 00:38:14,311
I am like you,

558
00:38:14,363 --> 00:38:18,816
so I know what you're feeling right now,

559
00:38:18,868 --> 00:38:22,202
that I'm asking you to weaken
yourself for someone else,

560
00:38:22,238 --> 00:38:26,040
for the island's sake, for my sake.

561
00:38:26,075 --> 00:38:27,625
But you're wrong.

562
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,795
We control something so valuable,

563
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:33,797
the whole of England wants it.

564
00:38:35,301 --> 00:38:37,835
We control Nassau,

565
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:39,970
and the ransom we are
going to demand for her

566
00:38:40,006 --> 00:38:43,641
is going to be fucking enormous.

567
00:38:43,676 --> 00:38:47,428
More than money. More than land.

568
00:38:52,018 --> 00:38:53,934
Legitimacy.

569
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:58,439
Legitimacy?

570
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:04,862
England is going to give that to you?

571
00:39:04,914 --> 00:39:08,115
When they realize it is the only
outcome that makes any sense,

572
00:39:08,117 --> 00:39:10,284
they'll have to.

573
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,787
And the moment they ratify
our control over this place,

574
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,624
no more fighting, no more leads,

575
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:18,792
no more chasing our fucking meals.

576
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:22,630
I'm talking about making money
the way London makes money...

577
00:39:22,632 --> 00:39:25,933
collecting it, not hunting it,

578
00:39:25,968 --> 00:39:28,435
and in amounts that mean something.

579
00:39:34,644 --> 00:39:37,311
Give up the girl.

580
00:39:37,313 --> 00:39:40,481
Make this deal.

581
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:42,983
Do this with me and we can
have a future here together.

582
00:39:42,985 --> 00:39:46,987
Eleanor, when I take
something from a man,

583
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:50,991
his ship, his money, his life,

584
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:53,160
I don't hide behind a clerk.

585
00:39:53,162 --> 00:39:55,329
I don't hide behind the law.

586
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:58,332
I don't hide behind anything.

587
00:39:58,384 --> 00:40:00,968
I look him in his eye

588
00:40:01,003 --> 00:40:03,470
and I give him every chance to deny me.

589
00:40:03,506 --> 00:40:06,557
That is legitimate.

590
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:08,676
I know what he wants you to believe,
but he's wrong.

591
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:10,928
England's return isn't inevitable.

592
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,429
England has no more appetite

593
00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:14,732
for taking this place back
today than it did yesterday,

594
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:17,067
or last month, or last year,

595
00:40:17,103 --> 00:40:21,271
because they know it is inhabited
by too many men like me,

596
00:40:21,323 --> 00:40:25,776
men who would die before being
another man's slave again.

597
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,747
Side with Flint,

598
00:40:29,782 --> 00:40:32,366
beg them to let you keep
what is already yours,

599
00:40:32,368 --> 00:40:34,535
show them that weakness,

600
00:40:34,587 --> 00:40:37,671
and you'll invite the very
outcome you wish to avoid.

601
00:40:37,707 --> 00:40:40,040
Side with me and we will show England

602
00:40:40,092 --> 00:40:42,342
that this place has never been stronger,

603
00:40:42,378 --> 00:40:44,878
and we'll keep our
freedom for another day,

604
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,682
another month, another year, a lifetime.

605
00:40:48,718 --> 00:40:50,634
Hey.

606
00:40:54,106 --> 00:40:56,273
Do you believe me?

607
00:41:21,584 --> 00:41:23,584
You're right.

608
00:41:23,586 --> 00:41:25,219
It's nowhere near an even split.

609
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:30,424
My God, this is...

610
00:41:30,426 --> 00:41:33,177
really quite disappointing.

611
00:41:36,432 --> 00:41:38,816
I say we take it.

612
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:40,068
What?

613
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,302
What?

614
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:44,988
You're not concerned how
the men will receive this?

615
00:41:46,442 --> 00:41:48,108
What other choice do we have?

616
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:52,663
Start a fight that gets
our whole crew slaughtered?

617
00:41:52,698 --> 00:41:55,249
I suppose you could challenge
him to fight you man to man,

618
00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:57,417
but I think we can both agree

619
00:41:57,453 --> 00:41:59,253
that's not going to end well for anyone.

620
00:42:01,507 --> 00:42:04,958
At the end of the day,
our men can count.

621
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,094
Most of them can count.

622
00:42:07,129 --> 00:42:09,296
They can all see that we're
simply outmatched here.

623
00:42:09,348 --> 00:42:14,017
And they know that... well, you know...

624
00:42:15,354 --> 00:42:17,554
They know what?

625
00:42:17,606 --> 00:42:20,891
That they chose you as a captain
to get access to the whore's leads.

626
00:42:20,943 --> 00:42:22,643
If they're honest with themselves,

627
00:42:22,695 --> 00:42:25,863
they can't really expect you to
be able to do anything about this.

628
00:42:25,898 --> 00:42:28,232
Leads or no, if I accept these terms,

629
00:42:28,284 --> 00:42:31,702
they'll vote me off before
we return to Nassau.

630
00:42:31,737 --> 00:42:32,737
Hmm?

631
00:42:38,794 --> 00:42:41,495
You cannot imagine what I've
sacrificed to gain this captaincy.

632
00:42:41,547 --> 00:42:42,996
I may have lost the only person

633
00:42:43,048 --> 00:42:47,801
in the world I cared for
to gain this captaincy.

634
00:42:47,837 --> 00:42:49,837
I cannot lose it.

635
00:42:52,591 --> 00:42:54,508
Not so soon. Not like this.

636
00:43:44,944 --> 00:43:46,226
You're right.

637
00:43:46,278 --> 00:43:49,313
This is likely the most
reasonable distribution

638
00:43:49,365 --> 00:43:50,781
given our relative strengths.

639
00:43:52,368 --> 00:43:56,653
Then can we consider ourselves
in agreement about our terms?

640
00:43:56,705 --> 00:44:00,073
With one or two small adjustments,

641
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:01,625
if you wouldn't mind hearing me out.

642
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,910
Of course.

643
00:44:02,962 --> 00:44:06,246
For what little comfort
it may provide right now,

644
00:44:06,248 --> 00:44:08,498
I believe you've made
the right decision.

645
00:44:09,585 --> 00:44:11,001
Your men will see the wisdom...

646
00:44:33,075 --> 00:44:37,077
Thank you for offering us a way forward.

647
00:45:26,495 --> 00:45:27,961
Wait!

648
00:45:27,997 --> 00:45:29,963
Wait, wait, wait.

649
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:31,381
Wait!

650
00:45:34,086 --> 00:45:35,335
Wait!

651
00:45:36,588 --> 00:45:39,389
I'm sorry, friends.

652
00:45:39,425 --> 00:45:42,809
I had hoped to find an outcome
amenable to both crews.

653
00:45:45,264 --> 00:45:48,849
But it seems that this man

654
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:53,353
was unable to see any outcome

655
00:45:53,405 --> 00:45:58,191
that saw a single member of
this prize crew to survive.

656
00:46:00,746 --> 00:46:05,415
And that was an outcome that
I could simply not abide.

657
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:09,369
I can only hope our new
brothers will join us

658
00:46:09,421 --> 00:46:10,954
in the fight for their own survival.

659
00:46:11,006 --> 00:46:13,206
Mr. Haines,
remove their restraints, please.

660
00:46:13,258 --> 00:46:16,009
Remove their restraints now!

661
00:46:16,045 --> 00:46:18,545
Every man from that prize crew.

662
00:46:23,052 --> 00:46:27,888
Unless there is a man amongst this crew

663
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:31,441
who can sit down with me at
this table and speak reasonably,

664
00:46:31,477 --> 00:46:33,610
honorably,

665
00:46:33,645 --> 00:46:36,313
to reach a resolution more favorable...

666
00:46:36,365 --> 00:46:40,734
in light, of course, of the
overwhelming odds now in our favor...

667
00:46:47,993 --> 00:46:49,576
Anybody?

668
00:46:50,913 --> 00:46:52,379
Come on!

669
00:46:56,418 --> 00:46:58,218
Anyone?

670
00:47:33,288 --> 00:47:37,457
You have heard I'm
supporting Captain Flint

671
00:47:37,509 --> 00:47:40,427
against Captain Hornigold tonight, yeah?

672
00:47:40,462 --> 00:47:42,095
I've heard.

673
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:44,965
I'm not sure I understand after
everything that's transpired,

674
00:47:45,017 --> 00:47:46,850
but I've heard.

675
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,807
Flint was right.

676
00:47:56,028 --> 00:47:58,728
England is coming.

677
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,148
I've seen them.

678
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,816
I've seen how they see us.

679
00:48:02,868 --> 00:48:05,402
We aren't criminals to them.

680
00:48:05,454 --> 00:48:07,487
We aren't even men.

681
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:09,656
We're animals.

682
00:48:09,658 --> 00:48:13,410
If Flint can do as he's promised,

683
00:48:13,462 --> 00:48:15,545
protect this place,

684
00:48:15,581 --> 00:48:18,999
protect us from ever
having to face that day,

685
00:48:19,001 --> 00:48:22,002
how can we do anything but support him?

686
00:48:22,054 --> 00:48:25,005
And if he cannot?

687
00:48:25,057 --> 00:48:28,008
Are you suggesting
there's an alternative?

688
00:48:40,105 --> 00:48:42,072
I didn't escape.

689
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,277
From the navy.

690
00:48:47,329 --> 00:48:49,496
I didn't escape.

691
00:48:53,669 --> 00:48:56,336
The captain of the Scarborough

692
00:48:56,371 --> 00:48:58,872
made me an offer.

693
00:48:58,924 --> 00:49:02,042
He offered me and nine men

694
00:49:02,044 --> 00:49:04,377
of my choosing full pardons.

695
00:49:04,429 --> 00:49:07,464
He placed them on the table
right in front of my eyes.

696
00:49:07,516 --> 00:49:11,801
Said I could have them if, in exchange,

697
00:49:11,853 --> 00:49:14,387
I would aid him

698
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:16,556
in the capture of a
fugitive from justice.

699
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:22,862
One particular fugitive.

700
00:49:27,653 --> 00:49:30,737
If we doubt

701
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:33,456
Flint's ability to do as he's promised,

702
00:49:33,492 --> 00:49:37,294
if we doubt he's the man to save us,

703
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:41,381
then you and I and eight other men

704
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:43,416
have another option.

705
00:49:43,418 --> 00:49:46,753
We subdue Flint

706
00:49:46,755 --> 00:49:48,672
and we deliver him to Harbour Island.

707
00:49:51,677 --> 00:49:53,893
And then...

708
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:57,731
we put this whole
fucking mess behind us.

709
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:15,081
You seem unconcerned.

710
00:50:16,952 --> 00:50:18,418
If I understand correctly,

711
00:50:18,453 --> 00:50:21,288
the stakes of the upcoming
vote are significant.

712
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,589
What exactly are you doing?

713
00:50:22,624 --> 00:50:25,959
I'm seeming unconcerned.

714
00:50:26,011 --> 00:50:29,262
I cannot think of a better way
to aid Captain Hornigold's cause

715
00:50:29,298 --> 00:50:31,298
than to appear panicked about it.

716
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:35,051
No, that would be my job, I suppose.

717
00:50:37,472 --> 00:50:39,189
What were the numbers of the last count?

718
00:50:39,224 --> 00:50:41,641
I'd say you have at
least a half dozen votes

719
00:50:41,643 --> 00:50:44,311
over Captain Hornigold at the moment.

720
00:50:44,313 --> 00:50:45,862
That isn't nearly enough.

721
00:50:45,897 --> 00:50:49,032
He's a desperate man.
Even with a minority faction,

722
00:50:49,067 --> 00:50:53,903
he might still move on Vane,
in which case the girl dies.

723
00:50:53,955 --> 00:50:56,323
I need him to lose so convincingly

724
00:50:56,325 --> 00:50:59,159
that no sane man would follow
him two yards up that beach.

725
00:51:00,712 --> 00:51:03,496
A margin of 20 would help matters.

726
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:06,666
Don't stop moving until you have it.

727
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,894
There is one particular vote

728
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:20,513
I'm having some trouble with.

729
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:22,649
Perhaps you could help me with it.

730
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:25,185
Whose vote is that?

731
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:28,054
Mine.

732
00:51:28,323 --> 00:51:30,440
When we returned here,
you said it would be a week,

733
00:51:30,492 --> 00:51:32,992
maybe two,
before Spanish reinforcements arrived

734
00:51:33,028 --> 00:51:34,411
and that gold was as good as gone.

735
00:51:34,446 --> 00:51:36,279
Yes.

736
00:51:36,331 --> 00:51:38,123
So what happens if we win the vote

737
00:51:38,124 --> 00:51:40,619
and the gold isn't delivered
in a timely fashion?

738
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,508
Vane reneges.

739
00:51:42,509 --> 00:51:44,858
Delays to achieve better terms.
Certainly these are plausible outcomes.

740
00:51:44,889 --> 00:51:47,590
How long do we wait for the
situation to resolve itself?

741
00:51:47,642 --> 00:51:49,475
The gold is still a priority.

742
00:51:49,511 --> 00:51:51,678
There's been no change in that.

743
00:51:53,848 --> 00:51:55,732
You have my word.

744
00:52:05,777 --> 00:52:07,527
That's all I needed to hear.

745
00:52:09,198 --> 00:52:11,698
I should get to work.

746
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,366
I'll keep you apprised of the numbers.

747
00:52:13,418 --> 00:52:14,501
You do that.

748
00:52:25,681 --> 00:52:28,431
Mr. Silver, a moment.

749
00:52:28,467 --> 00:52:29,883
How can I help?

750
00:52:29,885 --> 00:52:32,302
You're doing a nose count
for the captain, yes?

751
00:52:32,354 --> 00:52:34,554
I am.

752
00:52:34,606 --> 00:52:36,940
You're gonna find your
tally a man short.

753
00:52:36,975 --> 00:52:39,276
Why?

754
00:52:39,311 --> 00:52:41,361
Who isn't here?

755
00:52:48,904 --> 00:52:50,654
Where's the madam?

756
00:52:53,895 --> 00:52:55,575
Excuse me,
but I'm going to need your help.

757
00:52:55,577 --> 00:52:57,744
Hello.

758
00:52:59,164 --> 00:53:00,914
Sorry, I was looking for the madam.

759
00:53:00,966 --> 00:53:02,499
You found her.

760
00:53:04,336 --> 00:53:07,337
Somehow, I'm not surprised.

761
00:53:07,389 --> 00:53:10,674
Seems quite a bit has transpired since
last we were in business together.

762
00:53:10,726 --> 00:53:12,309
And I would love to hear all about it,

763
00:53:12,344 --> 00:53:14,227
but at the moment I'm
a bit pressed for time.

764
00:53:14,263 --> 00:53:16,229
So if you could do me a
favor and send Mr. Logan

765
00:53:16,265 --> 00:53:18,265
back to camp, that would be a huge help.

766
00:53:19,768 --> 00:53:23,103
Mr. Logan? I don't believe he's here.

767
00:53:23,105 --> 00:53:25,522
Oh, he's here. And he's not in trouble.

768
00:53:25,574 --> 00:53:28,275
But that could change
quickly if certain people

769
00:53:28,277 --> 00:53:30,577
were to learn he's here.

770
00:53:30,612 --> 00:53:33,163
So please, send him down.

771
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:45,292
What the fuck happened here?

772
00:53:45,294 --> 00:53:46,793
Does it matter?

773
00:53:46,795 --> 00:53:49,262
A man dies under this roof,
it is my responsibility

774
00:53:49,298 --> 00:53:51,097
whatever the circumstances.

775
00:53:51,133 --> 00:53:52,632
You've lost a valued crew member

776
00:53:52,684 --> 00:53:55,135
and restitution will be made.
I will see to it.

777
00:53:55,137 --> 00:53:57,771
My crewmates were expressly
forbidden from entering this place.

778
00:53:57,806 --> 00:53:59,306
I imagine you noticed.

779
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:01,308
And I imagine you can guess

780
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,560
it's because there's information
those men are privy to

781
00:54:03,612 --> 00:54:05,812
that we'd just as soon not have
plied out of them by your girls.

782
00:54:05,814 --> 00:54:08,148
Now my armorer is dead on your floor

783
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,151
and I'm forced to wonder if
those two things aren't related.

784
00:54:11,203 --> 00:54:13,236
How exactly did you plan
on covering this up?

785
00:54:13,288 --> 00:54:16,206
I told you, I have every intention
of seeing this made right.

786
00:54:16,241 --> 00:54:17,707
Time is not our friend here.

787
00:54:17,743 --> 00:54:19,659
Please, something resembling the truth.

788
00:54:21,296 --> 00:54:23,046
I don't know.

789
00:54:23,081 --> 00:54:24,964
Something about them falling in love,

790
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,633
running away together.

791
00:54:26,668 --> 00:54:28,635
That's as far as I had got.

792
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:33,840
He went to Providence.

793
00:54:33,892 --> 00:54:35,342
I'm sorry?

794
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:40,347
Logan was among a number of
men who deserted this morning.

795
00:54:40,399 --> 00:54:43,350
Unwilling to risk dying in a
bloody fight to retake the fort,

796
00:54:43,352 --> 00:54:45,268
he and his love fled together.

797
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,853
I heard he has a brother in Providence.

798
00:54:46,855 --> 00:54:48,271
Not surprised that's where he went.
Are you following?

799
00:54:48,323 --> 00:54:49,856
- Yes.
- Good.

800
00:54:53,528 --> 00:54:55,412
Clean this up.

801
00:54:55,447 --> 00:54:58,198
If anyone asks if I saw this up here,
I don't intend to lie.

802
00:54:59,418 --> 00:55:02,502
Why would you do that? Help me?

803
00:55:04,206 --> 00:55:07,040
The last thing I need right now
is Flint in the middle of this.

804
00:55:07,092 --> 00:55:10,176
If he or any of the men in his
crew were to learn about it,

805
00:55:10,212 --> 00:55:12,846
my life would get
significantly more complicated.

806
00:55:12,881 --> 00:55:15,382
Any of the men?

807
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:17,851
Aren't you one of the men on his crew?

808
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:22,722
Clean this up, please.

809
00:56:24,453 --> 00:56:26,669
Abigail.

810
00:56:26,705 --> 00:56:28,838
My name is Eleanor.

811
00:56:28,874 --> 00:56:31,458
You are no longer a hostage.

812
00:56:35,063 --> 00:56:37,196

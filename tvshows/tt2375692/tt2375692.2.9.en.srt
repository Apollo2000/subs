1
00:00:06,252 --> 00:00:09,252
ELEANOR: The only way to truly ensure
that the Urca gold doesn't return here

2
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:12,477
is to eliminate everyone with the knowledge
of where it is and how to retrieve it.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,229
MAX:
Are you angry with Anne for leaving

4
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:17,650
or are you angry with me for
offering her the opportunity?

5
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:19,284
You think there's something valuable enough

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,121
to make the British Navy forget
that you and I are pirates?

7
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:23,956
Not what, who.

8
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,909
Acquiring the partnership of a
plantation the size of Mr. Underhill's

9
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:29,074
could help bolster commerce
on my side of the island.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,963
VANE:
Richard Guthrie betrayed Nassau.

11
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:33,716
As far as you and I,
I was warned about you.

12
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:35,718
Warned you would betray me.

13
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:37,920
I made clear the price for the girl.

14
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:40,756
You should know me well enough
to know I will claim it.

15
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:44,226
My father said there would
be law in the Americas

16
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:46,729
the day Captain Flint
swung over Charles Town.

17
00:00:46,764 --> 00:00:48,981
- You're Captain Flint?
- I am.

18
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:51,150
And you wish an audience with Lord Ashe?

19
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:53,936
Welcome to Charles Town.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

21
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:10,989
I can't say enough, miss,

22
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:14,743
how saddened we all are by this loss.

23
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,495
All my life I was a pauper.

24
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,414
With your father's help I plied a trade.

25
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,917
I'll always be grateful for that.

26
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:30,008
(Distant chatter)

27
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,565
Do you need a respite, ma'am?

28
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:39,818
(Sighs)

29
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:45,941
(Chatter)

30
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,943
(Sighs)

31
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:57,619
Some bread and fruits from the girls.

32
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,872
May I sit?

33
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,723
Thank you.

34
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:21,977
I can imagine how difficult this must be.

35
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,698
Being the daughter they expect you to be.

36
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:28,483
I would think that at least with me,

37
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,152
you would know that I know the truth

38
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,821
about how complicated
the situation is for you.

39
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:35,874
Your relationship with him.

40
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,577
Your relationship with Captain Vane.

41
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:41,964
And because of that,
you would not pretend otherwise.

42
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,967
And that that might bring
some small measure of comfort.

43
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:47,970
There is no part of this
that is complicated.

44
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:50,839
I crossed Charles, he retaliated.

45
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:53,175
That is what happens in a war.

46
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:54,977
A war?

47
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:57,679
A state of affairs in
which resolution only comes

48
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,431
when one side has suffered enough pain

49
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,733
it's willing to concede its principles.

50
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:04,736
I presume you've heard Charles's manifesto.

51
00:05:04,822 --> 00:05:07,072
I heard it's been read aloud on the beach.

52
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:12,110
Everyone must take a side, he says...

53
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:15,530
with him against
reconciliation with England

54
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,950
or with me.

55
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:20,585
Those people out there heard him

56
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:24,289
and they came to my door
not to pay their respects,

57
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,208
not because they loved my father...

58
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:31,263
but because when this war begins,

59
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:34,216
they want to make sure I don't
mistake them for enemies.

60
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:37,552
Is that why you've come?

61
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,606
Or have you yet to choose a side?

62
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:47,980
MAN:
I'm interested to see what she does now.

63
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:50,198
- (Chatter)
- (Goats bleating)

64
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,239
How did that go?

65
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:01,326
I have seen what Eleanor Guthrie can build

66
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:03,295
when she is feeling ambitious.

67
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,215
I have seen what she can
destroy when she is angered.

68
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:08,917
Which of the two was she just now?

69
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:13,138
She was something else entirely.

70
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,309
How soon can you be ready to sail?

71
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:19,394
Just finalizing the route,
sorting out supplies.

72
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,230
I assumed we'd depart
tomorrow at some point.

73
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,236
Leave as soon as possible.

74
00:06:28,272 --> 00:06:30,188
There are foul things brewing here.

75
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,834
(Knocks on door)

76
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,453
Yes?

77
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:47,122
(Door opens)

78
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:55,130
They're here.

79
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,934
Do you know why you're here?

80
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:00,552
Yes, ma'am.

81
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:03,855
Good.

82
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:11,063
Then we move at sundown.

83
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:16,234
- (Bell tolling)
- (Chatter)

84
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,072
The proposal that I have
come all this way to make

85
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:23,742
is one that may at first
strike you as implausible.

86
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:26,745
However, I ask that you remember that...

87
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,165
(Clock ticking)

88
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,384
I love my daughter.

89
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:36,004
More than life itself.

90
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,890
When I received that despicable letter

91
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:41,476
I was given to dark thoughts, rage.

92
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,480
A desire to visit revenge upon those men

93
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:48,483
that put her through that ordeal.

94
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,235
It would seem only reasonable, then,

95
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,737
that I bear an equal measure of gratitude

96
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:54,940
to the man who rescued her from it.

97
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:58,860
Were it not for that gratitude,
you and I would not be speaking like this.

98
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:03,865
You and Colonel Rhett would be
having a very different conversation.

99
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,535
Because while I knew you once,

100
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,620
called you friends once,

101
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,706
I cannot fathom

102
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,759
how those people I knew turned into you.

103
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:17,262
Ask me, then.

104
00:08:17,347 --> 00:08:19,047
Anything you want to know.

105
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,549
I will be truthful.

106
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:23,602
Anything?

107
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,722
When did you first arrive in Nassau?

108
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:31,059
Two months after we saw you last in London.

109
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,727
February, thereabouts.

110
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,613
The first accounts of Captain Flint raiding

111
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:36,648
shipping in the area began in June.

112
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,869
You became the captain of a
pirate crew in four months?

113
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:43,989
I became the captain of a
pirate crew faster than that.

114
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:47,159
It took us four months to secure
our first significant prize.

115
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:48,743
How did you manage that so quickly?

116
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,078
I met a man in a tavern.

117
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,797
Quartermaster of a well-respected crew.

118
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:55,000
I persuaded him

119
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:57,335
that I was someone worth listening to.

120
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:59,421
A crew followed shortly thereafter.

121
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:00,922
And how long after that was it

122
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,509
that you decided to murder Alfred Hamilton?

123
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:11,766
MIRANDA: I received a letter
from a former servant.

124
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:14,903
She mentioned innocently

125
00:09:14,938 --> 00:09:17,906
that Alfred was travelling in secret.

126
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:21,276
And she mentioned the name of the ship.

127
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,697
I encouraged James to find him.

128
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,116
And to kill him.

129
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,787
If you're going to blame anyone for it,

130
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,757
- please, blame me.
- (Gun cocks)

131
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,630
The governor may know who you are.

132
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,381
I only know what you are.

133
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:45,684
Let us agree that if either one of you

134
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:48,053
gets any closer to the
governor than you just did,

135
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:50,722
I will be forced to consider
that a threat to his person

136
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:53,141
and I will shoot you where you stand.

137
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,957
I cannot stand before you

138
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:11,960
and claim to be without sin.

139
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:14,329
When we received that letter from you

140
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,249
informing us of Thomas's death,

141
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:19,501
the damage wrought by Alfred Hamilton

142
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,469
was too much for us to bear.

143
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:25,757
We were angry.

144
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:30,061
We allowed that anger to
drive us to a dark deed.

145
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:34,516
But I ask you not to
judge me by that one deed.

146
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:39,187
Judge me by the ends that I
have come here in service of.

147
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:41,406
The redemption of Nassau

148
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:44,442
in accordance with the
principles that you and I

149
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:46,695
and she and Thomas Hamilton

150
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,914
committed ourselves to all those years ago.

151
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,286
I ask nothing from you but your ear.

152
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:04,212
I'm listening.

153
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:11,803
- (Men shouting)
- (Birds calling)

154
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:19,311
Footrope. Bitch of a spot.

155
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:22,280
Fucking death trap if it isn't
fixed before we set sail.

156
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:31,906
Let's try this again.

157
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,743
You idiots are the fucking
riggers of this ship.

158
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,494
So which of you would like to volunteer

159
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,663
to repair our topsail yard footrope

160
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:41,249
so that when Captain Flint returns,
he returns to a ship

161
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:43,501
that can hoist its fucking
sails without fatalities?

162
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:45,637
It's a bad omen.

163
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:48,423
A man died on them ropes.

164
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,892
Can't touch it till it's fixed.

165
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,266
You're all good people.

166
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:13,365
Tell me something.

167
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,083
Is he going to find anything up there?

168
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:16,701
What would he find?

169
00:12:16,787 --> 00:12:20,121
An indication that the rope
didn't just fray on its own.

170
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,173
No. Absolutely not.

171
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:26,044
It'd be almost impossible.

172
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,800
What?

173
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:42,026
(Birds calling)

174
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:50,485
What is it?

175
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:53,405
I thought I saw something in the water.

176
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:02,831
Tell the watch on the main so
they can keep an eye on it.

177
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,549
I'm sure it was nothing.

178
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,551
Tell them anyway.

179
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,394
(Bagpipes playing)

180
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:27,522
LAMBRICK: The Lord is my shepherd.
I lack nothing.

181
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:30,024
He makes me lie down in green pastures.

182
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,577
Leaves me beside the quiet waters.

183
00:13:32,662 --> 00:13:34,362
Refreshes my soul.

184
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,997
He guides me along the right path

185
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,999
for His name's sake.

186
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:40,201
Even though I walk through
the darkest valley,

187
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:43,338
I will fear no evil, for You are with me.

188
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:46,374
Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.

189
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,711
You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.

190
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,180
You anoint my head with oil.

191
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:54,549
My cup overflows.

192
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:58,136
Surely Your goodness and love will
follow me all the days of my life

193
00:13:58,221 --> 00:14:01,189
and I will dwell in the
house of the Lord evermore.

194
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:03,024
- Amen.
- ALL: Amen.

195
00:14:15,572 --> 00:14:17,489
Mr. Underhill.

196
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:24,379
All his wealth, all his ambitions,

197
00:14:24,414 --> 00:14:27,966
yet here he rests.

198
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:31,920
One might see a lesson in that.

199
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:36,474
Before you return home,

200
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,843
I had hoped that you and
I might share a word.

201
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,814
Privately.

202
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,683
What do you wish to speak about?

203
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,020
Ambition, sir.

204
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,656
Yours and mine.

205
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,530
ASHE:
Total reconciliation?

206
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:00,114
This is what you're suggesting?

207
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,916
A return to colonial rule

208
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:04,502
with an existing power structure in place.

209
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:09,173
And I am to believe that
500 hardened pirate raiders

210
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,459
will voluntarily step down,

211
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:14,846
fall in line with this plan of
yours and volunteer their labor?

212
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:17,632
Not all of them.
A lot of them. Most of them.

213
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,767
Enough to resist those that won't.

214
00:15:19,803 --> 00:15:23,054
Enough to make it worth
giving them a chance.

215
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:25,557
I made an appeal to my crew of 100 men.

216
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:28,192
And better than 70 of
them are sitting right now

217
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:31,362
just outside your harbor
in full support of it.

218
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:34,482
It is exactly as Thomas proposed

219
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,317
- all those years ago in London.
- Yes.

220
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,986
But then we were talking
about less than half

221
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,989
the number of criminals on the island.

222
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:45,159
We were talking about a failing colony,
not a failed one.

223
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,495
We also didn't have the
most respected captain

224
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:50,748
on the island standing
in advocacy of our plan.

225
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:52,133
Now we do.

226
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:54,335
We didn't have the trade boss of the island

227
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,504
actively working to reform operations then.

228
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,172
Now we do.

229
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:01,009
And we didn't have a man
who has established himself

230
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:04,512
as the New World's most committed
pirate hunter endorsing it.

231
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:07,682
(Ticking)

232
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:20,995
The first thing that they
will ask for is a name.

233
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:27,285
- FLINT: A name?
- ASHE: It is as true now as it was then.

234
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:30,371
New Providence will only ever succeed

235
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,624
insofar as its governor can make it so.

236
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:34,842
(Clock chiming)

237
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:37,929
Were I to make this case to
the men I know in Whitehall...

238
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:39,764
(Voice fades)
the first question that they will ask

239
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:42,717
is who will oversee all this?

240
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,938
Who will be responsible
for its success or failure?

241
00:16:47,023 --> 00:16:48,940
You?

242
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:58,032
There are things that I can do to
help protect the fledgling colony.

243
00:16:58,068 --> 00:17:02,070
I can help establish the militia.

244
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,988
I can organize the navy.

245
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:06,240
But beyond that,

246
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:10,411
I don't think that there's a part
for Captain Flint in Nassau's future.

247
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,246
Not with the blood on his hands.

248
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:17,919
He will have to go away

249
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,922
and leave James McGraw and Lady Hamilton

250
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:24,175
to retire to the interior in peace.

251
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:28,730
- (Knocks on door)
- ASHE: Yes?

252
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:29,765
(Door opens)

253
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,686
Father, Mrs. Tyler says it's time

254
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:36,437
to turn the room over for dinner.

255
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,439
Please ask Mrs. Tyler to arrange a room

256
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,274
for our guests to retire to in the interim.

257
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,537
- (Clock ticking)
- Something wrong?

258
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:58,126
Nerves.

259
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,128
I'm fine.

260
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:11,606
- (Violin playing)
- (Men chatting)

261
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:35,496
If we're so worried he's gonna
find something up there...

262
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,167
what are we still doing here?

263
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:42,220
SILVER:
Where exactly do you think we'd go?

264
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,422
Charles Town is sleeping with one eye open

265
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:47,175
and a knife under its pillow tonight.

266
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,010
Any one of us sets foot on that sand

267
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,062
absent an engraved
invitation from the governor

268
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:53,564
is likely to greet the sunrise swinging.

269
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,853
We arrived on this ship.

270
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:03,191
Until and unless Captain Flint
is successful in his endeavor,

271
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,526
this ship is the only
way we leave here alive.

272
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,454
If he was suspicious,
he'd have come down by now.

273
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,707
I'm going to find Randall.

274
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,210
See who I can ridicule
for the crew's amusement.

275
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:26,964
(Wood and metal creaking)

276
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,600
(Whistling)

277
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,449
(Silver sighs)

278
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,401
Randall.

279
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:50,571
Crew address is due at next bells.

280
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,703
If you have anything new
for me by the way of gossip,

281
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:55,076
now... would...

282
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:58,462
be the...

283
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:03,251
time.

284
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:13,394
(Chatter)

285
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,827
(Clattering)

286
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,618
(Knife slicing)

287
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,704
(Man groans)

288
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:56,437
- (Groans)
- DeGroot!

289
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:58,105
- (Men shouting)
- Danger!

290
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:01,726
(Groans)

291
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:52,193
(Grunting)

292
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:56,330
(Shouting)

293
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,505
(Groans)

294
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,302
JENKS:
Secure!

295
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:29,113
MAN: Tie 'em up.
Down in the well with 'em.

296
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:36,620
- (Man shouting)
- MAN #2: Take them alive.

297
00:22:44,747 --> 00:22:47,581
He doesn't want to consider it.

298
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,835
He spent so many years hardening
himself to these ideas.

299
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:56,090
But I don't think he can
work out how to say no.

300
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:59,427
If he says no, it means there's
a part of him that is no more.

301
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:02,813
A part of him he doesn't want to let go of.

302
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:04,515
Did you mean it?

303
00:23:07,437 --> 00:23:09,820
Earlier.

304
00:23:09,906 --> 00:23:12,940
You said Captain Flint
would have to disappear

305
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,575
for this plan to work.

306
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,111
Are you truly ready to let him go?

307
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:25,202
Did I ever tell you where
that name came from?

308
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:28,589
No.

309
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:34,628
I told you of my grandfather who raised me.

310
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,964
A fisherman in Padstow.

311
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:42,386
Well, in his youth

312
00:23:42,472 --> 00:23:45,389
he was a deckhand on a privateer

313
00:23:45,475 --> 00:23:47,475
off the coast of Massachusetts.

314
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:52,029
And one night he was
alone on the late watch

315
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:53,898
at anchor in the Boston Harbor

316
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:57,902
when he sees this man

317
00:23:57,987 --> 00:24:01,455
climbing out of the
water and onto his ship.

318
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:03,240
A stranger.

319
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:07,795
Now, my grandfather thought
about ringing the bell,

320
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,881
but curiosity got the better of him.

321
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:14,668
The stranger approaches my grandfather

322
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,837
and asks him for a little rum.

323
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:21,092
Man said that he'd fled
his fishing trawler.

324
00:24:21,177 --> 00:24:23,394
Accused of killing another man.

325
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:26,013
And when asked his name,

326
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:29,517
the man simply replied

327
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,102
Mr. Flint.

328
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:36,440
This stranger, he never said whether

329
00:24:36,526 --> 00:24:40,778
he was guilty of the killing
or why he chose that ship

330
00:24:40,863 --> 00:24:43,781
or where he was bound, he just...

331
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,451
just sat there.

332
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:51,455
Eventually, he asked my grandfather

333
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:54,208
for a little more rum from below.

334
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,293
My grandfather went off to fetch it,

335
00:24:56,379 --> 00:25:00,131
but when he returned...

336
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:04,351
the man was gone.

337
00:25:04,387 --> 00:25:07,221
My grandfather was in Boston
for a month after that.

338
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,023
Never heard a word about a killing

339
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:12,526
or a fugitive at large.

340
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:17,648
It was as if the sea had
conjured that man out of nothing

341
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:21,235
and then taken him back

342
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:23,871
for some unknowable purpose.

343
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:32,413
When I first met Mr. Gates

344
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:34,331
and he asked me my name...

345
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,087
I feared the man I was about to create.

346
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:45,509
I feared that someone
born of such dark things

347
00:25:45,595 --> 00:25:48,262
would consume me were I not careful.

348
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:50,981
And I was determined only
to wear him for a while

349
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:55,603
and then dispose of him when
his purpose was complete.

350
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:58,022
And I thought of that story.

351
00:26:05,415 --> 00:26:08,299
Am I ready to let him go?

352
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:11,503
(Sighs)

353
00:26:11,588 --> 00:26:13,087
Truth is...

354
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:16,424
every day I've worn that name

355
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,760
I've hated him a little more.

356
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:24,933
I've been ready to return him
to the sea for a long time.

357
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:30,605
James...

358
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:33,775
(Knocks on door)

359
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:36,327
They're ready for you downstairs.

360
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,458
- (Metal creaking)
- (Breathing heavily)

361
00:26:50,544 --> 00:26:53,428
(Men shouting on deck)

362
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:26,744
What the fuck do we do now?

363
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,914
The moment this ship is clear of the area,
if not sooner,

364
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,633
Captain Vane will put the crew
to the sword, yes?

365
00:27:31,668 --> 00:27:33,334
Most likely.

366
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:37,505
Eventually,
they find us down here and do the same.

367
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:40,725
So either we swim to the beach
and likely face the noose,

368
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,344
or else do nothing,
in which case it's the sword.

369
00:28:17,047 --> 00:28:18,713
Come with me.

370
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:20,214
Where are we going?

371
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:23,217
To execute the third option.

372
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:26,054
Persuade Captain Vane
to surrender the ship.

373
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:29,307
- (Horse snorts)
- (Quiet chatter)

374
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:32,560
UNDERHILL:
Governor Ashe? He's coming here?

375
00:28:32,612 --> 00:28:35,063
Plans are underway as we speak.

376
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:38,066
When he arrives,
I propose that you and I greet him together

377
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:41,235
and we explain to him our joint
venture to reclaim Nassau.

378
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:45,239
My ships, your sugar.

379
00:28:45,325 --> 00:28:48,743
The return of legitimate
commerce and the return of law.

380
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,996
For so many years

381
00:28:52,082 --> 00:28:54,549
I have watched you and your kind

382
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:57,552
thieve and whore

383
00:28:57,587 --> 00:29:00,638
and kill like a plague upon this island,

384
00:29:00,724 --> 00:29:02,974
doing whatever you please because you can.

385
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,843
I've heard your appeal.

386
00:29:08,765 --> 00:29:11,432
How could I be expected
to trust one of you?

387
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:13,434
How could you trust a pirate?

388
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:15,737
Exactly.

389
00:29:15,772 --> 00:29:18,439
I am no pirate, sir.

390
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:20,241
I'm an Englishwoman.

391
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:22,110
I'm my father's daughter.

392
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:25,697
And I will be the end of piracy in
this place and it begins tonight.

393
00:29:26,783 --> 00:29:28,366
What do you mean?

394
00:29:28,451 --> 00:29:31,536
ELEANOR: I discovered a plan by
one of the crews on the beach

395
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:35,206
to reclaim a prize that is so large
it would upset our world here.

396
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:39,043
Embolden piracy for years,
possibly decades to come.

397
00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:41,262
I identified the members of that crew

398
00:29:41,297 --> 00:29:43,798
with the specific knowledge of
the whereabouts of that prize.

399
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:47,468
And I have ended their
endeavor before it began.

400
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,722
You've ended it? How?

401
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:57,228
(Gurgling)

402
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:04,652
(Muffled groaning)

403
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,123
Shh.

404
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:10,825
(Footsteps)

405
00:30:28,344 --> 00:30:30,261
You're back.

406
00:30:30,346 --> 00:30:32,230
Just landed.

407
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:48,196
I shouldn't have left the way I did,

408
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:49,997
without telling you.

409
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:54,535
Wasn't your fault what happened.

410
00:30:54,621 --> 00:30:56,454
It was a hard fucking choice put on you.

411
00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:58,873
I didn't think I was gonna see you again.

412
00:31:01,377 --> 00:31:04,846
I thought you'd just get to Port Royal
and board a ship and never look back.

413
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,633
I thought about it.

414
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,941
But then I...

415
00:31:24,484 --> 00:31:25,650
What?

416
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:29,987
Then I...

417
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:31,405
(Gasps)

418
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:33,876
(Shouts)

419
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,576
(Anne shouts)

420
00:31:35,628 --> 00:31:37,211
(Groans)

421
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:39,964
(Groans)

422
00:31:41,718 --> 00:31:43,384
(Grunting)

423
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:47,922
(Groans)

424
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,174
- (Screams)
- (Grunts)

425
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:56,931
(Gasps)

426
00:31:57,016 --> 00:32:00,268
(Groans)

427
00:32:09,746 --> 00:32:11,662
(Ticking)

428
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:28,296
My lord,

429
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:30,715
I know there are many reasons
to say no to this, however...

430
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,050
- Colonel Rhett.
- Yes, sir.

431
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:38,856
I'd like everyone to clear the room.

432
00:32:38,942 --> 00:32:40,725
RHETT:
Sir?

433
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:45,229
I'd like to speak with my
guests privately for a moment.

434
00:32:46,482 --> 00:32:48,282
Wait in the hall, please.

435
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,887
I believe there is a
way that I can help you

436
00:33:09,973 --> 00:33:12,506
achieve your intentions
for the future of Nassau.

437
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:15,426
And I am ready to do it.

438
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:18,930
However,

439
00:33:19,015 --> 00:33:22,817
my plan will require an act of you,
Mr. McGraw,

440
00:33:22,852 --> 00:33:25,019
if it is to succeed.

441
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:31,025
And I don't think you're going to like it.

442
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,000
Are you hurt?

443
00:33:39,035 --> 00:33:40,701
Mostly unscathed, thanks to Anne.

444
00:33:48,211 --> 00:33:51,462
Mr. Stayton and Mr. Atz are dead.

445
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:54,432
Jesus.

446
00:33:54,517 --> 00:33:57,184
MAX: It would be wise not
to tempt fate any further.

447
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,137
Eleanor will be returning from
the interior sooner than later.

448
00:34:00,223 --> 00:34:02,523
Can you sail without those men?

449
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:08,396
Yes.

450
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,698
Fuck it.

451
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:13,067
Fuck her.

452
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:15,069
We leave now.

453
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:22,376
Go get us our prize.

454
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:31,552
- (Violin playing)
- (Chatter)

455
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:08,289
MAN:
Shift capstan bars.

456
00:35:08,374 --> 00:35:10,374
Snap and go, boys.

457
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,626
- MAN #2: Raise anchor.
- (Men grunting)

458
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:18,933
Wait. You certain this is a good idea?

459
00:35:18,968 --> 00:35:22,103
Yes. We sever the forestay,
the ship can't sail till it's repaired

460
00:35:22,138 --> 00:35:23,898
- which could take hours, yes?
- Yeah, but...

461
00:35:23,973 --> 00:35:25,639
The longer Captain Vane
remains in this harbor,

462
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:27,141
the more dangerous it is for him

463
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:29,393
and the more likely it
is that Captain Flint

464
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:30,978
might just win over the governor

465
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,813
and bring his militia to
bear to retake the ship.

466
00:35:32,899 --> 00:35:36,033
I understand that, but the moment
you go out there to sever that line,

467
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,536
they'll send a team of men down
here to clear the hold again.

468
00:35:38,621 --> 00:35:40,121
We evaded them once.

469
00:35:40,156 --> 00:35:42,873
Which makes trying it a second
time that much more insane.

470
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,794
Perhaps.

471
00:35:58,841 --> 00:36:00,841
But I see no other way that I...

472
00:36:02,345 --> 00:36:05,012
we survive this ordeal.

473
00:36:05,098 --> 00:36:06,098
I can.

474
00:36:06,182 --> 00:36:08,566
We swim and hope for the best.

475
00:36:08,651 --> 00:36:12,103
It'd be dangerous,
but it wouldn't be suicide.

476
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:13,604
Just tell me this,

477
00:36:13,689 --> 00:36:16,157
are you suggesting we do
this to save ourselves

478
00:36:16,192 --> 00:36:18,826
or are you suggesting we
do it to save the crew?

479
00:36:38,548 --> 00:36:40,464
(Ropes creaking)

480
00:36:53,896 --> 00:36:57,398
- (Metal creaking)
- (Footsteps)

481
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,899
(Door opens)

482
00:37:10,913 --> 00:37:14,415
You're the boatswain.
Mr. Gates's boy, aren't you?

483
00:37:21,757 --> 00:37:24,592
I've got a confession to make.

484
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:26,727
The Singleton affair,

485
00:37:26,762 --> 00:37:29,430
when Jack and I attempted to
alter the vote on your ship,

486
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:31,849
see Flint deposed,

487
00:37:31,934 --> 00:37:36,437
it was intended to induce key
men on your crew to defect.

488
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:39,773
Then to recruit them ourselves.

489
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:42,693
But most specifically,

490
00:37:42,778 --> 00:37:45,079
it was with an eye toward recruiting you.

491
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:47,781
We'd heard about you.

492
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:49,814
Not some petty thief in it for coin.

493
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:52,600
Not some coward

494
00:37:52,652 --> 00:37:55,853
in need of a bottle to find
his courage in a fight.

495
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:58,272
A proper pirate

496
00:37:58,324 --> 00:38:00,358
committed to our way of things.

497
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:02,243
Committed to a life free of the yoke...

498
00:38:02,278 --> 00:38:03,494
Fuck you.

499
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:07,665
And loyal to a fault.

500
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,371
You can see how that

501
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:16,841
is a man we'd have wanted
on our side of things.

502
00:38:20,713 --> 00:38:23,130
A man I could still use now.

503
00:38:28,388 --> 00:38:31,138
You have no fucking idea
what's going on here,

504
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,640
do you?

505
00:38:32,692 --> 00:38:35,276
Flint stole from me and
I'm making it right.

506
00:38:35,311 --> 00:38:37,862
Exactly. You hate Flint.

507
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,649
I hate Flint.

508
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:48,322
But right now he's talking about
how we survive what comes next.

509
00:38:48,374 --> 00:38:51,158
And you're talking about
what you think is yours.

510
00:38:51,244 --> 00:38:53,661
When the navy arrives,
they aren't gonna give a fuck

511
00:38:53,713 --> 00:38:55,796
what belongs to you or what belongs to me.

512
00:38:55,832 --> 00:38:59,800
Because to them,
there is no difference between you and me.

513
00:38:59,836 --> 00:39:02,586
He has you so afraid of an imagined threat.

514
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:05,473
Nah. (Laughs)

515
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:09,593
I saw it with my own eyes.

516
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:12,012
The garrison on Harbour Island.

517
00:39:12,098 --> 00:39:14,682
Royal Marines, a full company of them.

518
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:16,767
200 men in support.

519
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:18,736
The Scarborough anchored.

520
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:20,855
And a commander just waiting for the order

521
00:39:20,907 --> 00:39:22,690
to begin his assault against us

522
00:39:22,742 --> 00:39:24,525
and exterminate every last one us.

523
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,411
There is nothing imagined about the threat

524
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:29,864
we all face, I assure you.

525
00:39:29,949 --> 00:39:32,249
And right now your only
plan to reckon with it

526
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:33,868
is to try and fight them head to head,

527
00:39:33,953 --> 00:39:36,704
each crew for themselves?

528
00:39:39,842 --> 00:39:43,094
Right now, Flint's plan is the only plan.

529
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:53,387
(Sighs)

530
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:01,228
(Grunting)

531
00:40:02,815 --> 00:40:05,733
(Rumbling)

532
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:12,406
MAN:
Forestay!

533
00:40:12,492 --> 00:40:15,075
Forestay, Captain!

534
00:40:18,414 --> 00:40:20,831
(Chatter)

535
00:40:29,175 --> 00:40:31,759
- What's going on?
- We lost the forestay.

536
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:33,761
Lost it? Fuck you mean, we lost it?

537
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:38,349
Sabotage. We must have missed someone.

538
00:40:38,434 --> 00:40:39,767
Can we sail without it?

539
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:42,436
Not without seriously
risking losing that mast.

540
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:44,939
Drop the anchors. Repair the stay quickly.

541
00:40:44,991 --> 00:40:46,574
I'll get a team, clear the hold.

542
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:48,108
No.

543
00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:49,860
I don't want to divert men
away from the prisoners.

544
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:53,164
We can't leave a saboteur down there.

545
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:54,748
I don't intend to.

546
00:40:58,538 --> 00:41:00,788
(Ticking)

547
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:08,846
ASHE: There are men in Whitehall
who could potentially find

548
00:41:08,931 --> 00:41:11,966
a proposal such as yours to be plausible.

549
00:41:12,051 --> 00:41:16,020
On religious grounds, on economic grounds.

550
00:41:16,105 --> 00:41:18,055
I know some of these men.

551
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,141
You could almost certainly
win them to your side.

552
00:41:21,227 --> 00:41:24,728
But there are other men who
will oppose it categorically

553
00:41:24,814 --> 00:41:28,816
for the same reason all men
refuse to do things they should.

554
00:41:28,868 --> 00:41:31,118
Pride.

555
00:41:33,072 --> 00:41:35,906
You think they're too proud
to put pardons on the table?

556
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:37,491
I think they fear you.

557
00:41:37,543 --> 00:41:39,660
And to capitulate to something one fears

558
00:41:39,712 --> 00:41:43,330
is a humiliation that
powerful men cannot accept.

559
00:41:43,382 --> 00:41:46,667
If we are to persuade
them to ally with you,

560
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,169
then we have to completely redefine

561
00:41:49,222 --> 00:41:51,472
their understanding of who you are,

562
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:53,390
what you are.

563
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:57,561
How do you propose we do that?

564
00:41:57,647 --> 00:41:59,730
With the truth.

565
00:41:59,815 --> 00:42:03,601
I will come with you to Nassau,
survey the situation.

566
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:05,185
If it is as you say it is,

567
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:09,156
you and I will sail to London together.

568
00:42:09,191 --> 00:42:11,442
And when we arrive,

569
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:14,612
you will stand up

570
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:16,363
and you will tell your story.

571
00:42:19,368 --> 00:42:21,285
My story?

572
00:42:23,706 --> 00:42:25,539
What part of my story?

573
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:27,508
All of it.

574
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:34,965
You will tell them about
the affair with Thomas.

575
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:40,220
You will tell them how it ended.

576
00:42:40,273 --> 00:42:43,190
You will explain to them
what it drove you to do.

577
00:42:44,944 --> 00:42:46,560
You will reveal everything.

578
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:49,063
And when you do,

579
00:42:49,148 --> 00:42:51,649
Captain Flint will be unmasked,

580
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:53,484
the monster slain.

581
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:59,540
And in his place will stand
before all the world a flawed man,

582
00:42:59,575 --> 00:43:01,909
a man that England can relate to

583
00:43:01,994 --> 00:43:04,912
and offer its forgiveness.

584
00:43:09,168 --> 00:43:11,085
(Sighs)

585
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,224
(Clock ticking)

586
00:43:28,237 --> 00:43:30,938
What you're asking of me...

587
00:43:34,193 --> 00:43:35,693
I wish there were another way,

588
00:43:35,778 --> 00:43:38,612
but I have given it great
thought and I cannot find it.

589
00:43:43,452 --> 00:43:45,753
Tell me this is something
that you are willing to do,

590
00:43:45,788 --> 00:43:48,839
and you and I will walk
out of this house together,

591
00:43:48,924 --> 00:43:52,042
announce our partnership to the street,

592
00:43:52,128 --> 00:43:54,628
and prepare to set sail for Nassau.

593
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:18,318
(Clock chiming)

594
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,883
Your clock by the wall...

595
00:44:32,968 --> 00:44:35,002
where did you obtain it?

596
00:44:37,506 --> 00:44:38,839
What?

597
00:44:38,924 --> 00:44:41,091
It looks very much like
one that used to reside

598
00:44:41,177 --> 00:44:43,143
in my husband's parlor in London.

599
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:45,179
Identical, in fact.

600
00:44:45,264 --> 00:44:47,147
I don't remember gifting it to you.

601
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:48,649
It was there when I left.

602
00:44:48,684 --> 00:44:51,318
So I ask again,

603
00:44:51,353 --> 00:44:54,104
how is it you came to possess that clock?

604
00:44:57,076 --> 00:44:58,525
It was a gift.

605
00:44:58,577 --> 00:44:59,743
From whom?

606
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,953
From Alfred Hamilton.

607
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,542
The earl was no friend of yours,

608
00:45:15,628 --> 00:45:17,878
yet he grants you gifts from his own home.

609
00:45:17,963 --> 00:45:19,463
Why would he do that?

610
00:45:23,269 --> 00:45:25,636
All these years it never sat right with me

611
00:45:25,721 --> 00:45:29,189
how Alfred was able to turn
the navy against James.

612
00:45:29,225 --> 00:45:31,558
He was far too admired by his superiors

613
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:35,562
for his career to be dashed
by solely on hearsay.

614
00:45:37,733 --> 00:45:40,451
Alfred would have known that.

615
00:45:40,536 --> 00:45:42,069
He wouldn't have gone to them

616
00:45:42,121 --> 00:45:45,739
armed only with unfounded suspicions.

617
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:47,708
He would have needed a witness,

618
00:45:47,743 --> 00:45:51,662
someone who knew Thomas

619
00:45:51,747 --> 00:45:53,714
and James well enough

620
00:45:53,749 --> 00:45:56,083
to give the accusation credibility.

621
00:45:59,088 --> 00:46:01,555
Alfred came to you, didn't he?

622
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:05,893
Asked you to betray Thomas
in exchange for which he'd...

623
00:46:05,928 --> 00:46:08,762
see you made a king in the New World.

624
00:46:17,439 --> 00:46:19,740
Perhaps this is an opportunity for us all

625
00:46:19,775 --> 00:46:21,441
to find a little forgiveness.

626
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:23,327
Forgiveness?

627
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:27,114
What forgiveness are you entitled to

628
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:29,333
while you stand back in the shadows

629
00:46:29,418 --> 00:46:31,952
pushing James out in front of the world

630
00:46:32,004 --> 00:46:34,955
to be laid bear for the sake of the truth?

631
00:46:36,175 --> 00:46:38,375
Tell me, sir, when does the truth

632
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,260
about your sins come to light?

633
00:46:40,296 --> 00:46:43,964
You know nothing of my sins.

634
00:46:44,049 --> 00:46:46,266
Were you there when
Alfred Hamilton threatened

635
00:46:46,302 --> 00:46:48,802
my family's standing, my daughter's future

636
00:46:48,888 --> 00:46:50,304
if I failed to cooperate?

637
00:46:50,389 --> 00:46:55,225
Were you there when I visited
Thomas at the hospital

638
00:46:55,311 --> 00:46:57,811
to confess my sins and heard him offer

639
00:46:57,863 --> 00:47:00,314
his full and true forgiveness?

640
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:02,533
He knew I had no choice in the matter.

641
00:47:02,618 --> 00:47:05,485
- MIRANDA: No choice?
- A hard choice.

642
00:47:05,538 --> 00:47:07,704
Made under great duress,
but with the intent

643
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,073
to achieve the least awful outcome.

644
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:12,492
You wish to return to civilization.

645
00:47:12,545 --> 00:47:15,045
That is what civilization is.

646
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,004
I am so very sorry for
what you have suffered

647
00:47:24,056 --> 00:47:26,173
and for any part I may have played in it.

648
00:47:26,225 --> 00:47:28,008
Please believe that.

649
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,727
But at this point, the most important thing

650
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:33,146
is what comes next, what we make of this.

651
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:35,983
- You destroyed our lives!
- Miranda.

652
00:47:36,018 --> 00:47:38,235
- You caused our exile!
- I am sorry for what I did.

653
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,521
- Thomas died in a cold, dark place...
- I am trying to help you.

654
00:47:41,607 --> 00:47:43,407
- What more do you want from me?
- What do I want?

655
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:45,442
I want to see this whole goddamn city,

656
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:49,863
this city that you purchased
with our misery, burn.

657
00:47:49,915 --> 00:47:52,833
I want to see you hanged
on the very gallows

658
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:55,869
you've used to hang men for
crimes far slighter than this.

659
00:47:55,955 --> 00:47:58,205
I want to see that noose around your neck

660
00:47:58,257 --> 00:48:00,841
and I want to pull the fucking
lever with my own two hands!

661
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:02,843
(Gunshot)

662
00:48:05,214 --> 00:48:06,797
(Gasps)

663
00:48:06,882 --> 00:48:08,131
This is not what I wanted.

664
00:48:08,217 --> 00:48:09,716
Do not shoot him.

665
00:48:09,802 --> 00:48:12,269
- (Shouting)
- ASHE: Don't shoot!

666
00:48:12,354 --> 00:48:13,971
(Grunting)

667
00:48:29,655 --> 00:48:32,139
- (Abigail screams)
- (Horse whinnies)

668
00:48:32,207 --> 00:48:34,124
(Snorting)

669
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:42,582
We have a deal, then?

670
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,752
Yes.

671
00:48:46,805 --> 00:48:48,422
(Sighs)

672
00:48:50,926 --> 00:48:52,926
We must get back before we're missed.

673
00:48:52,978 --> 00:48:54,594
We have much work to do.

674
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:58,098
Your father...

675
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,267
when he came to me seeking sanctuary,

676
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,103
telling me he wished to resist the
continued presence of the pirates,

677
00:49:03,188 --> 00:49:07,357
he told me he'd repented for his past sins.

678
00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:09,076
He seemed so genuinely contrite.

679
00:49:11,196 --> 00:49:13,664
I knew his reputation.
I knew he was most likely

680
00:49:13,749 --> 00:49:16,783
telling me the story I wanted to hear,

681
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:19,753
but his contrition was utilitarian at best.

682
00:49:19,788 --> 00:49:22,589
But you,

683
00:49:22,624 --> 00:49:25,509
you don't even seem to be
wanting to appear that way.

684
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,797
The time for storytelling is past.

685
00:49:30,883 --> 00:49:33,216
Now is the time for cold, hard truths.

686
00:49:36,939 --> 00:49:39,856
- (Frogs croaking)
- (Crickets chirping)

687
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:45,312
(Horse snorts, neighs)

688
00:49:47,616 --> 00:49:48,865
What is this?

689
00:49:48,951 --> 00:49:50,984
Who are you?

690
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:55,205
Are you Underhill?

691
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:58,658
- I am.
- Then I suggest you step aside, sir.

692
00:49:58,744 --> 00:50:00,327
We've no quarrel with you.

693
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,715
However, we will be taking the girl.

694
00:50:11,173 --> 00:50:13,673
(Wind blowing)

695
00:50:27,906 --> 00:50:30,190
(Creaking)

696
00:50:56,802 --> 00:50:59,970
(Man whistles)
Launch approaching!

697
00:51:02,724 --> 00:51:05,892
(Bell ringing)

698
00:51:18,907 --> 00:51:20,740
Hello.

699
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:32,752
Hello.

700
00:51:37,009 --> 00:51:39,176
Man your stations.

701
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:41,094
Ready the guns.

702
00:51:43,348 --> 00:51:46,066
- What's happening?
- Shut the fuck up.

703
00:51:57,996 --> 00:52:00,280
So...

704
00:52:02,284 --> 00:52:04,951
what do you suppose happens next?

705
00:52:05,037 --> 00:52:07,838
MAN:
Pirate vessel!

706
00:52:07,923 --> 00:52:10,090
Pirate vessel!

707
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:13,126
What follows is a message

708
00:52:13,178 --> 00:52:16,346
from the Lord Governor
of the Carolina Colony.

709
00:52:16,431 --> 00:52:18,548
"I trusted the good faith of your arrival

710
00:52:18,634 --> 00:52:21,134
and I accepted Captain Flint as my guest

711
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,270
in the same spirit.

712
00:52:23,305 --> 00:52:25,605
But I now regret to inform you

713
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:28,892
that he has violated that trust
in a most deceitful manner."

714
00:52:28,977 --> 00:52:32,812
- What?
- "Therefore I've placed him under arrest.

715
00:52:32,898 --> 00:52:36,149
This trial and its resulting sentence

716
00:52:36,235 --> 00:52:39,786
will be swift, just, and final.

717
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:43,240
And it will reestablish
beyond any shadow of a doubt

718
00:52:43,325 --> 00:52:47,377
that the rule of law lives in Carolina,

719
00:52:47,462 --> 00:52:50,497
that the men and women of this place

720
00:52:50,549 --> 00:52:54,084
will not shrink from you, from any of you,

721
00:52:54,169 --> 00:52:56,670
from any like you,

722
00:52:56,755 --> 00:52:59,506
and that the death of
piracy in the New World

723
00:52:59,591 --> 00:53:03,426
has never been nearer than today.

724
00:53:03,512 --> 00:53:05,512
At the conclusion of this trial,

725
00:53:05,597 --> 00:53:10,066
if your ship remains,
I will seize or sink her."

726
00:53:15,941 --> 00:53:18,108
(Grunts)

727
00:53:19,861 --> 00:53:23,863
Now, let me tell you what happens next.

728
00:53:31,373 --> 00:53:34,207
(Men chattering)

729
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:03,069
You were right.

730
00:54:08,243 --> 00:54:09,993
Right about what?

731
00:54:10,078 --> 00:54:13,330
They can't tell the
difference between you and I.

732
00:54:16,802 --> 00:54:20,971
Nassau is strongest when she's feared.

733
00:54:21,056 --> 00:54:23,139
And if what promises
to happen here tomorrow

734
00:54:23,225 --> 00:54:26,142
actually happens, a trophy

735
00:54:26,228 --> 00:54:30,263
made of one of her most notorious captains,

736
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:32,816
she may never be feared again.

737
00:54:32,901 --> 00:54:36,736
So I suggest we do something about this.

738
00:54:36,772 --> 00:54:40,190
I suggest we...

739
00:54:40,275 --> 00:54:42,242
get him the hell out of there.

740
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:50,583
(Footsteps)

741
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:53,286
(Eleanor breathing heavily)

742
00:54:59,511 --> 00:55:01,344
HORNIGOLD:
Captain Hume.

743
00:55:03,632 --> 00:55:06,466
I understand you hold in
your possession 10 pardons

744
00:55:06,551 --> 00:55:11,187
for whomever was to deliver
you Captain James Flint.

745
00:55:11,273 --> 00:55:13,189
I wonder if I can't do better.

746
00:55:16,194 --> 00:55:18,361
(Muffled grunts)

747
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,153
This is Eleanor Guthrie,
the trade boss of Nassau,

748
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:30,957
the woman who lorded over
a savage pirate kingdom

749
00:55:30,992 --> 00:55:32,992
as if it were a plaything.

750
00:55:33,045 --> 00:55:36,463
And without whom it cannot function.

751
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:39,749
Imagine, sir, how London would react

752
00:55:39,835 --> 00:55:42,335
to the arrival of the queen of thieves.

753
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:44,804
Imagine the spectacle of her trial.

754
00:55:46,174 --> 00:55:47,974
Imagine the celebrity

755
00:55:48,009 --> 00:55:50,643
that'll be heaped upon her captor.

756
00:56:09,998 --> 00:56:12,499
(Muffled shouting)

757
00:56:34,222 --> 00:56:36,789

1
00:00:01,088 --> 00:00:02,888
Are you the liaison
sent by the Admiralty?

2
00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:03,995
I am, my lord.

3
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:06,975
I intend to save Nassau
before she's lost forever.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,427
Hornigold provided security for
the consortium's operations.

5
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:11,312
You'd like me to fill
that role for you now?

6
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:13,398
If your friends aren't capable
of protecting themselves,

7
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:14,593
they aren't worth protecting.

8
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:15,850
- ELEANOR: What's your name?
- Ned Low.

9
00:00:15,902 --> 00:00:17,686
It would be a shame
to make enemies of each other

10
00:00:17,738 --> 00:00:20,355
- over such a small amount of money.
- Get out of my place.

11
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:23,358
Hell of a prize, Mr. Meeks.
Hell of a prize.

12
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,171
MAX: Perhaps it is in
everyone's best interest

13
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:27,445
that you and I find a way
past all of this.

14
00:00:27,447 --> 00:00:29,831
FLINT: There's simply no way
of stealing their gold.

15
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:32,250
But there might be something else
you can steal... their war ship.

16
00:00:32,285 --> 00:00:34,419
DUFRESNE: You will both be
transported back to Nassau

17
00:00:34,454 --> 00:00:37,422
at which point you will be removed
from this ship permanently.

18
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:40,125
SILVER: I think you intend to
take control of this ship.

19
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:42,677
And then I think you intend
to return to that beach

20
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:45,180
and seize every last ounce
of gold off of it.

21
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:47,799
And I think you're going
to need my help to do it.

22
00:00:49,703 --> 00:00:51,936

24
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:32,821
(Gasps)

25
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:49,420
(Gasping)

26
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:04,269
I learned of this technique
from a Spanish bishop.

27
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:06,404
Six days, they claim,

28
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,907
before the sun shrinks
the leather so tight

29
00:03:08,942 --> 00:03:12,277
that the ribs collapse,
piercing vital organs within.

30
00:03:13,864 --> 00:03:16,197
And on the seventh day,
you'll rest.

31
00:03:16,249 --> 00:03:19,951
Who knew?
They have a sense of humor.

32
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:27,208
When my men first
pulled you out of the sea

33
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,093
and brought you back
to this garrison,

34
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:33,298
I knew right away you were going
to be of great value to me.

35
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,134
You were ill-disposed
to acknowledge as much then,

36
00:03:36,186 --> 00:03:38,136
but five days later,

37
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:40,138
I believe I have your attention.

38
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,474
You see, I believe
I may have an opportunity

39
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:45,476
to be liberated from this place.

40
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:48,730
And you are going to help me.

41
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:03,828
THOMAS: And God said,
"Let there be light,"

42
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,247
and then there was light.

43
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,167
And He saw that it was good,

44
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:12,253
and He separated the land
from the water,

45
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:15,006
and He called the water the Seas.

46
00:04:17,143 --> 00:04:21,229
And He said, "Let the sea
bring forth life abundantly."

47
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:24,515
And He blessed it,

48
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:26,184
and He said that it was good.

49
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:28,102
(Men shouting)

50
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:33,858
(Grunting)

51
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:39,080
THOMAS: And He formed man
of the dust of the ground

52
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:41,833
and breathed life into his nostrils

53
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:44,669
and man became a living soul.

54
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:47,372
And He beheld all He had created,

55
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,507
and He said it was very good.

56
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:57,015
But the Lord beheld the man
made in his likeness

57
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,017
and He beheld his solitude...

58
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:02,136
and He said,

59
00:05:02,188 --> 00:05:04,889
"It is not good that he is alone."

60
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:09,861
- (Thunder rumbling)
- And the moral of the story...

61
00:05:12,198 --> 00:05:14,866
everybody needs a partner.

62
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:17,902
You are the partner assigned to me

63
00:05:17,954 --> 00:05:21,039
in response to my father's request by
the Admiralty, but it would appear

64
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:24,742
that even you believe this
endeavor is doomed to fail.

65
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:27,211
Beg pardon, my lord,
but I didn't say that.

66
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:30,415
I merely said that it would be wise
for us to manage our expectations

67
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:32,333
as to what's achievable.

68
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:34,635
And what is it that
you think is achievable?

69
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:37,138
Well, sir, the pirate
issue is a thorny one,

70
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:39,507
but I believe that
there are ways to...

71
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:42,310
- Aside from the pirates.
- I'm sorry?

72
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:45,396
I don't believe the pirates are
the cause of Nassau's problem.

73
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:48,266
I believe they are a symptom.

74
00:05:48,268 --> 00:05:51,436
The root causes are the ones that
I would like to address first.

75
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,271
Root causes?

76
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:55,323
The graft of its governor.

77
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:56,774
The incompetence of its managers.

78
00:05:56,826 --> 00:05:59,410
The neglect of its lords.

79
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:01,446
The instability caused by these things

80
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:03,998
is what draws the pirates to
Nassau, not the other way around.

81
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:05,917
So let's begin there.

82
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:08,453
What is it that you believe
would truly return Nassau

83
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:09,954
to stable profitability?

84
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:12,623
You mean aside from
removing the pirates?

85
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:15,593
Let's leave them out for now, yes.

86
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:17,962
What would it take?

87
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:23,968
Farmers, men skilled in the
cultivation of sugar and tobacco.

88
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,188
Magistrates to maintain order.
Carpenters to raise buildings.

89
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:29,140
Clergy to raise spirits.

90
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:32,643
Foodstuffs to sustain them all
for six months, perhaps a year.

91
00:06:32,645 --> 00:06:35,980
Three ships to transport it
all, sailors to sail them.

92
00:06:35,982 --> 00:06:37,865
And an honest governor,

93
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:40,985
the first in recent memory,
to oversee it all.

94
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:43,538
In short, you'd be
assembling a colony,

95
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:46,407
boarding it onto ships, transporting
it across the Atlantic,

96
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:49,127
and hoping that when it arrives,
it takes to an environment

97
00:06:49,162 --> 00:06:51,496
that has resisted every
attempt at stable commerce

98
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:53,831
for the past 50 years.

99
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:57,168
Oh, and then there are the pirates
that we've agreed not to discuss.

100
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:02,173
Are you sure three ships
would be enough?

101
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:07,562
My lord, I feel I have
to be honest with you.

102
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:11,649
I have grave doubts about whether
something like this is realistic.

103
00:07:11,684 --> 00:07:13,935
- Yes, I've gathered that.
- If you wish to request

104
00:07:13,987 --> 00:07:17,355
a liaison more sympathetic
to your views,

105
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:19,657
I'm sure Admiral Hennessey
would be happy to oblige.

106
00:07:19,692 --> 00:07:23,528
The New World is a gift, Lieutenant,

107
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,166
a sacred opportunity to right
our wrongs and begin anew.

108
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:30,918
And I do not want
my family's plot in it

109
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:32,870
to be the reason for its fall.

110
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:40,128
I'm not looking for
someone to hold my hand.

111
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,213
I need someone who can help me

112
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:44,882
ensure that Nassau survives.

113
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,801
The stakes are too great
for anything else.

114
00:07:48,054 --> 00:07:49,637
And you suspect that I'm that person

115
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:53,167
despite the fact that it's clear that
we both view the world very differently?

116
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:54,798
Because of it.

117
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:57,695
Strange pairs, Lieutenant.

118
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,232
They can achieve
the most unexpected things.

119
00:08:13,913 --> 00:08:16,414
You can walk away
from all this if you wanted.

120
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:19,300
The moment we arrive at Nassau,

121
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:21,886
you're free to go anywhere you want.

122
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:26,390
And yet you've offered
to help me regain control of this crew.

123
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:29,810
Why would you do that?

124
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:34,765
You mean aside from the share
of gold I'd get out of it?

125
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:40,605
There are other ways of
earning money, other crews.

126
00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:43,691
I don't want to earn money.

127
00:08:43,743 --> 00:08:45,610
I don't want to join another crew.

128
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:48,412
If we're being honest, I don't
really want to be on this crew

129
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:50,948
a day longer than
is absolutely necessary.

130
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,166
Why not?

131
00:08:52,202 --> 00:08:54,619
Because I don't want to be a pirate.

132
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:56,954
I'm not interested in the life.

133
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:58,873
Not interested in the fighting,

134
00:08:58,925 --> 00:09:01,008
not interested in the ships.

135
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:04,295
I don't care much for the sea
while we're on the subject.

136
00:09:04,297 --> 00:09:06,047
But being a pirate on this crew

137
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:07,798
for a little while longer,

138
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,600
it offers me an opportunity

139
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:13,304
I don't believe I can find
anywhere else on Earth...

140
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:15,973
one big prize.

141
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:18,109
And with it, freedom.

142
00:09:18,144 --> 00:09:20,645
From water, from Randall,

143
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:24,115
from hunger, from wages...

144
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:26,951
from you.

145
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,625
Just one question.

146
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:38,663
In approximately two days' time,

147
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:40,748
when we arrive back at Nassau,

148
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,884
you and I will both be unceremoniously
expelled from this ship.

149
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,671
That would seem to be
an impediment to your plan.

150
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:52,393
In less than two days,

151
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:55,896
I intend to be a captain again.

152
00:09:55,932 --> 00:09:59,517
I suggest you find a way of earning
your way back onto this crew as well.

153
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:05,406
(Chatter)

154
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:09,694
(Men laughing)

155
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,916
Captain, a word, please.

156
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,954
Mr. Meeks, how can I help you?

157
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:27,628
What happened at the tavern
last night, Captain?

158
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,430
I don't know.
Did something happen?

159
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:32,516
I've heard word you
confronted the Guthrie woman.

160
00:10:32,552 --> 00:10:34,935
- Threatened her?
- And?

161
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:37,021
And I wish you hadn't done that.

162
00:10:37,056 --> 00:10:38,776
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Are we through?

163
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:40,558
No, we're not.

164
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,560
The crew's relationship with her

165
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:44,478
is worth far more than
the amount she withheld

166
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,314
from the Good Fortune prize.

167
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:49,066
You're recklessly jeopardizing
that relationship,

168
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:51,235
their relationship.

169
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:52,870
Mr. Meeks, would you like to know

170
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:54,705
what the men were laughing at
just now when you arrived?

171
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:59,076
I was recounting to them
my conversation at the tavern last night

172
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:01,078
and wondering aloud

173
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
if I were to fuck the lady Guthrie

174
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:05,549
to within an inch of her young
life while they watched,

175
00:11:05,585 --> 00:11:08,636
would the crew consider her
debt to them repaid in full?

176
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,888
(Men laughing)

177
00:11:10,923 --> 00:11:12,757
And will they feel the same

178
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,226
when their next haul
is rejected by her outright?

179
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:16,977
When we return from Carolina,

180
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:19,597
every man on this ship will
have his hat filled with gold.

181
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:21,816
What happens after that?

182
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:23,934
It's an uncertain world, Mr. Meeks.

183
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:25,319
Best to live in the now.

184
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:54,515
He took me in

185
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,968
when I didn't have shit.

186
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,603
Made a place for me.

187
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,640
Taught me things.

188
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:06,694
Without him, I wouldn't
have fucking made it.

189
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:12,366
When someone gives you a life,

190
00:12:12,402 --> 00:12:14,285
it ain't truly your own.

191
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:19,790
You owe some part of it back.

192
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:26,163
What happened last night...

193
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:27,965
Jesus.

194
00:12:31,304 --> 00:12:34,054
I understand.

195
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,807
Something so different
from what you know.

196
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:39,176
I know how frightening it can be.

197
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:45,850
I will respect your wishes

198
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:48,436
and we can make last night
the last time.

199
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:07,254
Oh, fuck. There must be a way.

200
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,206
A way to make me essential.

201
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:12,343
They can hate me,
they just need to need me.

202
00:13:12,378 --> 00:13:14,678
Randall, hurry the fuck up.

203
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:16,347
We're waiting.

204
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:21,769
And don't you dare fucking
spit in my bowl, Randall.

205
00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:23,354
We all know you do it
when you're ornery,

206
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,056
but I'm warning you, I'll know.

207
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:31,812
Curs.

208
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:37,401
You're gonna do it
anyway, aren't you?

209
00:13:37,403 --> 00:13:39,620
(Snorting)

210
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,242
Randall, that is truly disgusting.

211
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:48,746
Imbecile or no, you really
ought to know better.

212
00:13:48,748 --> 00:13:51,332
I don't like him.

213
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:54,468
Be that as it may, it hardly justifies...

214
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:57,755
What did you say?

215
00:13:57,757 --> 00:14:00,257
I don't like him.

216
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,763
Yes.

217
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:07,932
Perhaps the better question is,

218
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:10,484
who else doesn't like him?

219
00:14:14,607 --> 00:14:16,440
- (Knocks on door)
- Yes?

220
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:21,278
A moment, if I may?

221
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:24,782
Of course.

222
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:27,918
Have you read any of these?

223
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:30,921
Excuse me?

224
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,343
A shelf of books,
so many lives unled...

225
00:14:37,797 --> 00:14:40,381
so many possibilities.

226
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:43,384
I glanced, but nothing rang familiar.

227
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:46,220
Nor for me.

228
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:51,141
You know the irony of all this?

229
00:14:51,143 --> 00:14:53,978
When we first found you,

230
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,147
I was the one who saw
the promise in acquiring you

231
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,483
and Mr. Gates was the one
who opposed it.

232
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:01,869
Is that so?

233
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:03,487
He didn't trust lettered men.

234
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:06,240
Found them harder to keep in line,

235
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:09,126
more resistant to persuasion.

236
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:11,662
I prevailed.

237
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:13,247
What was your argument?

238
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:18,502
That I was tired of being the only one
he had a hard time keeping in line.

239
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:20,504
(Chuckles)

240
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:28,312
Mr. Flint, I'm sorry, but I have a
tremendous amount of preparations...

241
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:30,147
It's killing me...

242
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:31,649
what happened.

243
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:35,102
What I did to Mr. Gates.

244
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:38,656
I keep on replaying it in my mind

245
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:40,658
every waking moment,

246
00:15:40,693 --> 00:15:43,027
trying to see another way.

247
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:48,999
I don't expect you to understand,

248
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:52,703
but I need you to know
that no one on this ship

249
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:56,457
feels his loss more keenly than I do.

250
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:00,711
I know he developed
a great affection for you.

251
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:05,049
Perhaps if I can support you
in this moment,

252
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:08,719
it will be some small
penance for what I've done.

253
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:12,022
How exactly do you propose
to support me?

254
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:14,058
By giving you good counsel.

255
00:16:18,564 --> 00:16:21,315
We're losing our favorable wind.

256
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:23,651
Been losing it for hours.

257
00:16:23,703 --> 00:16:26,704
Now, sooner or later,
someone will suggest

258
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:30,124
tacking east around the
coast, get ahead of the wind.

259
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,743
Maneuvered properly, that would
be the fastest way home,

260
00:16:32,745 --> 00:16:35,379
but I suggest that you resist
that plan at all costs.

261
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:37,665
Why?

262
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:41,502
Because that route runs right through
the common passage out of Kingston.

263
00:16:41,554 --> 00:16:44,805
And the men will press to take
the first prize they sight.

264
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:53,347
We're in possession of a war ship.

265
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,649
Why would we shy away
from taking a prize?

266
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:58,152
Because the men aren't ready.

267
00:16:58,187 --> 00:16:59,937
Not with the numbers they've lost.

268
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:03,524
They're far too depleted to
fully man this ship in battle.

269
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:05,359
You get them home safely,

270
00:17:05,411 --> 00:17:08,612
get them rested,
reinforce their numbers,

271
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:12,032
and then take this ship
and do with it what you will.

272
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:27,464
(Chatter)

273
00:17:31,353 --> 00:17:35,773
HENNESSEY: "A sacred opportunity
to right our wrongs."

274
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:40,144
My God, do you know anyone in
the world who talks that way?

275
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:41,979
I do now, sir.

276
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:44,648
Is it possible he's fully mad?

277
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,450
Half of Whitehall whispers it.

278
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:49,570
He isn't mad. He's just...

279
00:17:49,622 --> 00:17:52,372
bright, determined, wealthy,

280
00:17:52,408 --> 00:17:53,874
all at the same time.

281
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:55,325
Jesus. That's worse.

282
00:17:56,462 --> 00:17:58,912
(Chatter, laughter)

283
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:04,551
You might like him, sir.

284
00:18:04,587 --> 00:18:09,339
Actually, I went to one
of those salons of his,

285
00:18:09,341 --> 00:18:13,060
the ones that half the Royal
Society attend but most deny.

286
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:15,596
Most of those men are pretenders, sir,

287
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:18,682
attracted to his ideas because
they make them feel like radicals.

288
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:20,684
But Thomas...

289
00:18:20,686 --> 00:18:23,570
when he talks about
the need to rethink things,

290
00:18:23,606 --> 00:18:25,405
systemic things,

291
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:27,991
I think he truly believes
what he's saying.

292
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:31,161
And what's more, I'm afraid I might
believe a good deal of it as well.

293
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:32,696
Thomas?

294
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:35,365
I'm sorry, sir.

295
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:39,453
He refuses to stand on ceremony,
insists on the familiar.

296
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,090
I know what you're thinking,
but I assure you, sir,

297
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,876
my judgment, as it relates
to this assignment,

298
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:47,461
is still intact.

299
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:53,050
Ship's business.

300
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:55,469
I shall return. No, no.

301
00:18:58,023 --> 00:18:59,807
(Men laughing)

302
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,460
Is there a problem?

303
00:19:20,496 --> 00:19:23,297
No problem. None whatsoever.

304
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,966
Apologies.

305
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:28,635
Perhaps it's my jealousy showing.

306
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:30,754
Liaison to the Hamilton family,

307
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:33,223
that's quite an appointment.

308
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,259
Congratulations, sir.

309
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:38,095
Thank you.

310
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:40,147
I must say, I thought
myself quite qualified,

311
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:42,266
but then I suppose perhaps

312
00:19:42,318 --> 00:19:45,936
for this particular assignment,
you were the better man.

313
00:19:45,988 --> 00:19:48,238
(Men chuckle)

314
00:19:53,946 --> 00:19:55,445
Of course, I can understand

315
00:19:55,497 --> 00:19:57,831
how it would be
of such importance to you.

316
00:19:57,867 --> 00:20:01,785
Someone of your station...
son of a carpenter's mate

317
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:04,121
given a chance
to socialize with a lord.

318
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:06,206
Hold that position for long enough

319
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:09,509
and you might convince everyone you're
something more than you actually are.

320
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:11,178
(Men chuckle)

321
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:13,630
A gentleman, most civilized.

322
00:20:13,682 --> 00:20:15,515
(Chuckling)

323
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:18,719
I imagine there is
no end to the benefits

324
00:20:18,771 --> 00:20:21,054
Thomas Hamilton's favor
could bestow upon you.

325
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:24,308
Future employment, status...

326
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,395
hell, I understand
if he likes you well enough,

327
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:30,781
he may even let you fuck his wife.

328
00:20:30,816 --> 00:20:33,317
(Grunting)

329
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,959
HENNESSEY:
Enough!

330
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,884
If you are an officer in my fleet,

331
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,470
I suggest you leave this place.

332
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:56,173
Now!

333
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:10,904
(Chatter)

334
00:21:15,861 --> 00:21:17,577
You can't blame the men.

335
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:19,830
They'd suffered under
an awful stretch of captains.

336
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:22,666
Weaklings, frauds, liars.

337
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:25,953
Ned Low, whatever he is,
he's none of those things.

338
00:21:26,005 --> 00:21:27,788
The men saw him as an answer.

339
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,041
But now I fear they cannot
see that by supporting him,

340
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:33,043
they may be sowing the seeds
of their own destruction.

341
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:35,929
Mr. Meeks, your men can't
possibly be that stupid.

342
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:38,515
Are they unaware of the profits he
cost them with the Good Fortune prize?

343
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,300
Or the future profits
he's costing them with me?

344
00:21:40,352 --> 00:21:44,388
Ma'am, I'm uncertain of my
footing on this subject.

345
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,889
Suffice it to say,

346
00:21:45,891 --> 00:21:50,777
the Good Fortune yielded up
a unique item of great value.

347
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:53,280
The men know where their next
distribution is coming from

348
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:55,816
and it isn't you.

349
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:57,451
Item? What kind of item?

350
00:21:57,486 --> 00:21:59,236
I really cannot say.

351
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:02,572
Well, Mr. Meeks, I'm not exactly sure

352
00:22:02,624 --> 00:22:04,104
what it is you think I can do for you,

353
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:06,910
- but I've got business...
- I hear you depose captains.

354
00:22:06,912 --> 00:22:10,080
- Excuse me?
- I'm told you have that power.

355
00:22:10,132 --> 00:22:12,049
I'm told you've done it before.

356
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:13,967
That was a special case

357
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:16,420
and something I nearly paid for
at the cost of my livelihood.

358
00:22:16,472 --> 00:22:18,922
Simply incompatible
with the role I play here now.

359
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:21,641
He is a mad man.

360
00:22:21,677 --> 00:22:24,561
And he's fixed on you
as an object of his ire.

361
00:22:24,596 --> 00:22:27,514
I need your help.
My men need your help.

362
00:22:27,566 --> 00:22:32,019
But you have an interest in
seeing this resolved as well.

363
00:22:32,071 --> 00:22:33,737
(Knocks on door)

364
00:22:33,772 --> 00:22:35,605
Ma'am.

365
00:22:36,742 --> 00:22:38,775
I'm on my way.

366
00:22:38,827 --> 00:22:40,243
Wait for me in the bar.

367
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:42,245
We'll continue this conversation.

368
00:22:46,118 --> 00:22:48,118
Apologies, gentlemen,
for keeping you waiting.

369
00:22:53,092 --> 00:22:56,710
I'm most eager to hear the results
of Captain Lawrence's journey.

370
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:02,049
(Chickens clucking)

371
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:06,019
- WOMAN: Thanks, love.
- RACKHAM: Treating yourself, I see.

372
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:08,972
I'd say you're entitled.

373
00:23:08,974 --> 00:23:11,141
The work you've done
for my inn is commendable.

374
00:23:11,193 --> 00:23:15,028
And what good are the efforts
if they yield no spoils?

375
00:23:15,064 --> 00:23:17,981
- I don't know what you mean.
- Don't ya?

376
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:21,451
Mademoiselle, what exactly is
happening between you and Anne?

377
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:24,287
She wanted me out of the inn,
out on the streets.

378
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:25,789
What would you have had me do?

379
00:23:25,824 --> 00:23:30,077
I couldn't say, but seducing
her was certainly...

380
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:32,129
(French accent)
an interesting approach.

381
00:23:32,164 --> 00:23:33,830
Call it what you like,

382
00:23:33,832 --> 00:23:35,549
but yesterday she was enraged.

383
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:37,717
And today she is not.

384
00:23:37,753 --> 00:23:39,169
That is not seduction,

385
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:42,222
that is simply removing the
cause of her frustration.

386
00:23:42,257 --> 00:23:43,840
Please.

387
00:23:43,892 --> 00:23:47,227
She was frustrated because
you crossed Eleanor Guthrie.

388
00:23:47,262 --> 00:23:49,012
Do you really believe that?

389
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:51,731
Has she not been behaving strangely

390
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:53,683
for far longer than any of that?

391
00:23:53,685 --> 00:23:58,105
Were Mr. Hamund here, perhaps he
could testify on the subject.

392
00:23:59,942 --> 00:24:01,575
I beg your pardon,
but are you asking me

393
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,111
to believe that Anne
killed eight men,

394
00:24:04,163 --> 00:24:06,580
risked her life, utterly
destroyed both our reputations,

395
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:09,055
to say nothing of the damage done
to her relationship with me,

396
00:24:09,084 --> 00:24:11,501
to remove you from that tent,
and that she did it all

397
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:14,371
because she secretly wants to fuck you?

398
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:21,094
I see.

399
00:24:23,348 --> 00:24:25,432
I'll tell you what
that sounds like to me.

400
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:28,635
It sounds like a crass attempt to drive
a wedge between my partner and I

401
00:24:28,687 --> 00:24:31,388
to achieve for yourself
a controlling influence

402
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,973
over our little triumvirate.

403
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:34,975
Perhaps I'll share
that feeling with Anne

404
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:38,061
and let's just see how quickly she
turns that anger in your direction.

405
00:24:38,113 --> 00:24:41,226
- It won't work.
- No? Why?

406
00:24:41,227 --> 00:24:43,066
Because I believe
that somewhere, somehow,

407
00:24:43,118 --> 00:24:44,651
you have known she has wanted this...

408
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:47,037
needed this for a very long time.

409
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:49,122
I'm giving it to her.

410
00:24:49,158 --> 00:24:50,740
And now that she has it,

411
00:24:50,742 --> 00:24:53,577
it would be exceedingly
difficult for her to let it go.

412
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:56,630
This upsets you.
This threatens you.

413
00:24:56,665 --> 00:24:58,548
I am sorry.

414
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:00,834
There is nothing you can do about it.

415
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,184
MAN:
Hoist up the sails!

416
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:22,822
- No luck?
- DE GROOT: Ugly stretch.

417
00:25:22,858 --> 00:25:26,159
Goddamn wind just won't cooperate.

418
00:25:26,195 --> 00:25:30,113
If I were to suggest rather
than trying to tack southwest

419
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:34,167
that we head east, hug the coast
to navigate around the weather,

420
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:35,952
what would you say?

421
00:25:35,954 --> 00:25:38,205
(Chuckles)

422
00:25:38,257 --> 00:25:41,708
I would say either
somebody gave you that idea,

423
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,044
somebody who's a hell of a sailor,

424
00:25:44,096 --> 00:25:45,512
or you've been holding back on me.

425
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:48,632
Flint said to avoid it.

426
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:50,433
Said when it was raised

427
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:52,719
that we should resist
the temptation at all costs.

428
00:25:52,771 --> 00:25:55,305
Avoid the common passage
it would take us through

429
00:25:55,307 --> 00:25:57,140
and the temptation to hunt a prize.

430
00:25:57,142 --> 00:25:58,942
You spoke to Flint?

431
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:02,028
He approached me.

432
00:26:02,064 --> 00:26:03,813
Why would he do that?

433
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:07,117
Why attempt to scuttle the idea before
any of us have even arrived at it?

434
00:26:07,152 --> 00:26:09,653
Is it possible he still believes
he can take back his command?

435
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:11,238
How?

436
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,240
There isn't a man on the crew
that will even speak to him,

437
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:15,458
much less support him.

438
00:26:15,494 --> 00:26:18,662
I don't know, but had he that notion,

439
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:22,716
I imagine the idea of this crew
taking a prize under your command

440
00:26:22,751 --> 00:26:25,502
would be a terrifying prospect.

441
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:27,721
I suppose the only question is,

442
00:26:27,756 --> 00:26:30,006
are you prepared to lead them?

443
00:26:33,095 --> 00:26:35,512
Set the course.

444
00:26:35,514 --> 00:26:38,098
(Chatter)

445
00:26:41,737 --> 00:26:43,320
It's better than nothing, isn't it?

446
00:26:51,947 --> 00:26:54,114
An account of goings-on.

447
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:57,784
Volume the first
on this 13th day in June,

448
00:26:57,836 --> 00:27:02,038
1715, in the year of our Lord.

449
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,291
The weather is fair.

450
00:27:04,343 --> 00:27:07,177
Fresh topsail gale,
north by northeast.

451
00:27:09,765 --> 00:27:11,214
First item...

452
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:17,937
a certain member of this crew,
who shall remain nameless,

453
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:21,024
was seen dozing
during the night watch.

454
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:23,059
Another member of the same watch

455
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:27,030
took the opportunity to take
three pieces from his pocket...

456
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:30,533
Shut the fuck up.

457
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:32,285
We're eating.

458
00:27:41,213 --> 00:27:43,163
(Coughing)

459
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:47,250
What was that?

460
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:49,636
I am convincing the crew

461
00:27:49,671 --> 00:27:51,588
to allow me to remain with them.

462
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,256
As we discussed.

463
00:27:53,258 --> 00:27:54,724
Is that what you're doing?

464
00:27:56,511 --> 00:28:00,680
I spent three years at the
St. John's Home for Poor Orphan Boys.

465
00:28:00,732 --> 00:28:03,400
During that time, I knew a
boy named Solomon Little.

466
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:05,101
Cleft palette, spotted face,

467
00:28:05,153 --> 00:28:09,155
and the most unfortunate set of ears
I have, to this day, ever seen.

468
00:28:09,191 --> 00:28:11,775
He should have been beaten to within
an inch of his life on a daily basis

469
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:14,277
if the laws of nature applied.

470
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:16,830
Yet no one ever laid a finger on him

471
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:20,750
because even at that tender age,

472
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:23,420
he knew...

473
00:28:23,455 --> 00:28:26,506
it isn't about getting them to like you,

474
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:30,043
it's about reminding them how
much they dislike each other.

475
00:28:31,296 --> 00:28:34,631
He got up every morning,
made his address,

476
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:37,100
and I'll be God damned if
there was a boy in that home

477
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:38,885
who could've lasted a day without it.

478
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,309
You do realize that those are
grown men out there, not boys.

479
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:47,977
In my experience,

480
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:51,147
when it comes to the thrill
of ridiculing one's peers,

481
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:52,866
there's little difference.

482
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,377
No one pays him any attention,

483
00:29:04,413 --> 00:29:07,297
so he sees everything.

484
00:29:07,332 --> 00:29:09,165
And he knows his fate and mine

485
00:29:09,217 --> 00:29:11,634
are more closely linked
than he'd care to admit.

486
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,587
So he reports it all back to me.

487
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:16,673
And there's plenty more
gossip in the well.

488
00:29:20,312 --> 00:29:23,229
Good luck with...

489
00:29:23,265 --> 00:29:24,981
whatever this is.

490
00:29:31,356 --> 00:29:33,857
80 barrels of molasses,

491
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,942
65 units of rum.

492
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,920
I can't believe this is
all we got for it.

493
00:29:39,948 --> 00:29:42,165
If I may, ma'am,
I consider it a triumph

494
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,700
I made it back here at all.

495
00:29:43,752 --> 00:29:47,370
I was met with great
skepticism at every turn,

496
00:29:47,372 --> 00:29:49,839
from the merchant buyers
to the customs house...

497
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,341
Your papers were
properly arranged.

498
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:52,842
Your payoffs were
in the proper amounts.

499
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:54,377
It was all in good order.

500
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:55,962
All but your family's name, ma'am.

501
00:29:57,132 --> 00:29:59,015
It is no longer in good order,

502
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,633
and everyone
in that harbor knew it.

503
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:03,386
I was questioned for nigh
on three hours

504
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:06,222
the minute the customs man
realized I was your agent.

505
00:30:06,274 --> 00:30:09,476
At a certain point, I had to
frighten him into believing

506
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:13,279
there would be reprisals
against him personally

507
00:30:13,315 --> 00:30:15,365
if he were to arrest me.

508
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,067
- By whom?
- I beg your pardon?

509
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:23,039
By whom did you suggest there
would be reprisals against him?

510
00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:25,959
Did you use Mr. Frasier's name?

511
00:30:25,994 --> 00:30:28,411
Captain Naft's, then?

512
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:32,131
I can understand how that would
strike fear in the heart of any man.

513
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:35,168
- Charles, enough.
- Or did you use mine?

514
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:40,473
You're welcome.

515
00:30:42,761 --> 00:30:45,395
(Chatter, laughter)

516
00:30:57,526 --> 00:31:00,910
How awkward this is.

517
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:03,780
Mr. Holmes here informed me

518
00:31:03,832 --> 00:31:06,115
that he observed you in this place

519
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:08,201
nervously entering
Eleanor Guthrie's office.

520
00:31:08,253 --> 00:31:12,956
I told myself, "What on Earth could
Mr. Meeks have to say to her?"

521
00:31:13,008 --> 00:31:16,843
Now forced to wonder if it stems
from your concerns about my fitness.

522
00:31:16,878 --> 00:31:20,380
Seeking an ally, perhaps, to
threaten my position as captain.

523
00:31:22,634 --> 00:31:25,268
I swore an oath to those men.

524
00:31:25,303 --> 00:31:28,271
To protect them from their captain.

525
00:31:29,524 --> 00:31:32,108
From themselves when called for.

526
00:31:33,228 --> 00:31:35,311
I see.

527
00:31:35,313 --> 00:31:37,697
But perhaps you're right.

528
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:41,534
Perhaps you serve their interests
best by betraying me in this moment.

529
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:45,238
Although, perhaps this is just
the act of a spineless traitor,

530
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,323
in which case...

531
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:50,243
well, in which case...

532
00:31:52,581 --> 00:31:54,831
I have a duty to do
something about it.

533
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:03,840
- You need to walk away from this.
- Walk away?

534
00:32:03,892 --> 00:32:05,425
This venture is on shaky footing.

535
00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:08,094
How long before
the street realizes this?

536
00:32:08,146 --> 00:32:10,346
How long before the mob
is outside your door again?

537
00:32:10,348 --> 00:32:13,182
What happens if this time
it won't go away?

538
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:15,685
Since when have you been
concerned with my operation?

539
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:17,854
My concern is for you.

540
00:32:17,906 --> 00:32:20,273
(Scoffs)

541
00:32:22,911 --> 00:32:24,611
I believe this is going to work.

542
00:32:24,663 --> 00:32:27,497
I believe you have motive
to see it fail.

543
00:32:27,532 --> 00:32:29,449
I believe you're angry with me.

544
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:31,284
I believe you resent me.

545
00:32:31,336 --> 00:32:33,419
What I do not believe...

546
00:32:33,455 --> 00:32:35,622
not at all, not for an instant...

547
00:32:35,674 --> 00:32:37,256
is that you have any concern for me.

548
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:38,875
I can't protect you from this.

549
00:32:40,345 --> 00:32:43,179
My men follow me because
I serve their interests first.

550
00:32:43,214 --> 00:32:45,765
To ask them to protect a tyrant

551
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,850
too weak to enforce
her own tyranny...

552
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:50,386
I will have a very hard
time convincing them

553
00:32:50,438 --> 00:32:52,889
that that is in their interests.

554
00:32:52,891 --> 00:32:56,442
If you are not strong enough
to protect yourself, Eleanor,

555
00:32:56,478 --> 00:32:59,896
then I am urging you to cease
behaving as if you are.

556
00:32:59,948 --> 00:33:03,066
- (Banging)
- (Men yelling)

557
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,737
(Man screaming)

558
00:33:12,043 --> 00:33:14,293
(Gagging)

559
00:33:46,194 --> 00:33:48,161
I don't want to see you
in my place again.

560
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:50,329
I don't want to see
you on my island again.

561
00:33:50,365 --> 00:33:53,282
Take your men, take your shit,

562
00:33:53,334 --> 00:33:55,084
and seek life elsewhere.

563
00:34:07,098 --> 00:34:10,133
I'd appreciate it if you'd remove
that from my face, friend.

564
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:13,553
Did you not hear the lady, friend?

565
00:34:15,356 --> 00:34:16,939
All right.

566
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:25,198
(Grunting)

567
00:35:04,689 --> 00:35:06,489
Don't.

568
00:35:34,385 --> 00:35:38,054
I'm sorry we've had such a
rough go of it, you and I...

569
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:41,474
but I'm afraid I'm simply
enjoying myself

570
00:35:41,526 --> 00:35:43,943
way too much to consider
leaving this place.

571
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:53,202
I'm sure we'll be seeing
each other soon.

572
00:36:18,563 --> 00:36:20,646
If you're trying to impress me,

573
00:36:20,682 --> 00:36:22,598
it isn't working.

574
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:26,519
(Sighs)

575
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:35,077
Goings-on, volume the fourth.

576
00:36:37,165 --> 00:36:39,782
Light breeze, west-southwest.

577
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:42,952
Sunset in roughly three hours.

578
00:36:42,954 --> 00:36:45,288
First item...

579
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:49,091
a certain member
of the rigging crew,

580
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:51,127
who shall remain nameless,

581
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:54,130
was moving his bowels
over the side.

582
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:56,465
He was spotted considering the stick

583
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:58,968
and its unacceptable state of being,

584
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,520
and instead, chose to wipe

585
00:37:01,556 --> 00:37:03,973
with the bare palm of his hand.

586
00:37:03,975 --> 00:37:06,359
(Men laughing, cheering)

587
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:10,313
(Clapping)

588
00:37:10,365 --> 00:37:12,315
(Groaning)

589
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,660
- Next item...
- (Foot bangs)

590
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:29,548
Oh...

591
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:31,968
A member of the third watch,

592
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:34,637
who shall remain nameless,

593
00:37:34,672 --> 00:37:36,672
entered the pen late last night

594
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:38,841
sometime after three bells.

595
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:42,228
Though no one actually
saw him enter or exit,

596
00:37:42,263 --> 00:37:45,064
evidence of his presence was clear,

597
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:47,183
as upon inspection,

598
00:37:47,185 --> 00:37:51,520
the dairy goat's anus
was irritated from overuse.

599
00:37:58,947 --> 00:38:00,696
You fucked the dairy goat?

600
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:09,422
(Men cheering)

601
00:38:09,457 --> 00:38:11,924
The dairy goat?

602
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,011
They know who fucked the dairy goat.

603
00:38:17,048 --> 00:38:20,383
MAN:
There you go, Joshua!

604
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:25,638
- MAN #2: Sail!
- MAN #3: Starboard bow!

605
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,939
(Bell ringing)

606
00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:30,609
- Sail!
- Starboard bow!

607
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:32,361
There!

608
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:37,733
MAN:
Steady.

609
00:38:37,735 --> 00:38:40,319
Steer steady, keep your course.

610
00:38:40,371 --> 00:38:43,239
- What is she?
- English colors.

611
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:46,542
Inbound from Kingston.
Sugar merchants, most likely.

612
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:55,835
How do you presume an English
merchantmen will react

613
00:38:55,887 --> 00:38:57,720
when being hailed
by a Spanish warship?

614
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:00,890
Only one way to find out.

615
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:06,429
Anyone up for a little hunting?

616
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:09,098
(Cheering)

617
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,964
I'm sorry, you were saying something

618
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:45,434
about your judgment on this matter

619
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,053
remaining intact.

620
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:51,107
I apologize, sir.

621
00:39:51,142 --> 00:39:53,642
Good sense escaped me for a moment.

622
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:56,896
An insult to the man's wife
that had to be answered.

623
00:39:56,948 --> 00:40:00,116
It reflects not upon my fitness

624
00:40:00,151 --> 00:40:02,735
to continue handling Lord Hamilton.

625
00:40:02,787 --> 00:40:05,071
I know how important this posting is.

626
00:40:05,123 --> 00:40:07,289
I know you know.

627
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:10,042
My concern with you

628
00:40:10,078 --> 00:40:13,829
is over that which cannot be known.

629
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:17,249
That thing which arises in you

630
00:40:17,301 --> 00:40:19,969
when passions are aroused...

631
00:40:20,004 --> 00:40:22,338
good sense escapes you.

632
00:40:24,008 --> 00:40:25,925
All men have it.

633
00:40:25,977 --> 00:40:29,929
But yours... yours is different.

634
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:33,065
Darker. Wilder.

635
00:40:33,101 --> 00:40:36,902
I imagine it's what makes you
so effective as an officer.

636
00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:39,522
But when exposed to extremes,

637
00:40:39,574 --> 00:40:43,159
I could not imagine
what it is capable of.

638
00:40:43,194 --> 00:40:46,612
And of greater concern,

639
00:40:46,664 --> 00:40:48,781
I'm not sure you do either.

640
00:40:59,177 --> 00:41:00,793
- MAN: Lift!
- (Grunting)

641
00:41:03,214 --> 00:41:06,215
Raise the lateen.

642
00:41:06,217 --> 00:41:08,184
Pull away!

643
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:13,722
(Men chanting)
Heave!

644
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:15,224
DE GROOT:
Pull away, God damn it!

645
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:18,644
MAN:
Pull away, you lubbers!

646
00:41:18,696 --> 00:41:20,229
MEN:
Heave!

647
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:22,448
- Come down.
- Aye, sir.

648
00:41:24,702 --> 00:41:26,402
DE GROOT:
Harnin' the port sheets.

649
00:41:26,454 --> 00:41:29,038
MAN:
Harnin' the port sheets!

650
00:41:31,975 --> 00:41:33,576
(Overlapping voices)
Take your pistols.

651
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:38,214
- Ready the grappling.
- Keep it dry.

652
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:42,718
- (Man shouting)
- Stand to, lads!

653
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:45,337
(Groans)

654
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:48,090
I don't need to explain to you
the stakes of what happens

655
00:41:48,142 --> 00:41:51,393
if Mr. Dufresne is successful
in taking this prize.

656
00:41:51,429 --> 00:41:53,929
MAN:
Keep the mainsail tight!

657
00:41:53,981 --> 00:41:56,932
FLINT: Took me a while to get
a feel for this part of it.

658
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:59,768
Raise the black too soon
and the prize will run.

659
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,770
Raise it too late

660
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:05,357
and you'll induce panic and a
greater chance of resistance.

661
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:08,577
You ought to show your colors
at just the right moment

662
00:42:08,613 --> 00:42:10,196
to get them to strike theirs.

663
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:24,960
Raise the black.

664
00:42:25,012 --> 00:42:27,463
(Whistles)
Raise the black!

665
00:42:27,465 --> 00:42:30,049
MAN:
Raise the black!

666
00:42:46,234 --> 00:42:48,117
Gun crews at the ready.

667
00:42:48,152 --> 00:42:50,319
(Shouting)

668
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:56,125
Hold your breath, lads.

669
00:43:04,135 --> 00:43:05,634
MAN:
They struck their colors.

670
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,670
(Men cheering)

671
00:43:09,507 --> 00:43:11,590
See? I told you.

672
00:43:15,346 --> 00:43:17,813
- Prepare to board.
- Aye.

673
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:46,959
(Footsteps approaching)

674
00:43:58,522 --> 00:44:00,055
You're in command here, yes?

675
00:44:00,107 --> 00:44:02,725
I am.

676
00:44:02,727 --> 00:44:04,943
You were wise not to fight.

677
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:07,396
Are there any men
lying in wait below?

678
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:09,865
Answer truthfully

679
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,035
or the consequences will be severe.

680
00:44:15,706 --> 00:44:17,906
It is as you see it.

681
00:44:21,078 --> 00:44:23,829
Sweep the hold.
Start at the bow.

682
00:44:29,754 --> 00:44:32,004
This is the most dangerous part.

683
00:44:33,724 --> 00:44:35,841
Look at him.

684
00:44:35,893 --> 00:44:38,594
His mind is drowning in questions.

685
00:44:38,646 --> 00:44:41,430
Did I make the right decision?

686
00:44:41,482 --> 00:44:43,599
How am I going to explain
to my proprietors

687
00:44:43,651 --> 00:44:45,818
that I gave up their goods
without a fight?

688
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,686
What kind of man am I?

689
00:44:47,738 --> 00:44:51,273
You hope he has answers
to those questions.

690
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:56,445
You hope that he can reassure himself
that he made the right decision.

691
00:44:56,497 --> 00:44:58,580
You hope that he doesn't realize

692
00:44:58,616 --> 00:45:01,166
that the thing that he thought
he was surrendering to...

693
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:04,169
the thing that drove fear
into his heart

694
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:07,256
the moment he saw the black...

695
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:10,459
that that thing
is nowhere to be found.

696
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:19,134
Are you him?

697
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:29,061
- Beg your pardon?
- I said are you him? Are you Captain Flint?

698
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:40,572
I assure you, sir,

699
00:45:40,624 --> 00:45:42,541
you do not want to test us.

700
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,914
FLINT:
Men in these waters are hard men.

701
00:45:48,966 --> 00:45:52,501
They don't fear ships.
They don't fear guns.

702
00:45:52,553 --> 00:45:54,420
They don't fear swords.

703
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:58,006
Then what do they fear?

704
00:46:07,151 --> 00:46:09,351
(Whistles)

705
00:46:09,403 --> 00:46:11,437
(Shouting)

706
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:16,191
(Grunting)

707
00:46:17,278 --> 00:46:18,410
(Gunshots)

708
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:32,007
- MAN: Retreat!
- MAN #2: Back to the ship!

709
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:33,208
(Gunfire)

710
00:46:36,597 --> 00:46:39,548
(Men yelling)

711
00:46:41,552 --> 00:46:43,872
I want muskets in the rigging
to suppress their front line.

712
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:45,387
Mr. Dufresne, we have lost the day.

713
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:47,890
(Shouting and gunshots continue)

714
00:46:47,942 --> 00:46:49,224
MAN:
Muskets!

715
00:46:51,028 --> 00:46:52,361
We must disengage.

716
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:53,979
What are we waiting for?
Why aren't we moving?

717
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:55,898
Give the order, Mr. Dufresne.

718
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,116
We do not have the manpower
to retake that ship.

719
00:46:58,152 --> 00:47:00,452
- We must get underway.
- Why the fuck are we waiting for him?

720
00:47:00,488 --> 00:47:02,955
- Because he's in charge here.
- No one is in fucking charge here!

721
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,073
FLINT:
You have to sink her.

722
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:08,710
You cannot just escape,
you have to sink that ship.

723
00:47:08,712 --> 00:47:10,913
For if a single one of those
men lives to tell the tale,

724
00:47:10,915 --> 00:47:14,583
no one will ever surrender
before that flag again.

725
00:47:14,635 --> 00:47:16,418
(Man screams)

726
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:23,258
Cut us loose. Get us underway.

727
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:26,645
Cut us loose! Get us underway!

728
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,432
- MAN: Set sail.
- MAN #2: Cut the line! Cut the line!

729
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:37,105
Gun crews at the ready.

730
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:40,108
(Gunfire)

731
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:43,278
Gun crews at the ready.

732
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,948
(Men shouting)

733
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:50,118
- Two-six! Two-six!
- Heave! Heave!

734
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:57,509
- Two-six! Two-six!
- Heave! Heave!

735
00:47:57,545 --> 00:47:59,211
- Two-six!
- Heave!

736
00:47:59,263 --> 00:48:01,346
Fire!

737
00:48:01,382 --> 00:48:03,632
- Fire!
- Fire!

738
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:05,968
(Screaming)

739
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:18,480
(Cannon fire continues)

740
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,404
I don't see a move
I can make from here.

741
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,523
If I move against him directly,

742
00:49:01,525 --> 00:49:04,109
his men retaliate and I don't
have the muscle to withstand it.

743
00:49:04,161 --> 00:49:06,912
And even if I could muster up
that kind of support,

744
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:09,364
I couldn't get away with it.

745
00:49:13,087 --> 00:49:15,954
Not after such a public
display of loss as today.

746
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:20,425
Not so brazenly.

747
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:23,762
The consortium is fragile.
It would be toppled.

748
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:26,682
And I'm simply not willing
to allow that to happen.

749
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:29,635
And I suspect it's only a matter of time

750
00:49:29,687 --> 00:49:31,687
before he makes a move against me.

751
00:49:40,698 --> 00:49:43,198
You want me to believe that
you have some concern for me?

752
00:49:44,568 --> 00:49:45,901
Then show it.

753
00:49:49,123 --> 00:49:52,658
If you need something
to induce your men into action,

754
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:55,627
I know his crew hold an asset
from their last prize

755
00:49:55,663 --> 00:49:57,996
that they deem of great value.

756
00:49:58,048 --> 00:50:00,882
- What asset?
- I don't know.

757
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,223
I don't know.

758
00:50:38,005 --> 00:50:41,373
(Door opens, closes)

759
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:47,763
(Crickets chirping)

760
00:51:06,784 --> 00:51:09,701
(Gasping)

761
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:29,504
RACKHAM:
What I have found in my experience

762
00:51:29,556 --> 00:51:31,890
is the more elusive the puzzle,

763
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:35,393
the more painfully obvious
its ultimate solution.

764
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:37,679
One just has to be willing to see it.

765
00:51:37,731 --> 00:51:42,601
Take our predicament, for example.

766
00:51:42,653 --> 00:51:44,519
You have a wealth of leads,

767
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:47,522
but no means of exploiting them
for anything other than a fee

768
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:51,026
and risking retaliation from
Ms. Guthrie in the process.

769
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:52,944
I, on the other hand,

770
00:51:52,996 --> 00:51:56,114
have an unparalleled aptitude
for the management of a crew,

771
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:59,584
but am denied any and every
opportunity to exploit the skill.

772
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,004
And there it is...
the solution, so obvious.

773
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,957
You will provide all leads

774
00:52:06,009 --> 00:52:07,542
derived from this place
directly to me.

775
00:52:07,594 --> 00:52:09,544
I will judge which to prosecute

776
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:12,297
and which too likely to rouse
Ms. Guthrie's ire.

777
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:14,549
Anne and I will then
take those chosen leads,

778
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:16,384
we'll procure a ship,
we'll recruit men,

779
00:52:16,436 --> 00:52:19,054
and we'll create,
from nothing, a new crew

780
00:52:19,056 --> 00:52:21,973
from which we three
will each hold a share.

781
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:30,315
You asked for better captains...

782
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:32,400
I give you Captain Jack Rackham.

783
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:40,292
And one more thing...

784
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:44,045
darling, I can understand why you
wouldn't want to tell me about this,

785
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:48,049
but please know that all I have
ever wanted for you is to be happy.

786
00:52:51,922 --> 00:52:53,922
Come to bed when you're through.

787
00:53:13,327 --> 00:53:16,111
Was it close?

788
00:53:16,113 --> 00:53:17,612
The vote.

789
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:21,166
It was.

790
00:53:24,171 --> 00:53:26,288
I suppose you warned me...

791
00:53:28,508 --> 00:53:30,292
didn't you?

792
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:34,546
To avoid that course
through the shipping lanes.

793
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:40,685
Perhaps it was my hubris
that drove me to it.

794
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:44,639
To show you I had it in me to lead.

795
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:50,312
But as I sit here,

796
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:53,732
I'm forced to consider
another possibility.

797
00:53:55,953 --> 00:53:57,869
That course we charted...

798
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:05,493
perhaps none of us would
have thought of it at all

799
00:54:05,495 --> 00:54:08,330
had you not raised it
in the first place.

800
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,167
That you orchestrated it all.

801
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:17,722
The deaths,

802
00:54:17,758 --> 00:54:21,226
the destruction,

803
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:22,844
the loss.

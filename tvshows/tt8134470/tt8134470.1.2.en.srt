00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:21,249
<i>Mrs.
Alves just joined a committee</i>

3
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:22,624
<i>at the school that we serve on.</i>

4
00:00:22,707 --> 00:00:24,166
How well did you know her?

5
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:27,249
Sometimes,
I just feel overwhelmed.

6
00:00:27,707 --> 00:00:28,999
Do you ever feel that?

7
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:31,832
I've got that early flight
to Cleveland.

8
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,249
When do you get back?

9
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:38,791
It was Elena.
She was found dead.

10
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,958
Can you please just tell me
what happened?

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,374
Did you know her?

12
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,112
They're looking for the husband.

13
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:47,528
Evidently, they were having
problems.

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,528
Did you know the boy?
Are we upsetting you?

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,940
We gotta find out
who did this.

16
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:52,196
Did I do something wrong?

17
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,488
Where's your husband now?

18
00:00:53,624 --> 00:00:56,749
Can you, um, put me through
to Jonathan Fraser, please?

19
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,904
<i>I'm sorry,
I'm not seeing a Jonathan Fraser.</i>

20
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:42,666
<i>Hyatt place independence.</i>

21
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:45,445
- Jonathan Fraser, please.
<i>- Hyatt regency at the arcade.</i>

22
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,237
- Jonathan Fraser's room, please.
<i>- Hyatt Cleveland legacy.</i>

23
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:50,654
Can you put me through
to Jonathan Fraser's room, please?

24
00:02:51,749 --> 00:02:53,874
<i>This is Jonathan.</i>

25
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:59,332
- Jonathan Fraser?
<i>- Yes. Who is this?</i>

26
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,415
I'm...

27
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:06,332
I'm sorry, um... sorry.

28
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,083
Did you hear from
dad today at all?

29
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,332
Uh, not since this
morning when he left.

30
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,415
You saw him before
he left, at 5:00 am?

31
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,666
Yeah.
He came in to say goodbye.

32
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:32,083
Did he say anything else?

33
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,166
I think he just said
"bye," and then...

34
00:03:35,374 --> 00:03:37,582
And then he kissed me
on the forehead...

35
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,249
And... and left.
I was half asleep.

36
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:43,707
He didn't say anything else?

37
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,916
Probably that he loved me?

38
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:51,540
What's wrong? Does he usually
do that before he leaves on a trip?

39
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,083
Say goodbye? No, come into
your room while you're still asleep.

40
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,540
Doesn't he usually just say
goodbye the night before? Um...

41
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:03,624
M-Mom, you're acting strange.

42
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:05,624
Well, it-it's just I, I...

43
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:06,987
I haven't heard
from him all day.

44
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,457
I mean, I know he has
two presentations to give,

45
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,582
and he's probably busy,
but I'm just...

46
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:14,749
Text him.
He left his phone.

47
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,582
He left his phone?
Mm-hmm.

48
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:20,916
Do you know his code?

49
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,916
No.

50
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:35,749
How did he seem this morning?

51
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,249
He seemed like dad.

52
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:41,832
He came into your room,
he said goodbye,

53
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,666
maybe told you
that he loved you,

54
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:45,415
and then he left?

55
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:48,415
What's going on?

56
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,666
No...
Nothing, honey.

57
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,415
I'm just...

58
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,166
Um...

59
00:04:57,874 --> 00:05:00,582
Nothing, it-it...
It's nothing.

60
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:19,112
<i>This guy shoots
nothing but three-pointers!</i>

61
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:20,582
<i>You never see the mid-range...</i>

62
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,820
<i>The community
of the Tony Upper East Side.</i>

63
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:25,124
<i>Reardon academy
is in shock tonight</i>

64
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,208
<i>over the gruesome discovery
of a fourth grade mother</i>

65
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,290
<i>found bludgeoned to death.</i>

66
00:05:30,374 --> 00:05:32,499
<i>According
to police, Elena alves.</i>

67
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,540
<i>Never returned home last night
after a school fundraiser.</i>

68
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:38,540
<i>It was her 10-year-old son
who found the victim</i>

69
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:41,332
<i>dead in her blood-strewn
art studio this morning.</i>

70
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:44,124
<i>Cause of death hasn't been
confirmed, but we're told</i>

71
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,457
<i>the victim was struck multiple
times with a blunt instrument,</i>

72
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,457
<i>suffering numerous
abrasions and lacerations</i>

73
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,958
<i>to her skull. One officer called it...</i>

74
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,237
- Hey. Mm-hmm.
<i>- Are you seeing this?</i>

75
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:56,916
<i>It's all over.</i>

76
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:58,749
<i>Mentioning reardon, it's just...</i>

77
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:01,124
It's beyond awful.

78
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,958
I just can't stop
thinking about that woman.

79
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:06,332
- I know.
<i>- And the children, my god...</i>

80
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:10,987
<i>You know what? I've got
Amanda on the other line.</i>

81
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,999
- I'll call you back.
- Okay.

82
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:28,540
Mom!

83
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:30,791
Oh god.
What?

84
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:32,624
You scared me.

85
00:06:32,707 --> 00:06:35,540
Don't do that.
I said "mom."

86
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:37,249
What's wrong with you?

87
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:41,124
I don't know
where your father is.

88
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,290
He's not returning calls,

89
00:06:42,374 --> 00:06:44,166
he's not returning
my emails, nothing.

90
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:46,540
And that doesn't make any sense.

91
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:50,374
Is it possible that he
just doesn't have Internet?

92
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,666
He's at a medical conference,
Henry. He has Internet.

93
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,415
Alright. So, he's usually

94
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:01,083
terrible about
checking in, right?

95
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:03,624
You guys fight about
it all the time.

96
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,666
<i>And he usually has those dinners</i>

97
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:07,958
<i>after the conference.</i>

98
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,624
If he's at the dinner,

99
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:11,791
but he... if he doesn't
have his phone,

100
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:14,208
then how is he gonna
communicate with you?

101
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,832
Or! Maybe he's on the plane.
Henry...

102
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,415
'Cause he did say he might
get back earlier, right?

103
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:23,499
You're right.
Yeah.

104
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:26,374
So, don't worry.
He's on the plane. He's flying back to us.

105
00:07:26,457 --> 00:07:28,332
Don't worry. It's fine.

106
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:33,582
Hello? Hello?

107
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,874
Jonathan?

108
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,499
Hello?

109
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:48,958
Hung up.

110
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,332
Somebody tried to call him,

111
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:54,290
heard your voice...

112
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:58,249
Thought "wrong number,"
and hung up. Okay?

113
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,666
Sometimes, I just... I feel...

114
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,499
I feel...
Overwhelmed.

115
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:25,540
And, um, lost.

116
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,166
<i>We are live in
front of the reardon school</i>

118
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:04,958
<i>Is this 'cause of the dead mom?</i>

119
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,791
- Grace.
- We need to move quickly.

120
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,083
Grace! Hi.
Oh, Sylvia!

121
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,166
Oh my god, can you believe this?
Hi! I know.

122
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:24,249
Have you ever seen such
a cluster-fuck? Sorry.

123
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,832
<i>A caravan of concerned mothers.

125
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:31,290
Hi.
Hi.

126
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:34,332
Hi. Alexis young, grace Fraser.
She's a second grade mom.

127
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:35,707
Oh, hi.
Hi. Um,

128
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,874
I've been told you're a therapist?
Yes, I am.

129
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,707
I don't mean to be schnorring
free medical advice,

130
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,624
but my little Kimberly is
already anxious to begin with,

131
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:45,290
and this is our
first school murder,

132
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:47,874
and I just was wondering
if there were, you know,

133
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,374
any techniques you could recommend.
I'm gonna head in.

134
00:10:50,457 --> 00:10:52,916
- Sure. I'll see you this afternoon.
- Love you.

135
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,624
Did you guys hear?

136
00:10:54,707 --> 00:10:56,624
The husband suddenly
just turned himself in.

137
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:59,237
What? Turns
out that I actually met him once.

138
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:00,874
He gave me a bad feeling.

139
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,749
You met him, when?
Oh, Alexis, hi.

140
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:05,712
Well, I didn't realize
he was a parent at first.

141
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,791
I thought, you know,
he worked for the school.

142
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:09,528
- Excuse me, ma'am!
<i>- I think I told him</i>

143
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,420
<i>we were out of paper towels
in the ladies' room.</i>

144
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,582
Well, I haven't heard anything
about him turning himself in.

145
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,374
I wonder if this is connected
to what happened at the benefit.

146
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:20,041
What? What happened at the benefit?
Oh, come on.

147
00:11:20,124 --> 00:11:22,166
She had at least
10 men inhaling her.

148
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,487
Oh, please.
I don't think that's insignificant.

149
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:26,666
You know, it might help
them figure out who did it.

150
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:28,862
What do you mean "who did it"?
Of course it was the husband.

151
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:30,654
First he vanishes,
and now he's turned himself in.

152
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,332
It's always the f... husband.

153
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:34,332
Well, he didn't vanish.
That was fake news.

154
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,332
I have to go, so I'll
see you this afternoon.

155
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,791
Hey.

156
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:04,832
Did Jonathan call?
No.

157
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:14,332
Would you give Stuart a call?
Dr. Rosenfeld at the hospital.

158
00:12:14,415 --> 00:12:16,374
See if he's heard from him.

159
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:19,540
I think the secrecy
was a part of it.

160
00:12:19,624 --> 00:12:20,999
Maybe even a big part.

161
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:24,749
But I think I was trying
to break free of myself.

162
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:26,540
How so?

163
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:30,208
I've always been so righteous.

164
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,916
Living by my good values.

165
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,249
Oppressed by them.

166
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:38,415
<i>I think what I did</i>

167
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:42,624
<i>was more about me rejecting
myself than Michael.</i>

168
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:45,249
I'm timid,

169
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,290
I'm safe.

170
00:12:47,374 --> 00:12:49,832
Part of me wants
to be dangerous.

171
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,999
Hello? WOMAN:
<i>You've been chosen for a trip.</i>

172
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,290
<i>To the Caribbean!
Press five...</i>

173
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,166
Stuart.

174
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,791
Grace!
Hi, um...

175
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,832
Did my assistant call you?
Uh, I'm not aware.

176
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:06,083
Um...

177
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,999
Have you heard from Jonathan?

178
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,582
I haven't.

179
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,749
Wh... he went to Cleveland and he
didn't take his phone, and I...

180
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:20,041
I haven't been able to reach
him, and i-I'm getting worried.

181
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,374
What's in Cleveland?

182
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:24,916
The conference.
The conference?

183
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:28,083
Pediatric oncology at
the Cleveland clinic.

184
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,707
Oh, uh, I knew nothing about it.

185
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:35,083
I-I really can't talk.
<i>The conf...</i>

186
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,374
What do you mean you can't talk?
Can't talk about what?

187
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:39,499
I'm really late for a meeting.
Stuart, please!

188
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:42,749
I cannot talk. I am constrained.
There are strict terms.

189
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:45,332
Strict terms?
What strict terms?

190
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:47,540
What?
I'm sorry, I'm not at Liberty.

191
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:50,290
Please, it's me. It's grace.
I'm sorry. Grace, I'm sorry.

192
00:15:20,624 --> 00:15:21,791
Oh, that's disgusting.

193
00:15:38,582 --> 00:15:41,374
Is he back yet? Dad. Is he back yet?
What?

194
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:43,499
No.

195
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:44,999
No.
What?

196
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:48,124
Let's go. We're gonna
be late for grandpa.

197
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,124
Come on.

198
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,832
- Good evening, Mrs. Fraser.
- Good evening.

199
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,166
- Hey. Thank you.
- Thank you.

200
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:18,208
- Hi, Henry!
- Hey, grandpa.

201
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,582
Irma's made some penne
marinara especially for you.

202
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,874
So, that's all
Dr. Rosenfeld told you?

203
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,666
- Yeah.
- Mm.

204
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:34,415
You? What are you
telling yourself?

205
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:37,124
I don't know what
to tell myself.

206
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:38,779
He didn't just leave
his phone behind.

207
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,457
He arranged to be
unreachable, dad.

208
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:43,832
You know...

209
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,749
How've things been between the two of you?
How have they been?

210
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:52,540
It's not a trick
question, grace.

211
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,624
We've never been better.

212
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,124
This doesn't make any sense.

213
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,624
I'm having a hard time
functioning right now.

214
00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:05,666
But you have to.
You have a son to look after.

215
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:09,874
Irma?
Excuse me, Dr. Fraser.

216
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:13,249
Yes? There are two police
officers waiting for you in the lobby.

217
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,999
I see. No, dad.
I will take care of it.

218
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,999
I need to take a walk anyway.

219
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,791
Thank you for coming down.

220
00:17:31,874 --> 00:17:34,874
Can we have a word in
a more private environment?

221
00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:37,874
Well, my family is upstairs.

222
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,707
Could we go down
to the office then?

223
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,666
To the police station?

224
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,666
Are you arresting me?

225
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:49,582
Why would
we be arresting you?

226
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,779
We just wanna
get some more information,

227
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,999
it's easier if we do it there.

228
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,999
Alright.

229
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,528
<i>Why the
hell would you go with them?</i>

230
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,374
Because it's the
straightest line to what's going on.

231
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,749
You should have a lawyer.

232
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:10,041
I don't think that's the case,
but if... if it makes sense...

233
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:11,749
For god's sake, child...

234
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:13,278
<i>Thanks for watching Henry.</i>

235
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,862
<i>I'll call you when I...
When I know more.</i>

236
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:16,791
<i>Grace, this is a terrible idea.</i>

237
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:19,958
<i>I said I'll call you
when I know more.</i>

238
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:24,415
Everything okay?

239
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:32,707
I didn't really know Mrs. Alves.

240
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:36,958
We can talk when we get there.

241
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,540
Right this way, please.

242
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:54,457
This door here.

243
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,332
Hey, hey!

244
00:18:57,415 --> 00:18:59,624
Right in here.

245
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:05,666
Can I get you
a coffee or something?

246
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:08,624
Um, no.

247
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:11,415
No, thank you.
I'm fine. This...

248
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:13,666
It looks a little...

249
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:15,083
Am I gonna need a lawyer?

250
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,749
I wouldn't have thought so.

251
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,290
We're just gonna talk.

252
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,791
Alright.

253
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:49,791
Um...

254
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:52,707
Alright.

255
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:54,832
Dr. Fraser.

256
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:57,666
Where is your husband?

257
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,582
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

258
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,249
Is he in your apartment
on east 63rd?

259
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:05,083
- No, of course not. He...
- Why...

260
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,208
"Of course not"?
Because I told you. As far as I know,

261
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,124
he is at a medical conference
and if he were here in the city,

262
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,791
he'd be at work,
but he's not here.

263
00:20:12,874 --> 00:20:15,166
- And work would be where?
- Um...

264
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:18,208
<i>Price-norbury memorial hospital.</i>

265
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
Hm.

266
00:20:27,874 --> 00:20:29,999
<i>Dr. Fraser...</i>

267
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,958
<i>Your husband has not worked</i>

268
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,208
<i>at price-norbury memorial
hospital for a long time.</i>

269
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,208
You didn't know this?

270
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,208
- What?
<i>- According to Dr. Robertson sharp,</i>

271
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,290
<i>Dr. Jonathan Fraser's
employment was terminated</i>

272
00:20:51,374 --> 00:20:54,166
<i>nearly three months ago.</i>

273
00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:57,041
<i>You were not aware of this?</i>

274
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,791
<i>You're saying that</i>

275
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:04,749
<i>you were not aware of this
until this very moment?</i>

276
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:07,457
I was... I was not aware.

277
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,832
I spoke to a doctor
earlier today,

278
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,832
who wasn't forthcoming
with information,

279
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,332
but I was not aware...
What doctor was that?

280
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:17,332
Um, Stuart. Stuart,

281
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:19,624
um, rosenfeld.
Dr. Rosenfeld.

282
00:21:19,707 --> 00:21:21,666
<i>And did Dr. Rosenfeld
tell you that</i>

283
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:23,582
<i>your husband's
termination followed</i>

284
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,624
<i>three earlier disciplinary
actions at the hospital?</i>

285
00:21:33,415 --> 00:21:34,958
I want this to stop.

286
00:21:35,582 --> 00:21:36,612
Are you hiding your husband?

287
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:39,249
No! I'm not hiding my husband.

288
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,791
I told you, I thought he
was at a medical conference.

289
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:43,999
<i>He said to me that
he was going to</i>

290
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,624
<i>a medical conference
in Cleveland.</i>

291
00:21:45,707 --> 00:21:48,249
Then he's not in your apartment.
I told you.

292
00:21:48,332 --> 00:21:49,832
He's not there.

293
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,457
<i>His phone seems to be,</i>

294
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,707
<i>according to verizon.</i>

295
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,457
Yes. Yes, his...

296
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,695
His phone is there.
That's a detail you might've mentioned.

297
00:21:58,707 --> 00:22:00,071
You didn't ask me
where his phone was.

298
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,290
You asked me where he was.

299
00:22:01,374 --> 00:22:03,174
Right. Right.
He forgot his phone at home.

300
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,707
I mean, it's... it's not the
first time that he's done that.

301
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,707
<i>And I found the phone last
night, and that's why it...</i>

302
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:09,958
<i>I don't know where he is</i>

303
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,083
<i>because he forgot his phone,
and I can't...</i>

304
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,083
I can't call him.

305
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:18,832
That makes sense to you, hm?
No.

306
00:22:19,624 --> 00:22:21,540
<i>No, nothing about
this entire day</i>

307
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:24,499
<i>- makes any sense to me.</i>
<i>- Dr. Fraser,</i>

308
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,540
<i>do you know why your
husband was fired?</i>

309
00:22:31,415 --> 00:22:34,666
I suspect you figure that we do.

310
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:38,666
Are you not even curious?

311
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:44,624
Yesterday, we obtained the records
from price-norbury memorial hospital.

312
00:22:44,707 --> 00:22:46,208
You obtained
confidential records?

313
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,540
<i>Yes. Yes, as a result of</i>

314
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:49,166
<i>a court order filed
yesterday morning.</i>

315
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:51,916
This is fucking bullshit.

316
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:54,083
This is bullshit.
This is fucking...

317
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,958
- This is bullshit.
<i>- In June of last year,</i>

318
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,249
<i>a full disciplinary hearing</i>

319
00:22:59,332 --> 00:23:00,958
<i>alleged...</i>

320
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,624
<i>Inappropriate contact...</i>

321
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,208
With a family
member of a patient.

322
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:11,041
I don't know what any
of that means, but...

323
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:14,041
- I'm...
- But, what?

324
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:18,916
It's cancer.
It's children's cancer.

325
00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:23,749
My husband's a warm, warm man.

326
00:23:23,832 --> 00:23:26,249
<i>He's not some asshole who walks
into a room and pronounces</i>

327
00:23:26,332 --> 00:23:29,624
<i>that your child is gonna die
and then walks out the door.</i>

328
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:32,290
<i>He is a very caring man,</i>

329
00:23:32,374 --> 00:23:35,999
<i>and maybe he has
touched someone,</i>

330
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,041
<i>maybe he hugged someone</i>

331
00:23:39,124 --> 00:23:43,166
<i>because he cares, and that
does not mean that he's some...</i>

332
00:23:47,874 --> 00:23:49,415
Okay.

333
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,791
I'm gonna tell you
the name of the patient.

334
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:55,666
No. No, no, no, no, no.

335
00:23:55,749 --> 00:23:58,570
I can tell you the name of... It's
private. It's private, I don't wanna know.

336
00:23:58,582 --> 00:24:00,062
I don't wanna know
the patient's name.

337
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,666
<i>Don't. Private information...</i>

338
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:04,457
I don't want to know.

339
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,999
You don't wanna know...

340
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,540
Or you already do know?

341
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:15,041
<i>Your husband's patient...</i>

342
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,249
<i>Was Miguel alves.</i>

343
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,332
Diagnosed with wilms tumor.

344
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,415
<i>Miguel's mother...</i>

345
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:30,999
<i>Elena alves.</i>

346
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:39,208
<i>So,
you'll forgive me for asking, Dr. Fraser,</i>

347
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,041
<i>but I'm going to be
seriously pissed off</i>

348
00:24:41,124 --> 00:24:43,779
<i>if you keep telling me that your
husband's at a fucking medical conference</i>

349
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,415
<i>in fucking Cleveland,</i>

350
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:46,874
<i>that he forgot
his fucking phone!</i>

351
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,791
Don't protect him!

352
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:53,415
Wherever Jonathan is,
we're going to find him.

353
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:55,916
<i>So if you know something,
this would be the right time</i>

354
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,612
<i>to tell us what it is.</i>
This is what I know.

355
00:24:57,624 --> 00:24:59,874
<i>I'm sitting here in a room
with two detectives</i>

356
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:03,041
<i>who are treating me
very much like I'm a suspect,</i>

357
00:25:03,124 --> 00:25:06,083
<i>trying to elicit incriminating
responses from me,</i>

358
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:09,332
<i>in a grossly custodial setting.</i>

359
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:15,332
<i>So you either read me my
Miranda rights right now...</i>

360
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:20,707
<i>Or tell me I'm free to go.</i>

361
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,958
- Are you still with them?
<i>- No!</i>

362
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:55,958
I just left.
Are you alright?

363
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,582
Grace, what the devil's
going on?

364
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:04,707
They're asking me a lot of
questions, aggressive questions.

365
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:06,695
<i>I'm guessing that</i>

366
00:26:06,707 --> 00:26:09,707
<i>there's still no word from Jonathan?</i>

367
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,290
No.
<i>Well,</i>

368
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,832
<i>guess it's safe to assume
he's not in Cleveland.</i>

369
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,540
<i>Now, you and Henry,</i>

370
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,624
<i>you stay here with me tonight.</i>

371
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:26,666
Yes.

372
00:26:26,749 --> 00:26:28,112
Grace, did you hear me?

373
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:30,540
Yes. I just need to go
back to the apartment.

374
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:32,166
I have to get some clothes,

375
00:26:32,249 --> 00:26:34,749
some things for Henry.

376
00:26:34,832 --> 00:26:36,707
I'll see you when you get here.

377
00:26:37,374 --> 00:26:38,582
Yeah.

378
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:58,374
<i>Good morning,
Mrs. Fraser.</i>

379
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:06,570
<i>Police are focusing on events.</i>

380
00:31:06,582 --> 00:31:08,832
<i>Transpiring at
a reardon school fundraiser,</i>

381
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:11,916
<i>where the victim, Elena alves,
was last seen alive.</i>

382
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:14,528
<i>Several witnesses described Mrs.
Alves as visibly upset. Morning, Henry.</i>

383
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,874
<i>Morning, grandpa. Though other
partygoers dispute that account.</i>

384
00:31:18,415 --> 00:31:20,666
<i>Early suspicion was on
the victim's husband,</i>

385
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:22,457
<i>but we're now learning
his whereabouts</i>

386
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,916
<i>have been accounted for.</i>

387
00:31:25,374 --> 00:31:26,874
Do the police think
he killed her?

388
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:29,041
No.

389
00:31:29,874 --> 00:31:32,124
They wanna talk to him.

390
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:33,999
As do I.
As do you.

391
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:35,832
So...

392
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:38,041
Why did they take you
into the police station?

393
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:43,208
<i>Because he knew her.
He was her child's doctor,</i>

394
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,457
<i>and I knew her, and...</i>

395
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,083
<i>It's not a crime
to know somebody.</i>

396
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:49,332
No. No, it's not.

397
00:31:49,415 --> 00:31:51,332
So, they think he killed her.
No.

398
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:54,208
Well, why else all of this then?
I don't know.

399
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:56,582
I don't know.

400
00:32:02,374 --> 00:32:03,582
Excuse me!
Excuse me, ma'am!

401
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:14,916
Wow,
I can't believe she'd...

402
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:18,511
I see they're putting
you to work, Jennifer.

403
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:23,041
Hi, Mrs. Hartman.
Go on in.

404
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:26,832
Huh, what was that?

405
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:28,707
I'll be right back.

406
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,486
Good morning, Henry. Good morning, grace.
Morning, sir.

407
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,832
God, this is...
Indeed. It's quite something. Henry,

408
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:37,749
why don't you head
up to class, huh?

409
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:39,457
Yes, sir.
Are you okay?

410
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,916
Yeah. Mom, I'm fine.
You sure?

411
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,791
Robert, wh...
What's going on?

412
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:50,791
What is going on is I am trying
to get us through a crisis.

413
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:53,958
Alright.
Grace,

414
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,290
I don't think you
should be here.

415
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,707
What?

416
00:32:57,791 --> 00:33:00,540
I think, for the good
of everyone,

417
00:33:00,624 --> 00:33:02,791
you don't need to be here.

418
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,958
What did they tell you?
I want you to know...

419
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,083
This is a safe place for Henry.

420
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:17,112
What the...
<i>And if he needs to come to my office</i>

421
00:33:17,124 --> 00:33:19,624
<i>at any time, he can come.
At recess or after school.</i>

422
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:22,874
If anyone says anything to him,
he should come see me right away.

423
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:25,540
It's not true. It's not true.

424
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:27,457
Whatever they said to you...

425
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,916
Listen to me.
Robert, come on.

426
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:30,599
The teachers will be
looking out for him.

427
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:33,415
I have spoken to all of them.
He's a reardon student,

428
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:35,290
and I take that very seriously.
Really?

429
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:36,999
You're really doing this to me?

430
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:39,582
<i>My advice to you...</i>

431
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:43,041
<i>Is you send someone else to
pick him up this afternoon.</i>

432
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:52,374
Grace.
Sylvia.

433
00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:53,791
I have a cab. Come on.

434
00:33:53,874 --> 00:33:55,290
What...
Come on.

435
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:06,582
Okay. Okay.

436
00:34:07,582 --> 00:34:08,958
What are people saying?

437
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:11,124
I...

438
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:13,124
Tell me.
It's...

439
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:15,958
Just a water, please,
and some privacy.

440
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:17,749
Thank you.
Tell me.

441
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,083
The word is that Elena's
husband evidently has an alibi.

442
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:27,374
The attention now seems to be
focused entirely on Jonathan.

443
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:35,916
So he knew her?
Elena?

444
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:39,540
Well, Miguel was
his patient, so...

445
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:44,166
Ah, it was her.

446
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,249
What?

447
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:52,540
He hired me.
A few months ago.

448
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:56,499
Jonathan hired you?

449
00:34:56,582 --> 00:34:57,791
As his lawyer.

450
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:01,124
I told him that employment law
wasn't my expertise, but he...

451
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,374
He insisted.

452
00:35:03,457 --> 00:35:06,749
He signed a document hiring me
to formally represent him.

453
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,999
There was going to be a
disciplinary hearing at the hospital,

454
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,916
involved the mother
of a patient.

455
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,749
He wanted my advice.

456
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:21,166
So why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know,

457
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:23,749
for sure, whether you
knew or not, and...

458
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:26,290
Grace, it was...

459
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,832
It was privileged. It's still...

460
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,624
Privileged.
What happened?

461
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:34,124
I looked over the paperwork
that he brought me.

462
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:37,124
There was a lot there. A lot.
More than enough to fire him.

463
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:40,041
He insisted that he was
innocent of the charges.

464
00:35:40,124 --> 00:35:41,582
That it was all being...

465
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:45,582
Manufactured by this,
this... crazy woman.

466
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:49,457
Really? He called a week later to
say the accusations were dropped.

467
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,958
That the hospital found the
woman's claims were baseless.

468
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:54,457
He thanked me for my time.

469
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:59,249
And I just... I assumed
that it went away.

470
00:35:59,332 --> 00:36:01,166
But it didn't.

471
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:05,290
They fired him. They kept
it completely confidential.

472
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,249
I'm sorry, grace.

473
00:36:10,332 --> 00:36:11,999
I am. I'm really sorry.

474
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,415
<i>My advice...</i>

475
00:36:18,499 --> 00:36:20,916
Not that you're asking.

476
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:26,666
If you do learn
where Jonathan is,

477
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:29,166
tell the police.

478
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:31,612
The sooner you make it clear
that you're not involved,

479
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:33,237
the better you'll be
treated by everybody,

480
00:36:33,249 --> 00:36:35,415
police and media included.

481
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:38,415
Grace, you need to get out
of here, you and Henry.

482
00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:42,332
Once they find Jonathan,
this story will explode.

483
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:46,832
You need to be somewhere
else when that happens.

484
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:51,332
So?

485
00:37:51,415 --> 00:37:53,374
Nothing new.

486
00:37:53,457 --> 00:37:56,208
You need to get protection
for yourself, grace.

487
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:00,041
You think you can handle
everything on your own, alone.

488
00:38:00,874 --> 00:38:02,791
This is bigger than you.

489
00:38:02,874 --> 00:38:05,083
It's bigger than me,
for Christ's sakes.

490
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:07,457
You should get out of town.

491
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,749
You should go to
the beach house.

492
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:12,083
I have patients.

493
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,499
Henry has school.

494
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,208
I'm gonna call Haley Fitzgerald.
You have to have a lawyer.

495
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,457
I don't want a lawyer.

496
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,874
Grace.

497
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:25,624
<i>Your husband...</i>

498
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:27,958
<i>Is the lead suspect</i>

499
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:30,290
<i>in a murder investigation.</i>

500
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:48,041
Excuse me.

501
00:38:48,124 --> 00:38:50,154
- Excuse me, I live here. Yes, I do.
- You live here?

502
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:53,582
Hey, hey,
you can't come in here. You got some ID?

503
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:56,958
Uh... Come on.
Let her through, let her through. Come on.

504
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:58,958
What is going on?

505
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,666
Do you have paperwork for this?
Of course. Paul, the warrant.

506
00:39:13,749 --> 00:39:15,332
Here you go.

507
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:36,499
So you think my husband
killed this woman?

508
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,707
The search might take a bit.

509
00:39:41,374 --> 00:39:43,374
You got somewhere else to go?

510
00:39:44,624 --> 00:39:46,457
You don't need to worry
about me, detective.

511
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,457
Well, believe it or not,
it's kinda my nature.

512
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,457
To worry about people.

513
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,874
Where is his phone?
We can't find it.

514
00:40:05,332 --> 00:40:07,832
Can you
guys give me a hand down here?

515
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:11,624
<i>I really
am sorry about all this.</i>

516
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:12,916
<i>Why are you taking...</i>

517
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:15,208
<i>Why are you taking his...
His hairbrush?</i>

518
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,958
<i>Well, we're taking a
number of things that might help</i>

519
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,916
<i>our investigation.</i>
That's all.

520
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:23,249
I could be wrong, but I think
that you wanna help us.

521
00:40:23,582 --> 00:40:27,958
I think that, at this point, you're
more angry at him than you are at us.

522
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:31,916
And you're right to be.
Please, don't fucking patronize me.

523
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:34,112
No, it's not my intention to do that.
I can't... don't.

524
00:40:34,124 --> 00:40:35,737
I don't do that. I don't patronize people.
Don't...

525
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:36,958
<i>I've just seen</i>

526
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:39,249
<i>this type of situation
one too many times.</i>

527
00:40:40,332 --> 00:40:42,499
<i>Husbands who have kept
their wives in the dark</i>

528
00:40:42,582 --> 00:40:43,624
<i>about a lot of things.</i>

529
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:47,457
And when I'm in the picture,
there's some fraud or a robbery.

530
00:40:48,374 --> 00:40:49,582
Sometimes, a murder.

531
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:52,290
I'm sorry.

532
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:57,916
<i>We need the hairbrush for DNA.</i>

533
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,749
<i>For a couple of reasons.
The crime scene...</i>

534
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,499
<i>And also...</i>

535
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,332
Also what?

536
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:10,166
What?
Paternity.

537
00:41:11,499 --> 00:41:12,540
They have a baby.

538
00:41:12,624 --> 00:41:16,083
Mr. Alves is demanding
a paternity test.

539
00:41:18,415 --> 00:41:19,958
He insists he's not the father.

540
00:42:13,415 --> 00:42:14,415
Please...

541
00:42:14,457 --> 00:42:16,041
Please.

542
00:43:08,582 --> 00:43:10,582
Oh! God...

543
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:13,499
Henry, you scared me.

544
00:43:13,582 --> 00:43:15,749
Mom.

545
00:43:16,832 --> 00:43:19,832
Mom, I don't wanna be here.
I know, but we're here.

546
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:21,999
For how long?
For as long as it takes.

547
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:23,707
That's not an answer.

548
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:26,499
<i>When the police and the media
stop congregating</i>

549
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:29,332
<i>outside our apartment
and your school,</i>

550
00:43:29,415 --> 00:43:30,582
<i>that's when we'll go back.</i>

551
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:33,083
We'll go back when things...
When they what?

552
00:43:34,832 --> 00:43:37,457
When they what? Go back to normal?
Come on, Henry.

553
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,958
Mom.
Henry, come on.

554
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:42,457
I'm trying. I'm trying.

555
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,832
By... by running away?

556
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:45,666
That's bullshit, mom.

557
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:47,249
There's no hiding.

558
00:43:48,124 --> 00:43:49,791
Hen...

559
00:43:50,249 --> 00:43:51,707
Henry.

560
00:45:25,707 --> 00:45:27,041
Ah!

561
00:45:49,749 --> 00:45:52,041
Come here.

562
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,540
Come here.

563
00:47:34,874 --> 00:47:36,332
Don't scream! Don't scream.
Mm!

564
00:47:36,415 --> 00:47:38,237
Don't scream, don't scream. It's me.

565
00:47:38,249 --> 00:47:40,249
I didn't do it.
I didn't kill her.

566
00:47:40,332 --> 00:47:42,832
I did not kill her.

567
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:45,041
We were romantically involved,

568
00:47:45,124 --> 00:47:47,374
but I didn't kill her. I'm so sorry.

569
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:50,540
I'm so sorry, my grace.

570
00:47:50,624 --> 00:47:52,791
I'm so sorry.

571
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:56,374
I'm gonna
take my hand away,

572
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:59,249
and you're not gonna scream. There.

573
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:01,582
There.

574
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:03,749
I didn't do it.

575
00:48:03,832 --> 00:48:05,540
I didn't kill her.

576
00:48:05,624 --> 00:48:07,749
I'm calling the police.
Give me two minutes.

577
00:48:07,832 --> 00:48:10,593
Give me two... you're going to give
me two minutes before you do that.

578
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:13,749
I gave you my whole life. No.
Grace. Grace!

579
00:48:13,832 --> 00:48:16,362
Get your fucking hands off
me or I will. I will scream. Grace.

580
00:48:16,374 --> 00:48:19,457
I didn't... you can hate
me as much as you want,

581
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,749
but Henry needs to know
that his father's not...

582
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,196
A murderer.
He's gotta believe in me.

583
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:26,666
I will never,
ever let him believe in you.

584
00:48:26,749 --> 00:48:29,832
Look, here's what happened.

585
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:31,124
I had an affair.

586
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:34,332
What?
She became obsessed. With me,

587
00:48:34,415 --> 00:48:37,208
with my life,
and then, with you.

588
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:39,987
First it was all about
getting her boy into reardon,

589
00:48:39,999 --> 00:48:42,666
which I helped with 'cause I
thought it was about his education,

590
00:48:42,749 --> 00:48:45,374
but it wasn't.
It was about encroachment.

591
00:48:45,457 --> 00:48:47,041
She was fucking possessed.

592
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,582
She was possessed.

593
00:48:48,666 --> 00:48:50,266
When I heard she'd
got herself on your...

594
00:48:50,332 --> 00:48:53,166
Auction committee and then
joined your gym, I was scared.

595
00:48:53,249 --> 00:48:55,999
I was scared for us as a family.
I was scared for you.

596
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:58,249
At the night of the fundraiser,
I went to confront her.

597
00:48:58,332 --> 00:49:01,374
I told her that had to stop...
You snapped?

598
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:04,958
We argued. We fought.

599
00:49:08,374 --> 00:49:11,208
We had sex. I left.
I walked the streets.

600
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:13,540
I went to a bar to
collect myself, then I...

601
00:49:13,624 --> 00:49:15,666
I went back to
confront her again,

602
00:49:15,749 --> 00:49:18,166
and she was fucking dead.

603
00:49:18,249 --> 00:49:20,749
She was dead.
There was no sign of anyone.

604
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:24,290
I panicked! I totally fucking
panicked! I lost my head.

605
00:49:24,374 --> 00:49:27,540
Shock took hold of me...
You came home.

606
00:49:27,624 --> 00:49:30,124
You crawled into our bed...

607
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:32,374
And I held you.

608
00:49:32,457 --> 00:49:34,707
I held you.

609
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:36,666
And I broke for you.

610
00:49:36,749 --> 00:49:40,166
And we made love, Jonathan.
We made love.

611
00:49:40,666 --> 00:49:43,083
And I thought you'd
lost a patient.

612
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:45,415
How can I ever believe you?

613
00:49:45,499 --> 00:49:47,290
Because you're a fucking liar.

614
00:49:47,374 --> 00:49:50,707
You're a liar. You've been
pretending to have this job

615
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:52,791
you didn't even have.
No. That's all part of...

616
00:49:52,832 --> 00:49:55,874
What are you...
It's part of... the same big deception.

617
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:59,540
I lost my job 'cause of
this woman. I lost myself.

618
00:49:59,624 --> 00:50:00,874
She got hold of me, grace.

619
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:02,874
She got hold of every
fucking part of me.

620
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,166
But I didn't kill her.

621
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:07,832
- I did not.
- Wha...

622
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:09,166
Dad?

623
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:12,166
Dad?
Come here. Come here, come here.

624
00:50:20,707 --> 00:50:22,041
My name is grace Fraser.

625
00:50:22,124 --> 00:50:24,749
My husband has just broken in.

626
00:50:24,832 --> 00:50:27,499
He's a fugitive.
He's wanted for murder.

627
00:50:27,582 --> 00:50:29,874
His name is Jonathan Fraser.
I'm at 361...

628
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:32,332
Beachway. Beachway drive,

629
00:50:32,415 --> 00:50:33,832
and I'm fucking terrified.

630
00:50:33,916 --> 00:50:36,290
I need you to get here quickly.

631
00:50:37,332 --> 00:50:38,999
Please.

632
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:50,249
Were you afraid because
you thought he might...

633
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:52,906
Kill you?
Why would you be asking me these questions?

634
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:54,249
Why are you asking me this?

635
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:58,707
The whole world thinks
I did this.

636
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:01,626
I got a feeling your daughter
is hiding something.

637
00:52:04,332 --> 00:52:06,092
The police will want
your cooperation.

638
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:08,008
Are you trying
to intimidate me?

639
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:10,166
Did you kill her?

640
00:52:10,791 --> 00:52:11,707
Be very careful...

641
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:13,624
...Dr. Fraser.

642
00:52:14,305 --> 00:53:14,213

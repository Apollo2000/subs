<i>Murder
is ugly business.</i>

2
00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:13,234
Whatever you've heard, this one
is worse than you think.

3
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:16,585
I think we're gonna win.

4
00:00:16,753 --> 00:00:19,002
We can get a dog,
I'll take care of it.

5
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,294
So you won't have to worry
about what happened before.

6
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:24,062
I...
I didn't kill the family dog.

7
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:25,612
It was your sister?

8
00:00:26,223 --> 00:00:28,055
<i>After his sister was killed,</i>

9
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:30,514
<i>he never said another word
about it.</i>

10
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:33,179
<i>Jonathan never even said
he was sorry.</i>

11
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:36,598
<i>I saw
them together. At school.</i>

12
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:38,469
Elena Alves was hit

13
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:40,656
with a sculpting hammer
like this one,

14
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,851
<i>which was never found.</i>

33
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:51,306
You need to talk to me.

34
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:55,640
Now.

35
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:57,984
Now!

36
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:00,355
I found it
at the outdoor fireplace.

37
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,951
At the beach house?

38
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:07,589
Yeah.

39
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:16,838
- In the fireplace?
- Yes.

40
00:03:18,307 --> 00:03:19,594
<i>When?</i>

41
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:21,324
Just after we got there.

42
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:39,222
And why didn't you tell me?

43
00:03:49,077 --> 00:03:50,367
Why do you think?

44
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:53,076
Do not answer my question
with a question.

45
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,066
Why?
Why didn't you tell me?

46
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:01,292
Because he killed her.

47
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,402
I didn't want him to get caught.

48
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,300
And you would have
turned it over.

49
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:32,201
Please... Please...

50
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:44,738
It's Alves.

51
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:47,660
He had to have
put it there.

52
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:49,908
Planted it.

53
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:53,456
How would he know
to plant it there?

54
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:55,378
Maybe he followed us.

55
00:04:55,577 --> 00:04:58,113
- Us?
- It was a place we went to.

56
00:04:58,618 --> 00:04:59,792
Me and Elena.

57
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:02,293
In my family house?

58
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:04,618
- You son of a bitch...
- Dad. Dad. Dad!

59
00:05:04,702 --> 00:05:06,576
- You fucking fuck!
- Stop it. Stop it!

60
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,394
- Jesus Christ.
- This could be a good thing.

61
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:10,692
Alves.

62
00:05:11,074 --> 00:05:12,933
His DNA could be
all over that.

63
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:15,659
Do we get it tested?

64
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,284
This could exonerate me.

65
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:18,964
- Yes?
- It won't.

66
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,956
- Huh?
- It won't.

67
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,495
I ran it through the dishwasher.

68
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:28,605
- What?
- To protect you.

69
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:34,386
- I didn't kill her!
- Jonathan, shut up.

70
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:37,075
Henry, this is very important
for me to help your dad.

71
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,980
I absolutely must
know the truth.

72
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:42,449
You found it
in the outdoor fireplace?

73
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:43,816
Yeah.

74
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:45,589
When?

75
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,417
Just after we got
to the beach house.

76
00:05:50,355 --> 00:05:52,261
And you ran it
through the dishwasher?

77
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,659
- Twice.
- Fuck.

78
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:58,812
Okay.

79
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:00,104
- Look...
- Nobody talk.

80
00:06:00,188 --> 00:06:02,800
- Wait a minute. Henry...
- I said, nobody talk.

81
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:07,855
Um...

82
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:11,941
I have no knowledge that that
is the actual murder weapon.

83
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,714
I am not advising you
what to do with it.

84
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:18,081
I also have no obligation
to alert the police.

85
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:21,337
Given that it has been run
through a dishwasher,

86
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,730
I have no reason to believe that
it will be of any evidentiary value.

87
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:26,582
- Well, of course it...
- Listen to me.

88
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,722
Should this hammer
come to light,

89
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:31,972
it is game over.

90
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:35,034
It's one too many coincidences
to account for.

91
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:38,346
Add to that,

92
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:40,949
Henry could be arrested
for obstruction of justice.

93
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,745
No, they wouldn't
arrest an innocent boy

94
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,038
for protecting his father.

95
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:45,239
They can,
and they likely will.

96
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:46,667
They could arrest Henry?

97
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:48,831
They can blame Henry?

98
00:06:49,003 --> 00:06:51,613
They can,
and they will.

99
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:54,808
Add to that,

100
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:57,199
they would traumatize
the shit out of him.

101
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,445
Ugh.

102
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,245
It is my advice...

103
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:11,493
It is my advice that
you do not turn it over.

104
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:14,445
- Are you kidding me?
- Franklin,

105
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:16,629
you hired me to defend
your son-in-law.

106
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:18,509
All of you understand,

107
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:21,244
now is not the time.
We're in the middle of a trial.

108
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:26,080
We can tend to our ethical egos
once this is all over.

109
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:28,329
So, all right. What...?

110
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:32,595
What should I do with it?

111
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:44,837
I can neither advise
nor instruct you

112
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,938
to conceal or destroy.

113
00:07:47,386 --> 00:07:50,282
That is not an answer, Haley.

114
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:55,071
I can neither advise
nor instruct you

115
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:57,040
to conceal or destroy.

116
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:00,954
I need to talk to my wife.

117
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,626
Alone. Now.

118
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:08,378
- Grace.
- Go to your room.

119
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:10,204
Wait in your room.

120
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:24,423
Could it be?

121
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:26,209
What?

122
00:08:28,837 --> 00:08:31,251
Well, it's the only other
explanation, Grace.

123
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:33,244
What?

124
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:35,540
Well, I think you're asking
yourself the same question.

125
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:39,243
I mean, he knew about me
and Elena. Saw us at school.

126
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:42,143
Could have been very, very
upset.

127
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:43,920
Traumatized more than we know.

128
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:46,166
I mean, could, could he have
gone there that night

129
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:47,879
for some reason, and...

130
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:50,727
Seen me with her?
And I don't know. Just...

131
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:52,879
Are you actually asking me,

132
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:55,766
do I think our son
beat a woman to death?

133
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:01,267
Well, he had the weapon.

134
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:02,806
- No. No.
- He, he had the weapon.

135
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:04,339
- No.
- He was carrying it around with him.

136
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:06,368
- It is not possible. No. No.
- Hiding it. He was hiding it

137
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:08,220
for three months.

138
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:12,282
Why'd he put it through
a dishwasher?

139
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:16,198
He...
He wants to protect you.

140
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:18,407
He believes you did it.

141
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,260
Everyone assumes
they know their own kid.

142
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:25,042
- But maybe they, maybe they don't.
- Are you actually...

143
00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:27,431
Are you actually
accusing our son...

144
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:29,401
- No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm just thinking.
- Of committing this crime?

145
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,149
Do not... -I'm thinking. My mind
is just fucking spinning. That's all!

146
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:36,361
In despicable directions.

147
00:09:43,705 --> 00:09:45,219
I need you to leave.

148
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:49,500
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:03,977
Hey.

150
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:08,252
- F-f-fuck you.
- Don't talk to me like that.

151
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:11,415
- You're accusing me of doing this.
- I'm not. I'm not.

152
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,439
I fucking heard you!

153
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:16,487
No, no, no, Hen. What you heard

154
00:10:16,571 --> 00:10:18,556
was my mind running in a way

155
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:21,528
which at the moment is
completely... bonkers.

156
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,375
It's, it's out of control.
Sit down. Come on. Talk to me.

157
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:27,266
I'm under siege here,
and I'm under siege.

158
00:10:27,351 --> 00:10:29,266
Everyone seems to think
I did this thing, and I didn't.

159
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,317
You blamed me.

160
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:36,149
That's not me in this.
That is a desperate man.

161
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:38,820
That's not the real Dad.
But I promise you this.

162
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,632
If I survive this ordeal,
and I fucking well will,

163
00:10:46,257 --> 00:10:49,999
the real me will be back.
And the real us will be back.

164
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,051
And you and I will go on
the much-advertised road trip.

165
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,147
<i>Deux. Yeah?</i>

166
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:01,737
I love you, mate. I'm sorry.

167
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,029
Come here. I love you.
I love you.

168
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,783
Come here.

169
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:29,136
Jesus Christ.

170
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:31,278
If that man goes free,

171
00:11:31,405 --> 00:11:35,140
he will be in your life.
He will be in your son's life.

172
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:42,109
Good God, Grace.

173
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,563
You have always
seen things so clearly.

174
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:48,194
Seen exactly how
they will play out.

175
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:52,819
How can you
not see this now?

176
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:58,054
Oh. Oh, God.

177
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:04,155
I do see.

178
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,140
I'll fix this.

179
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:18,313
<i>To put the defendant
on the stand, it's risky,</i>

180
00:12:18,398 --> 00:12:22,086
<i>and likely a sign Haley
Fitzgerald feels she has no choice.</i>

181
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:23,445
<i>On the other hand,</i>

182
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:26,077
<i>the doctor's primetime
news interview was</i>

183
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,515
<i>clearly compelling.</i>

184
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,437
<i>She may very well feel that
her client is the secret sauce</i>

185
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:31,945
<i>to an acquittal.</i>

186
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:33,737
<i>One thing we know
for a certainty,</i>

187
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,859
<i>tomorrow promises to
deliver high theater.</i>

188
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:04,630
I'm not loving
the vibe here, team.

189
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:06,382
We're fine.

190
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:08,296
Uh-huh.

191
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:13,361
Again, no emotion whatsoever.

192
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:14,946
Not even a hint.

193
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:18,826
Be inhuman.
I get it.

194
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:20,343
Not my point.

195
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,173
What is your point?

196
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:25,312
My point is your every reaction
will be used against you.

197
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,976
If you wince,
he's a monster.

198
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,779
If you smile, you don't care.

199
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:32,402
If you cry, you're faking it.

200
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:38,906
You, on the other hand,

201
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:40,988
you hide nothing.
You let 'em see everything.

202
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:42,614
Yeah.

203
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:52,523
Chins up. Eyes down.

204
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,819
And hold fucking hands.

205
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:19,737
When you consider the
totality of all the circumstances,

206
00:14:19,988 --> 00:14:22,198
together with some
of the facts...

207
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:25,698
Um, they're awful.

208
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:29,730
I lied to my wife,
which makes me a liar.

209
00:14:30,722 --> 00:14:33,612
I was unfaithful,
which makes me a cheat.

210
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:36,403
My semen was found
inside the victim,

211
00:14:36,487 --> 00:14:38,511
which makes me a suspect.

212
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:41,988
I deserve those labels.

213
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,534
But not murderer.

214
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:51,316
I didn't kill Elena.

215
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:56,847
We made love.
I left. I returned.

216
00:14:58,278 --> 00:14:59,778
I found her dead.

217
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:02,089
But you understand our problem.

218
00:15:02,242 --> 00:15:04,066
We only have your word.

219
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:06,901
And as you've admitted,
you lie.

220
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:09,825
Well, there is no evidence
of me ever being violent.

221
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:11,978
Ever.

222
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:14,653
In fact, I have attempted
to devote my entire life

223
00:15:14,737 --> 00:15:16,570
to what might be called...

224
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:19,779
the antithesis of violence.
Healing.

225
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,153
As well as, I hope,
empathy and compassion.

226
00:15:23,395 --> 00:15:28,067
I helped to heal Elena and Fernando's son,
Miguel.

227
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:29,995
Can we talk about that?

228
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:32,568
What was his condition?
Miguel's condition?

229
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,381
He had what's called
Wilms Tumor.

230
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:36,862
It's cancer of the kidney.

231
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:38,195
Most common among children,

232
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,099
and Miguel bore
that statistical brunt.

233
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:42,987
- What was his treatment?
- Well, he was unlucky

234
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:45,287
in that normal medical
practice had failed.

235
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,959
I...

236
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:49,810
used to lead a team

237
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:52,335
that specialized
in a procedure

238
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,037
called autologous
bone marrow transplant.

239
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:57,951
It's a long, and relatively
new process,

240
00:15:58,036 --> 00:16:01,110
but happily, it was entirely
successful in Miguel's case.

241
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:03,146
By the end,
we'd all become quite close.

242
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,564
Cancer can do that.

243
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:06,974
There's been much
discussion of...

244
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:11,099
my loving his mother.

245
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,014
But I also quite love him.

246
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:16,528
Miguel.

247
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:18,820
Yeah, he became like a son,

248
00:16:18,904 --> 00:16:20,334
which is not advisable.

249
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,545
Um, pediatric oncologists
becoming too close to their patients.

250
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:27,904
Well, it's a recipe
for depression,

251
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,819
or if not,
utter personal doom,

252
00:16:30,904 --> 00:16:33,612
but, uh, I found I had no choice
more times than not.

253
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:37,570
And I certainly had no
choice with Miguel. He's...

254
00:16:37,654 --> 00:16:39,698
<i>He's a remarkable
young man.</i>

255
00:16:40,737 --> 00:16:43,854
<i>You keep calling him a man.</i>

256
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,456
Yeah, he's a young boy.

257
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:49,620
But to fight the cancer he did,

258
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:52,573
with the ferocity he showed,

259
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,526
and the good humor,

260
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:58,432
there's a man in there,
I assure you.

261
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:03,745
After the surgery,
during chemotherapy,

262
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:05,987
you often slept
in his hospital room.

263
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:08,456
Well, as I say,
I'd become very attached.

264
00:17:08,697 --> 00:17:11,706
There were some touch-and-go
moments and I wasn't gonna lose him.

265
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:14,948
I was very determined
about that.

266
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:20,388
Uh, another reason,
of course, why...

267
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,617
Another reason what?

268
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,377
Well, he was like a son.

269
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,143
What was done to his mother...

270
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:43,386
I could never do such a thing.
Not to her, and...

271
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:45,050
not to him.

272
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:50,456
Thank you.

273
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:06,511
You discovered
Miguel's mother like this.

274
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,320
I did, yeah.

275
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:11,270
And when the police found her
the next morning,

276
00:18:11,362 --> 00:18:14,112
when they came looking
to ask you questions,

277
00:18:14,456 --> 00:18:16,029
uh, where were you then?

278
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,029
Near Lake George,
upstate New York, in a motel.

279
00:18:21,284 --> 00:18:22,542
How'd you get there?

280
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,690
- I drove.
- Hmm.

281
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,320
You say
you loved Elena Alves.

282
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,878
- Yeah.
- You discovered her like this.

283
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:42,847
May I ask you to look
at the screen, please?

284
00:18:44,148 --> 00:18:45,417
Sir?

285
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:50,089
A woman you loved.

286
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:54,245
A woman whose son
was like a son to you.

287
00:18:54,378 --> 00:18:57,876
You didn't call the police,
or an ambulance?

288
00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:00,003
Well, first of all,
I knew she was dead.

289
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:02,320
Yes, so,

290
00:19:02,404 --> 00:19:03,987
off to Lake George, then.

291
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:07,153
And I panicked, you see. I
panicked. I panicked. I panicked.

292
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:10,857
You panicked, and went straight
to Lake George from the scene.

293
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,496
No, I went the next morning.

294
00:19:13,463 --> 00:19:14,552
Oh, but,

295
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:16,262
where did you go that night?

296
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:18,487
- I went home.
- Sorry?

297
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:19,946
I went home.

298
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:23,279
And did what?

299
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:28,587
I went to bed.

300
00:19:28,904 --> 00:19:32,212
You left your
bludgeoned-to-death lover,

301
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,696
went home,

302
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,103
- and went to bed.
- I was terrified.

303
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:43,607
I was terrified of being blamed.

304
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:48,779
And that my infidelity
would be exposed.

305
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,528
And I...

306
00:19:50,612 --> 00:19:52,945
made a stupid decision.

307
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:56,653
But you're not a stupid man.

308
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,029
You're an acclaimed oncologist.

309
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:01,945
Well-versed in making
life-or-death calls

310
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:03,945
under extreme stress.

311
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:06,571
The decision you made here...

312
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:09,653
was to flee.

313
00:20:09,737 --> 00:20:11,154
I knew how it looked.

314
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:13,737
I knew how it looked then,

315
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:16,403
as I know how it looks now.

316
00:20:16,487 --> 00:20:19,487
If not me, then who?

317
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,278
Well, it's not me.

318
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:24,487
I might be the easy answer,

319
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:26,445
but I'm not the right answer.

320
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:34,487
The, um, clothes you
were wearing that night,

321
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:36,904
a tuxedo, I believe,

322
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:39,362
what became of the tuxedo?

323
00:20:42,654 --> 00:20:44,528
I took it to the dry cleaner.

324
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:46,862
You took
it to the dry cleaners?

325
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,988
When?

326
00:20:51,445 --> 00:20:53,278
On the way to Lake George.

327
00:20:58,863 --> 00:21:02,904
You took it to the dry cleaners
on your way to Lake George.

328
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:58,863
- Henry?
- Yeah?

329
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:09,445
I cannot fathom how
you're bearing up through all of this.

330
00:22:11,071 --> 00:22:13,737
Are you okay?

331
00:22:14,571 --> 00:22:15,779
Hmm?

332
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:21,571
I know how close
you and your dad are.

333
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:27,946
Dad created this.

334
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:36,404
What do you think about what he
said about trying to fix this family?

335
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:42,987
Do you hope for that?

336
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:48,571
You are answering a question
with a question again.

337
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,612
Yeah.

338
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,779
And I'd like you
to answer first.

339
00:22:57,654 --> 00:22:59,320
Do you hope for that?

340
00:23:04,237 --> 00:23:06,863
I want what's best for you.

341
00:23:44,362 --> 00:23:46,696
- Hi.
- <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

342
00:23:48,237 --> 00:23:50,278
Will you come for
a walk with me?

343
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,320
<i>What,
now, before breakfast?</i>

344
00:23:52,404 --> 00:23:54,153
<i>Yeah, can you
give me, like, 30?</i>

345
00:23:54,237 --> 00:23:55,737
<i>That's when Rosana
gets here.</i>

346
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:57,779
I need to talk to you,

347
00:23:57,863 --> 00:24:00,696
and I need you to do
something for me.

348
00:24:34,904 --> 00:24:37,779
Why the
same cop? Why not call his partner?

349
00:24:37,863 --> 00:24:40,403
JOkay, Ms. Fitzgerald,
you've still got the ball.

350
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:41,820
Thanks, Your Honor.

351
00:24:41,904 --> 00:24:44,404
At this time, the defense
would like to call...

352
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:56,029
Miguel Alves.

353
00:24:57,445 --> 00:24:58,695
Your Honor...

354
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:00,487
He's on the witness list.
Yours, in fact.

355
00:25:00,571 --> 00:25:02,403
This witness was never included

356
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:04,612
- on our pre-trial...
- He's on your list.

357
00:25:04,696 --> 00:25:06,821
And he's here,
I suspect, as a prop.

358
00:25:08,946 --> 00:25:11,029
<i>If it gets too much,
I'll make it stop.</i>

359
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:13,029
Okay? I'm here for you.

360
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:15,821
- I'm sorry.
- Love you.

361
00:25:24,654 --> 00:25:27,195
Do you swear that the testimony
you're about to give is the truth,

362
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,404
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

363
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:36,820
Yes.

364
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:38,528
State your name, please.

365
00:25:38,612 --> 00:25:40,279
Miguel Alves.

366
00:25:41,487 --> 00:25:43,988
Okay, Miguel. Have a seat.

367
00:25:49,946 --> 00:25:51,153
Hi, Miguel.

368
00:25:51,237 --> 00:25:54,260
I'm really sorry to put you
on the spot like this.

369
00:25:54,377 --> 00:25:57,695
This has been all
pretty terrible.

370
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,979
But nothing can be as bad
as losing your mom, I bet.

371
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:09,619
I see you looking
at your dad.

372
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:12,987
And that's okay.

373
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:15,612
And I promise if any of this
gets too hard,

374
00:26:15,696 --> 00:26:17,854
or too scary,
you tell me, okay?

375
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:20,596
We can stop.
We can take a breath.

376
00:26:22,154 --> 00:26:23,236
Okay.

377
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,070
And I also promise that
I'll keep this very short.

378
00:26:26,154 --> 00:26:28,057
I really only have
two questions.

379
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:30,994
Or I should say,
questions about two things.

380
00:26:31,768 --> 00:26:33,059
First,

381
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:36,299
the night your mom died,

382
00:26:38,071 --> 00:26:39,776
you were home with your dad?

383
00:26:41,071 --> 00:26:43,799
- And my sister.
- Where was your mom?

384
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,790
She went to a school
fundraiser thing.

385
00:26:48,763 --> 00:26:50,179
An auction.

386
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:53,116
She went to the auction?

387
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,311
Okay. Do you remember offhand

388
00:26:56,396 --> 00:26:58,271
when you went to bed?

389
00:26:59,294 --> 00:27:01,545
Around nine o'clock.

390
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:03,779
Nine o'clock?

391
00:27:03,863 --> 00:27:05,529
You fairly sure?

392
00:27:08,654 --> 00:27:09,820
That's my bedtime.

393
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,433
My father's really
strict about it.

394
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,777
You have your own bedroom?

395
00:27:16,404 --> 00:27:17,695
Yes.

396
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:19,964
And where does
your baby sister sleep?

397
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:22,136
In my parents' room.

398
00:27:22,237 --> 00:27:24,987
So,
you went to bed around nine.

399
00:27:25,071 --> 00:27:27,228
Do you remember
what time you woke up?

400
00:27:27,728 --> 00:27:29,394
6:30.

401
00:27:29,587 --> 00:27:31,642
I have an alarm clock
for school.

402
00:27:32,113 --> 00:27:33,415
Okay.

403
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:37,029
And between nine o'clock
when you went to bed,

404
00:27:37,228 --> 00:27:39,653
and around 6:30
when you woke up,

405
00:27:40,003 --> 00:27:44,003
did you get up,
or wake up, in between?

406
00:27:47,197 --> 00:27:48,572
No.

407
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:55,487
You were asleep
the whole time?

408
00:27:56,487 --> 00:27:57,862
I think.

409
00:27:57,946 --> 00:27:59,320
I wake up sometimes

410
00:27:59,404 --> 00:28:03,029
when I get thirsty
or I need to pee.

411
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:05,279
Did that happen that night?

412
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:08,445
I don't think so.

413
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,738
But I can't really remember.

414
00:28:12,612 --> 00:28:14,320
That's fair.

415
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,275
So, it could have been

416
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,236
that you slept
the whole night through,

417
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,070
from around nine,

418
00:28:21,154 --> 00:28:23,222
to around 6:30.
Right?

419
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:25,779
I guess.

420
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,040
Okay.

421
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:33,587
My next question
is a little harder.

422
00:28:34,093 --> 00:28:37,260
Did your mom and dad
ever get upset with each other?

423
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:38,972
Argue?

424
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,359
Sometimes.

425
00:28:46,821 --> 00:28:48,528
Did they ever yell at each other

426
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:50,154
when they got upset?

427
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:52,821
Sometimes.

428
00:28:56,807 --> 00:28:58,348
Scream?

429
00:29:06,257 --> 00:29:08,091
Did they fight a lot?

430
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:20,404
- I don't know.
- Okay.

431
00:29:21,404 --> 00:29:23,487
Had they been fighting

432
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:25,945
a little more than usual

433
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:28,029
shortly before she died?

434
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:31,862
I don't know.

435
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:34,863
Did it ever frighten
you when they would argue?

436
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:40,362
Miguel?

437
00:29:43,071 --> 00:29:45,737
Did you ever tell anyone
that it was really scary

438
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:47,696
when your mom and dad fought?

439
00:29:53,988 --> 00:29:55,571
I told...

440
00:29:56,612 --> 00:29:59,863
one of... my teachers.

441
00:30:01,904 --> 00:30:03,612
Hey.

442
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:05,820
<i>Sorry.</i>

443
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:09,029
You know what? Why don't
we call it quits right here?

444
00:30:09,113 --> 00:30:11,111
You did great.

445
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:13,528
Ms. Stamper?

446
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:16,195
I have nothing, Your Honor.

447
00:30:18,696 --> 00:30:20,029
Thank you, Miguel.

448
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:21,696
You may step down now.

449
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:54,737
- Hey.
- Hi.

450
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:57,737
That was obscene.

451
00:30:57,821 --> 00:30:59,279
I know.

452
00:31:00,113 --> 00:31:01,487
Do you?

453
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,904
Really?

454
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:16,113
You okay?

455
00:31:16,737 --> 00:31:19,195
Yeah. I'm fine.

456
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,821
And you?

457
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,862
Hey, hey, hey.

458
00:31:24,946 --> 00:31:26,695
- How dare you?
- Mr. Alves...

459
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:28,528
You people are fucking vile!

460
00:31:28,612 --> 00:31:29,987
- Officer!
- You cannot be here.

461
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:31,403
You should be ashamed!

462
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:33,987
- Don't make me call security.
- Come on, Fernando.

463
00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:37,779
- Fucking vile!
- Officer!

464
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:40,070
Out! Let's go!

465
00:31:40,154 --> 00:31:41,320
Not here.

466
00:31:41,404 --> 00:31:43,153
You okay?

467
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:45,445
Are you sure?

468
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,278
So now what?

469
00:31:48,362 --> 00:31:50,653
Is that it? Do we...?

470
00:31:50,737 --> 00:31:52,154
We rest?

471
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:57,904
Or maybe we still go to Mendoza.

472
00:31:57,988 --> 00:32:00,528
It's close.

473
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:03,654
No, it's good.
I like where we are.

474
00:32:09,737 --> 00:32:11,362
What about me?

475
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:19,779
You've always said I'm the
most reliable narrator. I'm...

476
00:32:19,863 --> 00:32:24,695
I'm... I'm willing to testify.

477
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:27,696
You said the jury
will relate to me.

478
00:32:32,362 --> 00:32:34,029
Grace.

479
00:32:34,113 --> 00:32:36,945
I can't put your ambivalence
on display.

480
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:39,278
Ambivalence?

481
00:32:39,362 --> 00:32:42,195
I see.

482
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,237
I'm just gonna tell the truth.

483
00:32:49,113 --> 00:32:50,779
But what is your truth?

484
00:32:50,863 --> 00:32:53,404
I'm having a little trouble
tracking it.

485
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,571
I don't believe
you could have done this.

486
00:33:05,821 --> 00:33:07,195
I'll say that.

487
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,279
I'm willing to say that.

488
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:15,737
I'll testify to that.

489
00:33:24,237 --> 00:33:25,737
Thank you.

490
00:33:29,612 --> 00:33:30,904
Grace.

491
00:33:52,445 --> 00:33:55,946
<i>To have an affair,
that's human.</i>

492
00:33:57,404 --> 00:34:00,945
<i>To strike at someone
in an... an act of passion,</i>

493
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:05,195
<i>or anger, that's human.</i>

494
00:34:07,113 --> 00:34:09,111
<i>But to bludgeon someone
to death,</i>

495
00:34:09,195 --> 00:34:12,737
<i>and keep on bludgeoning them
long after they are dead,</i>

496
00:34:12,821 --> 00:34:15,403
<i>that is a monster, Grace.</i>

497
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:18,361
<i>That is a monster.</i>

498
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:24,111
Thank you...

499
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,029
for your kindness.

500
00:34:56,029 --> 00:34:57,987
Do you swear that the
testimony you are about to give

501
00:34:58,071 --> 00:35:00,904
is the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

502
00:35:00,988 --> 00:35:02,111
I do.

503
00:35:02,195 --> 00:35:04,111
Please state
your name for the record.

504
00:35:04,195 --> 00:35:06,820
Grace Reinhart Fraser.

505
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,404
Be seated.

506
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,487
Dr. Fraser.

507
00:35:18,529 --> 00:35:19,862
May I call you Grace?

508
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:21,695
Yes.

509
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:23,236
You're a doctor.

510
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,487
I am.

511
00:35:24,571 --> 00:35:25,987
Could you tell us
your specialty?

512
00:35:26,071 --> 00:35:28,612
I'm a clinical psychologist.

513
00:35:28,696 --> 00:35:31,570
I have a PhD in psychology

514
00:35:31,654 --> 00:35:33,820
that I got from
Harvard University.

515
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:36,361
- And that's where you met your husband.
- It is.

516
00:35:36,445 --> 00:35:39,320
We met in 2002.

517
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:42,071
And we were married in 2005.

518
00:35:43,071 --> 00:35:44,695
You've been happily married.

519
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:46,904
Until recently, yes.

520
00:35:46,988 --> 00:35:48,236
Yes.

521
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,653
I won't ask you to recite

522
00:35:49,737 --> 00:35:52,571
the events that
brought you here today.

523
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,153
I appreciate that.

524
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:57,571
You and your husband
are still together.

525
00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:00,737
Yes. We are.

526
00:36:00,821 --> 00:36:05,195
Prior to the night
that Elena Alves was killed,

527
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:07,278
did you know that
she and Jonathan

528
00:36:07,362 --> 00:36:08,945
were romantically involved?

529
00:36:09,029 --> 00:36:10,236
I did not.

530
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,862
We've heard testimony of you all

531
00:36:11,946 --> 00:36:13,695
being at a school fundraiser
together.

532
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:16,445
And that he left early.

533
00:36:16,529 --> 00:36:19,279
Why did he leave,
to your knowledge?

534
00:36:21,654 --> 00:36:23,361
My knowledge then
was that he left

535
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:26,070
because of an emergency
with a patient.

536
00:36:26,154 --> 00:36:31,695
My knowledge subsequently
and now is that he left because

537
00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:33,487
of her.

538
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:38,278
Her, being Elena, the victim?

539
00:36:38,393 --> 00:36:39,518
Yes.

540
00:36:39,643 --> 00:36:41,570
He was in love with her.

541
00:36:41,654 --> 00:36:43,487
Perhaps still is.

542
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:45,445
That must be difficult.

543
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:50,070
Yes, it is.

544
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:51,737
And yet you stand by him,

545
00:36:51,821 --> 00:36:53,904
giving testimony
on his behalf today.

546
00:36:53,988 --> 00:36:56,320
Because he could not
have done this.

547
00:36:58,612 --> 00:37:00,279
How do you know that?

548
00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:07,779
We've been married
for 14 years.

549
00:37:07,863 --> 00:37:11,029
We've been together
for 17 years.

550
00:37:11,113 --> 00:37:14,612
I've been able to intimately
observe who and what he is.

551
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:16,945
I'm a clinical psychologist.

552
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:18,612
I have an expertise
in brain cognition.

553
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:20,862
I have a skill set that
allows me to read people.

554
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:22,946
To diagnose them, if you will.

555
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:28,195
You didn't know
about his infidelity?

556
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,945
It's one thing to be
fooled by his adultery.

557
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:33,737
To be duped by who and
what he fundamentally is...

558
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:35,237
And what is he?

559
00:37:36,529 --> 00:37:37,904
He is...

560
00:37:40,362 --> 00:37:42,570
Perhaps most profoundly,

561
00:37:42,654 --> 00:37:45,403
I would say he's a healer.

562
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:47,945
He, he saves people's lives.

563
00:37:48,029 --> 00:37:50,945
He, he cures children
of cancer.

564
00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:55,278
His whole esteem is
inextricably bound up with that.

565
00:37:55,362 --> 00:37:57,945
Preserving human life.

566
00:37:58,029 --> 00:38:02,570
The idea that he would take one
is simply untenable.

567
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:04,987
You would
know as a psychologist

568
00:38:05,071 --> 00:38:07,236
that many law-abiding,

569
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,403
high-functioning people,
including doctors,

570
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:12,696
have the capacity to snap.

571
00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:18,029
I've never, ever
observed Jonathan

572
00:38:18,113 --> 00:38:19,612
to be violent.

573
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:26,570
Not even once.

574
00:38:26,654 --> 00:38:28,195
He is a gentle man.

575
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:30,737
He is a man of empathy.

576
00:38:34,821 --> 00:38:37,111
It is not within him

577
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:40,404
to do what he has
been accused of.

578
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,404
Thank you.

579
00:38:58,612 --> 00:39:00,445
You love him.

580
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:06,320
I do.

581
00:39:06,404 --> 00:39:09,237
Is there anyone you love more?

582
00:39:10,362 --> 00:39:11,945
My son.

583
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:14,862
- Henry.
- Yes. Yes, of course.

584
00:39:14,946 --> 00:39:17,653
I cannot imagine his ordeal.

585
00:39:17,737 --> 00:39:20,153
For a, a 12-year-old,

586
00:39:20,237 --> 00:39:23,029
to see his father
accused of murder,

587
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:24,904
I bet you wish you could just

588
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,737
wave a wand for Henry's sake.

589
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:29,070
Give his,
his father back to him.

590
00:39:29,154 --> 00:39:31,071
That's not what I'm doing here.

591
00:39:32,487 --> 00:39:34,904
Are you familiar
with the term

592
00:39:34,988 --> 00:39:37,403
confirmation bias?

593
00:39:37,487 --> 00:39:40,070
- Yes. Of course.
- What, what is it?

594
00:39:40,154 --> 00:39:43,153
It's, um...

595
00:39:43,237 --> 00:39:44,904
It's the tendency
to see things

596
00:39:44,988 --> 00:39:47,737
according to your own
preconceived notions.

597
00:39:47,821 --> 00:39:50,070
The defendant
is the love of your life.

598
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,987
He's the father of your child.

599
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:55,029
To see him as a murderer...

600
00:39:56,612 --> 00:39:59,070
My testimony has been truthful.

601
00:39:59,154 --> 00:40:00,779
Really?

602
00:40:00,863 --> 00:40:02,236
You testified that

603
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,153
you've never known
your husband to be violent.

604
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,111
That was truthful?

605
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:09,320
Yes.

606
00:40:10,612 --> 00:40:13,320
Has he ever grabbed you
by the neck?

607
00:40:16,863 --> 00:40:19,236
If you're referring, um,

608
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,278
if you're referring to the night
that he came to the beach house,

609
00:40:22,362 --> 00:40:23,737
that... - Yes,
that is the night.

610
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:27,153
I'm referring to the night
he broke into the beach house.

611
00:40:27,237 --> 00:40:29,987
Suddenly came up on you
from behind,

612
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:31,696
and grabbed you.

613
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:37,029
He wanted to talk to me,
and...

614
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:40,612
He put both his hands on me,

615
00:40:40,696 --> 00:40:43,904
and, and he, he wanted to
prevent me from yelling,

616
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:45,779
because he didn't
want to scare me,

617
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:48,070
and he didn't want to
scare my son,

618
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,653
who was sleeping upstairs.

619
00:40:49,737 --> 00:40:51,570
- And that's...
- But did you...

620
00:40:51,654 --> 00:40:54,320
Did you tell Detective Mendoza
that...

621
00:40:54,404 --> 00:40:57,487
you weren't sure
he wouldn't kill you?

622
00:41:02,737 --> 00:41:05,403
I mean, I was terrified
in the moment,

623
00:41:05,487 --> 00:41:06,737
and all of a sudden,

624
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:10,153
he was there, and...

625
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:12,236
I was startled.

626
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,945
So the
testimony you gave earlier,

627
00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:17,278
that your husband
could never be violent,

628
00:41:17,362 --> 00:41:18,612
that was incorrect.

629
00:41:18,696 --> 00:41:20,653
My senses were overwhelmed

630
00:41:20,737 --> 00:41:23,445
in the moment briefly by fear.

631
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:26,528
I quickly realized
I wasn't in any real danger.

632
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:28,820
You quickly realized that

633
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:32,320
before or after
you called 9-1-1?

634
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:39,361
<i>My name is Grace Fraser.</i>

635
00:41:39,445 --> 00:41:42,236
<i>My husband has just
broken in.</i>

636
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,445
<i>He's a fugitive.
He's wanted for murder.</i>

637
00:41:44,529 --> 00:41:48,195
<i>His name is Jonathan Fraser.
I'm at 361 Beachway,</i>

638
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:50,528
<i>Beachway Drive,
and I'm fucking terrified,</i>

639
00:41:50,612 --> 00:41:51,820
<i>and I need you to hurry.</i>

640
00:41:51,904 --> 00:41:53,445
<i>Get here quickly.</i>

641
00:41:53,529 --> 00:41:55,487
<i>Please.</i>

642
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:06,070
As I said, I was terrified.

643
00:42:06,154 --> 00:42:08,987
I was terrified in the moment.

644
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:10,779
I know my husband,

645
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:12,695
- and I know...
- You know his family?

646
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:14,111
- What?
- His family.

647
00:42:14,195 --> 00:42:17,695
His, uh, mom.
His dad. You know them?

648
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:19,113
Not well.

649
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,361
He's estranged from his family.

650
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:27,820
Estranged?

651
00:42:27,904 --> 00:42:30,278
Do you know why?

652
00:42:30,362 --> 00:42:32,029
There was an incident.

653
00:42:33,362 --> 00:42:35,029
What kind of incident?

654
00:42:40,696 --> 00:42:43,236
When Jonathan was 14,

655
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,361
he was babysitting
his four-year-old sister,

656
00:42:46,445 --> 00:42:47,779
and she somehow
got out of the house

657
00:42:47,863 --> 00:42:50,737
and she was struck
and killed by a car.

658
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:53,320
He was blamed by his parents.

659
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:57,570
And... and that's the
source of the estrangement?

660
00:42:59,237 --> 00:43:00,445
Yes.

661
00:43:00,529 --> 00:43:03,111
Uh, did you ever talk to
Jonathan's mother

662
00:43:03,195 --> 00:43:04,695
or father about this?

663
00:43:04,779 --> 00:43:06,278
I spoke to his mother.

664
00:43:06,362 --> 00:43:08,029
When?

665
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,195
Recently. About a week ago.

666
00:43:12,904 --> 00:43:14,320
And what did she tell you?

667
00:43:14,404 --> 00:43:15,779
Objection. Hearsay.

668
00:43:15,863 --> 00:43:17,653
Declaration against interest.

669
00:43:17,737 --> 00:43:19,320
I'll allow it.

670
00:43:21,195 --> 00:43:23,945
Please.
What did she tell you?

671
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:26,153
Mainly just that.
That, um...

672
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:28,153
That somehow,

673
00:43:28,237 --> 00:43:29,820
the sister got
out of the house,

674
00:43:29,904 --> 00:43:31,863
and then the...

675
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:36,237
The tragedy happened.

676
00:43:40,362 --> 00:43:42,862
Did she talk about
Jonathan's trauma?

677
00:43:42,946 --> 00:43:45,862
- Objection.
- Overruled.

678
00:43:45,946 --> 00:43:48,653
What did the
defendant's mother tell you

679
00:43:48,737 --> 00:43:51,153
regarding the,
the trauma he suffered

680
00:43:51,237 --> 00:43:54,320
as a result of
his sister's death?

681
00:43:54,404 --> 00:43:56,904
She said that he suffered...

682
00:43:58,654 --> 00:44:00,029
no trauma.

683
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:05,820
In fact,

684
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:07,820
she told you Jonathan suffered

685
00:44:07,904 --> 00:44:10,987
from neither guilt nor grief.

686
00:44:11,071 --> 00:44:12,361
Isn't that correct?

687
00:44:12,445 --> 00:44:13,653
Objection!
This is hearsay.

688
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:15,449
It's a
declaration against interest.

689
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:16,570
She's his mother, and...

690
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,153
There's been no showing
of any support...

691
00:44:18,237 --> 00:44:20,987
And also offering to impeach.
This witness testified under oath

692
00:44:21,071 --> 00:44:23,570
that she knows the defendant
to be a person of empathy,

693
00:44:23,654 --> 00:44:24,987
when she has reason...

694
00:44:25,071 --> 00:44:25,987
Your Honor!

695
00:44:26,071 --> 00:44:28,385
The objection is noted
and overruled.

696
00:44:31,779 --> 00:44:33,065
Yes or no?

697
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,862
The defendant's mother
told you

698
00:44:34,946 --> 00:44:38,026
that Jonathan suffered
neither guilt nor grief

699
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,776
in reaction to his
four-year-old sister's death.

700
00:44:45,154 --> 00:44:47,174
Please answer the question,
doctor.

701
00:44:48,003 --> 00:44:49,460
Yes.

702
00:44:50,766 --> 00:44:52,346
No grief?

703
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:55,705
She kept waiting for it, but...

704
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,904
She said they surrounded him
with family support.

705
00:45:00,988 --> 00:45:03,445
That they...

706
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:06,111
That they were certain
once the shock wore off

707
00:45:06,196 --> 00:45:09,646
the suffering would begin.
But it didn't. It never came.

708
00:45:11,696 --> 00:45:14,154
Did she say anything else?

709
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:18,278
Uh...

710
00:45:18,362 --> 00:45:19,904
It's just her opinion.

711
00:45:19,988 --> 00:45:21,653
It's not necessarily what...

712
00:45:21,737 --> 00:45:23,403
We can regard it as such.

713
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,154
Please answer the question.

714
00:45:26,863 --> 00:45:28,862
What else did she say?

715
00:45:28,946 --> 00:45:30,320
She said...

716
00:45:32,404 --> 00:45:35,570
that it's her belief

717
00:45:35,654 --> 00:45:37,529
that Jonathan...

718
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,612
doesn't know how to suffer.

719
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:46,236
That he's not capable
of remorse.

720
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,863
Or contrition.

721
00:46:04,029 --> 00:46:06,737
Ever tell anyone that
you believed your husband

722
00:46:06,821 --> 00:46:09,528
to suffer from narcissistic
personality disorder?

723
00:46:09,612 --> 00:46:11,445
- Your Honor, objection!
- Overruled.

724
00:46:11,529 --> 00:46:13,153
Your Honor,
in addition to being prejudicial,

725
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,612
- this is irrelevant.
- It goes to impeach.

726
00:46:15,696 --> 00:46:18,445
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but this witness took the stand

727
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:20,945
to vouch for the defendant,
for his innocence.

728
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:23,612
When in fact,
she can vouch for neither.

729
00:46:23,696 --> 00:46:25,570
- Objection!
- Overruled.

730
00:46:25,654 --> 00:46:27,862
Sit down, Ms. Fitzgerald.

731
00:46:27,946 --> 00:46:31,320
Eyes to me,
doctor. Eyes to me.

732
00:46:31,404 --> 00:46:34,987
You told your friend,
Sylvia Steinetz,

733
00:46:35,071 --> 00:46:37,320
that you believed
your husband suffered

734
00:46:37,404 --> 00:46:40,695
from narcissistic
personality disorder.

735
00:46:40,779 --> 00:46:42,820
It wasn't a professional
diagnosis.

736
00:46:42,904 --> 00:46:44,653
But your opinion,

737
00:46:44,737 --> 00:46:46,653
as his wife.

738
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:50,071
As a clinical psychologist.

739
00:46:52,904 --> 00:46:54,862
What are the traits

740
00:46:54,946 --> 00:46:57,779
of narcissistic
personality disorder?

741
00:46:58,571 --> 00:47:00,445
Grandiosity, mostly.

742
00:47:05,737 --> 00:47:07,404
What else?

743
00:47:11,154 --> 00:47:12,904
Lack of empathy.

744
00:47:14,529 --> 00:47:17,945
So your testimony that you
knew him to be a man of empathy,

745
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:19,862
that was a lie.

746
00:47:19,946 --> 00:47:21,563
One you told us.

747
00:47:22,951 --> 00:47:25,659
And one you told yourself.

748
00:47:26,063 --> 00:47:27,404
Wasn't it?

749
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,862
- I don't know what you mean by that.
- Really?

750
00:47:32,946 --> 00:47:35,528
Doctor, in your practice,

751
00:47:35,612 --> 00:47:38,029
do you not tell patients
that sometimes

752
00:47:38,113 --> 00:47:41,862
they so want to believe
in their partners that they...

753
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:44,904
They choose to un-know things.

754
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:47,361
Un-see things.

755
00:47:47,445 --> 00:47:49,570
That sometimes the truth

756
00:47:49,654 --> 00:47:52,111
of who and what they married

757
00:47:52,195 --> 00:47:55,612
gets distorted by
the desperation

758
00:47:55,696 --> 00:47:58,821
of what they want
to be married to.

759
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:03,487
That, that's a real phenomenon.

760
00:48:03,571 --> 00:48:05,904
Isn't it, Dr. Fraser?

761
00:48:05,988 --> 00:48:09,111
People being blind to
the reality of their spouses.

762
00:48:09,195 --> 00:48:12,779
You tell your patients that
all the time. Don't you?

763
00:48:17,154 --> 00:48:19,654
I know who and what I married.

764
00:48:29,612 --> 00:48:31,279
Yes.

765
00:48:32,362 --> 00:48:35,278
Yes, I think you do.

766
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:37,612
Your Honor,
I move for a mistrial.

767
00:48:37,696 --> 00:48:39,070
This is hearsay.

768
00:48:39,154 --> 00:48:41,487
It's prejudicial
beyond the pale.

769
00:48:41,571 --> 00:48:43,695
It's unfair surprise
and outrageous!

770
00:48:43,779 --> 00:48:45,445
If she
were a prosecution witness,

771
00:48:45,529 --> 00:48:47,445
I might go for that.
But she's not.

772
00:48:47,529 --> 00:48:48,904
She's a defense witness.

773
00:48:48,988 --> 00:48:51,528
You put her up there. The
damage done here was done by you.

774
00:48:51,612 --> 00:48:53,236
- You should know...
- Dr. Fraser, take your seat, please.

775
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,029
...that most of what has been
said in the last 10 minutes

776
00:48:55,113 --> 00:48:57,529
- is a lie!
- Take your seat.

777
00:49:04,863 --> 00:49:06,571
You may step down now.

778
00:49:30,988 --> 00:49:33,113
I so love you, Grace.

779
00:49:35,779 --> 00:49:37,362
Grace?

780
00:49:38,113 --> 00:49:39,237
Grace.

781
00:49:45,904 --> 00:49:47,487
Well done, Haley.
Well done.

782
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:50,528
She fucked us. She fucked us.

783
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,403
We'll move for a mistrial.

784
00:49:52,487 --> 00:49:54,153
You won't.
You tried that just now,

785
00:49:54,237 --> 00:49:55,695
and he shut you down.
It's over.

786
00:49:55,779 --> 00:49:57,487
- She fucked us.
- Jonathan...

787
00:49:57,571 --> 00:50:00,113
- And you let it happen.
- I let it happen?

788
00:50:01,737 --> 00:50:04,528
Jonathan, she was with you.

789
00:50:04,612 --> 00:50:06,987
She was in your camp.

790
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:08,654
And you lost her.

791
00:50:10,071 --> 00:50:13,862
Because you didn't
get rid of the fucking hammer.

792
00:50:13,946 --> 00:50:15,487
You hear that?

793
00:50:15,571 --> 00:50:19,195
You didn't get rid of
the fucking hammer.

794
00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:21,779
How stupid can you get?

795
00:50:41,195 --> 00:50:43,528
<i>She
absolutely did it on purpose.</i>

796
00:50:43,612 --> 00:50:45,820
<i>She was in cahoots
with the prosecution.</i>

797
00:50:45,904 --> 00:50:47,737
<i>If the
prosecutor had called her,</i>

798
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:50,570
<i>the defense could have shut
her down on spousal privilege.</i>

799
00:50:50,654 --> 00:50:52,820
<i>But because the defense
called Grace Fraser,</i>

800
00:50:52,904 --> 00:50:54,236
<i>the privilege
was deemed waived.</i>

801
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,612
<i>And she became fair
game to impeach. Brilliant.</i>

802
00:50:57,696 --> 00:51:00,653
<i>The bombshell she dropped...</i>

803
00:51:03,237 --> 00:51:04,904
She took him down on purpose.

804
00:51:04,988 --> 00:51:07,403
What'd you
want her to do? Lie?

805
00:51:07,487 --> 00:51:11,737
She could always have
turned over the hammer.

806
00:51:11,821 --> 00:51:13,904
But that would have
taken you down.

807
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:17,236
Goodbye, Reardon.
Hello, juvenile hall.

808
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:21,904
You got a text.

809
00:51:21,988 --> 00:51:25,279
The morality lesson
is suspended.

810
00:53:05,779 --> 00:53:07,528
<i>Bad news for gamblers.</i>

811
00:53:07,612 --> 00:53:09,153
<i>The oddsmakers
in Las Vegas</i>

812
00:53:09,237 --> 00:53:11,029
<i>have suspended
any further betting</i>

813
00:53:11,113 --> 00:53:12,361
<i>on the trial's outcome,</i>

814
00:53:12,445 --> 00:53:16,695
<i>as Dr. Fraser's conviction
seems all but assured.</i>

815
00:54:13,696 --> 00:54:15,278
Where's Jonathan?

816
00:54:15,362 --> 00:54:17,153
- Hmm?
- He's not here.

817
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:19,236
He's not answering my calls.
Have you heard from him?

818
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,361
Of
Course I haven't heard from him.

819
00:54:22,445 --> 00:54:24,737
That son of a bitch.
I warned him,

820
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:26,904
but... -Henry didn't
show up at school.

821
00:54:26,988 --> 00:54:29,071
Didn't show up at school?

822
00:54:31,029 --> 00:54:32,988
Get the police, Haley.

823
00:54:36,529 --> 00:54:38,071
Oh, darling.

824
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,278
<i>Dad,
are we really going for breakfast?</i>

825
00:54:47,571 --> 00:54:49,029
Give me the phone.

826
00:54:49,571 --> 00:54:51,612
Thanks.

827
00:54:51,696 --> 00:54:54,945
The look on
your face is brilliant.

828
00:54:55,029 --> 00:54:58,445
It's going off though.

829
00:54:58,529 --> 00:55:00,863
Try to stay calm.

830
00:55:04,612 --> 00:55:06,361
<i>You can't do this, Dad.</i>

831
00:55:06,445 --> 00:55:09,320
I'm not really doing anything,
am I?

832
00:55:09,404 --> 00:55:11,153
Going for a drive with my son?

833
00:55:16,696 --> 00:55:18,571
<i>Your wife.</i>

834
00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:22,737
She's great.

835
00:55:22,821 --> 00:55:25,237
She's been so kind to me,
you know?

836
00:55:26,404 --> 00:55:29,862
I think we had
a real connection.

837
00:55:29,946 --> 00:55:31,695
We're having tea tomorrow,

838
00:55:31,779 --> 00:55:34,737
with the kids, I think.

839
00:55:34,821 --> 00:55:37,445
Henry could be great
for Miguel.

840
00:55:38,487 --> 00:55:40,821
<i>Like an older brother.</i>

841
00:55:44,612 --> 00:55:47,571
You stay away from my family.

842
00:55:49,113 --> 00:55:51,487
If you go anywhere
near my family again,

843
00:55:51,571 --> 00:55:54,195
either my wife, or my son,

844
00:55:54,279 --> 00:55:56,236
I will hurt you.

845
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,695
- I will fucking hurt you.
- You will never hurt me.

846
00:55:59,779 --> 00:56:02,988
And you will never leave me,
Jonathan.

847
00:56:07,362 --> 00:56:09,528
So go on, then.
How's Rosenbaum?

848
00:56:09,612 --> 00:56:10,779
How's his bum?

849
00:56:15,154 --> 00:56:17,320
<i>The New
York State Special Victims Unit</i>

850
00:56:17,404 --> 00:56:20,862
has issued an Amber Alert
for 12-year-old Henry Fraser.

851
00:56:20,946 --> 00:56:23,570
Five-feet, one-inch tall,
110 pounds.

852
00:56:23,654 --> 00:56:26,029
<i>He's Caucasian,
with dark brown hair.</i>

853
00:56:26,113 --> 00:56:28,070
<i>Was last seen wearing
a school uniform...</i>

854
00:56:28,154 --> 00:56:30,153
<i>- Gray pants, blue blazer.
- Let's go, Billy.</i>

855
00:56:30,237 --> 00:56:32,070
<i>We're
looking for a late model</i>

856
00:56:32,154 --> 00:56:33,612
<i>gray Range Rover.</i>

857
00:56:33,696 --> 00:56:35,737
Vehicle was recorded
exiting the island of Manhattan

858
00:56:35,821 --> 00:56:37,570
<i>along the
Henry Hudson Parkway.</i>

859
00:56:37,654 --> 00:56:40,320
<i>We have reason to believe that
vehicle's headed for the Canadian border.</i>

860
00:56:40,404 --> 00:56:42,361
<i>We've requested
interstate activation,</i>

861
00:56:42,445 --> 00:56:44,320
<i>and have notified
Canadian border services.</i>

862
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:47,487
<i>Dr. Jonathan Fraser should be
considered armed,</i>

863
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:48,779
<i>and extremely dangerous.</i>

864

866
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:58,654
Can you just tell me
where we're going, please?

867
00:56:59,571 --> 00:57:01,153
Not sure.

868
00:57:01,237 --> 00:57:03,320
I'm not sure, mate.
It's a...

869
00:57:03,404 --> 00:57:04,779
It's a magical
mystery tour.

870
00:57:04,863 --> 00:57:06,904
It's the long-promised
road trip two.

871
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:09,278
I just thought, you know,
that it'd be our last chance to do it.

872
00:57:09,362 --> 00:57:10,737
Dad, come on.

873
00:57:10,821 --> 00:57:12,445
We can't go on
a road trip right now.

874
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:14,320
Come on, come on, come on,
come on. Sit back. Relax.

875
00:57:14,404 --> 00:57:15,779
Enjoy yourself.
Sing a song.

876
00:57:15,863 --> 00:57:17,528
What's that song you used
to sing when you were little?

877
00:57:17,612 --> 00:57:19,528

00:57:36,362 --> 00:57:38,111

00:57:38,195 --> 00:57:39,945

I just left you.

898
00:58:16,612 --> 00:58:20,195
The police got him
on 202. They're ten miles out.

899
00:58:23,612 --> 00:58:26,278
<i>Right. I say,
it is very nearly</i>

900
00:58:26,362 --> 00:58:29,236
- fried clam o'clock.
- Fried clams?

901
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,278
But not fried clams as you know them,
Earthling.

902
00:58:32,362 --> 00:58:36,320
These are the fried clams
from the great Bollie's of Albany.

903
00:58:36,404 --> 00:58:38,570
The best fried clams
in the universe.

904
00:58:38,654 --> 00:58:42,029
Dad, we can't go get
fried clams.

905
00:58:42,113 --> 00:58:43,820
You need to pull over
and let me out.

906
00:58:43,904 --> 00:58:47,029
They're Ipswich clams as well,
which means they're big, fat bastards,

907
00:58:47,113 --> 00:58:49,029
- as any self-respecting clam should be.
- Dad!

908
00:58:49,113 --> 00:58:51,445
- Jesus!
- So why don't we just do this?

909
00:58:59,654 --> 00:59:01,071
Sorry.

910
00:59:02,113 --> 00:59:03,904
See, that can happen.

911
00:59:03,988 --> 00:59:07,278
That can happen.
We can just...

912
00:59:07,362 --> 00:59:09,320
lose ourselves sometimes.

913
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,320
We become...

914
00:59:13,404 --> 00:59:16,070
you know, other.

915
00:59:16,154 --> 00:59:19,988
Could be panic,
or anger, or...

916
00:59:21,071 --> 00:59:22,988
Or love, sometimes.

917
00:59:24,529 --> 00:59:26,154
We lose ourselves.

918
00:59:29,445 --> 00:59:32,236
But it doesn't undo
who we are in our entirety.

919
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,779
You should know that.

920
00:59:35,821 --> 00:59:37,279
You got that?

921
00:59:42,029 --> 00:59:44,195
So they're gonna say that

922
00:59:44,279 --> 00:59:46,320
this is my legacy,

923
00:59:46,404 --> 00:59:48,445
and they can go fuck themselves,

924
00:59:48,529 --> 00:59:49,612
be... sorry...

925
00:59:49,696 --> 00:59:54,070
Because it's not my legacy.
My legacy...

926
00:59:54,154 --> 00:59:55,945
is you.

927
00:59:56,029 --> 00:59:59,029
And my patients,
and your mum.

928
01:00:00,779 --> 01:00:01,863
Yeah?

929
01:00:02,737 --> 01:00:06,237
You murdered a person, Dad.

930
01:00:26,571 --> 01:00:28,445
Really? Yeah?

931
01:00:28,529 --> 01:00:30,487
Yeah?

932
01:00:37,946 --> 01:00:39,113
Please.

933
01:01:03,779 --> 01:01:07,404
You murdered a person.

934
01:01:09,529 --> 01:01:11,154
Not the real me.

935
01:01:16,612 --> 01:01:18,445
Not the Dad you know.

936
01:01:34,696 --> 01:01:37,612
It's all right. It's
all right. It's okay.

937
01:01:37,696 --> 01:01:39,195
Dad, stop!

938
01:01:44,029 --> 01:01:45,737
- Dad, stop!
- Yeah, in a minute.

939
01:01:45,821 --> 01:01:47,029
- Stop the car.
- In a minute.

940
01:01:47,113 --> 01:01:49,111
I want every last second
with you, my friend.

941
01:01:49,195 --> 01:01:51,153
You have to stop.
You have to pull over

942
01:01:51,237 --> 01:01:52,821
and let me out, Dad.

943
01:01:54,946 --> 01:01:57,070
- Dad, please. Please.
- Every last second.

944
01:01:57,154 --> 01:01:59,195
Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em!

945
01:02:06,654 --> 01:02:07,987
Dad, come on.

946
01:02:08,071 --> 01:02:09,779
- Come on, you can't do this.
- This is nothing to be scared of.

947
01:02:09,863 --> 01:02:12,023
- It's gonna make it worse.
- Nothing to be... Shut up!

948
01:02:15,113 --> 01:02:17,029
Just please. Just let me out.

949
01:02:17,113 --> 01:02:18,445
Please.

950
01:02:42,863 --> 01:02:44,695
Well, there it is.
Dead ahead.

951
01:02:44,779 --> 01:02:48,029
That, my friend,
is the Wurts Street Bridge.

952
01:02:48,113 --> 01:02:51,278
Once a thing of
majestic beauty. Now...

953
01:02:51,362 --> 01:02:53,236
not so much, huh?

954
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,111
What does that remind you of?

955
01:02:55,195 --> 01:02:56,612
Dad.

956
01:02:56,696 --> 01:02:58,654
The light is red, Dad.

957
01:03:00,071 --> 01:03:02,904
Dad, it's a red light.
Dad. Dad!

958
01:03:04,696 --> 01:03:06,029
Dad!

959
01:03:09,195 --> 01:03:13,278
Please don't hurt my son.
Please don't hurt my son.

960
01:03:13,362 --> 01:03:15,863
Dad, what the fuck
are you doing?

961
01:03:16,821 --> 01:03:18,653
- So remember.
- Dad.

962
01:03:18,737 --> 01:03:20,653
- It's you, my patients, and your mum.
- Dad. Dad!

963
01:03:20,737 --> 01:03:23,153
- That's my legacy. What's my legacy?
- Dad!

964
01:03:23,237 --> 01:03:26,487
Get back in the lane!

965
01:03:26,571 --> 01:03:29,445
We gotta get down there.
Can you land this thing? Land it.

966
01:03:29,529 --> 01:03:33,071
Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad!

967
01:03:33,904 --> 01:03:34,737
Dad!

968
01:03:34,821 --> 01:03:36,820
Dad! Dad!

969
01:03:36,904 --> 01:03:38,820
Dad, no! No! No!

970
01:03:38,904 --> 01:03:40,528
Dad, don't do this!

971
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:41,820
- Dad!
- No!

972
01:03:41,904 --> 01:03:43,403
- Don't run from it!
- No!

973
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:45,528
Don't run from it!

974
01:03:45,612 --> 01:03:48,445
Just get back in the car.

975
01:03:48,529 --> 01:03:50,653
Can I get out?
Can I open the door?

976
01:03:50,737 --> 01:03:52,153
Get out,
get out. Open the door!

977
01:03:52,237 --> 01:03:54,029
No! Stop!

978
01:03:55,237 --> 01:03:56,487
Dad!

979
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:57,820
Jonathan, no!

980
01:03:57,904 --> 01:03:58,904
- Ma'am, you can't go...
- Stop!

981
01:03:58,988 --> 01:04:00,695
- You can't go through.
- Stop!

982
01:04:00,779 --> 01:04:02,278
- I love you.
- Jonathan!

983
01:04:02,362 --> 01:04:04,445
Henry. Stop!

984
01:04:07,113 --> 01:04:08,571
Henry!

985
01:04:10,362 --> 01:04:11,821
Please!

986
01:04:12,779 --> 01:04:15,237
<i>Henry, I'm coming!</i>

987
01:04:19,696 --> 01:04:21,113
<i>Stop!</i>

988
01:04:24,404 --> 01:04:26,987
Stop! Look at me!

989
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,570
Jonathan, no!

990
01:04:28,654 --> 01:04:31,279
Henry! Jonathan!

991
01:04:33,362 --> 01:04:35,029
Henry!

992
01:04:35,113 --> 01:04:36,654
Jonathan!

993
01:04:37,529 --> 01:04:39,528
Henry!

994
01:04:39,612 --> 01:04:41,445
- It's all right.
- Henry.

995
01:04:41,529 --> 01:04:43,236
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

996
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:46,403
Grace, I'm sorry.

997
01:04:46,487 --> 01:04:48,278
I'm sorry.

998
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:49,820
Grace, come here.

999
01:04:49,904 --> 01:04:52,113
Come here.
Give me a hug. Grace!

1000
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,654
Henry!

1001
01:04:58,988 --> 01:05:01,320
- Run.
- Grace!

1002
01:05:01,404 --> 01:05:02,654
Henry!

1003
01:05:04,654 --> 01:05:05,695
Grace!

1004
01:05:38,487 --> 01:05:41,029
All right,
Henry. Ready to go, ma'am?

1004
01:05:42,305 --> 01:06:42,460

00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:49,083
Okay.

162
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:53,834
Bailiff: ALL RISE.

163
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,625
The criminal court of the city
of New York is now in session.

164
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:00,667
The Honorable
Layla Scott presiding.

165
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,667
Please be seated.

166
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,166
I have allowed television
cameras into this room

167
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,583
for today only.

168
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,041
I am making a public
interest exception,

169
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:13,458
pursuant to my authority
under local civil rule 1.8.

170
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:17,333
However, however,
this courtroom will not become a circus.

171
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:20,333
I don't want to see
anybody talking on phones,

172
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,792
Snapchatting, Instagramming,

173
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,792
or any of the other
social media nonsense.

174
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,291
We're going to call the case,
bring in the defendant,

175
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,375
arraign him in accordance
with the duly-promulgated

176
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,333
rules of procedure
of this courtroom.

177
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:34,625
I hope I have made
myself abundantly clear.

178
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,810
- Go ahead.
- (camera shutters clicking, spectators chattering)

179
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:40,709
Bailiff: (clears throat)
Docket number 62333.

180
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:44,208
The People of the State of New
York versus Jonathan Fraser.

181
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,875
Count one: murder
in the first degree.

182
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,625
Count two: aggravated rape.

183
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,935
Robert Adelman: Robert Adelman
for the defendant, your honor.

184
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,917
At this time,
we'll waive reading of the charges,

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,250
and enter a plea of
not guilty for all charges.

186
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,417
- We also ask...
- Catherine Stamper for the people, your honor.

187
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,041
We oppose bail.

188
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,375
This was a heinous
and violent crime...

189
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,250
Adelman: My client has
long-standing roots in the community...

190
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,601
Catherine Stamper: The defendant
has already demonstrated himself

191
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,976
- to be a flight risk. He fled the jurisdiction.
- Cures cancer, no record.

192
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,917
Not so much as a parking ticket.

193
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,667
Well,
murder and rape. He hit the ground running.

194
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,417
Objection. Ask for sanctions.

195
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,083
(camera shutters clicking)

196
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,250
Ten million bond,
two million cash.

197
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,667
(spectators exclaiming)

198
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,750
Judge Scott: Take the
defendant back into custody.

199
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:29,559
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

200
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,875
Next case.

201
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,768
- Bailiff: Docket number 62432.
- (commotion, chattering)

202
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:36,542
People of the State of New
York versus Matthew Tinker.

203
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,792
(spectators clamoring)

204
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,500
(sighs heavily)

205
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,709
(door closes)

206
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,208
Henry: He looks scared.

207
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,500
Dad.

208
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,291
- (metal rattling)
- (door slams)

209
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,750
(lock clicks)

210
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,250
(commotion, yelling)

211
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,625
Guard: Straight ahead. Let's go!

212
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,041
Inmate: Yeah,
hey. I'm gonna fuck you up!

213
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:02,917
(door slams)

214
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,250
(inmates yelling)

215
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,709
How are we doing?

216
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:13,333
- (door slams) - It's been nearly a week,
so...

217
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,333
Adelman: Yeah,
I'm sorry about that.

218
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:17,417
- (pen clicking) -
First things first.

219
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,542
Don't be talking
to nobody in here.

220
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,375
The franchise is populated with
reprobates looking to improve their plight.

221
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,583
Any information they
can glean from you,

222
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,875
might reap dividends.
And not to you.

223
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,799
Well,
I would only tell them that I'm innocent.

224
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:34,125
Innocent is good.
Saying nothing is better.

225
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:39,208
So, can you get me out of here?

226
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,458
With money for bail, yes.

227
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:45,000
With,
with my persuasive skills...

228
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,417
More of a challenge.

229
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,041
Now, you own your own home?

230
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,959
The one in the fancy
building I seen on the news?

231
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,000
I own it jointly with my wife.

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,125
Ah.

233
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,709
I am innocent.

234
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:06,375
- (bangs fist) - Do you care?

235
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,625
Not really.

236
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,417
Truth be told,

237
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,750
I prefer my clients guilty.

238
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,333
Takes the pressure off.

239
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,083
I should say,
having read the police report,

240
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,834
I would be very surprised
if you were innocent.

241
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:25,542
In fact, it'd be difficult for an
innocent man to present more guilty.

242
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,083
Unless, of course,
he was stupid, which...

243
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,041
I'm figuring you're not
since you cure cancer and all.

244
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,375
Back to me, please.

245
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,917
You know, I should say up
front that in my experience,

246
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,125
doctors tend to be assholes.

247
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,417
The reason they
tend to be assholes

248
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,250
is because they get
to be. They're doctors.

249
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,917
My point is,

250
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,375
you don't get to be one anymore.

251
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,625
I would be very grateful
if you could arrange

252
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,542
for me to see my wife.

253
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,417
- (horn honks) - (dog barks)

254

♪

255
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,125
Dr. Fraser.

256
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,166
Thanks for coming. I'm, uh,
Robert. Robert Adelman.

257
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,667
- Nice to meet you. - Please.

258
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,291
This all must be a terrible
hardship for you and all, so...

259
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,583
My, uh, my sympathies on that.

260
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,458
Server: Hi. Can I
get you anything?

261
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:01,125
Um, no. I'm fine. Thank you.

262
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,125
Your husband seems

263
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,750
pretty convinced that you would

264
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:09,834
vouch for his innocence.

265
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,291
I won't.

266
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,959
I can't.

267
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,250
Uh, okay, then.

268
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,000
You strike me as a
wife suffering from PTB.

269
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:29,375
Excuse me?

270
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,083
- Post-Traumatic Betrayal. - Oh.

271
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,542
- I kind of, I kind of coined it myself.
- Yes.

272
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,208
- So, it's not a real disorder.
- No.

273
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,709
It means a fucked-over person,

274
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:41,041
in the immediate aftermath
of being fucked over,

275
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,000
often believes the fucker-overer

276
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,709
to be capable of anything.

277
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:46,959
Including murder.

278
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,792
So, my question to you,

279
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,875
um, before you got wind of
the fact that he was unfaithful,

280
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:54,375
your pre-fucked-over
impression of him.

281
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,250
Did he strike you as a
person capable of committing

282
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,208
this kind of mayhem?

283
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,750
If he did,
do you think I'd be married to him?

284
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,583
My, uh,
my specialty is reading people.

285
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:09,667
It's the best tool
in my kit. I just...

286
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,792
Getting a feel for a person.

287
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,959
I'm thinking your
husband is a bit of a dick.

288
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:22,417
But not a killer.

289
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,583
And what do you think?

290
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,208
I don't know what I think.

291
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,917
(dish clinks)

292
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,500

Franklin: I WOULDN'T GO ANYWHERE
NEAR THE SON OF A BITCH.

294
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,792
Don't tell me
you're considering it.

295
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,208
I feel like I owe it to Henry.

296
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,500
To allow for his father
to be innocent. Don't I?

297
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,083
No, you do not.

298
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,834
I just need to get a
semblance of the truth.

299
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:12,041
What makes you think you
will get the truth from him?

300
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:18,625
(vehicle approaching)

301
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,041

(sobs)

304
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,750
You think he did it, don't you?

305
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,959
(whispers): No, baby.

306
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,125
No, no.

307
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,500
No.

308
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:04,834
(sobbing)

309
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,834
No. Henry, Henry.

310
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,792
(whispers): It'll be all right,
Henry.

- (commotion, chattering) - Oh.

312
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,709
Reporter: She's coming out.

313
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,917
- Did you know, did you know...
- (all clamoring)

314
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,500
Reporter 2: Is he guilty?

315
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,500
Reporter 3: How do you
feel about the betrayal?

316
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,959
Reporter 4: Did he do it?

317
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,667
(loud clamoring)

318
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,542
(inhales slowly, exhales)

00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,834

Look, I don't know what the
purpose of this conversation is,

00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:53,166
but you wanted me
to come and I'm here.

Well, it's, it's not to convince

Or a good father.

You didn't just do this to
me. You did this to your son.

00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,834
You have a daughter.

Fuck.

Look, I...

343
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,417
I spoke about Elena,

344
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,792
uh,
being obsessed with me. Yeah?

345
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,291
She was.

346
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,792
She was not a well person.

347
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,375
Grace, you have to help me.

348
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:47,458
The whole world
thinks I did this.

349
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:51,667
My only chance is for people
who know me to come forward.

350
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,250
To help you? You actually
think I'm gonna help you?

00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,917
You know my heart.
You know my heart.

I, I understand that you
can no longer trust me to be

353
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,583
the man you thought
I was. I get that.

354
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:05,625
But you certainly know that I
would never take a human life.

355
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:07,208
You know that.

356
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,208
I don't know anything.

357
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,125
My heart wouldn't allow it.

358
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,375
Nor would my ego. You know...

359
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,542
I didn't...

360
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,041
I didn't do it.

361
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,834

and my transgressions...

Can you bring him? Please,
bring him.

366
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,375
He's gotta hear from me.

367
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,041

PERFECT. AND BACK AGAIN.

371
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,792
VERY GOOD.

372
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,475
Um,
which other animals have funny walks?

373
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,375
The batfish, uh,
body like a tennis racket.

374
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:14,976
THEY USE THEIR FLAP-LIKE FINS FOR
WALKING SLOWLY ON THE SEA BED.

375
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,458
So,
it's this. (makes flapping noise)

376
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:19,959
Yeah. Perfect.

Thank you. Thank you.

00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,667
I appreciate it.

382
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,208
I appreciate you
taking the time.

383
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:47,834
I'm really not
comfortable with this.

384
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:49,351
- No, I understand...
- I, I signed a,

385
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,375
a confidentiality agreement,

386
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:54,375
and, uh,
I'm risking my job even talking to you.

387
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:55,917
You're...

388
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,333
You're a good friend to
him. You are. You were.

389
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:02,125
If you're expecting me to
actually help him at this point,

390
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,768
- that after everything that just...
- No.

391
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:05,083
I would never expect that.

392
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:07,333
If, if he were guilty.

393
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:09,208
- Which he is.
- And if he's not?

394
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,250
(scoffs) Come on, Grace.

395
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,750
He's not who we thought he was.

396
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:14,309
I think we can at
least acknowledge that.

397
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:18,166
What do you know about
the victim? Elena Alves?

398
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,000
(indistinct chatter)

399
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,917
I know she had a son.

400
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,834
A seven-year-old boy
with a Wilms' tumor.

401
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,333
Jonathan was his doctor.

402
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,208
They weren't discreet.

403
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,583
They weren't even trying to be.

404
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,709
He got warnings.
Didn't seem to matter.

405
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:41,750
He wanted her,
and he was willing to risk everything.

406
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,375
Which he clearly did.

407
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,834
Well,
he says that she wasn't well.

408
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:48,959
- He says that she was obsessed with him and that she was...
- (scoffs)

409
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,792
- I wouldn't know.
- If she was the obsessive-compulsive type...

410
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,309
- Yeah, then, then what?
- ...and I, I admit,

411
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,333
- I'm, I'm clutching at straws here.
- Grace,

412
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:57,458
- Jonathan cultivated it.
- I... Plea...

413
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,709
People becoming
obsessed with him? He...

414
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,500
He fed off that.

415
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:02,792
His patients loved him.

416
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,518
The parents, of course,
the parents worshiped him.

417
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,166
He was saving their children.

418
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,208
- He thrived on being the center of intense emotion...
- That's...

419
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:14,000
In a very narcissistic
and unhealthy way.

420
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,458
It's like he never got
the God complex memo.

421
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:18,142
- In fact, actually,
sometimes I think -I...

422
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:20,083
It wasn't even about the,
the patient.

423
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:21,709
It was about the
emotion coming at him.

424
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:24,500
He cared about
his patients. He did.

425
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,291
- I saw it. - Yeah. Maybe.

426
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:29,291
- I did. He cried for them. He would...
- Yeah. Maybe.

427
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,518
- Yes!
- They say psychopaths can't work in a hospital.

428
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:34,208
Psychopaths? He's
not a psychopath.

429

(indistinct chatter)

431
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,250
Hey.

432
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:12,375
Did you see Jonathan?

433
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,333
- Yeah. - How was it?

434
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,333
- I'll tell you later.
- Yeah, of course. Sorry.

435
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:38,125
It's called hero worship.

436
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:40,291
Excuse me?

437
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,875
People falling in
love with their saviors.

438
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:47,792
It's mostly a woman
who is affected and...

439
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:51,208
the objects of the
delusion are doctors.

440
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:53,125
Firefighters. Policemen.

441
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,291
(fire crackling)

442
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:58,709
- It's also called rescue romance syndrome.
- (chuckles)

443
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:01,458
- Sounds like a load of crap.
- Well, it isn't.

444
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:03,542
What has it got to
do with anything?

445
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:07,166
She fell in love with the
doctor who saved her kid's life.

446
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,291
What has that got to
do with him killing her?

447
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:12,125
According to Jonathan,
she took it to extremes.

448
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,458
And?

449
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:18,208
Crazy people do crazy things.

450
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,166
Are you serious?

451
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:26,333
Are you now believing
that Jonathan is innocent?

452
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,709
I'm just open to the idea.

453
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,166
(scoffs)

454
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,542
And are you open to the idea

455
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,333
of you and Jonathan
getting back together?

456
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:43,000
No. Of course not. Don't
be ridiculous. It's your move.

457
00:29:43,709 --> 00:29:44,875
Mm.

458
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,250
He came to me for money.

459
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:59,583
(softy): Excuse me?

460
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:03,125
He said you were worried about
paying for Reardon this year.

461
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:05,458
That you thought you
might have to take Henry out.

462
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:08,208
- That's not true.
- Yeah, I know.

463
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,625
I told him it would not
be in Reardon's best

464
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,959
economic interest to lose Henry.

465
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:15,834
And he said, yeah,
but you were worried about finances overall

466
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:18,417
and that you would never
come to speak to me about it.

467
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,875
And I knew that to be true,

468
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:22,875
so that when he asked me
not to say anything to you...

469
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,959
(Grace sighs)

470
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,041
(exhales)

471
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,917
How much did you give him?

472
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,583
$500,000.

473
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:47,834
But I, I,
I thought I was helping you and Henry.

474
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:51,000
(stammers) I mean,
I know how private you are, Grace.

475
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,792
I knew that you
would not come to me.

476
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:56,583
I mean, I was actually
grateful to that son of a bitch.

477
00:30:56,667 --> 00:31:00,291
I even thanked him for
giving me the opportunity to...

478
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,166
(stammers) I'm...

479
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:10,917
I am so sorry.

480
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:14,542

00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,583
So you don't love Mom anymore.

530
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,333
Yeah, of course I do.

531
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,750
I love her and you
more than anything.

532
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:33,667
And I always will.

533
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:35,458
I fucked up.

534
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:38,875
I made a terrible,
terrible mistake.

535
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,166
I, um, allowed myself to be,
uh, persuaded

536
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,542
that a person
desperately needed me

537
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,917
because her child was very sick,

538
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,625
and I could help him recover.

539
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,041
And I let that be a reason to
lose my strength of character.

540
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,500
I was very sorry for her,
and I think that, uh,

541
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:05,250
my wanting to help overwhelmed me,
so...

542
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:08,166
And then, after everything,

543
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:12,125
instead of being grateful
for everything I'd done

544
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:14,333
for her and for her son,

545
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:16,792
she became unsound.

546
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,417
Threatening.

547
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,500
It got to the point where I
felt she wanted to destroy us,

548
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:26,333
as a family,
so I went to confront her about that.

549
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:29,291
And that's it.

550
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:31,792
That's all I did.

551
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,250
Why did you run,

552
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,041
if you're innocent?

553
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:41,083
Well, I ran because I...

554
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:45,125
I was scared. I,
I knew how it looked.

555
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:47,125
And I was selfish.

556
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,000
In that moment,
I was completely selfish.

557
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:52,125
I thought only about myself
and what might happen to me.

558
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,750
And then, uh...

559
00:36:57,709 --> 00:37:00,375
I thought about you. Mom.

560
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:01,875
So I came back,

561
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:03,500
uh,
which may have been selfish again.

562
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:06,125
But, you see,
I wanted my family back.

563
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:10,208
(quietly): We're never
gonna be a family again.

564
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:14,375
Well, I,
I desperately hope we will be.

565
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:16,625
Come here. Come here.

(both exhale sharply)

585
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:44,083
There is a certain stigma
attached to a public defender.

586
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:49,458
(chuckles) You have always
had an unlimited capacity

587
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:53,542
to see the humanity in a person.

588
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,709
To have an affair...

589
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,291
that's human.

590
00:38:57,375 --> 00:39:03,208
To strike at someone in an act of passion,
or anger,

591
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:05,166
that's human.

592
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,166
But to bludgeon someone to death

593
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:11,000
and keep on bludgeoning
them long after they are dead,

594
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,542
that is a monster, Grace.

595
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:15,500
That is a monster.

596
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,291
He's not that monster.

597
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,750
- Franklin: Mm. - He's...

598
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:23,792
He can't be.

599
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,333
He... (exhales)

600

00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:26,458
I'm not saying that at all.

648
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:30,500
I never underestimate the
state's ability to fuck things up.

649
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:33,625
I can win almost any case,
Grace.

650
00:43:33,709 --> 00:43:37,917
What I cannot do is wave a
wand and make everything better.

651
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:42,875
If he killed her,
I can't make him innocent.

652
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,959
- I can't make him faithful.
- I know that.

653
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,792
- Do you? - Yes.

654
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:52,125
Many clients think I
can undo everything.

655
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:53,625
Wipe the slate clean.

656

You sound like me talking to
my patients. (chuckles softly)

Haley: I understand that
you're a very good therapist.

658
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,417
You've probably fixed
more than a few marriages.

659

That's not my skill set.

660
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:06,792
People hire me to create muck.

661
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:11,125
Muck up the state's case,

662
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:12,959
so they can't meet their burden.

663
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:17,583
That's what I can give you,
and your husband.

664
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:21,083
Muck.

Mendoza: Mr. Reinhart?

666
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:37,709
Detective Joe Mendoza. NYPD.

667
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:42,875
I'm sure you are, dear boy.

668
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:47,500
I got a feeling your
daughter is hiding something.

669

tampering with,

671

or falsifying evidence.

672
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:01,041
For all we know,

673
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,667
she's an accomplice.

674
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:07,125
You're her father.

675
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:09,750
She could use some good advice.

676
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,709
Voice of reason.

677
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,709
Or better, I think,

678
00:45:13,792 --> 00:45:17,208
that I be the voice of reason for you,
detective.

679
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:20,041
My daughter has neither
committed a crime,

680
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:21,875
nor obstructed justice.

681
00:45:21,959 --> 00:45:24,250
I recognize that
in the particular,

682
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:27,917
justice is open to
subjective interpretation,

683
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,667
and I would not deem to presume

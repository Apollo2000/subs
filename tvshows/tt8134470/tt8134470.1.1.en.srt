2
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,875
- WHERE IS SHE?
- SHE'S IN HER STUDIO.

3
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,000
SHE'S WORKIN'.

4
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,208
WHY HASN'T SHE COME BACK?

5
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,458
Mm-hmm.

6
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,375
It's crap. It's cra... Could
you just turn that down a bit?

7
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,029
- Please. I'm trying to concentrate...
- What?

8
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,583
On a very delicate
operation, here.

9
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,417
Blenders don't have
volume control.

10
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,333
Well, that's a pathetic excuse.
Just turn it down, anyway.

11
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:29,542
Dad.

12
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:33,000
- Yeah.
- I did some research last night.

13
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,500
- Yes?
- On golden doodles.

14
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,792
- Oh, God...
- And they don't shed.

15
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,417
They're hypoallergenic.

16
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,405
- No, no... Listen, Hen.
- They're really, really, really cute.

17
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:42,905
We're not having...
Tell him. Tell him.

18
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:44,321
- It's the dog thing again.
- But why, Dad?

19
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,667
We can't have a dog
because as I've said before,

20
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,542
all dogs make my throat
close up,

21
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,875
so no air gets to my lungs,
which makes me die.

22
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,750
So it's...
It's undesirable.

23
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,988
- But...
- Think of another pet. You know, you can have a,

24
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,041
a cat, or a hamster.

25
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,959
Or... I don't know what
kids have these days.

26
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,792
Have a, have a vampire bat.

27
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,208
- Is that a promise?
- Yes. That is a promise.

28
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,625
Like the, the promise of...

29
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,250
a road trip, too?
Just you and me?

30
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,458
That's a low blow.
That will happen.

31
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,738
- Will it?
- It will happen.

32
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,375
Shit, my violin!

33
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,029
- Help me, please.
- What is going on?

34
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,083
I don't know why
I'm suddenly six years old.

35
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:22,959
Oh, God. All right.
Why the tie, hmm?

36
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,458
Not another funeral?

37
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:27,333
- It's The Turd's idea.
- Oh.

38
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:29,125
And no, no.

39
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:32,500
- Not all my patients die.
- Oh.

40
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,166
Why are you so dressed up?
What's his name?

41
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,750
Ladies' tea.
Planning the fundraiser.

42
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:40,667
Oh, school auction.
Did I mention I'm not going?

43
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,405
- Oh, did I mention you are?
- I think you'll find I'm not, my love.

44
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,377
Isn't it enough we give
them tons of money anyway?

45
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,166
We actually don't
give them money.

46
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,697
- Well, your dad does, which is very sweet of him.
- Uh-huh.

47
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,905
Which reminds me, we have
dinner with him next Thursday.

48
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,709
Right. So I have Reardon
and your dad in the same week.

49
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:57,041
I'm just the luckiest girl
in New York.

50
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,166
Don't you like Reardon?

51
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,667
Well, do you like Reardon?
You, you like your school?

52
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,667
- Yeah.
- Hey.

53
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,166
And I love it.
Go on, kiss your mom.

54
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,500
- We have to go.
- Mom...

55
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,083
No, I'm not kissing Mom.
You do it.

56
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,206
You need to clean this up.

57
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,810
I'm not doing this
every single morning.

58
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:11,542
No, no, I want to kiss you.
I like this.

59
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,208
Yeah. Right.

60
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,834
- Henry? Henry?
- What?

61
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:18,000
No more smoothies.
You never, ever clean up...

62
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,738
All right, here's
a question and don't lie.

63
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,875
Did you, in fact, practice
that thing at all this week?

64
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,166
Because I heard nothing.

65
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,250
No, I practiced.

66
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,750
- Really?
- Yeah. I swear.

67
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,333
Do you know, he doesn't
even think I'm any good.

68
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:32,917
Mr. Rosenbaum.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,583
He actually said that, did he?

70
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,709
No. It's not that he says it.

71
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:40,834
It just... He used to say
a lot more good stuff.

72
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:43,792
I mean, sometimes
with the looks he gives me,

73
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,291
I-I think
he wants me to quit.

74
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,208
Well, is it possible that,
as your mom might say...

75
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,530
You're
actually projecting that sentiment.

76
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:52,542
Because somewhere deep down,

77
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,125
in the bowels of
your teenage psyche,

78
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,279
you actually want to give it up.

79
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,750
I don't want to give up.
I love violin.

80
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,363
Okay,
well, that's great then.

81
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,125
You know, Rosenbaum,
he's an unhappy man.

82
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,667
It is never a good idea

83
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,208
to take measure of ourselves

84
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,750
through the eyes of the joyless.

85
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,458
Well, you can be joyless.

86
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,041
- Beg your pardon?
- Yeah.

87
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,709
You can be joyless when
you're... when you're stressed.

88
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,917
Do I seem stressed a lot?

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,667
Some... lately.

90
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,250
Huh.

91
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,625
Brilliant. Well, now...

92
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,792
Now I'm stressed about
being stressed, so...

93
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,917
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,667
You don't, you don't play your
violin for Rosenbaum, anyway.

95
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,792
You owe him your respect
and your hard work,

96
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,417
but in the end,
your relationship with song

97
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,542
is between you
and your music.

98
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,125
- Got it.
- Right. And you're brilliant, okay?

99
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,250
So fuck Rosenbaum.

100
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,458
- I'm telling Mom you said that.
- Take your violin,

101
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:45,834
and shove it up his
Rosen-bum cheeks, okay?

102
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:47,000
Dad...

103
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,375
- Morning.
- Morning.

104
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:13,583
Rebecca Harkness has arrived
way too early.

105
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,291
Oh. Great.

106
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,792
It just doesn't
make any sense to me.

107
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,792
- Huh.
- One minute, he's attentive, loving.

108
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,583
The next minute,
he's borderline abusive.

109
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:27,375
I got both swings last night.
The full pendulum.

110
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,291
And fucking forbid

111
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,208
I call him bipolar.
I mean...

112
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,000
Fucking forbid!

113
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:38,000
So you're back to thinking
that he's, um, that he's bipolar.

114
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,458
I don't know.
The mood swings...

115
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,625
What do you think?

116
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,375
Well, I don't know him.

117
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,917
- I only know you.
- Meaning?

118
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,917
- Do not give me that look.
- This is your third marriage. Isn't it?

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,125
So, what,
we're keeping score?

120
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,709
No. No, I'm just...

121
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:03,041
- I'm not doing that.
- Okay, this is going somewhere,

122
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,333
and I'm not exactly sure where,
other than a direction

123
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:08,083
not in my favor.
So just say it.

124
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,709
- Say it! I pay you. Say it.
- Reb...

125
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,083
Rebecca.

126
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:19,917
I have met few people
more discriminating than you.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,458
You read 100 Yelp reviews before
choosing someone to install your carpet.

128
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:27,667
Am I right? You, you
try on 20 pairs of shoes

129
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,083
before making a choice.

130
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,500
You do background checks
on your hair colorist.

131
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,263
You did a background check
on me, no doubt.

132
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,625
You vet everything.
Everything.

133
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:39,083
- Which is fine. I mean, that's appropriate.
- But...

134
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,125
But an attractive man
comes along,

135
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,125
and shows an interest in you,
and judgment be gone.

136
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,834
No. That is not
what is happening.

137
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:49,041
I mean, the day
that you met Kevin,

138
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,917
you floated into this office.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,834
It was an appointment
that was made to deal

140
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:55,166
with the anguish
of husband number two,

141
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,250
only to declare that you'd met
husband number three.

142
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,000
So, I'm saying...

143
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:03,542
Maybe it's possible...

144
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:07,125
that you're less of a victim of Kevin's
moods than you are of your own.

145
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,125
So, excuse me,
this is my fault?

146
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,667
- No.
- It is. You're blaming me.

147
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,417
I'm not blaming you. I'm
just saying there's a particular

148
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,166
type of person that
you want to be with,

149
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,750
and maybe you're
a little too quick

150
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:20,083
to see that person
in the men that you meet,

151
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,500
instead of seeing
what's actually there.

152
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,709
UGH. WELL, I'll
PROBABLY NEVER SEE HER AGAIN.

153
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:31,458
BECAUSE THEY HIRE YOU
TO GIVE THEM THE HARD TRUTHS,

154
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,959
AND THEN, THEN THEY FIRE YOU
FOR DELIVERING THEM.

155
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,625
Well, just...
Just up your prices.

156
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,709
The more exclusive you seem,
the more she'll come begging.

157
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:42,000
Wow.
I have some bad news.

158
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,500
The, um,

159
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,417
the dress code for the
fundraiser is fancy-glam.

160
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,709
I'm not wearing a tux.

161
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:50,750
LISTEN, THIS IS
FOR HENRY'S SCHOOL.

162
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:53,083
If I can tough out
a ladies' tea,

163
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,125
you can stomach one fundraiser.
For Henry.

164
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,792
I will do it.
But not for Henry's school.

165
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,542
I will do it for you.

166
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,917
Because you're hot.

167
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,875
Anyway, I'm here.
Okay?

168
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,917
Later, smart ass.

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,417
Yeah, later. Bye.

170
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,709
- Come in.
- Hi.

171
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,583
- Let me take your coat.
- Yes.

172
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,750
They're waiting for you
upstairs.

173
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,500
- Hello!
- Sorry I'm late.

174
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,750
Not a problem.

175
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:31,667
- We have a new mom.
- Oh.

176
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,250
A Scholarship.

177
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,653
She brought her infant. She's
changing her in the bathroom.

178
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,125
You look fabulous.

179
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,583
- Oh, hi, Grace.
- Hi.

180
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,363
- Hi.
- Is she, uh, on the committee?

181
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,542
Uh, wants to be
an involved parent.

182
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,417
Hi. Hi, hi. Sorry.

183
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:46,333
- Hey.
- Thanks.

184
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,542
Did any of you even
know that she was coming?

185
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,834
I mean, I'm usually the
first one to learn of anything.

186
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,333
People can't wait
to tell me stuff.

187
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,667
Because you're
so quick to disapprove.

188
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,834
Well, exactly.

189
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,667
All right, we
should get going here.

190
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,875
Sorry!

191
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,166
She's a bit nervous.

192
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,166
She's back to being
the auctioneer.

193
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,170
I thought you got
the guy from Sotheby's.

194
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,417
No, he dropped
out. We'll be fine.

195
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,792
- I've done this before.
- Hi.

196
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,291
Hi. Hi.

197
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,208
I'm Grace Fraser.

198
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,417
Elena Alves.
Nice to meet you.

199
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,375
- Hi.
- Elena has a boy in fourth grade?

200
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,166
You said his name was Miguel?

201
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,792
- Yeah, yeah.
- Your baby's gorgeous.

202
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,583
- Thank you.
- Hello. Boy or girl?

203
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,041
Girl. Teresa.

204
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,667
Oh. Teresa.

205
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,917
- I love your eyelashes.
- Okay, come on, folks.

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,166
The auction's tomorrow.

207
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,959
Thank you so much
for letting me join.

208
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,125
Are you kidding? We're
happy to get all the help we can.

209
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,834
That you even have the time
with two kids.

210
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:38,959
I have twins. So regret it.

211
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,500
Jolene!

212
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,834
I mean, they're
so much work, right?

213
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,709
Okay, let's, uh...

214
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,000
let's rank the items.

215
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,883
- Yes.
- We'll start with the least expensive.

216
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,250
Work our way up to the...
the big tickets.

217
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,834
There's a lot of stuff here.

218
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:57,166
Well, we have over 200 people
confirmed coming. That's a record.

219
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,834
Thanks to the Spensers
lending us their home.

220
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:01,750
I did a walk-through yesterday.
Oh, my God.

221
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,194
Mm. Did you see
the David Hockneys?

222
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,250
Two of them, on facing
walls in the dining room.

223
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,792
- And what about Suki's closet?
- Oh, I'll get there.

224
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,375
Maybe Monday night,
with any luck.

225
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,834
Yes!

226
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,250
Okay, let's do this. Okay!

227
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:16,166
We got four
separate stays in the Hamptons.

228
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,250
A pair in Vail and Aspen.

229
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,625
A cooking lesson at Tribeca
for eight.

230
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,250
You never know how much
those go for.

231
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,583
Stem-cell facelift.

232
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:24,947
Does anybody really
believe in those?

233
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,583
Kathy Sennot
got one. Did not work.

234
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,166
We have a bunch of consults.

235
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,822
A college admissions counselor.
A pre-school admissions counselor.

236
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,542
A genealogist that'll
come to your house.

237
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,071
That could actually go.

238
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,988
I don't see any
artists. Where are the artists?

239
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,640
Are you saying
we can't scratch up

240
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,875
one lousy playwright
in all of New York City?

241
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,458
Grace, maybe you could donate
a therapy session.

242
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:45,792
I am not doing that.
That is not happening.

243
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,375
Why not? "Do I hear $500
on saving your marriage?"

244
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,834
Uh, 500, and I will
throw in my husband.

245
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:52,613
Grace, you know
what would be awesome?

246
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,500
I think Jonathan
would be a huge get.

247
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,166
You want to auction Jonathan?

248
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,792
- Well...
- Yes! I'm putting him up.

249
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,834
Uh, Grace's husband is a doctor.

250
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:02,792
- He was featured in "New York" magazine.
- Oh.

251
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,792
He's an oncologist,
Sally. Who's gonna bid on cancer?

252
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,959
A private, after-hours
tour at the Guggenheim.

253
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,750
They're doing the Salon
de la Rose Croix.

254
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,166
You know, I was just there on
Tuesday for the Chagall exhibit.

255
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,792
I swear, I actually
felt light-headed.

256
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,834
I don't really get Chagall.

257
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:23,125
I mean, who doesn't get Chagall?

258
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,834
Me. One minute he's a modernist.

259
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:29,250
Then it's stained glass.
The guy's all over the place.

260
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,375
If he were alive today,
they'd put him on Prozac...

261
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,875
Hey. Hold on.

262
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,208
Tell me that wasn't odd.
My God!

263
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,166
She was just feeding her child.

264
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,208
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

265
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,051
There was definitely
something more going on.

266
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,208
- Excuse me.
- LIKE WHAT?

267
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,709
Like she was...

268
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:11,041
Point!
Point your foot!

269
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,583
Like she was being passive-aggressive
about it. You didn't get that?

270
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,291
No.

271
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,375
You know, I've seen her
at the school before.

272
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,417
SITTING ACROSS THE STREET
ON ONE OF THOSE BENCHES.

273
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,750
AFTER SHE DROPS HER SON OFF,
SHE JUST SITS THERE.

274
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,041
WITH THE BABY?

275
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,279
WELL NOW WITH THE BABY.
BEFORE WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT.

276
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,250
She wouldn't even be
reading a book.

277
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,250
I feel like telling her,
"You live in New York.

278
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,917
"It is a crime not to be
frantically busy." Who just...

279
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,625
SITS AROUND QUIETLY?

280
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,750
What an unfathomable
state of being.

281
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:49,083
Albeit with...

282
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,250
Spectacular breasts.

283
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,458
- You're bad.
- OH, MY GOD. THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL.

284
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:56,917
Up, up, up, up, up.

285
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,417
Up, up, tall.
Get your... Tall.

286
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,260
Shoulders down. Shoulders down.

287
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,750
Stop smiling.
Stop smiling!

288
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:29,667
Elena, what's wrong?

289
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:39,875
IT WAS
HOSTILE. IT JUST WAS.

290
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,250
But I don't blame her. I mean,
we were talking about art.

291
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,917
We were talking about money.
It was, it was pretty vulgar.

292
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,208
And she was just trying
to say, "Hey, here I am."

293
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,625
"I'm a real, real woman.
I'm a real mom.

294
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:52,542
I'm struggling, and..."

295
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,834
I don't know. Sometimes I think
we should move out of the city.

296
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,250
Said the most New York person
I've ever met in my life.

297
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,834
No, but don't you
worry sometimes

298
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:05,875
that you're raising your son
in a bubble?

299
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,000
I thought that was the whole
essence of modern parenting, isn't it?

300
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,709
Keep them protected from reality
for as long as possible

301
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:13,071
so that when they
finally emerge,

302
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,750
they can't cope
and end up self-harming.

303
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:17,542
- I thought we were doing really well at that.
- Mm.

304
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,875
Wow. What about
Schenectady, huh?

305
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,792
- I've heard nice things about Schenectady.
- It sounds horrible.

306
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,125
Even phonetically.

307
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,458
So, is this
a serious conversation?

308
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:31,083
Yeah.

309
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,041
Yep. Manhattan is
a lonely place.

310
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,500
I mean,
when you think about it,

311
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,834
we don't have a lot
of close friends.

312
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:40,667
Well, that's only 'cause
we hate everyone.

313
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,834
You hate everyone.
I don't.

314
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:46,208
I wouldn't call us isolated.

315
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,583
Our days are stuffed
with people and their problems.

316
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:52,000
I mean, we're right up close
with them at their most vulnerable.

317
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,583
It's not a conventional
social life,

318
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,709
but in terms of meaningful
human interaction,

319
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,458
I would say we did
very well.

320
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,375
- Mm.
- I don't like you being lonely.

321
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,834
Mm.

322
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,625
You lonely in there?

323
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,625
Would you like some company?

324
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,041
Would you like to be washed?

325
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,208
Grace, Dr. Fraser,
with his magic hands.

326
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,041
Shall I get my rubber gloves?

327
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,041
- Come on. Come in.
- I'm coming, Grace.

328
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,500
Grace?

329
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,000
Hi.

330
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,709
Elena.

331
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,959
- We met at the fundraiser committee.
- Yes, yes. Of course.

332
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,458
How are you?

333
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:24,959
- I'm, I'm well.
- Good.

334
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:29,000
Thank you so much for
making me feel so welcome.

335
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,375
The other women...

336
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,208
I don't know,
I felt like an intruder.

337
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,208
But you made me feel
at home. So...

338
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,125
Thank you.

339
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,959
Well, I know that, um...

340
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,125
Everybody was very happy
to have you there.

341
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,125
We need all the help
we can get.

342
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,083
How can I help?

343
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:59,667
'Cause nobody actually made me do anything.

344
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,208
Um, I suppose...

345
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:07,208
because most of the work
was already done, and...

346
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,083
And you were occupied
with your sweet baby.

347
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,709
Yeah.

348
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,083
But I want to be a part of it.

349
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,583
At school.

350
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,417
I really do.

351
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,083
I know.

352
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,083
I really do.

353
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,000
She was just standing there.

354
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,625
Naked.

355
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,834
Yeah?

356
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:50,583
I'm all for women being
comfortable with their bodies,

357
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:53,125
but it was...

358
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,291
- Weird.
- Good weird?

359
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,125
Were you a little bit...

360
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,583
- St...
- Aroused?

361
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:02,375
- No.
- Oh, Christ. We're nearly there.

362
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,938
The sooner we can get out,
the better.

363
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:06,333
Look, I've got that
early flight to Cleveland.

364
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:08,166
When do you get back?

365
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,667
Possibly tomorrow night,
if I can get away,

366
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,542
but you know, I do hate to
forfeit my Hyatt reward points.

367
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,906
And that's how you get the
complimentary breakfast, Grace.

368
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,041
Okay, here we are.

369
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,583
Slump, dread, sob...

370
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,750
- Despair...
- Look at me.

371
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:24,291
Mm.

372
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,667
I'm very proud of my wife.
Come on.

373
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,747
Oh, Christ. They're coming.

374
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,166
Hold the elevator!

375
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,291
Oh. Sorry. Sorry!
Just...

376
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,000
- Couldn't face it.
- You're so bad.

377
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:50,000
Profound,
and existential dread.

378
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,083
- Hi. May I take your coat?
- Thank you.

379
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,291
Thank you.

380
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,041
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

381
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,125
- Champagne?
- Thank you.

382
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,542
Thank God. Thank you.
I love you very much.

383
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,667
I thought there was
gonna be some glam.

384
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,917
- I didn't think this much.
- Ugh.

385
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,125
Can we hide?

386
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,834
Let's go and pretend to be
interested in those Hockneys, mm?

387
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:30,709
No, we're stuck here for a bit.

388
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:33,542
We have to have cocktails
with the headmaster first.

389
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,000
- Come on.
- Oh, Christ.

390
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,083
- Robert. Hi.
- Grace.

391
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,542
- Jonathan.
- Hey.

392
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,125
Oh, thank you both
so much for coming.

393
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,458
- There you are.
- It's a...

394
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:43,125
- Dad?
- Hello.

395
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,291
Franklin.

396
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,333
Such an honor and
a privilege, sir.

397
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:49,250
- You left out "thrill."
- Yes, I did.

398
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,458
Well, thank you for coming.

399
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:54,041
I'm not coming.
I'm going.

400
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:57,041
- Really? Now?
- I bid on the silent auction.

401
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:01,083
I'm apt to win one of Henry
Ford's original dipsticks.

402
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,834
- Mm.
- I would like to be long gone before that happens.

403
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:06,583
- Jonathan.
- Franklin.

404
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:07,792
You're looking well.

405
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,083
I am?

406
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,709
Uh, very surprising.
Thank you.

407
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:13,542
- Dinner Thursday?
- Absolutely.

408
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,750
- Hello.
- Hi.

409
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,125
- Hi. Hi, hi.
- Hi, darling.

410
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,542
- Jonathan.
- Franklin.

411
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,417
You're not gonna
fucking believe this.

412
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,208
- What?
- They're not even here.

413
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,041
- Who?
- The Spensers.

414
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,208
Oh.

415
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,792
What, you don't think
that's rude?

416
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,917
We could take it as rude
or it could be,

417
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,083
"While we're gonna be
out of town,

418
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,542
happy to let you
use our palace."

419
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,542
Can't you ever
just be not nice?

420
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,375
Oh, she can, I promise you.

421
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,000
You hear those fucks
didn't show?

422
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,709
It's a fabulous turnout. I was
worried that people wouldn't show,

423
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,875
and it seems that
absolutely everybody is here,

424
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,583
so we can relax.

425
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,875
There she is.

426
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,959
Ugh. Our lactator-in-chief.

427
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,041
She looks a bit uncomfortable.

428
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,250
That's the mom
I was telling you about.

429
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,208
- Oh, that's her?
- Mm-hmm.

430
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,083
- The nudist?
- I want those boobs.

431
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,846
You know,
we should go talk to her.

432
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,834
She must be feeling
so awkward.

433
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,417
Actually, she seems okay.

434
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,166
Mm, maybe better than okay.

435
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,875
- Am I missing something?
- Look at the men.

436
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,417
Like Pavlov's dogs.

437
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,709
Grace, I, I think she
might be looking at you.

438
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,834
Really? Is she?

439
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:21,000
Uh, yeah. I think she is.

440
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,458
Well, here you all are.

441
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,571
I think they'd like to get
started. It's bidding time.

442
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,959
- Start herding the people.
- All right. Here we go.

443
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,417
Come on.

444
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,583
Is that enough? We've
put in an appearance.

445
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,208
- Can we go?
- Would you stop?

446
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,166
Hey. I'll make it
up to you later.

447
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,792
Make it up to me now. Let's find
a room. They must have a few.

448
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,750
- You're so bad.
- Come on. In Suki's closet.

449
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:44,375
- In Suki's clothes. Both of us.
- Stop!

450
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,000
Make an Englishman happy.
Come on.

451
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,166
Aah.

452
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,890
- You know what I love about this?
- What?

453
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:53,279
You could never tell
they were rich.

454
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,709
It's all so classy
and understated.

455
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,208
Hi. We're ready to start.

456
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,625
Welcome, welcome,
welcome.

457
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:02,583
I'm Sally Maybury, head
of the auction committee,

458
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:06,625
for our wonderful Reardon School!

459
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:08,125
Woo!

460
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,583
We have a positively fabulous

461
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:12,166
afternoon in store for you.

462
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,959
Now, some of you
might be thinking,

463
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,583
"Don't I already pay enough
in tuition?"

464
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,542
Damn right!

465
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,417
Yes. Of course you do.
Yes, I feel the same way.

466
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,667
But, it is our responsibility

467
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,834
to make sure that
Reardon can accept

468
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:29,667
the students it wants to accept,

469
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,125
and that those students
are able to attend,

470
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,000
despite their financial
circumstances,

471
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:38,166
ensuring that the name Reardon
is always synonymous with...

472
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,208
Diversity!

473
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,655
And of course,
we have to make sure that

474
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,125
our teachers are so well paid

475
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,291
that we do not lose them
to other schools.

476
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:51,000
We love our teachers at Reardon! Woo!

477
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:53,333
Just not enough to
invite them to the party.

478
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:55,041
- Shush.
- Okay, now,

479
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:58,417
Diane Porter is gonna
start the party. Let's go!

480
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,834
Woo!

481
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:04,291
Before we turn to
our scheduled items for bid...

482
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:06,917
Observe.

483
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,375
This may look like an
ordinary glass of tap water,

484
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,250
but it is much
more than that.

485
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:15,959
This is very special water

486
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:19,125
that will serve to
prime the pipes

487
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:21,625
to your generously
deep pockets.

488
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:23,250
Aw...

489
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,458
What is the
value, you may ask,

490
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:27,458
of an ordinary glass
of tap water?

491
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:28,709
That depends.

492
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:32,834
What is the value of
your children's education?

493
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:35,208
The value of his
or her teachers?

494
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:37,959
The opportunity
of the less fortunate

495
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:41,542
to enjoy the privilege
of your offspring.

496
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:46,750
Who will bid $1,000

497
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:49,250
for this glass of water?

498
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:52,583
Who is gonna stand up
and clang that bell?

499
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:55,500
- 1,000!
- $1,000!

500
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:58,917
Thank you. Money for our kids.

501
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,083
- 2,000!
- 2,000!

502
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,709
3,000...

503
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:05,458
5,000 right here...

504
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:07,750
- Eight!
- 8,000, right here!

505
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:10,792
- I bid 10!
- 10,000!

506
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:20,125
Oh, uh...

507
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:21,542
Elena. Sorry...

508
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:24,667
- I...
- Sorry.

509
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,500
Are you okay?

510
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:45,500
I'm sorry.

511
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:50,542
'Cause
sometimes I just feel...

512
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,208
overwhelmed.

513
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,375
And lost.

514
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,041
- Mm.
- I...

515
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,041
Do you ever feel that?

516
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,542
If you ever want to talk...

517
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:11,250
For free, uh...

518
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:15,834
I apologize. I didn't
mean it to sound like that.

519
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:18,625
But if you do ever
wanna talk...

520
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,750
You're so kind.
Thank you.

521
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,625
And please,
don't be intimidated.

522
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:29,625
The parents at Reardon
can be a little, um...

523
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,583
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

524
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,417
But...

525
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:38,166
Most of them are very kind.
They're...

526
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,709
They are nice people.
Kind people and...

527
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:44,125
But you are the most kind.

528
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:47,041
It's true.

529
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,917
I feel it.

530
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:00,458
All right, our next item...

531
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:02,542
Knicks tickets. Wow.

532
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:05,000
You can rub elbows
with Spike Lee.

533
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,917
Pitch him your idea
for a new movie.

534
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,542
Hey, you never know.
They might even win the game.

535
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,208
All right. Who's gonna take
these tickets off my hands?

536
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,834
Let's start the bidding
at 1,500.

537
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:18,000
- Thank you.
- 1,500, right here.

538
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:21,291
2,000, in the front. 2,500.
Do I hear 3,000?

539
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,542
- 3,000 over here. 35?
- Yeah.

540
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,875
- 4,000, near the piano.
- Right here.

541
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:28,000
$6,000!

542
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,834
- Going once, going twice...
- Elena?

543
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,583
- Yours, for...
- Oh, hi.

544
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:36,417
I'm going home
'cause I forgot to pump,

545
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,208
and it's getting a bit
uncomfortable.

546
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:40,208
Oh. I have a car.

547
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:42,417
My driver could take you,
if you want.

548
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,458
- Oh. Oh, no, I'm...
- Please.

549
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm in Harlem,

550
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,917
so, it'll be faster
to take the subway.

551
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,041
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

552
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,375
But thank you.

553
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,333
Oh, hey. It's all right.

554
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,583
Thank you.

555
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,375
For your kindness.

556
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,792
Do I hear 80? 80,000?

557
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:33,125
Gentleman in the front.
90? 90,000.

558
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,458
If we reach 100,000,

559
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:37,125
we'll donate a C-class
to a child in need.

560
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:41,166
So what was all that?

561
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,458
What's going on with you
and the nudist?

562
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:45,583
She was upset,

563
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:48,500
and she just, um,

564
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:52,333
I suggested she use our car
but she didn't want to, so...

565
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:54,166
You are a very nice person.

566
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,583
Come here.

567
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,792
I love you.

568
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:02,279
- I love you.
- Thank you so much. It's been an incredible evening.

569
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:05,375
You raised so much money
for a good cause. Thank you.

570
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,917
We're good?

571
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,000
Joanna...

572
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,834
- Well, you're not gonna be happy.
- Why?

573
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:22,083
- I just got paged.
- Mm-hmm?

574
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:25,542
Shelby McGibbons' lungs
just filled up with fluid.

575
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,458
- Go.
- You want to come?

576
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,083
Legitimate excuse
to duck out early.

577
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:30,738
The driver could drop me
at the hospital?

578
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,000
Oh, I can't.
I'm on the committee. Go.

579
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,947
- Go, go. Take the driver. I'll Uber.
- Really? I'm sorry.

580
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,959
I'm sorry.
I'll, I'll call.

581
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,291
- Mm.
- Where's he going?

582
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,875
Emergency.
One of his patients.

583
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:48,208
Honestly, staring down cancer
every day with children,

584
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:50,083
maintaining a sense
of humor all the while.

585
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:53,291
- How does he do it?
- I wonder myself.

586
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,750
TEN DOLLARS.

587
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:41,792
YEP. YOU HAVE MY SOLEMN WORD.

588
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,417
YOU CAN TRUST ME.
I'M A DOCTOR.

589
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,542
TEN BUCKS IF I BEAT LEUKEMIA.

590
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:47,792
Yeah.

591
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:49,250
I mean, if you prefer,

592
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:52,041
I could give you
a whole talk about, um,

593
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:54,917
you know,
being brave and fighting,

594
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,583
and all that sort of stuff but I
do find, generally speaking,

595
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,458
money works best.

596
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,792
How 'bout $10,

597
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:04,500
and when I apply
to medical school,

598
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:07,291
you write my recommendation.

599
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,208
I don't know.
I don't know, Shelby.

600
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:10,792
I'd have to see
your transcripts,

601
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:13,709
because I can't recommend
just anyone.

602
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:15,375
You could be awful.

603
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,875
Am I going to die?

604
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:23,000
You're not gonna die.

605
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,333
If you die, I'll kill you.

606
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:57,125
Hey.

607
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:04,125
Did everything go okay?

608
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:15,750
Oh, no.

609
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,250
I'm so sorry.

610
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:24,750
- Honey.
- Yeah.

611
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:26,959
Fuck.

612
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:30,417
Oh.

613
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,000
Where is she?

614
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:41,250
She's in her studio.

615
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,333
Why hasn't she come back?

616
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:46,125
She's working, okay?

617
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:49,625
You think you can
take yourself to school today?

618
00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:51,291
Catch the bus outside?

619
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:52,542
Yeah.

620
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:55,166
Go get your things.
You're gonna be late.

621
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,959
Shh...

622
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:37,500
- Henry?
- Uh-huh.

623
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:39,333
Come on. Have you eaten?

624
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:42,083
- Yeah.
- We gotta go 'cause I'm, um,

625
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,041
I'm late and I've got
an early session.

626
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:47,417
- Quick! Put those books away.
- Yeah. Okay.

627
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,208
Mom.

628
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:55,000
I don't think Dad is
actually allergic to dogs.

629
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,917
I think he just says it.

630
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:00,917
Yeah. You're right.

631
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,083
It's not about being allergic.

632
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:06,625
He would never want me to tell you
this, so don't say anything, all right?

633
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:08,333
Okay.

634
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:11,125
But when he was younger,
he was actually your age,

635
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:14,542
he was home alone, he was
taking care of the family dog,

636
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:16,542
it got out of the house...

637
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:19,291
and it was hit by a car
and killed.

638
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:23,750
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

639
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:26,333
I mean, it was very
traumatic for him.

640
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:30,083
And it was actually made worse
because his parents...

641
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:32,875
blamed him for it.

642
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:36,583
- What?
- Yeah. That's why he hates talking about it.

643
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:40,333
What kind of dog?

644
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:43,000
Um...
What kind of...

645
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:46,375
I think it was...
It was a small dog.

646
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:47,625
That's what I know.

647
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:51,333
Anyway, I honestly don't think
he's ever gotten over it.

648
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,583
Quick. Put everything away,
would you? Let's go.

649
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:57,375
- Put your coat on. It's freezing outside.
- All right.

650
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:04,166
AT SOME POINT, YOU ARE
GONNA HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

651
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,709
The why of it all.

652
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:08,083
It had nothing to do
with us. Or you.

653
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:09,667
- Bullshit!
- Here we go.

654
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,333
So, what was it about, then?

655
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:12,333
Just sex?

656
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:14,166
If I had a clue,
I wouldn't be here

657
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,709
paying these
criminally high rates.

658
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:17,863
- We are paying these criminally high rates.
- Would I?

659
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:19,988
That's just a bit
deflective, isn't it, Joseph?

660
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,750
Is it possible that you were
drawn to the secret of it all?

661
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:26,667
Maybe more than you were
to this other man, Dennis?

662
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,709
The affair got to be
yours alone?

663
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:32,333
Michael couldn't know about it,
so he couldn't micromanage it?

664
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:35,333
I don't think that's it.

665
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,834
I'm sorry. Are
we keeping you from something?

666
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:46,667
I apologize.
This is my son's school.

667
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,208
It is programmed for emergencies
only, so I do have to take it.

668
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,625
Now, you said that you knew
Dennis when you were single,

669
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:01,109
but you never had sex
with him then.

670
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:02,709
I wasn't even
attracted to him then.

671
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:04,363
No one was attracted to him.
He's not attractive.

672
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:06,458
- Okay...
- Exactly. Then what changed?

673
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:09,417
Part of the thrill
of adultery is that

674
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,166
it exists in the shadow

675
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,875
of a primary relationship.

676
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,542
It's the clandestine part of it

677
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,166
that provides
much of the erotic jolt.

678
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,583
Could that have
been it here?

679
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:20,709
The lie?

680
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,750
What about the fear
of getting caught?

681
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,333
Maybe you wanted to get caught.

682
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:31,000
Why would I want that?

683
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:33,792
To show Michael that
he can't control you, after all?

684
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:38,667
I think this is more about
Michael and your marriage

685
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,792
than it is about this other man.

686
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:51,458
He doesn't always love when other
people are right.

687
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,625
So you wanted to get caught.

688
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:02,542
I think I better check on him.

689
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:07,083
So we're gonna try
and get the new protocol

690
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:10,458
for the pro-bono work, uh,
in place as soon as possible.

691
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:22,291
- Sylvia?
- Just a second.

692
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:25,375
It's my... It's my daughter's
school. Excuse me.

693
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:27,018
- Excuse me.
- Sylvia, can it wait?

694
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:28,083
Two minutes.

695
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,375
Is this going to affect...

696
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,041
Did you hear?

697
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:33,917
What?

698
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,667
The school? It was a family...
It was a family tragedy?

699
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,625
- A FOURTH GRADER?
- Grace.

700
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,709
It was Elena.

701
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:47,083
WHAT?

702
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:48,875
She was found dead.

703
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:52,542
What?

704
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:54,655
WELL, DIDN'T
YOU GET THE SCHOOL ALERT?

705
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:56,709
Yes. What happened?

706
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:58,000
There's been no official word.

707
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:01,667
- At first I heard...
- aneurysm, but...

708
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,667
WHAT THE SCHOOL
IS BEING TOLD IS THAT...

709
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,667
SHE WAS MURDERED.

710
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,125
What?

711
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,250
- I KNOW.
- Oh, my God.

712
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,041
And, and apparently,

713
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,333
her son, the poor thing.
Discovered her.

714
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,834
God, this is awful. Um...

715
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:25,458
What do they know?
Do they know who did it?

716
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:28,959
No. Nobody seems to
really know anything.

717
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:32,417
- I CANNOT BEAR IT. THAT POOR WOMAN.
- I know.

718
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,291
And that poor little boy.
It's...

719
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:37,875
You know, they're
looking for the husband.

720
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:40,458
They are. Evidently,
they were having problems.

721
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:43,125
It's always the fucking husband.

722
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,458
CAN YOU IMAGINE?
LETTING HIS OWN SON

723
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,792
DISCOVER HIS MOTHER LIKE THAT?

724
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:50,029
You know what? Actually,
I'm right in the middle of a meeting,

725
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,709
- so I'm gonna call you later when I know more.
- YEAH.

726
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:05,125
Did I do something wrong?

727
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:08,709
- No. I just...
- You seem unnerved.

728
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:12,250
- Really?
- Yeah. Just... Do I unnerve you?

729
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:15,667
No.

730
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,291
Well, you would tell me...
if I did something wrong.

731
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,291
You didn't do anything wrong.

732
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:24,041
- Okay?
- Okay.

733
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:33,780
HOW WELL
DID YOU KNOW ELENA ALVES?

734
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:36,291
Not very well, but,
um, she had just started...

735
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,041
Uh, she was part of
the auction committee.

736
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,041
I arranged to have
her participate.

737
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,291
She was a scholarship mom.

738
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,125
I've only met her a few times.

739
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:44,822
- Just in the schoolyard, here.
- Do you remember what time

740
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:46,709
- you left the fundraiser?
- What time I left?

741
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:50,041
I think, uh,
I was home by eleven.

742
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:51,738
And what time did you learn
that something had happened?

743
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,208
The school sent out an alert.

744
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:56,208
An alert that went out from
the school on all of our phones.

745
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:58,446
- Did you know Elena Alves?
- No. Uh, we've met.

746
00:41:58,458 --> 00:41:59,583
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't know her.

747
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:01,458
The most time I've
ever spent with her

748
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:03,542
was at a, a meeting
recently at Sally's.

749
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:05,000
Do you know if Miguel
took the bus,

750
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:06,405
or did somebody come
and pick him up?

751
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:08,488
Well, normally his mom
comes to school to pick him up.

752
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,041
- Did you know Miguel?
- Uh, yeah, we were in math together.

753
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,959
Okay. Did you say
you knew Miguel as well?

754
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:15,041
Yeah, sometimes we
played together after school.

755
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:17,959
And did everything seem okay
lately? He's, he's okay lately?

756
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,488
HELLO, THIS IS JONATHAN FRASER.

757
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,780
I CAN'T ANSWER YOUR CALL
RIGHT NOW,

758
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:33,083
BUT I WILL GET BACK TO YOU
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

759
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:36,417
IF THIS IS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY,
PLEASE CALL 911,

760
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,166
OR GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

761
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,417
Hi, sweetheart.
It's, it's me.

762
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,125
Um, can you give me a call,

763
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:45,625
'cause something
came up at school.

764
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:49,208
E-everything's fine.
Henry is fine, but I...

765
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:52,458
I just, I just want to
fill you in. Um...

766
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,792
I hope Cleveland is good.

767
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:58,417
- I love you, Uh...
- Mrs. Fraser.

768
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,917
I'm Detective Paul O'Rourke.
23rd precinct.

769
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,333
Oh, my God. What
happened? Is it my son?

770
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:05,988
No, it's not about your son. I'm
sorry if we frightened you. We...

771
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,667
We do that sometimes.

772
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,542
Right. Um...

773
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:11,500
I'm Detective Joseph Mendoza.
NYPD.

774
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:12,903
We just want to talk
for a minute.

775
00:43:12,917 --> 00:43:14,750
Can you please just
tell me what happened?

776
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:16,041
Well, the mother of a child

777
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:17,959
who attends your son's school
was killed.

778
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:19,481
- I'm sure you heard of that.
- Yeah.

779
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,988
- Yeah.
- The school sent out a message.

780
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm so sorry. I just...

781
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:23,250
No, no. No need to apologize.

782
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:24,625
- I got two kids.
- Right.

783
00:43:24,709 --> 00:43:26,750
We just want to ask a few
questions, if that's okay.

784
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:29,500
Of course.

785
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:36,041
I didn't know it was
Mrs. Alves till, um...

786
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:37,709
until I spoke to a friend.

787
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:40,125
- And who was the friend?
- Um...

788
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,792
Sylvia Steinetz.

789
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:44,959
She and I are part of a committee
at the school that we serve on.

790
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:47,083
- The, uh, auction committee?
- Mm-hmm.

791
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,834
She just joined.

792
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,125
And what time
did you learn of her death?

793
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:53,458
Hmm.
Let me check my phone.

794
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,583
Uh, at 2:46 p.m.

795
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:02,291
- From, uh, Sylvia Steinetz?
- Yes.

796
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:05,375
Is that important?
What time I got the call?

797
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:07,166
Well, you're a shrink, right?

798
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,041
You only ask the
important stuff?

799
00:44:11,417 --> 00:44:14,542
She wasn't, um, a
patient of mine, Mrs. Alves.

800
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:18,166
She was a... She... I
mean, I wasn't treating her.

801
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,750
How well did you know her?

802
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:24,291
Uh, not well. As I said, she'd
only just joined the committee.

803
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:25,834
And you saw her last when?

804
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:28,834
I saw her last
night at the benefit.

805
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:31,375
And you
didn't talk to her after that?

806
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:33,709
- No.
- Did you notice anyone.

807
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:37,125
Mrs. Alves might have spoken to?

808
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:43,250
I mean, there were just some
men who were paying her

809
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:45,166
special attention.

810
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,290
- What do you mean, special attention?
- No, I mean,

811
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:50,458
the, the special attention
that men sometimes

812
00:44:50,542 --> 00:44:52,417
- pay to a woman.
- Mm.

813
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,875
And what about
Mrs. Alves' husband?

814
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,417
Was he there last night?

815
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,375
Not to my knowledge.

816
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:02,917
I mean, I never met him, so...

817
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:09,417
Do you suspect
the husband of this?

818
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,417
Right now, we're just,
uh, gathering facts.

819
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,458
Would it be possible for us
to speak to your husband?

820
00:45:16,542 --> 00:45:20,166
Um, well, um, why?

821
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,291
Well, he might have
seen something.

822
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:25,417
Oh. No. No, he didn't.

823
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,500
So you've spoken to him
since this news came to light?

824
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,625
No, but anything that
he would have seen,

825
00:45:30,709 --> 00:45:32,613
- I would have seen, so...
- Where's your husband now?

826
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:33,959
He's in Cleveland.

827
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:36,208
He's at an oncology
convention.

828
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:37,542
Where's he staying?

829
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:38,625
I think at a Hyatt,

830
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:40,208
- or something.
- When did he go there?

831
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:41,917
Uh, this morning.

832
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,750
Early.

833
00:45:43,834 --> 00:45:46,208
- Mom.
- Oh, Henry.

834
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:49,208
Um,
orchestra ran over.

835
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:51,208
- Mm-hmm.
- Wh-what's going on?

836
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,822
Um, I'm just
talking to these men.

837
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,363
Could you go to your room,
and I'll, um,

838
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:55,792
I'll be up in a minute?

839
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:58,375
- I'll make you a snack.
- Is everything okay?

840
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:00,333
Yes. Yep. Everything's fine.

841
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:02,792
I just need you
to go upstairs,

842
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:05,375
and, um, I'll be right there.

843
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:08,291
Off you go.
I'll be right there.

844
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:10,041
- Okay.
- Good.

845
00:46:12,709 --> 00:46:14,250
Go on.

846
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:18,417
Did your son know
the Alves boy?

847
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,959
Um, no. No.

848
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:24,166
I mean, they're...
They're in different grades.

849
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,458
Yeah, but it's kind of
a small school, isn't it?

850
00:46:26,542 --> 00:46:29,458
That's what I read on
the website. Small school,

851
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:31,792
individual attention.

852
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:34,208
That's why it costs
the big bucks, right?

853
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,125
What is the tuition there?

854
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:41,875
How much do you pay?

855
00:46:41,959 --> 00:46:45,500
Um, it's...

856
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:47,709
- $50,000 a year.
- Oof.

857
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:51,166
Fifty grand. How do you think
they could afford that? The Alveses?

858
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,625
I mean, I think
it was a scholarship.

859
00:46:54,709 --> 00:46:58,667
But, I don't really have
any knowledge of, uh,

860
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,875
the Alves' financial
circumstances.

861
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:05,750
Are we upsetting you,
doctor?

862
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:12,250
If there's anything,
anything else I can do.

863
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,041
Sure.

864
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,250
Here's my card.

865
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:18,792
My cell phone.

866
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:21,250
If you can think of
anything else.

867
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:24,291
I will, I will give you a call.

868
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:25,917
Good.

869
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,208
Thank you.

870
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:30,083
Right. Thanks.

871
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:32,375
What was that about?

872
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:33,667
- What?
- The police.

873
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,291
- Henry...
- Are they here for the murder?

874
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:41,291
- Yeah.
- Oh, I saw it on my phone.

875
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:43,458
- Really?
- Yeah.

876
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,834
They mentioned Reardon.

877
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:53,417
Oh. Did you, um...
Did you know the boy?

878
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,250
I think his name is Miguel?

879
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I don't think so.

880
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:03,750
- Thank you.
- Kind of scary, huh?

881
00:48:03,834 --> 00:48:05,500
This happening at your school?

882
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,667
How you feeling about it?

883
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:10,208
Did the father do it?

884
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:13,959
It's...

885
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,625
It's too soon to know.

886
00:48:16,709 --> 00:48:17,834
Did you know her?

887
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:21,792
Um, hmm?

888
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:24,083
The mom who got...

889
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:25,625
Did you know her?

890
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:28,583
Not really. I mean, she was...

891
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,458
She was on
the auction committee.

892
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:33,417
Was she nice?

893
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,417
Yeah.

894
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,542
Yeah, she was very nice.
She...

895
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:41,417
She seemed a little sad.

896
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,750
WHERE DO YOU GO TO
SCHOOL? YOU GO TO REARDON?

897
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:51,083
What... Okay.
What grade are you in?

898
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:54,417
- Fourth.
- Okay.

899
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:56,875
Do you like it?

900
00:48:57,542 --> 00:48:58,709
It's all right.

901
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:00,625
So, you were gonna
go to school,

902
00:49:00,709 --> 00:49:03,625
but instead, did...
You went where?

903
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:06,834
- My mom's studio.
- She's a, an artist?

904
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:11,917
I know it's hard.
We gotta find out who did this.

905
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:33,750
- Hey.
- Hi.

906
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:43,458
Hey, honey. Um,

907
00:49:43,542 --> 00:49:45,279
I'm sure you're at some
scintillating dinner,

908
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:46,625
but I really
need you to call me

909
00:49:46,709 --> 00:49:48,291
and talk about
this school incident.

910
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:51,583
It's nothing bad with Henry,
but can you call me, please?

911
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:16,547
HYATT REGENCY AT THE ARCADE.

912
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:19,083
Um, Jonathan Fraser, please.

913
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:21,834
- IS HE A GUEST?
- Yes.

914
00:51:21,917 --> 00:51:24,208
I'M SORRY. I'M NOT
SEEING A JONATHAN FRASER.

915
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:27,542
WOULD IT BE UNDER
ANOTHER NAME?

916
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:30,113
HYATT PLACE
INDEPENDENCE. THIS IS JESSICA.

917
00:51:30,125 --> 00:51:32,959
Uh, Jonathan Fraser's
room, please.

918
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:35,917
I'M SORRY. I DON'T SEE ANY RESERVATION.

919
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,655
HYATT CLEVELAND LEGACY.

920
00:51:37,667 --> 00:51:39,822
Could you put me through to
Jonathan Fraser's room, please?

921
00:51:39,834 --> 00:51:45,000
- UH, CAN YOU SPELL THAT?
- Fraser. F-R-A-S-E-R.

922
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:49,625
UH, YES. TRANSFERRING YOU NOW.

923
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,583
HELLO?

924
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:00,166
- Uh...
- WHO IS THIS?

925
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:03,250
Who are you?

926
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,208
EXCUSE ME?

927
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:08,041
Uh...

928
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,458
Can you, um, put me through
to, uh, Jonathan Fraser, please?

929
00:52:11,542 --> 00:52:14,417
UH, HOLD ON.

930
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,083
JONATHAN?

931
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,417
THIS IS JONATHAN.

932
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:26,041
Uh, J-Jonathan Fraser?

933
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:28,250
YES. WHO IS THIS?

934
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:31,125
I'm, I'm sorry. Um...

935
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:33,041
Sorry.

936
00:54:06,959 --> 00:54:08,839
I don't know
where your father is.

937
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:12,542
He's not returning calls,
he's not returning my emails.

938
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:15,125
Mom, you're acting strange.

939
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:16,667
Don't worry, it's fine.

940
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:20,166
If you know something,
this would be the right time

941
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:21,375
to tell us what it is.

942
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:26,792
Nothing about this
makes any sense.

943
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:29,208
I just need to get the truth.

944
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,041
Did you guys hear?

945
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:33,125
The husband just turned
himself in.

946
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:34,834
Of course it was the husband.

947
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:36,667
It's always the husband.

948
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,166
Exactly how well
did you know Elena Alves?

949
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:43,738
They still
think you're withholding.

950
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:44,750
Why?

951
00:54:45,709 --> 00:54:48,041
Because it's what
rich people do.

952
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:51,750
They conceal the ugly truths.

953
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,035
You think
you can handle everything.

954
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:00,417
This is bigger than you.

955
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,375
Exactly how weak
do you think I am?

956
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:06,417
I will fix this.

957
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:08,208
I'll fix this.

958
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,330
I've got a feeling your daughter
is hiding something.

959
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:13,166
For all I know, she's
an accomplice.

960
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:16,417
I will fix this.

961
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,250
I'll fix this.

962
00:55:22,305 --> 00:56:22,739

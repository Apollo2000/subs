2
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:15,814
Perhaps,
I could suggest that you killed her.

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,958
Are you making a joke?

4
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:19,583
Did you?

5
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:23,833
Haley feels that it's important
that he gets out on bail.

6
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:25,809
You'll be able to contribute
to his defense

7
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,292
in a more meaningful way.

8
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:31,625
I'm
obviously very happy to be out,

9
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,125
and I look forward to
clearing my name in court

10
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:35,583
and proving that I'm innocent.

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,250
We're not in this together.

12
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:40,583
I'm gonna play the role,
the assigned role,

13
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,209
and that's it.

14
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:46,042
You just
committed witness tampering.

15
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,625
You actually did think you
could change his mind, didn't you?

16
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,250
Oh, my God. Of course.

17
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,125
We're gonna do a TV interview.

18
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,083
Let the people
see for themselves.

19
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:55,917
What you want them to see?

20
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:59,292
That in all this,
I lost someone I loved!

21
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,875
Let's not forget that, uh...

22
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,875
that in all this...

23
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,750
I lost someone I love.

24
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,666
So you
still say you didn't kill her?

25
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,334
Well, I say,
I say that because I did not kill her.

26
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:58,334
You loved this
woman. You knew her.

27
00:02:58,417 --> 00:02:59,666
You knew her life.

28
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,125
Do you have some idea who did?

29
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,125
I do. Yeah.

30
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,417
How you doing, Henry?

31
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:21,958
- Good, thanks, sir. - Yeah?

32
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,334
Why were you there that night?

33
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,125
Outside her apartment?

34
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,083
Because I was, I was walking.

35
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:57,167
Like I always do. I
didn't know where I was.

36
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,450
I've told you this many times.

37
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
It is just such a coincidence,
isn't it, that...

38
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,042
I was having an affair with her,

39
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,708
and, and, you were there.

40
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,917
- Just as I was, or just had been.
- Oh, my God.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,541
What are you asking me?

42
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,083
Were you following me?

43
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,000
Was I following you?

44
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,167
Were you?

45
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,583
Were you following me?

46
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,809
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Were you following me, Grace?

47
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,292
- Don't you dare say that...
- Are you Jonathan Fraser?

48
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,517
- I'm sorry. Excuse me. Can we take a selfie with you?
- This is wild!

49
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,250
- Johnny! Right here! - No. No.

50
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,875
- Quick selfie.
- No. No. Come on.

51
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,541
- This is... - Grace! Grace!

52
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,666
How are we doing?

53
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:58,583
What's going on?

54
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,125
Um...

55
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,917
I think we're both, um...

56
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,583
A little pre-trial nerves,
that's all.

57
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,167
Look,
they have a strong case. No question.

58
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,500
But it's circumstantial.

59
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,125
Nobody saw anything.

60
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:20,875
They don't have a murder weapon,

61
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,666
and some of the
science actually helps us.

62
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,625
Their case is vulnerable.

63
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,083
So you keep saying, um,

64
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,541
although with a little more
anxiety each time you say it.

65
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,417
Here's my question.

66
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,958
What's our case, Haley?

67
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:36,417
Because I don't really
have clarity on that.

68
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:40,833
Our defense is wait and see.

69
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:42,666
I told you. It's fluid.

70
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,917
Fluid. Okay, great. That gives
me great confidence. Thank you.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
It depends on
what they throw at us.

72
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,583
Okay. Let's break it down.

73
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,708
Our case is you.

74
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,375
You say you didn't do it.

75
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,417
Explain why you ran.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,167
And our case is you.

77
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,459
You say,
"Believe what he just said."

78
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,833
I can't imagine that the
word of a devoted wife

79
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:07,334
would carry much weight.

80
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:09,125
Are you devoted, Grace?

81
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:11,708
I'm here.

82
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:15,250
Under the circumstances,
I think I deserve a medal.

83
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,583
We have seven women on the jury.

84
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,125
These five...

85
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,459
are educated,
working professionals.

86
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:32,334
Just like you.

87
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,666
These two...

88
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,958
have been cheated
on by their husbands.

89
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,666
Just like you.

90
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,292
And then there's this guy.

91
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,875
He knows better than most that
infidelity doesn't mean murder.

92
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,583
He's having an affair, himself.

93
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,375
How could you
possibly know that?

94
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:53,791
I know all these people.

95
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,833
We piggyback on the algorithms
of both Amazon and Google.

96
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,750
I know where they go
shopping. Where they go to eat.

97
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,042
Where they go on
vacation. We know it all.

98
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,125
We're already targeting their
Instagram and Facebook accounts

99
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,833
with pro-defense news feeds.

100
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:09,500
Is that legal?

101
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:12,917
It's gray enough
to get away with.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,583
We do have one little problem.

103
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,917
The same question keeps
coming up in all our focus trials.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,375
If you didn't do it,
then who did?

105
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,125
We need to offer
up another suspect.

106
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,209
Whoa.

107
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,125
Well, what about his alibi?

108
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,209
Oh, it stinks. I can nick it.

109
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,500
Take his hand, would you please?

110
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,250
I mean, now.

111
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:45,708
- Why? - Because I said so.

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,250
Do it.

113
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,375
Feel his hand.

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,167
Feel hers.

115
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,209
Feel together.

116
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,708
If you two don't feel it,
neither will the jury.

117
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,958
I'm not feeling that.

118
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:27,375
What is the point of this?

119
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:30,209
The point is that you two
need to be one in the room.

120
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:34,042
In effect, you'll be giving
testimony every single day.

121
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,042
Every single
minute of this trial.

122
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,791
The jurors will be
studying you for signs.

123
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,833
Is he human?

124
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:44,209
Does she believe him?

125
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:46,250
Does she still love him?

126
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,125
They will constantly be
taking measure of you.

127
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:55,125
Individually, and jointly.

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,960
Look, juries
don't like to convict good-looking people.

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,541
They certainly don't
like to imprison doctors,

130
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,833
and they don't like
to punish the wealthy.

131
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:34,875
As much as we think we
like to stick it to the rich,

132
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,167
in the end, we don't.

133
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,209
- We never do. -

134
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:40,684
The
idea that jurors don't come into this

135
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:41,833
with preconceived notions,

136
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,541
that's just preposterous.

137
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,417
This case has been
so well-reported,

138
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,250
I might go as far as to say
that these jurors are liars.

139
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:50,583
I mean, to get on this panel,

140
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,066
they would have
had to have declared

141
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,791
that they know
nothing about this case.

142
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,541
Does anybody...

143
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,292
It's just entertainment.

144
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,167
Which you need to be a part of.

145
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:06,791
The jury will know who you are.

146
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,083
Haley says that they
notice everything.

147
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:13,167
Your presence. Your reactions.

148
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,875
- It all matters. - Grace.

149
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,125
You're doing this
for your grandson.

150
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:20,083
I will be at your side,

151
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:23,250
tomorrow and beyond.

152
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:27,500
But the idea that
this best serves Henry

153
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,250
is absolute nonsense.

154
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,750
Murderer or not,
Jonathan must be kept

155
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,666
as far away from
your son as possible.

156
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:13,958
FiveThirtyEight is reporting an 83%
chance of conviction this morning,

157
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:16,000
down three points
from just yesterday...

158
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:42,958
Plans for a last-minute plea
deal either never materialized,

159
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,750
or were squashed.

160
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,541
How is Grace doing?

161
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,833
Are you speaking
to your son-in-law?

162
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,250
Take all the
metal out of your pockets, please.

163
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,000
Thank you.

164
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,292
Next, please.

165
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,750
Step up.

166
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:48,500
Take all the metal out of your pockets,
please.

167
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,125
Murder is ugly business.

168
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:27,583
I must warn you,

169
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:31,917
whatever you've heard,
whatever your predispositions,

170
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:35,083
this one,

171
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,167
it's worse than you think.

172
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,250
The evidence will show that

173
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:43,125
Jonathan Fraser was
having an affair with the victim.

174
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:46,541
That he went to
the victim's studio

175
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:51,417
on the night of January 8th,
2019.

176
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,666
That he sexually penetrated her.

177
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,292
That he then violently,

178
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,583
savagely,

179
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,750
beat her to death.

180
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,500
He then fled the scene
and went into hiding,

181
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,583
before he was captured.

182
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:14,417
Elena Alves was
bludgeoned so badly,

183
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,791
so viciously,

184
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:20,250
she was unrecognizable
to her own husband.

185
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,958
She was first discovered

186
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:26,250
by her 10-year-old son,

187
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:27,750
Miguel.

188
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,583
She was hit with
a blunt instrument

189
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,250
11 times.

190
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:34,125
The medical examiner found that

191
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:38,375
the wounds inflicted were
consistent with a sculpting hammer,

192
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,875
which belonged to the victim.

193
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,292
A hammer which was never found.

194
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,791
It could have been a hammer

195
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,625
like this one.

196
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,541
He turned her skull into mush.

197
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,875
He just kept hitting.

198
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,833
And hitting.

199
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,167
- And hitting. -

200
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,459
- And hitting. -

201
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,375
He just kept hitting.

202
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:44,000
And hitting.

203
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:48,209
- And hitting. -

204
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:55,000
It's worse than you think.

205
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,875
Such a beautiful, vibrant woman.

206
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,292
When bad things
happen to good people,

207
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,625
we want answers.
We want closure.

208
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,042
We want a conviction.

209
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,917
My client is the only option.

210
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,917
That's why the
investigation was so limited.

211
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,666
It wasn't sloppy,

212
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,666
or lazy, or negligent.

213
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,292
It was specifically and
intentionally narrow,

214
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,541
precisely because
evidence of other suspects

215
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,625
would compromise their
one shot at a conviction.

216
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,958
My client

217
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:00,541
made love to Elena Alves,

218
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,042
on January 8th.

219
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,083
His DNA. Semen at the scene.

220
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:09,625
He guarantees reasonable
doubt to any other defendant,

221
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:13,000
so we're not even gonna
look for other possibilities.

222
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,583
He's the only one we can get.

223
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:22,708
Somebody else hit Elena
Alves with that sculpting hammer,

224
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,666
11 times,
like the prosecutor said.

225
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,125
It continued after she was dead.

226
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,791
That's rage.

227
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,334
That's hatred.

228
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,334
- Please. -

229
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,791
A lot of hatred.

230
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,750
A crime of passion.

231
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,791
Primal fury.

232
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,334
We have to wonder.

233
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,791
Fernando Alves had motive.

234
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,666
He had opportunity.
He was there.

235
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,833
Is he the killer?

236
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:02,375
Can we know for sure? No.

237
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:04,708
Why?

238
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:08,125
In part,
because he was never really investigated.

239
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:09,459
Why?

240
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,500
Because his semen was
found inside the victim?

241
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,292
He's the only one we can get.

242
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,167
It shall be him.

243
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,459
It's not.

244
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,393
The problem is, once the defense

245
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,292
comes up with its own theory,

246
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,625
the jury expects

247
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,791
that they're gonna have
some evidence behind it.

248
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,459
And the idea that
the husband did this,

249
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,625
there's no evidence for that,
as far as I know.

250
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,083
Hello?

251
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,375
Hey.

252
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,541
Hey.

253
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,167
How was your day?
Anything interesting happen?

254
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,583
I don't really have
anything to say. I'm...

255
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,250
just sitting here in the quiet.

256
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:12,292
It's a bit oppressive.

257
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,292
I'm a bit lonely.

258
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,167
How's the boy? Is he all right?

259
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,583
Yeah. I mean...

260
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,791
I'm gonna have to take his iPhone away,
because he's...

261
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:28,875
He's devouring all the coverage,
and I...

262
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,125
Well,
good luck with that. I tried it once,

263
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:33,666
and he turned into that
kid from "The Exorcist."

264
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,167
I was so scared, I gave it straight back.

265
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,708
Don't suppose you'd like to...

266
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,083
come over for a cup of tea?

267
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,833
Boat of Frosties?

268
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:51,209
"oeuf à la Jonathan."

269
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:53,334
No.

270
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,875
I do realize how
brutal today was. Um...

271
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,167
Not least because,

272
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,000
well, there you are,
the most private person

273
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,583
on the face of the Earth,

274
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,875
who goes for walks to disappear,

275
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,958
thrust into the middle of that
God-awful circus. I'm sorry.

276
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,083
Um-hmm.

277
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:19,833
But I do think,
I think we can get our anonymity back.

278
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:22,000
Just a question of planning.

279
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,541
I think we should,
uh, let ourselves go,

280
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:28,292
and get really alarmingly
fat. Stop grooming.

281
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,500
I think you should wear
extremely frumpy tweed skirts.

282
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,875
In fact, we both should.

283
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:36,833
I, I think we could have
a very peaceful old age.

284
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:38,375
Mm.

285
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:44,666
Tragic, isn't it? That was my
biggest fantasy when we met.

286
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,000
Getting old with you.

287
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,125
Doing all the, you know,
old stuff. All the...

288
00:22:51,209 --> 00:22:53,875
puttering around the garden,
and...

289
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,125
being spiteful
about young people.

290
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,875
Joining a book club.

291
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,625
But we did that.

292
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:05,791
You got kicked out.

293
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:08,625
I was kicked
out because I was honest.

294
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,125
The book was crap.

295
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:18,958
You still there?

296
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:21,666
Yeah, yeah. Do you remember
those long phone calls?

297
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,250
Even when we had nothing to say,
we just...

298
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:26,334
We didn't hang up.
What was that about?

299
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:28,708
I remember.

300
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,459
Yeah.

301
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:33,209
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

302
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:35,791
Yeah, okay. Bye.

303
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:40,250
Wait. Um, hang on. I...

304
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:41,708
I love you.

305
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:41,541
Hey.

306
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,500
Henry.

307
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:42,250
My God, you scared me.

308
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,625
- What are you doing? - Sitting.

309
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:46,833
Where were you?

310
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,791
Why are you sitting here?

311
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:58,500
- What is it?
- I couldn't sleep in my bed.

312
00:27:03,334 --> 00:27:05,209
Were you thinking about it all?

313
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:09,125
- Yeah. - We've survived so far.

314
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:11,583
And we'll survive
the rest. We will.

315
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,958
What is it?

316
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:20,833
What's wrong?

317
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:23,042
Something's wrong. I can tell.

318
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:26,000
No. No.

319
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,500
I'm fine.

320
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,666
No, you're not.

321
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,209
I saw them.

322
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:43,167
- Hmm? - I saw them together.

323
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,250
At school.

324
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:07,042
Okay.

325
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,083
I should have told you.

326
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:14,250
If I'd told you,
maybe it wouldn't have happened.

327
00:28:14,334 --> 00:28:16,209
Maybe Miguel's father,

328
00:28:16,292 --> 00:28:17,958
or somebody else
who was jealous,

329
00:28:18,042 --> 00:28:19,459
maybe if, if,

330
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:20,666
maybe they found out.

331
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,226
- And maybe if I told you...
- You had nothing to do...

332
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,850
- No. Henry.
- Then they wouldn't have...

333
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:25,666
Shh. Would you just
listen for a minute?

334
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,167
You had nothing to do with
what happened to Miguel's mother.

335
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,018
- You can't say that.
- You could never have put...

336
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,833
- I can.
- No, but Mom, I saw them.

337
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:35,500
And that must have
been very hard for you.

338
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:38,000
They weren't doing anything.

339
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,875
I mean, they weren't kissing,

340
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:43,125
or anything, but...

341
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,583
I just knew,

342
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:48,250
when I saw them.

343
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:50,875
I knew.

344
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:54,167
And when he saw me,

345
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,791
he just smiled.

346
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,000
Like it was nothing.

347
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:04,334
He saw that I saw.

348
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:08,334
He knew that I knew.

349
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:10,666
Well,
he put you in a terrible position.

350
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,209
A position no child
should ever be in.

351
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:20,459
- I wanted to tell you.
- Mm-hmm.

352
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:23,083
I wanted to tell you, but...

353
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:24,666
I just...

354
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:28,958
I felt like he trusted me.

355
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,334
It's all right.

356
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:53,083
You let him see.

357
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:56,625
You let him see you with her.

358
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,750
At his school.

359
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,250
And you know that he saw you.

360
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,814
- You know he did, and he fucking worships you.
- No.

361
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:04,459
He would do anything for you.

362
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,185
Anything. You know that.

363
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:08,541
No more lies, Jonathan.

364
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,708
I got it. Yeah. Yeah.

365
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:12,375
Jonathan.

366
00:30:12,459 --> 00:30:14,750
- At school. - Grace, Jonathan.

367
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:16,500
We're about to take
on the lead detective.

368
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:19,042
He needs to be my focus,
and he needs to be yours.

369
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,666
What,
I'm meant to go out there now?

370
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,684
- And sit out there like this?
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

371
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:23,767
Haley.

372
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:26,083
Jonathan, why?

373
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:28,833
- You did that to our son.
- Jonathan.

374
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,125
We got to the scene at 8:57 a.m.

375
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,500
Nine minutes after the
husband made the 911 call,

376
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,167
and about 30 minutes

377
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,833
after the body was
discovered by the son.

378
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:45,708
And what did you find?

379
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:48,583
We discovered a woman, deceased.

380
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:50,375
Her head badly lacerated,

381
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:51,958
her skull crushed.

382
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:55,000
Identified as Elena
Alves by her husband.

383
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:58,625
Though any facial recognition
was difficult to discern.

384
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:02,750
Yes. I'd like to show
you a series of photographs.

385
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,917
I'm sorry, I can't...

386
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,167
Do these
photographs fairly and accurately

387
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,125
represent the crime
scene as you found it?

388
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:28,791
They do.

389
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:30,917
Thank you.

390
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:43,708
Order in the court.

391
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:45,708
It's okay. It's okay.

392
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,625
The forensic evidence you spoke of,
Detective.

393
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:51,708
My client's sperm, saliva,
and skin fragments.

394
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:54,209
They could all be the
product of Jonathan Fraser's

395
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:56,750
and Elena Alves'
having sex. True?

396
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:59,375
That would not explain
her crushed skull.

397
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,167
No, it wouldn't.

398
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,042
And yet,
when asked by Ms. Stamper

399
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:06,042
to give evidence as to
who crushed that skull,

400
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:09,750
the evidence you gave
to incriminate my client is...

401
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,250
sperm, saliva,
and skin fragments.

402
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:13,917
And his bloody footprints.

403
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,250
Which he could have left if
he'd returned to the scene

404
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,583
after she was killed.

405
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:20,209
And the fact that
your client fled.

406
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:22,334
Yes, he fled.

407
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,750
I suppose when we have two
people come upon the scene,

408
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:28,833
one flees, the other doesn't,

409
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:32,042
it's usually the one who
flees who gets put on trial.

410
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,583
It's not as simple as that.

411
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:35,917
In this case,

412
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,167
it is.

413
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:41,292
There were no
eyewitnesses to this crime.

414
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,375
No security cameras
in this building

415
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:44,791
to monitor the
comings and goings.

416
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:47,125
To see if anybody
else came or went.

417
00:32:47,209 --> 00:32:48,250
There were not.

418
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:49,625
The footprints,

419
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,791
fingerprints,
and saliva found at the scene,

420
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:54,791
belonging to two people.

421
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,791
My client, and the husband.

422
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,268
Fernando Alves went to the scene

423
00:32:58,292 --> 00:33:00,167
after his son alerted him.

424
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,583
He went to his wife's aid.

425
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:02,726
His DNA.

426
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,190
The DNA that
belonged to the husband,

427
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,583
Fernando Alves.

428
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,167
You cannot scientifically

429
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,583
exclude the possibility

430
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:09,958
it was left the night before.

431
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:11,708
Can you?

432
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,809
- Did you not hear my question, Detective?
- I did.

433
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:18,791
I did hear your question.

434
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:21,500
And I also heard your
opening statement.

435
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,958
It was offensive.

436
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,000
We don't stick our
heads into sand

437
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:27,541
in order to jam through
quick convictions.

438
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:29,666
An innocent person
got slaughtered.

439
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,226
Our intent was to
find out who did it.

440
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,625
Our only pursuit
here was the truth.

441
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:37,791
- However much that disappoints you.
- And the truth is...

442
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:40,000
- that man's DNA...
- He had an alibi.

443
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:42,334
- A man with motive.
- His son was with him.

444
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:44,209
They were together
at the family apartment

445
00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:45,833
over 10 blocks away.

446
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:47,583
His 10-year-old son.

447
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,417
He was awake the whole time?

448
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,167
There are cameras in
and outside the building

449
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,167
that would have
shown if Mr. Alves left.

450
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,833
Cameras in the back,
as well as the front.

451
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:01,059
He could have gone out the back.

452
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,541
There is no evidence,

453
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,750
either by security cameras,

454
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:08,541
street cameras,
or eyewitness accounts,

455
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:12,666
that place Mr. Alves on,
or around the scene that night.

456
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,666
Street cameras, however,

457
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,791
did capture your client.

458
00:34:23,334 --> 00:34:24,917
Anybody else?

459
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,125
No.

460
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,459
Where was this taken?

461
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,417
A full block away.

462
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,625
- From the scene?
- Yes.

463
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:51,250
At what time?

464
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:53,042
A little past 9:30 p.m.

465
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:56,750
- The night of the murder?
- Yes.

466
00:34:56,833 --> 00:35:00,209
A block from the scene,
and at the time of the murder.

467
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,875
Who is this in the
picture? Do you know?

468
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:07,209
Grace Fraser.

469
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:09,000
The defendant's wife.

470
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:12,541
The defendant's wife.

471
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:15,708
Near the scene,
at around the time.

472
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,833
Gee.

473
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:20,500
Are you suggesting
she killed her?

474
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,666
I'm actually not.

475
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,417
What I am suggesting
is that you just lied.

476
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,292
I'm suggesting that you had
evidence of another person,

477
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,125
one with a lot of motive,

478
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:32,958
being at or near the scene
around the time of death,

479
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:35,625
and you never bothered to
question her as a suspect.

480
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:36,958
We absolutely questioned her.

481
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:38,250
As a suspect?

482
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:39,875
You gave her Miranda?

483
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:45,292
Did you advise Grace
Fraser of her Miranda rights

484
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,583
before questioning
her as a suspect?

485
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,833
We did not.

486
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:54,250
Wouldn't that be the law if you
considered her to be a suspect?

487
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:55,708
To read her her rights?

488
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:58,500
It would be,
if she was a suspect.

489
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:00,000
But she wasn't.

490
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:04,875
We had security cameras
capturing her walking.

491
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:06,666
Continuing on.

492
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,417
We had and still have
no reason to believe

493
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,000
she ever entered the dwelling,

494
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:13,583
nor there was any
of her DNA present.

495
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,292
If her DNA had been present,

496
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,125
you would have
considered her a suspect?

497
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,042
Of course. But it wasn't.

498
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:24,666
His was.

499
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,334
Did you ever read
Fernando his rights?

500
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:30,167
You made an exception
for Fernando Alves.

501
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,583
Was it because admitting
your suspicions of him

502
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:36,583
might weaken your
chances of getting him?

503
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:46,875
Fernando Alves

504
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,375
had an alibi.

505
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:54,459
Yes. His sleeping son.

506
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,875
Dad. Yeah.

507
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:14,125
They're calling, uh,
the detective a squirmy worm.

508
00:37:14,209 --> 00:37:17,042
They're saying, like,
"Can't make the prosecutor feel good

509
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:20,583
- having your whole case ride on a squirmy worm."
- Turn the phone off.

510
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,209
Turn the phone off.

511
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:25,334
Just turn it off. Thank you.

512
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:28,209
It's not often that we get to eat together,
the three of us.

513
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,625
Here we are.

514
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,042
He'll pour it. Thank you.

515
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:36,500
Thank you.

516
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:39,917
- -Did you
know she was gonna do that?

517
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,125
Pull up that picture?

518
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:43,459
I did.

519
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:48,375
And you're okay being a suspect?

520
00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:50,500
I'm not a suspect.

521
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:52,042
That was Haley's point. That...

522
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:54,459
They should have taken
a more serious look at me,

523
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:57,292
just as they should have taken
a more serious look at Mr. Alves.

524
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,625
And they didn't. They just
had tunnel vision for your father.

525
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:06,375
So, Hen, uh, your mom told me

526
00:38:06,459 --> 00:38:08,958
that you saw me and...

527
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,708
Me and Elena Alves at school.

528
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:22,083
And I'm really sorry about that.

529
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,708
I behaved incredibly badly.

530
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:26,125
It was repugnant of me

531
00:38:26,209 --> 00:38:28,708
to allow you to
witness anything.

532
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,875
I think we're gonna win.

533
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,375
Do you?

534
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,500
I, I don't know.

535
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:46,083
Thank you.

536
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:53,125
I don't... I don't know,

537
00:38:53,209 --> 00:38:55,459
but I think we might have
made a colossal mistake.

538
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:59,459
I think Mr. Alves is
obviously very sympathetic,

539
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,292
and there's no real evidence
to show his guilt. So...

540
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:09,000
Did you mean what you said?

541
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:10,958
If we survived this far,

542
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:12,459
we can survive anything?

543
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:13,625
I said that?

544
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:15,791
Oh.

545
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,292
If we can survive this trial,

546
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:20,167
I think this family can survive.

547
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,642
- All right, but...
- Don't you?

548
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:22,875
Well, I...

549
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:25,118
- We need to talk about that another time.
- No.

550
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,292
I want to talk about it now.

551
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,559
No,
we're not talking about it now.

552
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:29,666
- It's not the time.
- You tell your patients

553
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,917
that marriages can go on,

554
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,809
- even after somebody cheats.
- Henry, come on.

555
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,750
You tell them that marriages

556
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,541
can even sometimes
grow stronger.

557
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,345
- Is that a lie?
- I said it's not the time.

558
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,143
- Is that a lie, or do you believe that?
- Henry, stop. Stop. Shh.

559
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:42,708
You would never
cheat again. Would you?

560
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:44,917
- No. No.
- You would never cheat...

561
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,083
- See? See? - Henry.

562
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:00,625
We can still be a family.

563
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:04,917
Uh, you know,
we could even get a dog.

564
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,167
Finally.

565
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,541
I'll take care of it,

566
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:10,000
so you won't have to worry
about what happened before.

567
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:12,583
What do you mean?

568
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:16,625
What do you mean?

569
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,250
I asked you a question.

570
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:23,708
What do you mean?

571
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:28,042
Mom told me about the dog thing.

572
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,292
About your family blaming you.

573
00:40:39,334 --> 00:40:41,334
Well,
she shouldn't have done that.

574
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:52,375
Uh, you know,
I'm gonna get some air.

575
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:53,750
What did I say?

576
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:55,250
Mom, what did I say?

577
00:40:55,334 --> 00:40:57,958
It's all right. Just wait here.

578
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,334
Jonathan.

579
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,541
Jonathan!

580
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:17,459
I'm sorry. It was just
the stress of it all. I, I...

581
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,042
Taking its toll, I suppose.

582
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:22,541
I don't believe you.

583
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:26,250
What was that about?

584
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:28,625
Jonathan, what...

585
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,583
was that about?

586
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:37,083
I, I didn't kill the family dog.

587
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:40,209
We never had a dog.

588
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,375
I had a sister. I, I...

589
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:48,250
I, I killed the family sister.

590
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:52,417
What?

591
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:55,167
Katie.

592
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,541
Um,

593
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,209
Katie the Kitten, we called her.

594
00:41:58,292 --> 00:42:00,292
Um, I was babysitting her.

595
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:02,917
I was 14. She was, uh,

596
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,375
four.

597
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:06,167
And, uh,

598
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,042
somehow she sneaked
out of the house

599
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,292
while I was in the
kitchen making a...

600
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,750
a cheese and tomato sandwich.

601
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,167
I heard the sound of the brakes,

602
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,666
and then, um, another sound

603
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,666
that I will never...

604
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,042
uh, get out of my head.

605
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:30,625
Your sister got hit by a car?

606
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:33,334
It was your sister?

607
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,541
You should add
that to my list of lies.

608
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,250
Except I also tell
myself this one.

609
00:42:37,334 --> 00:42:38,917
You know,
that it wasn't my fault.

610
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,917
That, uh,
it was just an unfortunate thing,

611
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,375
but, of course,
it was my fucking fault,

612
00:42:45,459 --> 00:42:47,334
because Katie...

613
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:50,167
Katie the Kitten was
put under my charge.

614
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:52,750
And she...

615
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:56,083
And she got hit by a car when
I was making myself a snack.

616
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,708
How is it you have
never told me this?

617
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:05,708
Because we don't...
We don't talk of it.

618
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,833
You know. Ever.

619
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:09,167
Ever.

620
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:14,125
It's probably, uh...

621
00:43:14,209 --> 00:43:15,917
why I went into
pediatric medicine.

622
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,666
I don't know. You're,
you're the shrink.

623
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,750
You know better than me,
but, uh, I will tell you this.

624
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:22,917
Every... every patient I treat,

625
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
every s-single one...

626
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:28,875
Is... is little Katie.

627
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,666
Yeah.

628
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:05,833
All this time,
he was carrying that burden,

629
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:07,375
and I never saw.

630
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:10,666
In your professional opinion,

631
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,708
is a past trauma like that

632
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:17,625
likely to render a person

633
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:20,292
more compassionate?

634
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:22,500
Or more psychotic?

635
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,042
I tried calling his mother.

636
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:35,791
A few times.

637
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,708
And she never returned.

638
00:44:39,417 --> 00:44:42,875
Even his family doesn't want
to have anything to do with him.

639
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:00,466
Turn, please.

640
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:04,541
- -Security guard: Thank you.

641
00:45:07,417 --> 00:45:08,875
Turn, please.

642
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,791
Thank you.

643
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:19,083
- - Morning.

644
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:22,958
- - Turn, please.

645
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:30,958
- Thank you, sir. - Yeah.

646
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:39,791
Turn, please.

647
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,958
After she hadn't come home,

648
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:51,209
or replied to any
of my calls or texts,

649
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:55,625
my son Miguel,
he went to check on her.

650
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:58,209
I,
I thought he'd gone to school.

651
00:45:58,292 --> 00:46:00,042
I was just having a busy morning

652
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:01,750
with the baby. She wasn't there,
so,

653
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:04,250
I told him to just go on.

654
00:46:04,334 --> 00:46:08,541
See himself to the
bus. And he didn't.

655
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,875
He went to see his mom.

656
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:15,334
He went to the studio.

657
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:16,750
Yes.

658
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,708
And then you went there.

659
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:20,541
Yes.

660
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:22,334
After he'd come back.

661
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:24,209
He was...

662
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,250
crying, screaming.

663
00:46:26,334 --> 00:46:28,875
- And so you went there, and...
- Yeah.

664
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:31,708
What did you find?

665
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:39,334
It's...

666
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:42,209
Elena.

667
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,750
My wife.

668
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:49,708
She was just lying there.

669
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:52,042
There was just blood everywhere.

670
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:54,125
Her face,

671
00:46:54,209 --> 00:46:56,292
head. They were like mush.

672
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:00,250
So you called the police?

673
00:47:00,334 --> 00:47:03,334
Yeah. I called the police,
and...

674
00:47:06,209 --> 00:47:07,666
ambulance.

675
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,750
Thank you.

676
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,042
Mr. Alves.

677
00:47:29,209 --> 00:47:31,666
I cannot imagine your pain, sir.

678
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,250
That's a lie.

679
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:35,417
I'm sorry?

680
00:47:37,459 --> 00:47:39,375
You feel nothing for me.

681
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:42,083
Or my pain.

682
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,209
You tried to blame me.

683
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:48,167
I actually didn't.

684
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,583
I simply tried to point out

685
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,042
that you cannot be
eliminated as a suspect.

686
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:54,000
That others cannot
be eliminated.

687
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:57,000
For that, you should direct your
contempt to the police. Not me.

688
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,625
- Objection. - Sustained.

689
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:04,209
See, my wife is dead,
and, and you're just...

690
00:48:04,292 --> 00:48:06,167
playing games.

691
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,625
That's it.

692
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:12,083
You disgust me.

693
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:17,292
I don't mean to
incite your rage.

694
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:21,541
You spoke of your love of Elena.

695
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:23,541
You loved her very much.

696
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:25,917
She was everything to me.

697
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,666
I'm sensing that.

698
00:48:29,292 --> 00:48:32,459
But you weren't everything to her.

699
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:34,167
And there were other men.

700
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,666
- Including my client.
- No, no, no.

701
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,292
There were no other men.

702
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:39,791
He was the only one.

703
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,393
- How can you know that, sir?
- Well, because I do.

704
00:48:42,417 --> 00:48:45,708
Did you know that she was
romantically involved with Jonathan?

705
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:57,250
Elena was able to keep
part of herself from you.

706
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,375
Maybe that's why she
kept a separate apartment.

707
00:48:59,459 --> 00:49:00,750
To keep part of her separate.

708
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:02,666
No, that's not what that was.

709
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,209
That was an
apartment for her art,

710
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:06,250
because she was an artist,
and...

711
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:09,417
And she needed to focus
and she needed to work.

712
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,625
That's what that
apartment was for.

713
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:14,583
It wasn't just for her art.

714
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:17,833
She'd been using it to
have an affair with my client.

715
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,334
Did you know, sir?

716
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,958
Did you know, sir?

717
00:49:27,042 --> 00:49:28,708
Not at first.

718
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:32,000
But at some point?

719
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:39,625
And at some point,
you learned that your daughter...

720
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:42,500
That my client was
the biological father.

721
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:46,917
That must have been
an awful thing to learn.

722
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:53,958
Forgive me, but I have to ask.

723
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:57,417
Was your wife receiving
any psychiatric treatment?

724
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,625
Objection.

725
00:49:58,708 --> 00:49:59,958
Overruled.

726
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:01,417
Was she?

727
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:06,042
- Yes. - What for? Do you know?

728
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:09,666
You are vile.

729
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:13,209
My question only goes to who
else could have possibly done this.

730
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:15,375
We cannot rule out
that she saw other men.

731
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:16,833
That maybe one such man

732
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:20,042
had the capacity for
explosive jealousy,

733
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:21,875
- or violent rage. - Objection!

734
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:24,435
These are the very
questions you'd want the police asking.

735
00:50:24,459 --> 00:50:26,767
- Am I right to find out who did this?
- Your honor...

736
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:29,642
- He did this! He did this!
- Your, your honor, may I approach...

737
00:50:31,209 --> 00:50:32,666
Mr. Alves,

738
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,375
are you receiving
any psychiatric help?

739
00:50:35,459 --> 00:50:37,351
- Objection!
- I don't mean to be insensitive.

740
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:39,000
Well,
you're doing a great job of it.

741
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:40,708
You have put this
witness on the stand.

742
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:43,000
- Your honor, may I approach?
- It's cross-examination.

743
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:45,791
Mr. Alves,
what you have to be going through,

744
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,042
are you getting any help?

745
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:49,583
Your honor...

746
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:56,375
How do you think it's going?

747
00:50:56,459 --> 00:50:58,334
Your objective opinion?

748
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:01,708
Look, to, to me,

749
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:04,833
it's more likely
than not that...

750
00:51:04,917 --> 00:51:06,583
that Jonathan did it.

751
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,292
But more likely
isn't the standard.

752
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:13,042
It's beyond all
reasonable doubt.

753
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:14,375
That puts you ahead.

754
00:51:14,459 --> 00:51:16,500
That,
and he has the best attorney

755
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:18,167
money can buy. So...

756
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:22,958
Grace, I...

757
00:51:25,209 --> 00:51:28,000
I probably shouldn't ask you this,
but...

758
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:33,042
What are you actually thinking?

759
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,125
Yeah. You shouldn't ask that.

760
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:33,000
Another reason I
couldn't have done it.

761
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:39,042
I loved her.

762
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:43,250
Quite madly.

763
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:50,292
Not something I could say to Grace,
you see.

764
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:53,791
It didn't diminish my love
for my wife. It was just, uh...

765
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,666
different.

766
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,917
It's going well,
but you'll need to testify.

767
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,125
We need to account
for why you fled.

768
00:53:04,209 --> 00:53:05,625
Only you can do that.

769
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:08,059
Don't pretend to be honest,
because you've told too many lies.

770
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:09,976
Don't pretend to be a good husband,
a decent father,

771
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,833
because you are
arguably neither.

772
00:53:11,917 --> 00:53:13,833
We don't need to
give them a good man.

773
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:16,375
Just someone who
didn't commit murder.

774
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,833
Janet.

775
00:53:57,917 --> 00:53:59,417
Hello.

776
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,833
Grace.

777
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:06,042
- What time is it there?
- It's four a.m.

778
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08,334
I couldn't sleep, so,

779
00:54:08,417 --> 00:54:11,791
I thought I would use
the time to return your call.

780
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:13,250
Well, thank you.

781
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:17,583
Thank you. I'm sorry it's...

782
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:19,958
been so long since we've...

783
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:21,917
Since the wedding, Grace.

784
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,292
We haven't seen each
other since the wedding.

785
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:29,375
Jonathan's doing, I realize.

786
00:54:29,459 --> 00:54:30,958
How is he?

787
00:54:31,042 --> 00:54:33,209
I can't imagine well.

788
00:54:33,292 --> 00:54:36,083
No. None of us are doing great,
so...

789
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:38,250
Is. - I'm sorry?

790
00:54:38,334 --> 00:54:40,875
None of us is doing great.

791
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:43,500
"None" is a
contraction of "not one."

792
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:45,417
It's singular.

793
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,666
The verb is singular.

794
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:52,625
And, um, Henry.

795
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:56,750
He must be looking like
a grown man by now?

796
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,209
He's getting there.

797
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:04,292
I've sent you some pictures,
but, uh...

798
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:07,375
Grace, I don't blame you.

799
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:11,833
It was Jonathan's decision

800
00:55:11,917 --> 00:55:14,334
to no longer be
part of his family.

801
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:18,666
A decision he made
long before he met you.

802
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,791
Well, I'm just trying to piece
everything together right now.

803
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:23,958
You can probably understand.

804
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:26,250
Yes, I can.

805
00:55:26,334 --> 00:55:28,334
I just...

806
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:32,375
learned that Jonathan
had a younger sister.

807
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:35,958
Katie.

808
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:39,125
And that he feels
responsible for her death.

809
00:55:40,917 --> 00:55:43,167
As he should.

810
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,125
He was responsible.

811
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:48,209
He allowed a four-year-old

812
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:52,125
to wander out
onto a busy street.

813
00:55:52,209 --> 00:55:55,042
Where she was struck dead.

814
00:55:57,375 --> 00:56:00,042
That must have been
unspeakably awful.

815
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,167
It was.

816
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:05,250
Janet, um...

817
00:56:05,334 --> 00:56:08,292
The grief and the guilt,
and, and...

818
00:56:08,375 --> 00:56:10,292
Jonathan growing up with that.

819
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:12,917
Did he ever get
professional help?

820
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,917
He did not.

821
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:18,375
He suffered from neither.

822
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:22,875
No guilt, no grief.

823
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:24,875
We kept waiting for it.

824
00:56:24,958 --> 00:56:29,250
We, uh,
surrounded him with family support,

825
00:56:29,334 --> 00:56:32,209
certain that once
the shock wore off,

826
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:34,459
the suffering would begin.

827
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:38,625
But, it never did.

828
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:44,625
Jonathan doesn't
know how to suffer.

829
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:50,625
After his sister was killed,

830
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:53,917
he never even said he was sorry.

831
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,875
After his sister was killed,

832
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:58,958
he never said
another word about it.

833
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:03,250
He just went on living here,

834
00:57:03,334 --> 00:57:05,917
until he was old
enough to leave,

835
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,833
and never come back.

836
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:12,209
Which is what he did.

837
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:19,417
Her name was Katie,
and he was responsible.

838
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,143
- ...that he allowed her to wander out of the house...
- She was four.

839
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:26,083
And that after,
he suffered neither guilt nor grief.

840
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:28,167
Grace, I want to be very clear.

841
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,833
I want to understand
exactly what you're telling me.

842
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:32,917
You're saying that
Jonathan's mother

843
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,292
said he suffered from neither guilt,
nor grief.

844
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:40,417
In essence, his own mother

845
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,833
identified him as a sociopath.

846
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:46,708
Yes.

847
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:49,917
Jesus.

848
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:02,125
I'm willing to testify. I'm
just gonna tell the truth.

849
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,541
But what is your truth?

850
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:10,393
Could he have gone there
that night for some reason?

851
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:13,083
Are you actually
accusing our son?

852
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:17,500
Should this come to light,
it is game over.

853
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:21,500
You discovered Elena
Alves. You didn't call the police?

854
01:01:21,917 --> 01:01:23,875
I panicked. You see.
I panicked. I panicked.

855
01:01:24,459 --> 01:01:26,779
Do you swear the
testimony you're about to give...

856
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:31,791
is the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

857
01:01:32,459 --> 01:01:34,292
You should be ashamed!

858
01:01:35,417 --> 01:01:37,083
Please answer
the question, doctor.

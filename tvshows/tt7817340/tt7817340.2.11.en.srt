1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,681
Previously on "New Amsterdam"...

2
00:00:01,683 --> 00:00:03,518
I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,347
I'm gonna move back in with my parents.

4
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:06,461
In Idaho.

5
00:00:06,486 --> 00:00:09,287
Maybe you can move in with me.

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,490
What do you think would happen

7
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:13,758
if you stopped helping people?

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,759
What would they see?

9
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:18,062
They would see
what a complete loser I am...

10
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:21,165
Corny, nerdy, fat.

11
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:25,336
San Francisco's sounding
really good right about now.

12
00:00:25,338 --> 00:00:26,470
Let's get out of here.

13
00:00:26,472 --> 00:00:29,840
The pattern of your behavior
can actually be indicative

14
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:32,610
of a more substantive
diagnosis per the DSM-5.

15
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:33,709
Such as?

16
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:35,646
Narcissistic Personality Disorder?

17
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:37,848
Effective immediately,
you are stripped of your title

18
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,417
as cochair of oncology,

19
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:42,286
as well as your duties
as deputy medical director.

20
00:01:07,513 --> 00:01:09,180
At the center, where they belong,

21
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:10,281
so I am introducing

22
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:12,149
a new initiative to change that,

23
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:14,452
one that reconnects
all of our doctors to our...

24
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:31,779
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

25
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:33,204
Ligon did what?

26
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:34,305
I know.

27
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:37,174
Who could've guessed
that having sex with my doctor

28
00:01:37,176 --> 00:01:39,910
and fellow drug addict
would turn out poorly?

29
00:01:39,912 --> 00:01:41,879
Are you okay?

30
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:43,481
No, not really.

31
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:45,649
But is it crazy to think
that this all happened

32
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:48,419
at exactly the same time
I get a large chunk of money

33
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:49,887
from my family's trust?

34
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:52,356
What, you think the money's cursed?

35
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:53,824
I think bad things happen

36
00:01:53,826 --> 00:01:55,526
anytime my family does anything,

37
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:58,362
but especially
when there's money involved.

38
00:01:58,364 --> 00:01:59,897
How much are we talking?

39
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:01,432
Whatever amount is in your head,

40
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:02,466
times it by ten,

41
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:06,203
and then taint it with
toxic family relationships.

42
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,439
Well, just buy a house in the Hamptons

43
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:10,908
so we can grow old
and "Grey Gardens" together.

44
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,444
How are you holding up?

45
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:15,379
Great.

46
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:18,549
It's good.
I've got so much time freed up.

47
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:20,665
Helen.

48
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:22,072
It's horrible.

49
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:23,687
Honestly, I thought
that it would be easier,

50
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:27,625
but I feel like I'm trespassing
in my own hospital.

51
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:28,926
But I'm not gonna dwell on it.

52
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:30,294
I'm just gonna keep my head down

53
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:32,730
and just focus on my patients.

54
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:34,799
Well, look,

55
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:37,735
at least they still let you
monitor my drug tests.

56
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:38,869
Yes.

57
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:41,238
Still allowed to watch you pee.

58
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:47,645
Hey, missed you
at the department head meeting

59
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:48,479
this morning.

60
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:50,614
Oh, I'm sure it went swimmingly.

61
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:52,249
How's my little munchkin doing today?

62
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:53,384
I don't like you being out of the loop.

63
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:54,618
I didn't get to tell you my big idea.

64
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,535
Is Luna going on rounds?

65
00:02:55,537 --> 00:02:56,987
Everyone loves seeing baby boss.

66
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:59,391
Actually, it's time
for our six-month checkup,

67
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:00,491
so we're headed to the Ped's wing

68
00:03:00,493 --> 00:03:01,826
for some important vaccines.

69
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:03,327
Gosh. Have fun.

70
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:04,929
Wait, I didn't get to
tell you my big idea.

71
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,597
- No need.
- But I want to tell you.

72
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,774
I have patients.

73
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:09,253
Sounds like you have zero patience,

74
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:10,401
with a C.

75
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:11,735
See what I did there? It's a pun.

76
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:14,238
It's hilarious. Gotta go, bye.

77
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,973
Terrible.

78
00:03:18,244 --> 00:03:19,944
- Hi.
- Just one sec.

79
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:27,418
I can take that.

80
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,020
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

81
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:31,689
That was beautiful.

82
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:32,823
Hot chai is ready.

83
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:36,026
Oh, thank you, I just...
I have to rush off to work.

84
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:37,928
Okay, then I'll quickly show you my home.

85
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,969
Okay.

86
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:40,798
- This is the kitchen.
- Yeah.

87
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,301
And this is the living room.

88
00:03:44,303 --> 00:03:45,469
Kay.

89
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:46,937
- That's my mandir.
- Mm-hmm.

90
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:51,108
And this will be your room.

91
00:03:52,678 --> 00:03:54,845
I-It... it appears occupied.

92
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:57,014
Yes, this was Rohan's room.

93
00:03:57,016 --> 00:03:58,282
You don't say.

94
00:03:58,284 --> 00:03:59,783
When he first left home,

95
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:02,520
his mother insisted that
we leave the room as it is,

96
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:04,622
in case he needed to come back.

97
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:06,938
We will squeeze you in.

98
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,628
And this is his famous posters wall.

99
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,696
- Right.
- You cannot touch these.

100
00:04:12,698 --> 00:04:14,532
- Come with me.
- Kay.

101
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:16,800
I have to show you something.

102
00:04:24,977 --> 00:04:28,712
And my wife's sewing room
is perfect for the baby.

103
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:32,416
- Where will the crib go?
- Oh...

104
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:34,852
No need to change much.

105
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:36,053
Oh.

106
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,592
What about here?

107
00:04:41,594 --> 00:04:43,678
Uh, great.

108
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,763
- I'll show you the bathroom now.
- Kay.

109
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:04,628
_

110
00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:07,418
_

111
00:05:09,555 --> 00:05:11,355
Elandra Siefert, 33-year-old woman.

112
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:13,390
Restrained driver in a MVA.
Multiple crush injuries.

113
00:05:13,392 --> 00:05:14,725
- What do you got?
- Hemothorax.

114
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:16,760
I suspect a lacerated pulmonary artery.

115
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:18,128
She's losing blood by the pint.

116
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,296
When can we get her to the OR?

117
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:21,865
Tying off an arterial pumper
now, then she's all yours.

118
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,767
Ma'am why don't you come with
me so the doctors can work?

119
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:25,035
No, she's my sister.

120
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:26,637
Floyd, this is gonna be a long surgery.

121
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,705
You sure you're up for it?

122
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:29,873
Wound's healed, I'll be fine.
What about you?

123
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,375
Wound's healed. I'll be fine.

124
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:34,639
B/P 80/40 and dropping.
Tachy at 130 and rising.

125
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:36,413
- Yo, we gotta go.
- Okay, I'm almost there.

126
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:37,815
Breathing pattern ineffective.

127
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,583
Okay, she's all yours.

128
00:05:39,585 --> 00:05:41,385
Is Elandra on any medications,

129
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:42,553
or has she had any health scares?

130
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:43,887
No meds. She was a Marine.

131
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,990
She's crazy healthy. Please help her!

132
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:47,558
Okay, all right, we're gonna
do everything we can.

133
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,726
- Let's go!
- Incoming!

134
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:49,960
- Out of the way.
- Trey Masterson.

135
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:51,895
18, with an anaphylactic reaction.

136
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:54,138
Epi Auto Injector times two
with no response.

137
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,466
High-dose Epi.

138
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:58,802
Original B/P 130 over 70,
down to 110 over 50.

139
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:01,572
Heart rate 148. O2 sats 84 and dropping.

140
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:02,940
Okay, doubling dose.

141
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:06,076
- Heart rate at 160.
- Okay, but O2's up to 90.

142
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:08,612
- We got him.
- Trey?

143
00:06:08,614 --> 00:06:10,914
Trey, has anything like this
ever happened to you before?

144
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,559
- No.
- Okay. Any medical history

145
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:13,617
we should know about?

146
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:16,587
I had lymphoma.

147
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:17,788
Four years ago.

148
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,823
- Okay.
- Dr. Sharpe treated me.

149
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:21,425
Okay, okay, we're gonna run some tests

150
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:23,160
to figure out what caused
this allergic reaction,

151
00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:24,962
and let's page Sharpe.

152
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:31,001
- Hey.
- Hi, Dr. Goodwin.

153
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:32,959
I'll let Dr. Elder know you're here.

154
00:06:35,272 --> 00:06:36,761
Thanks.

155
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,423
Oh.

156
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:49,520
Is anyone...

157
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:50,721
Oh, sorry.

158
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:52,229
Thanks.

159
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,858
Are you gonna walk for me?

160
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,027
Are we walking today?

161
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:00,164
How old is yours?

162
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,699
Six months.

163
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,567
Walking's right around the corner.

164
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:05,035
Yeah, so I've heard.

165
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:08,238
I keep putting her
on the treadmill, but no luck.

166
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,874
Well, this wobbly girl is Bobbi.

167
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:13,977
Oh. Hey there.

168
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,214
This sweet girl is Luna.

169
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,019
You know, it's nice that the adults

170
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:23,187
don't have to put the qualifiers

171
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:24,421
before our names too.

172
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:27,556
Actually, I think we'd treat
each other better if we did.

173
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:32,996
Hi, I'm "anxious in hospitals" Alice.

174
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:37,607
I'm "hiding behind my smile" Max.

175
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:45,509
Hey. Have you heard Max's big idea?

176
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:47,111
No screens?

177
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:48,679
That is a big idea.

178
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,214
No screens in patient rooms,

179
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:52,182
no tablets, no computers.

180
00:07:52,184 --> 00:07:54,017
He's not serious, is he?

181
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:55,953
He's definitely serious.

182
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:57,855
But we don't actually
have to do it, do we?

183
00:07:57,857 --> 00:07:59,690
You most certainly do, and not only that,

184
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:01,925
but as chair, it's your job
to share this new rule

185
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:03,260
with your entire department.

186
00:08:03,262 --> 00:08:05,262
One down. Good luck with the rest.

187
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,932
- Dr. Sharpe.
- Dr. Baker.

188
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:11,769
Don't say my name nicely when
it's clear how furious I am.

189
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:12,636
This is unacceptable.

190
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:14,138
I'm not sure what you're referring to.

191
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,139
No screens?

192
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:16,240
I had nothing to do with that.

193
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,075
Then veto it! We need screens.

194
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:19,209
This isn't the Stone Age.

195
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:21,311
As I'm certain you've heard,
I'm no longer management.

196
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:23,046
I am just a doctor like yourself,

197
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:26,083
keeping my head down
and focusing on my patients.

198
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,653
Dr. Sharpe.

199
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:31,822
No screens during any patient encounters

200
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:33,257
is, frankly, outlandish.

201
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:34,465
Dr. Eliraz, long time.

202
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:36,760
- I'm doing well. Thank you for asking.
- Dr. Sharpe.

203
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:38,262
Without looking at a computer screen,

204
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:40,063
I can't keep my patients' names straight.

205
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:41,156
I suspect that's why

206
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:42,599
Dr. Goodwin instated the policy.

207
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:44,568
More face-to-face emotional engagement.

208
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,603
Since I was an intern,
I've always had a screen

209
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:47,538
in my exam room.

210
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,072
We can't do our jobs without our screens.

211
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:50,240
You have to make this go away.

212
00:08:50,242 --> 00:08:51,675
Enough!

213
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:53,010
I am not the deputy medical director,

214
00:08:53,012 --> 00:08:54,011
I am not a department chair,

215
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:55,746
I am not anyone who is
in charge of anything,

216
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:57,181
so my advice to all of you
is to suck it up,

217
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:58,816
swallow your pride, keep your head down,

218
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:01,018
and do the one damn thing
that Max has asked of you,

219
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,754
which is what I am trying to do!

220
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:04,855
And just for the record,

221
00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:07,424
you should bloody well know
your patients' names.

222
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,563
Hi, Luna. Can you say hi?

223
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:13,069
Say hola. Shalom?

224
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:15,538
Bobbi, you wanna say hi to Luna?

225
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,768
She's totally thinking "hello."

226
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,005
Yeah, totally got that.

227
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:22,006
What are you in for?

228
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:24,141
Bobbi keeps getting these ear infections.

229
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:25,142
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

230
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:26,844
They're scared they could
delay her speech,

231
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:29,146
so an ENT's putting these tubes
in her ears.

232
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:30,214
Tympanostomy.

233
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:32,817
That's the word
I keep meaning to write down.

234
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:34,351
Maybe you could toss them on in,

235
00:09:34,353 --> 00:09:36,353
seeing as you're already in scrubs.

236
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:38,122
Yeah, I'm not really an ear guy,

237
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:39,723
but if she had Ebola...

238
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:41,525
In that case, we'll stick
with the ear infections.

239
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:43,360
That's fair.

240
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:45,320
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Yep.

241
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:47,456
- You can come on back now.
- Oh, great.

242
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,324
Hope the doctor gets to you soon.

243
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:50,907
Thanks.

244
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:53,155
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

245
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:54,163
And Luna.

246
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:56,331
Yeah, she's totally thinking "bye!"

247
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,399
- Say "bye!"
- Bye!

248
00:09:57,401 --> 00:09:58,801
- Bye, Bobbi.
- Bye, Luna.

249
00:10:00,504 --> 00:10:02,671
And on a scale of one to ten,
how bad is the pain?

250
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:04,339
Maybe a four,

251
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:05,841
but it's nothing compared to my knee.

252
00:10:05,843 --> 00:10:07,242
So it's your knee as well.

253
00:10:07,244 --> 00:10:08,710
And what number would you give your knee?

254
00:10:08,712 --> 00:10:10,646
Well, if my foot is a nine,

255
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:11,980
then I'd say my knee is an eight.

256
00:10:11,982 --> 00:10:14,349
Shouldn't you be typing this
into a computer?

257
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:15,851
I've got it all right here, okay?

258
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:19,888
So, it is your shoulder,

259
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,723
your knee, and your foot.

260
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:22,724
And that is everything.

261
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:24,827
And my skin is very dry.

262
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:26,395
Huh, so that's not everything.

263
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:28,831
I wasn't sure if you did skin stuff.

264
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,832
Okay, Mr. Pembroke,

265
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:32,000
why don't you just tell me
all of your concerns?

266
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:34,203
Well, the only other thing I can think of

267
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:35,938
is muscle aches...

268
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,406
Mm-hmm.

269
00:10:37,408 --> 00:10:39,708
Blurred vision, exhaustion,

270
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,211
headaches, constipation,

271
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:43,912
oh, and I'm always freezing.

272
00:10:43,914 --> 00:10:46,284
Okay, I'm gonna go and get
this logged into your chart

273
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:48,550
before I forget, and then
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

274
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:51,220
Okay, so you've got shoulder pain,

275
00:10:51,222 --> 00:10:53,422
connected to the knee pain,
connected to the foot pain,

276
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:56,959
dry skin, blurry vision,
muscle aches, exhaustion,

277
00:10:56,961 --> 00:10:59,928
constipation, and...

278
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,266
Oh, no.

279
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:07,703
Making the incision between
the sixth and seventh rib.

280
00:11:07,705 --> 00:11:10,038
Get me a pair of.

281
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,040
Gonna need a saline flush.

282
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:14,276
Isolating pulmonary artery.

283
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:16,612
Polypropalyne sutures.

284
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:18,914
Need a new carton of lap pads.

285
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,582
Suture.

286
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:22,651
500 milliliters.

287
00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:24,419
That should do it.

288
00:11:24,421 --> 00:11:26,711
Her heart rate's still rising.

289
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:28,991
Should be slowing down.

290
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:31,460
And her blood pressure's dropping.

291
00:11:31,462 --> 00:11:33,795
- I got all the bleeders.
- There must be something else.

292
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:35,597
Hypotensive, tachycardic...

293
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,000
And a lacy red rash.

294
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:39,768
That's a transfusion reaction.

295
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,070
Her body's rejecting the blood.
Disconnect it!

296
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,507
- And call hematology!
- Assess for DIC.

297
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:47,075
She's oozing blood everywhere.

298
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:49,678
BP is still dropping.

299
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,113
Gauze.

300
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:55,517
Come on, come on.

301
00:11:57,021 --> 00:11:58,921
Dr. Reynolds, tell me what's happening.

302
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:00,155
Where's Sharpe?

303
00:12:00,157 --> 00:12:01,590
If there's an issue
with the blood product,

304
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:02,791
the chair of hematology gets paged,

305
00:12:02,793 --> 00:12:04,092
and right now, that's me.

306
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:05,460
Sorry, just habit.

307
00:12:05,462 --> 00:12:06,929
You suspect a transfusion reaction?

308
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:09,097
Yeah, a big one.

309
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:10,966
Okay, I'm on it.

310
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,703
down. Get a new one.

311
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:16,471
Dr. Sharpe.

312
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:17,539
Long time no see.

313
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,541
Hello, Trey.

314
00:12:19,543 --> 00:12:20,709
How are you feeling?

315
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:22,844
Like someone who was almost
murdered by crab cakes.

316
00:12:22,846 --> 00:12:24,546
They figure out why it happened?

317
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:28,231
What is it?

318
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,794
Trey, I have some bad news.

319
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:44,833
The newfound allergies that you have

320
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:46,902
are from your lymphoma,

321
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:49,071
which means that it's returned.

322
00:12:53,043 --> 00:12:55,477
So, it's back to chemo?

323
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,812
The cancer has spread

324
00:12:56,814 --> 00:12:58,513
too aggressively for chemotherapy.

325
00:12:58,515 --> 00:13:01,049
It's beyond anything that we can treat.

326
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:05,487
But we beat it.

327
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:06,455
You and me. You said we beat it.

328
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:09,658
It's not fair,
and it doesn't make any sense,

329
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,493
and I am so sorry.

330
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:16,237
How long?

331
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:18,800
Four months.

332
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:20,992
Maybe six.

333
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:25,374
Are your parents here?

334
00:13:25,376 --> 00:13:26,441
I'm gonna call them.

335
00:13:26,443 --> 00:13:28,010
- No, don't.
- Trey...

336
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:29,711
I don't want them to know.

337
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:51,474
_

338
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:56,315
_

339
00:14:00,744 --> 00:14:02,577
- Have you got a minute?
- Oh, hi.

340
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,946
Yeah, actually, I'm glad you're here.

341
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:08,373
Would you say that I have
Narcissistic Personality Disorder?

342
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:11,553
Because the DSM says that
people who are narcissistic

343
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:13,588
are typically quite haughty.

344
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,123
Is that how you would characterize me?

345
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,092
Haughty? Just give it to me straight.

346
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:18,627
Am I haughty?

347
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:20,629
You know, I heard
a really good hypothetical

348
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:21,830
to tell if you're a narcissist.

349
00:14:21,832 --> 00:14:22,764
Good, what is it?

350
00:14:22,766 --> 00:14:24,232
If a colleague shows up at your office

351
00:14:24,234 --> 00:14:25,200
during the work day,

352
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:26,508
do you assume they're there for a reason,

353
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,503
or just to hear you talk nonsense?

354
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:33,488
Lay it on me.

355
00:14:33,513 --> 00:14:35,646
His name's Trey.

356
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:38,639
He's 18, and he wants to die alone.

357
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:42,751
The mutiny is upon us.

358
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:44,753
Why does no one ever stop me
with good news?

359
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:46,788
Honestly, I'm gonna start using
the air ducts.

360
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,690
The neurology
and neurosurgery departments

361
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:49,624
are in open revolt.

362
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:51,693
So naturally, you come to an oncologist.

363
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:54,162
Max's ban on screens
is completely impractical.

364
00:14:54,164 --> 00:14:55,363
Screens are vital

365
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:58,633
even for the most basic
neurological patient encounter.

366
00:14:58,635 --> 00:15:00,669
Do you know what's most
interesting about neurology?

367
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:01,770
- What?
- I couldn't tell you.

368
00:15:01,772 --> 00:15:02,804
It's not my department.

369
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:05,006
My clinic is in chaos.

370
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:06,475
You must help.

371
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:07,809
I can't.

372
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:09,878
I don't have a position
of authority, Vijay.

373
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,948
There's no reason for roving
gangs of rebel neurologists

374
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,484
- to listen to me.
- Max listens to you.

375
00:15:15,486 --> 00:15:17,358
It's not about your title.

376
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:19,610
You have Max's ear.

377
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:21,404
Please.

378
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,692
For the patients.

379
00:15:32,236 --> 00:15:33,068
Yeah.

380
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,170
Just so you know, your big idea

381
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:37,072
is going down like a lead balloon.

382
00:15:37,074 --> 00:15:38,673
Look there's something...

383
00:15:38,675 --> 00:15:40,842
There's something wrong with Luna.

384
00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:42,878
Max, what... do they know
what it is, or...

385
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,886
Not yet. What do you need?

386
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:47,215
Nothing.

387
00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:48,984
I'll handle it.

388
00:15:57,683 --> 00:16:00,527
A small bump, Dr. Goodwin.
Likely a lipoma.

389
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:01,784
Do you wanna biopsy it?

390
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,166
I don't want you to panic.

391
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:05,635
Well, I have... Had cancer.

392
00:16:05,637 --> 00:16:06,936
Cancer is so unlikely.

393
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:09,105
Yeah, I know, I know, but it could be,

394
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:12,008
or it could be a hemangioma
or a Budd-Chiari malformation...

395
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,343
I highly doubt that.

396
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:15,044
I don't want to doubt, kay?
I'd like to know.

397
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:16,501
I need to know.

398
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:18,882
- I could biopsy it, but...
- Okay.

399
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:21,017
We could be opening up
ourselves to a false positive...

400
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,887
Do it. Kay?

401
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:28,391
Hey.

402
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:29,626
It has come to my attention

403
00:16:29,628 --> 00:16:33,229
that you have been brazenly
disregarding Max's directive.

404
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:34,330
Because it's crazy.

405
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:36,199
And yet, I'm fairly certain
it wasn't optional.

406
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:38,234
We need our screens for consults.

407
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:39,135
And Max believes

408
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:41,204
having your faces buried in your tablet

409
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:43,339
only alienates you from your patients.

410
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:45,041
Now, I've spoken with Max directly

411
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:46,376
and he would like you to get this done,

412
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:48,378
so tell me, how can I help?

413
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,312
Do you know how much information

414
00:16:49,314 --> 00:16:51,247
we're expected to enter for each patient?

415
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:52,515
36 pages.

416
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:54,884
2/3rds of which is insurance
coding and billing questions.

417
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:56,052
And we have no choice but to do it

418
00:16:56,054 --> 00:16:57,086
during the consults.

419
00:16:57,088 --> 00:16:58,555
Since it takes
about 15 minutes of scrolling

420
00:16:58,557 --> 00:16:59,489
to fill it all out.

421
00:16:59,491 --> 00:17:01,157
If we can't do it
during the patient visit,

422
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,225
we'll have to do it after.

423
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:04,060
Which means each patient
will take twice as long,

424
00:17:04,062 --> 00:17:05,662
and we'll end up seeing
half as many patients.

425
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:08,427
And some of us
are not the fastest typists.

426
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:10,400
Okay.

427
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:14,337
So, what if we were to hire,
say, medical scribes

428
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,439
who could input the data
while you were consulting.

429
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:18,207
- Would that help?
- That would be incredible.

430
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:19,208
You can do that?

431
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,177
No, but Max can,
and if Max wants this done,

432
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,111
then consider it done.

433
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:23,947
Six new medical scribes coming your way.

434
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:26,249
That's... thank you.

435
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:27,864
Thank you!

436
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,454
See, I knew Max would listen to you.

437
00:17:34,426 --> 00:17:36,059
How about an indoor rock climbing wall?

438
00:17:36,061 --> 00:17:38,461
Okay, what part of "this money is cursed"

439
00:17:38,463 --> 00:17:39,462
didn't you understand?

440
00:17:39,464 --> 00:17:41,030
- Sauna and hot tub?
- No.

441
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:42,265
- Jet skis.
- Sure.

442
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:44,100
- Really?
- No.

443
00:17:44,102 --> 00:17:46,302
Eli, Eli, Eli. Okay.

444
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:48,738
Now you, you nearly had me stumped,

445
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,206
what with your litany of issues.

446
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,041
I mean, the headaches, the knee,

447
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,577
the inability to regulate
your body temperature.

448
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:56,579
I mean, I really had to dig deep,

449
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:59,582
and I searched far and wide.

450
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:02,285
I mean, I even consulted
a dusty old medical text.

451
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:05,254
But I have figured it out.

452
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:06,623
I know what you have.

453
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,591
It is called a low thyroid,

454
00:18:08,593 --> 00:18:11,449
and it explains all of your symptoms.

455
00:18:12,564 --> 00:18:15,498
Even the cut on my leg that won't heal?

456
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,300
What cut on your leg that won't heal?

457
00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:19,435
Did I forget to mention that one?

458
00:18:19,437 --> 00:18:22,605
Yeah, must've slipped your mind.

459
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:26,109
So, do I still have
a low thyroid, Dr. Bloom?

460
00:18:27,412 --> 00:18:28,799
No.

461
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:33,316
Okay, so,

462
00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:35,318
cut on your leg

463
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,620
that won't heal...

464
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,063
Constipation...

465
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:45,762
headaches...

466
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,766
Dr. Sharpe.

467
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:51,200
Sandra Fall from billing.

468
00:18:51,202 --> 00:18:53,169
Why did you requisition
six medical scribes?

469
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:55,104
I didn't. That was Max.

470
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:57,373
Except the entire neurology
department said it was you.

471
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,244
Doesn't that sound
like something Max would do?

472
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:01,644
Unfortunately, yes.
So, why didn't he sign the paperwork?

473
00:19:01,646 --> 00:19:03,312
You know, that also sounds like something

474
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:04,313
Max would forget to do.

475
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:06,315
I can't approve
the requisition of new staff

476
00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:08,151
without the medical director's signature.

477
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:09,632
Okay, wait.

478
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:11,554
- Turn around.
- Why?

479
00:19:11,556 --> 00:19:13,723
Plausible deniability.

480
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:18,724
Okay, you can turn around now.

481
00:19:19,564 --> 00:19:22,365
That looks like Max signed it to me.

482
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:24,534
That does seem like something
Max would do.

483
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:31,207
Have you ever heard of magical thinking?

484
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:32,208
No?

485
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,078
It's the belief that

486
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,326
our thoughts can shape reality.

487
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:39,415
The idea that our deepest wishes

488
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:42,248
can somehow shape the physical world.

489
00:19:42,654 --> 00:19:44,387
Or sometimes, we hope

490
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:46,556
that if we don't talk about something,

491
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:47,962
it won't happen.

492
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:51,561
You think I'm in some weirdo headspace

493
00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:52,729
where if I don't tell my parents,

494
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:54,330
I think I won't die?

495
00:19:54,332 --> 00:19:55,803
I think it's possible.

496
00:19:56,534 --> 00:19:58,601
Okay, no. That's not me at all.

497
00:19:58,603 --> 00:20:00,369
I'm fully clear on my situation.

498
00:20:00,371 --> 00:20:02,852
- Okay.
- In six months, I'm toast.

499
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:05,675
Yeah.

500
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:10,713
So, why not tell your parents?

501
00:20:10,715 --> 00:20:12,381
Look, I'm 18,

502
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:14,617
and three years of that was
spent sidelined with cancer,

503
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:17,120
so experience-wise, it's like I'm 15.

504
00:20:17,122 --> 00:20:19,422
I've got less than a year left,
and I want to go live.

505
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:21,557
That's great.
Why don't you tell them that?

506
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,526
If I did, every time I leave the house,

507
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:25,795
I'll have to deal with their sad faces.

508
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:27,396
That I'm choosing to spend my last days

509
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:29,098
with people that aren't them.

510
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,299
Okay, I get that, Trey,

511
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:34,203
but you know there are physical
signs of cancer, right?

512
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:38,274
Bottles of painkillers,
your body will be in decline.

513
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:39,275
So?

514
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:41,277
So your parents are bound to notice that,

515
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,600
don't you think?

516
00:20:43,448 --> 00:20:45,882
Terminal cancer's not really
something you can hide.

517
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:49,886
That's why I'm leaving.

518
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:51,220
Leaving?

519
00:20:51,222 --> 00:20:52,755
I've been thinking about it all morning.

520
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:54,757
My buddy Jem is doing
a semester in Barcelona.

521
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,759
I'm gonna take the semester off
and go crash with him,

522
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:58,461
then after that, I'll go wherever.

523
00:20:58,463 --> 00:21:02,732
Peru, climb the Andes,
hopefully lose my virginity.

524
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:05,568
- It's okay to laugh.
- I'm not laughing.

525
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:09,210
There's just so much I haven't done.

526
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:12,308
So, your parents
are gonna hear about you dying

527
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,410
on a mountain thousands of miles away,

528
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:15,778
all alone?

529
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,413
And it'll be awful for them.

530
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:18,447
Yeah.

531
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:20,971
But it's gonna be awful
for them no matter what.

532
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,187
At least this way,
it won't be awful for me.

533
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,358
Yeah.

534
00:21:33,104 --> 00:21:34,485
Okay.

535
00:21:35,366 --> 00:21:37,600
I'm gonna go get
your discharge paperwork.

536
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,343
I know.

537
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:49,345
I know, I know, I know.

538
00:21:49,347 --> 00:21:50,880
I know, I know, I know.

539
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:52,882
- I know.
- Everything okay?

540
00:21:52,884 --> 00:21:55,451
They need to run some tests, but...

541
00:21:55,453 --> 00:21:57,186
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

542
00:21:57,188 --> 00:21:59,288
Sorry. Can't seem to...

543
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,190
Don't worry about it.

544
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:05,394
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

545
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:12,368
My wife would have been better at this.

546
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,870
Have you tried the Ss?

547
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:18,708
- Give it a try?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

548
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,476
Hey, hey.

549
00:22:20,478 --> 00:22:23,379
Oh, hi.

550
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:28,885
Hi.

551
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:36,392
Raising a child by yourself is hard.

552
00:22:36,394 --> 00:22:39,996
Yeah. Hoping it gets easier.

553
00:22:39,998 --> 00:22:41,898
It won't.

554
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,567
But you get better at getting through it.

555
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:46,435
Yeah.

556
00:22:48,673 --> 00:22:49,772
Ms. Healy?

557
00:22:49,774 --> 00:22:52,241
The doctor will see you now.

558
00:22:52,243 --> 00:22:54,377
- There we go.
- Thanks.

559
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:56,712
Hi. Hi!

560
00:22:56,714 --> 00:22:58,447
Yeah, was that better?

561
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,519
Good luck.

562
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:05,354
Thanks. You too.

563
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,927
Hang another liter of normal saline.

564
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:12,135
She has a positive ANA

565
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:13,529
and double-stranded DNA antibodies.

566
00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:14,530
She has Lupus?

567
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:15,631
And it's making antibodies

568
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:17,533
that are reacting to the
transfused red blood cells.

569
00:23:17,535 --> 00:23:18,701
That's why she rejected it.

570
00:23:18,703 --> 00:23:20,770
Any blood we give her needs
to be meticulously matched

571
00:23:20,772 --> 00:23:22,939
to dozens of proteins on the
surface of her red blood cells,

572
00:23:22,941 --> 00:23:24,040
or she'll react again.

573
00:23:24,065 --> 00:23:25,965
- Okay, so get it up here.
- We don't have any.

574
00:23:25,944 --> 00:23:27,777
But I'm gonna search
every hospital and blood bank

575
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:29,378
- until we find it.
- Well, you better hurry,

576
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,393
or she's gonna bleed out on the table.

577
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:42,576
- Where's Bobbi?
- Still back there.

578
00:23:42,578 --> 00:23:44,286
- Oh.
- They let me watch

579
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:46,446
as she went under, but then
said I had to wait here

580
00:23:46,448 --> 00:23:47,881
till after the procedure.

581
00:23:47,883 --> 00:23:49,516
Yeah, that's typical.

582
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,730
Since my husband passed, I...

583
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,167
I hate having her out of my sight.

584
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,269
I know she's okay, but...

585
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,104
I know, um...

586
00:24:03,217 --> 00:24:04,574
Come with me.

587
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,253
Are you sure we can be back here?

588
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,754
I know a few people.

589
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,823
You can leave that there if you want.

590
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,301
Chuck Turnbill's one of
the best ENTs in Manhattan.

591
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,305
Now you get to see why.

592
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,589
Thank you.

593
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,015
Sure.

594
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,686
Dr. Goodwin, we have Luna's results.

595
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,788
Excuse me.

596
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,065
We want medical scribes too.

597
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,374
Oh, do you now?

598
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,734
We heard what you got the neurosurgeons,

599
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,136
and we want the exact same thing.

600
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,004
Mm, but I distinctly recall
you telling me

601
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,409
how much you love your screens,

602
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:12,008
so hiring medical scribes
isn't gonna solve your problem.

603
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,643
So what are you gonna give us?

604
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:14,845
Home visits.

605
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,813
Home visits?

606
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,348
To forge authentic connections

607
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,482
with the people that you treat,

608
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,319
you need to do far more than
just set your screens aside.

609
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:25,355
You need total immersion
in the lives of your patients.

610
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,091
Even if we wanted to do that,
which we don't,

611
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,759
our schedules would never allow for that.

612
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,862
I'm cancelling all
pulmonology clinic appointments

613
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,029
for the next month.

614
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,098
- That should free up some time.
- Wait, you can't do that.

615
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,700
I'm not doing it, Max is.

616
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:37,734
You talked to him about us?

617
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,870
Yes, and he agreed
this is exactly what you need.

618
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,271
You and your colleagues are gonna start

619
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,939
visiting your patients in their home,

620
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,908
and you are really gonna
get to know them.

621
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,743
Max suggested that you could start

622
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,178
by learning their first names.

623
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:54,851
Eli.

624
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:55,919
Okay.

625
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,788
Now, I think I figured out
what is wrong with you,

626
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,859
and this is the treatment.

627
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,895
It looks big.

628
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,049
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

629
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,068
So look, I went over
your landfill of symptoms

630
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,038
a million times, and...

631
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,641
the only diagnosis I could come to

632
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,242
was malnutrition.

633
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:25,115
Now, Eli, are you
having trouble buying food?

634
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,918
My Social Security check
pays most of my rent,

635
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,239
but to cover the rest of it,

636
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,822
I sell my food stamps,

637
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:36,426
and eat fast food 'cause it's cheap.

638
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:38,995
Okay.

639
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:42,933
Well, look, you can't do that anymore.

640
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,234
I knew I was cutting corners,

641
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:46,970
I didn't know I was hurting myself.

642
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,805
What about the shelter?

643
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,580
I mean, they offer
three healthy meals a day.

644
00:26:51,582 --> 00:26:53,843
I won't take food away

645
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,912
from people who really need it!

646
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,248
You really need it.

647
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,784
I mean, your body is basically starving.

648
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:07,090
Have you heard of something
called Meals for Seniors?

649
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,693
I mean, it is a great program
that is designed to help

650
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,194
with the nutritional needs
of the elderly.

651
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,129
I've been on a waitlist since June.

652
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,167
Of 2016.

653
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:22,772
I don't understand.
Why can't you find a match?

654
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:23,873
Your sister needs

655
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,376
an extremely particular blood product,

656
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:29,813
and so far, no hospital within 6 hours

657
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,425
has it on hand.

658
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,845
I'm so sorry, Justine.

659
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,988
If there's any other family members

660
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,391
you wish to call, now would be the time.

661
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:44,394
Elandra's a Marine.

662
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,797
She did three tours in Afghanistan,

663
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,166
and now a commute to work
is going to kill her

664
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,835
because you don't have blood?

665
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,142
You paged me?

666
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,177
Look, I know I'm stepping over Castro,

667
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,513
but my patient needs
all the help that she can get,

668
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,148
and I'm not gonna let chain of command

669
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,377
get in the way of saving her life.

670
00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:10,086
Will you help?

671
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:12,255
Ella.

672
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,490
I have something for you.

673
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,392
I realized mine were a little old,

674
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,060
so I thought maybe these new ones

675
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,229
will make you feel more at home.

676
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,365
Vijay, I really appreciate
what you're doing.

677
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,267
I just...

678
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,522
Your home?

679
00:28:25,524 --> 00:28:26,770
You mean our home.

680
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,104
Yeah.

681
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,073
There's so much of your old life there,

682
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,510
so much of everything, really, and...

683
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:35,111
I just...

684
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,546
There's no space for anyone else.

685
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,914
There's no space for me.

686
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,083
Oh, we will move Rohan's books.

687
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,384
It's not about the books.

688
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,453
I just...

689
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,088
Feel like I picture myself there,

690
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,358
and I just... with my OCD, and...

691
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,794
I know that you are just
trying to be helpful,

692
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:52,462
and that really means so much.

693
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,464
I just... it's just not
gonna work for me.

694
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,596
I...

695
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:02,205
I'm sorry I did not think of...

696
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,374
No, I'm sorry.

697
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,376
I...

698
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:07,944
You're being so great, and I...

699
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:12,048
You need to do what is best
for the baby, and...

700
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,819
And for you.

701
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:17,087
I'll come by after my shift,
and I'll pick up my things.

702
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,329
Where will you go?

703
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,265
I'll go stay with a friend
till I figure it out.

704
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:35,839
Okay.

705
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,314
It's not cancer.

706
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,249
It's not some obscure infection.

707
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,285
Luna has an epidermoid cyst,
a simple fold of tissue.

708
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,588
A small injection of steroids
and she'll be fine.

709
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:54,457
That's great news. Thank you.

710
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,159
But if I may, Dr. Goodwin,

711
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,660
today you let your parental fears

712
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:00,530
override your medical judgment and mine.

713
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,365
What do you mean?

714
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,267
From now on,
when Luna visits this office,

715
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,202
I don't want her coming with Dr. Goodwin.

716
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:08,605
I want Luna coming with her father.

717
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,610
Got it.

718
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:18,982
Okay.

719
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:23,019
For your discharge,
my mountain-climbing friend.

720
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,021
- Here you go.
- Sweet, thank you.

721
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,890
So, listen, before you leave,
if you don't mind,

722
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:29,893
I have one more shrink thought for you.

723
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:32,564
What do you say about making
a video for your parents?

724
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,231
What kind of video?

725
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,233
Well, when you leave,
and you say good-bye,

726
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,468
your parents aren't going to know

727
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,904
that that's really good-bye,

728
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,705
so why don't you give them that gift?

729
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,641
The real good-bye?

730
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,509
And then when I receive word
that you've passed,

731
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,413
I will make sure that they get it.

732
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,080
Yeah. Seems like a good idea.

733
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,149
Great, okay. I'm gonna set this up.

734
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:56,088
We'll get you off to Aconcagua
in no time, my friend.

735
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:06,515
What should I say?

736
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,064
I mean, that's up to you, really,

737
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:11,234
but try to remember that
when your parents see this,

738
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,336
they're gonna be dealing
with the fact that you're gone.

739
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,004
All right? So...

740
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,274
I don't know, maybe tell them
how you want to be remembered.

741
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,210
Five most important memories.

742
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,082
Hi, Mom and Dad.

743
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,744
Hi.

744
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,254
When you see this, I'll be gone,

745
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:35,001
and I thought you'd like
to hear this message from me.

746
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,212
Anyway,

747
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,762
here are my five most important memories.

748
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,137
Okay. Here's one.

749
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,440
The day I got diagnosed with cancer.

750
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,041
We were driving home from the hospital,

751
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,020
and you offered to get me ice cream.

752
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,479
And I was 15, and trying to be
a tough guy or whatever,

753
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,150
so I said no.

754
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,284
But later that night,
you brought me some anyway.

755
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,319
Rocky Road.

756
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,622
And it had been years since I'd
asked you to get me ice cream,

757
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,223
but you remembered my favorite flavor,

758
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:10,260
and that made me feel so good.

759
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,124
Number two.

760
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,544
Playing Toss the Trey when I was little.

761
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,403
Might be my first memory, actually.

762
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,729
Getting tossed up in the air,

763
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,177
and not worrying
if you were gonna catch me.

764
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,512
And...

765
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:34,811
And...

766
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,481
and Thanksgiving.

767
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,789
When I tried to eat
Dad's stuffing after chemo,

768
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,125
but I got sick, and I...

769
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:47,282
And you had to help clean me up.

770
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:51,100
And I hated it, but I remember
having this thought of,

771
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,662
"Jesus,

772
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,590
what would I do if I didn't..."

773
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,780
"If I didn't have you?"

774
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,558
Could you... could you
press stop, please?

775
00:33:26,835 --> 00:33:29,182
You hired unbudgeted medical scribes?

776
00:33:29,184 --> 00:33:32,245
You cancelled clinics?
You forged Max's signature?

777
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,003
Usually, I save my indignation for Max,

778
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:35,437
but this time, you outdid even him.

779
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:37,172
Mm, it has been a busy day.

780
00:33:37,174 --> 00:33:38,340
This isn't a game, Helen.

781
00:33:38,342 --> 00:33:40,075
You're on a branch all by yourself,

782
00:33:40,077 --> 00:33:41,744
and if you don't want me to run you

783
00:33:41,746 --> 00:33:43,846
out of this hospital for good,
you better start talking.

784
00:33:43,848 --> 00:33:45,080
Do you mind walking a bit faster?

785
00:33:45,082 --> 00:33:46,081
I do mind.

786
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:47,883
Did you learn nothing
from your recent demotion?

787
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:49,084
What I learned is that sometimes

788
00:33:49,086 --> 00:33:51,186
we have to bend the rules
in order to help our patients,

789
00:33:51,188 --> 00:33:53,922
and it certainly helps that
I have no titles to stop me.

790
00:33:53,924 --> 00:33:55,057
God, you sound just like him.

791
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:56,859
Good, because everything I did today,

792
00:33:56,861 --> 00:33:57,960
Max would have done too.

793
00:33:57,962 --> 00:34:00,763
Patients are the most important
part of this hospital,

794
00:34:00,765 --> 00:34:02,364
the center of everything that we do.

795
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:03,432
Believe it or not,

796
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:06,201
emulating Max's reckless
and irresponsible behavior

797
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:07,703
is not gonna win you any points.

798
00:34:07,705 --> 00:34:10,873
And where the hell are we even going?

799
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,380
Ma'am, inside this cooler,
you'll find the synthetic blood

800
00:34:18,382 --> 00:34:20,049
that you requested.

801
00:34:20,051 --> 00:34:22,051
What's going on? Who are you?

802
00:34:22,053 --> 00:34:24,420
When the Marines found out
one of our own was down,

803
00:34:24,422 --> 00:34:25,487
we were determined to help.

804
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,215
Thank you, Colonel.

805
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:28,824
You were saying?

806
00:34:28,826 --> 00:34:31,126
That blood will help Reynolds' patient?

807
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:33,996
- It will.
- Then go!

808
00:34:33,998 --> 00:34:36,065
Your call is very important.

809
00:34:36,067 --> 00:34:37,399
Please continue to hold,

810
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:39,401
and the next available Meals
for Seniors representative

811
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:40,402
will assist you.

812
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:42,905
Meals for Seniors. This is Linda.

813
00:34:42,907 --> 00:34:45,240
Hi, Linda, this is Dr. Lauren Bloom

814
00:34:45,242 --> 00:34:46,508
over at New Amsterdam.

815
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,944
I've got a patient
who is on your waitlist.

816
00:34:48,946 --> 00:34:51,180
I'm sorry, I know it's frustrating,

817
00:34:51,182 --> 00:34:52,981
but it can take years for a client

818
00:34:52,983 --> 00:34:54,516
to work their way to the top.

819
00:34:54,518 --> 00:34:57,252
There's just too many hungry elders.

820
00:34:57,254 --> 00:34:58,898
Right.

821
00:35:01,158 --> 00:35:02,858
Well, look, how much would it cost

822
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,160
to wipe out the waitlist?

823
00:35:05,162 --> 00:35:06,462
Are you trying to bribe me?

824
00:35:06,464 --> 00:35:07,963
No. No.

825
00:35:07,965 --> 00:35:09,431
I just wondered how much it would cost

826
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:12,167
to service everyone who's been waiting?

827
00:35:12,169 --> 00:35:14,370
That's a big number.

828
00:35:14,372 --> 00:35:16,271
Try me.

829
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:20,342
Oh, Eli.

830
00:35:20,344 --> 00:35:21,777
I called Meals for Seniors.

831
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:23,345
Turns out they had an opening after all.

832
00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:30,219
Hey.

833
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:31,220
Hey!

834
00:35:31,222 --> 00:35:34,189
Bobbi just wanted to make sure
Luna was okay.

835
00:35:34,191 --> 00:35:36,892
She is. And Bobbi?

836
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:39,061
- She is.
- Good.

837
00:35:39,063 --> 00:35:41,029
That's my number.

838
00:35:41,031 --> 00:35:43,899
Oh, I'm not really...

839
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:45,401
The number's for Luna.

840
00:35:45,403 --> 00:35:47,469
- For a playdate.
- Playdate?

841
00:35:47,471 --> 00:35:49,071
Yeah, you know, babies on blankets,

842
00:35:49,073 --> 00:35:52,007
spilled Cheerios, toy battles.

843
00:35:52,009 --> 00:35:55,178
Right. Playdate, yep. Heard of those.

844
00:35:55,913 --> 00:35:58,847
Yeah, welcome to the next
level of parenthood, Max.

845
00:36:04,822 --> 00:36:07,156
You gave my sister experimental blood.

846
00:36:07,158 --> 00:36:08,090
Synthetic blood.

847
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:10,325
It's used mainly
for battlefield injuries.

848
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:12,327
Which isn't actually blood at all.

849
00:36:13,154 --> 00:36:15,097
Scientists take hemoglobin,

850
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:16,498
the molecule that carries oxygen,

851
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,934
and they wrap it in a polymer coating.

852
00:36:18,936 --> 00:36:20,936
Which means that your sister's body

853
00:36:20,938 --> 00:36:22,237
gets the oxygen that it needs,

854
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:25,073
but won't reject the blood carrying it.

855
00:36:25,075 --> 00:36:27,075
Elandra's responding well
to the treatment.

856
00:36:27,077 --> 00:36:29,170
She's gonna pull through.

857
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,081
I didn't know any of this was an option.

858
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:34,416
It wasn't.

859
00:36:34,418 --> 00:36:37,186
But Dr. Sharpe made it happen anyway.

860
00:36:42,026 --> 00:36:43,559
Oh.

861
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:44,593
Thank you.

862
00:36:58,876 --> 00:37:00,476
Floyd, you paged?

863
00:37:00,478 --> 00:37:02,044
I don't know how I'm gonna say this,

864
00:37:02,046 --> 00:37:06,048
so I'm gonna just say it.

865
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,375
Okay.

866
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:12,387
So Evie took this new job
in San Francisco,

867
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:14,490
and it's everything she's ever wanted,

868
00:37:14,492 --> 00:37:16,291
but it means it's gonna be
a lot of changes

869
00:37:16,293 --> 00:37:17,259
happening for us,

870
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:19,061
and I just wanted to be
straight up with you

871
00:37:19,063 --> 00:37:21,097
about my future here.

872
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:23,432
Well, I think that's amazing.

873
00:37:23,434 --> 00:37:24,671
Yeah, I totally get it.

874
00:37:24,673 --> 00:37:26,101
And look, we'll make
whatever happens next

875
00:37:26,103 --> 00:37:27,970
as painless as possible.

876
00:37:27,972 --> 00:37:29,404
- I appreciate that.
- Mm-hmm.

877
00:37:29,406 --> 00:37:30,572
Thank you.

878
00:37:30,574 --> 00:37:31,775
Sure.

879
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,642
It's crazy.

880
00:37:33,644 --> 00:37:36,345
You and I have been linked
since my very first day here.

881
00:37:36,347 --> 00:37:37,412
You were my first hire.

882
00:37:37,414 --> 00:37:38,280
- Mm-hmm.
- You know that?

883
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:39,681
- Mm-hmm.
- Best decision I ever made.

884
00:37:39,683 --> 00:37:40,948
Oh, thanks.

885
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,918
Look, just know that
whatever you need from me,

886
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,919
I got you.

887
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:44,853
I'm flattered, I really am,

888
00:37:44,855 --> 00:37:46,421
and I'm definitely gonna
take you up on that.

889
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:48,123
Good. I know how brutal

890
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:50,158
long distance relationships can be.

891
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,059
Oh, no, no, I'm...

892
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,928
Just take a few weeks and help Evie move

893
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:53,795
and get settled and...

894
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:55,297
Max, that's very generous, but that...

895
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:56,598
Yeah, well, good. You deserve it.

896
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,333
We'll make it work, for both of you.

897
00:37:58,335 --> 00:38:00,302
Right? We got this. All right?

898
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:02,538
'Cause teamwork makes the dream work!

899
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,739
Right, buddy?

900
00:38:10,714 --> 00:38:12,899
How did you get him to change his mind?

901
00:38:13,617 --> 00:38:15,284
I didn't.

902
00:38:15,286 --> 00:38:17,452
I think Trey just realized that

903
00:38:17,454 --> 00:38:20,240
he can't finish his story without them.

904
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:36,572
Hey.

905
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:40,475
I want to show you something.

906
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:10,957
What about what your wife wanted?

907
00:39:11,675 --> 00:39:13,842
This is what she would have wanted.

908
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,881
Rohan never came back home,

909
00:39:18,616 --> 00:39:20,592
but his child has.

910
00:40:29,753 --> 00:40:32,120
- Hey.
- Hey.

911
00:40:32,122 --> 00:40:34,256
Luna's fine. She's totally healthy.

912
00:40:34,258 --> 00:40:37,659
Turns out I was the one
who needed a little help.

913
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:40,213
Did you get it?

914
00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:41,763
Yeah.

915
00:40:41,765 --> 00:40:43,299
Think so.

916
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:46,468
Oh, and I heard my "no screens"
idea went down without a hitch.

917
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,803
Indeed.

918
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:49,304
- Smooth as silk.
- Good.

919
00:40:49,306 --> 00:40:51,349
Best ideas usually are.

920
00:40:51,842 --> 00:40:53,308
Good night.

921
00:40:57,448 --> 00:40:58,780
I'm kidding! It was a joke.

922
00:40:58,782 --> 00:41:00,115
It was a disaster.

923
00:41:00,117 --> 00:41:02,652
I heard it was horrible.

924
00:41:03,687 --> 00:41:05,287
I know.

925
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:07,289
I know everything that you did.

926
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:10,726
I know that my ideas only work

927
00:41:10,728 --> 00:41:12,327
because of you,

928
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:13,729
and so, I just wanted to say...

929
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:14,730
No.

930
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:15,797
- No?
- No.

931
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:17,733
You were gonna thank me, right?

932
00:41:17,735 --> 00:41:19,919
- I was.
- Good, no.

933
00:41:20,804 --> 00:41:22,370
Because I'm gonna thank you.

934
00:41:22,372 --> 00:41:24,090
Why?

935
00:41:24,508 --> 00:41:26,641
I finally felt what you must feel

936
00:41:26,643 --> 00:41:28,477
every time you turn
this hospital on its head,

937
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:29,511
and it is quite the rush.

938
00:41:29,513 --> 00:41:31,546
It is thrilling!

939
00:41:31,548 --> 00:41:32,748
And I want more of it.

940
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,583
I want it every day.

941
00:41:34,585 --> 00:41:36,818
But Max, I have been
your safety net for so long

942
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,320
that if I go down this road,

943
00:41:38,322 --> 00:41:40,422
I am gonna need you to start being mine.

944
00:41:44,261 --> 00:41:46,237
How can I help?

1
00:00:00,155 --> 00:00:02,378
Hi, there.
It's me, Ryan Eggold.

2
00:00:02,463 --> 00:00:04,816
I play Dr. Max Goodwin
on "New Amsterdam."

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,036
We are very proud to bring you
our season two finale.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,453
It's a good one.

5
00:00:08,538 --> 00:00:10,039
But first, I want to take
a moment

6
00:00:10,123 --> 00:00:12,041
to thank all the healthcare
professionals

7
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,870
who right now are working
their buns off

8
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:16,785
to keep everyone safe.

9
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:19,515
You guys are our inspiration
for every story

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,919
we tell every episode we make,

11
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:22,617
and now you are everyone's
inspiration,

12
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:25,789
so thank you, and keep up
the heroic work

13
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:27,143
that you are doing.

14
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,375
We all dearly appreciate it.

15
00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:32,844
It's because of that admiration
and a sense of caution

16
00:00:32,928 --> 00:00:35,891
that we decided not to air
tonight's

17
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:37,719
originally scheduled episode,

18
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:40,025
which was titled "Pandemic."

19
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:41,679
It hit a little too close
to home,

20
00:00:41,763 --> 00:00:43,638
and we didn't want to make
entertainment

21
00:00:43,722 --> 00:00:45,074
out of a story that's
a little too scary,

22
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:47,515
a little too real
at the moment.

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,947
But we're gonna show you
that episode later

24
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:50,122
once some time has passed.

25
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:51,907
But the good news is

26
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:53,648
that we're gonna show you
a little teaser

27
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:55,737
from that episode

28
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:58,391
because it introduces

29
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,958
one of our newest characters

30
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:01,960
played by the incomparable

31
00:01:02,044 --> 00:01:04,397
Mr. Daniel Dae Kim,

32
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,289
who I would like to hand it to
right now.

33
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:08,966
Thanks, Ryan.

34
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:10,926
And aloha, everybody.

35
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,046
Ryan is absolutely right.

36
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:14,843
The storyline you're about
to see

37
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:17,672
introduces my character,
Dr. Cassian Shin.

38
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:19,344
Now what we've done is pulled
together

39
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:20,675
all of Cassian's scenes

40
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,024
to give you a sense of his
character

41
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:23,765
and how he's gonna change
more than a few things

42
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:25,114
around the hospital.

43
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:27,420
As you guys may know,
this storyline

44
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,987
turned out to be very personal
to me

45
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:32,164
because I ended up contracted
COVID-19,

46
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:33,775
the disease caused by
coronavirus,

47
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:36,821
while I was in New York
shooting this very episode.

48
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:38,475
Now, thankfully, I was
fortunate enough

49
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:40,328
to have experienced
a full recovery.

50
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:42,500
But too many others have not.

51
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:45,221
So on behalf of the entire
casting crew,

52
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,671
we'd like to dedicate
this season finale

53
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:49,804
to those still fighting
the illness.

54
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:51,877
We're rooting for you.

55
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,260
How can I help?

56
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:55,884
We're down two
trauma surgeons.

57
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,753
I had to call in our new hire
a week early.

58
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,305
You sure that they're
ready for this?

59
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,523
No.

60
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:04,480
That's why I need you
to help him through it.

61
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:11,726
- Dr. Shim?
- Hang on.

62
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:14,054
Yes.

63
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:16,731
Hi, I'm Dr. Helen Sharpe,
Deputy Medical Director.

64
00:02:16,815 --> 00:02:18,080
We really appreciate you
starting early.

65
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:19,891
Yeah, Max said almost
half your staff was down.

66
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:21,695
And our patient load
has almost tripled.

67
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:23,475
- Any recent traumas?
- Thankfully, no.

68
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,368
But I need to get you
to the ED straightaway.

69
00:02:25,453 --> 00:02:26,683
Which way is the men's
locker room?

70
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:28,441
Uh, it's back that way.
There's a bathroom

71
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:29,714
just along here.

72
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,050
- I need a hot shower.
- And we do need you in ED.

73
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:34,267
Yeah, but I need
that shower more.

74
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:44,462
The hospital's in the middle
of a crisis.

75
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:47,196
I know... the dispenser
was out of body wash.

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,763
This is your new pager.

77
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:50,199
As you can see,
it's being paged,

78
00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:52,126
so maybe it's time to wrap up
this beauty routine

79
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,820
and join me in the ED.

80
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:55,897
How about I put on
some pants first?

81
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,164
This is Casey,
our head nurse.

82
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:02,165
Casey, this is Dr. Shin,
our new trauma surgeon.

83
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,821
Oh, thank God.
Follow me.

84
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:04,953
I got a kid who appears
to have swallowed

85
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:06,389
some rare earth magnets.

86
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:09,039
Ah, that's a sure
fire way to get attention, huh?

87
00:03:09,124 --> 00:03:10,952
Hi, I'm Dr. Shin.

88
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:14,352
Casey, do you know the risks

89
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:16,024
when adjusting multiple
magnets?

90
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,836
Uh, if the magnets
were to connect internally,

91
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,134
they could twist
the intestines,

92
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:21,701
force hemorrhages,

93
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:23,181
intussusception.

94
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:26,062
- Even a strangulated bowel.
- They can also do this.

95
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,180
Cool, right?

96
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:32,210
But you only swallowed
one magnet, didn't you?

97
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:33,546
Mm.

98
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,445
So that should pass
in a few hours.

99
00:03:35,777 --> 00:03:37,484
Turns out you don't need me.

100
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,931
Uh, in case you haven't
noticed,

101
00:03:40,016 --> 00:03:42,164
we have a full ED of patients
who need your help.

102
00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:43,252
Where do you think
you're going?

103
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:44,862
I always show up
when I'm paged,

104
00:03:44,947 --> 00:03:47,148
but I only stay
when I'm needed.

105
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:54,871
<i>Dr. Gilmore to Pediatrics.</i>

106
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:56,766
<i>Dr. Gilmore to Pediatrics.</i>

107
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:58,969
Should I go
for the energy drink

108
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:00,269
or the protein bar?

109
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,867
Why would you need energy?

110
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:04,078
You seem intent on doing
virtually nothing.

111
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:07,023
So you vote protein bar.

112
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:08,625
I know that trauma surgeons

113
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,594
like to play the aloof cowboy,
but that's not...

114
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,118
That's not how
you do things here.

115
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:13,947
- No, yes, it's not.
- I know.

116
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:15,393
Don't you think I researched
this place

117
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:16,477
before I took the job?

118
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:18,351
Then you should also know
Max's motto.

119
00:04:18,436 --> 00:04:20,828
"How can I help?"
Yeah, that's catchy.

120
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:24,242
It's words that we live by.
Everybody chips in.

121
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,117
- Everybody helps.
- Right now I am helping.

122
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:30,391
By eating a protein bar.

123
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:33,165
Hm. Duty calls.

124
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:34,883
Well, maybe.

125
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:42,039
So what you got?

126
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:44,227
Lucas Jarvis.
Nail gun mishap.

127
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:45,680
It slipped.

128
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:47,445
Well, Mr. Jarvis,
you're very lucky.

129
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,664
This is lucky?

130
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:50,319
Well, the fact that your new
nail appendage

131
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:52,453
missed the bone in every one
of your fingers is.

132
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:54,105
You know what?

133
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:55,359
Don't you dare.

134
00:04:55,444 --> 00:04:57,078
- I'm thinking Dr...
- Turan.

135
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,428
Dr. Turan here gets
to practice

136
00:04:58,513 --> 00:04:59,675
her nail extraction skills.

137
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,259
Now, a little numbing agent

138
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:02,626
and some gentle retrograde
pressure,

139
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,715
and that sucker should
come right out.

140
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,020
- Dr. Shin...
- You got this?

141
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,312
Yeah.

142
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:08,337
- Dr. Shin!
- Mm?

143
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:09,686
Where are you going?

144
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:11,094
Nap time.

145
00:05:15,254 --> 00:05:16,843
I don't want to hear it.
My friend is sick,

146
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,562
another is gone,
this hospital is slammed,

147
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:20,014
and I'm gonna need you
to be a team player

148
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:21,343
for once,
do you understand?

149
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:22,394
I'm always a team player.

150
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:23,709
Kit Brower, 25.

151
00:05:23,794 --> 00:05:25,350
Multiple lacs
from a large explosion

152
00:05:25,435 --> 00:05:26,922
- at his home.
- What exploded?

153
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:28,359
What's that smell?

154
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:29,866
I make beer.

155
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,718
My fermenting vat...

156
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:33,106
Book an OR right now.

157
00:05:34,272 --> 00:05:35,561
Grab a side.

158
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:38,811
Nurse, I need two units
of O-neg on a bear-hugger.

159
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:41,109
Uh. Hold on, the entire wing
is contaminated.

160
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:43,827
No more surgeries until we can
disinfect every OR.

161
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,330
Hey, welcome to New Amsterdam.

162
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:47,538
Oh, yeah.
Great place.

163
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:49,290
But look, he needs surgery
right now.

164
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,421
How about an ICU?
Attendant's in quarantine.

165
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:54,973
I got a place in mind.
We got to turn around.

166
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:56,079
Thanks.

167
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,478
You guys need something here?

168
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,914
Yeah, we're commandeering
your rig.

169
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:05,350
Help me get him in.
Wait, where are we going?

170
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:07,004
Nowhere... we're doing
the surgery right here.

171
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:09,050
Grab an OR tray and any
supplies you need.

172
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:14,038
You in?

173
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,678
This is trouble.

174
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:26,515
When the glass tank exploded,

175
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,069
it blew apart
the housing cabinet,

176
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:31,507
pieces of which are all over
Kip's abdomen.

177
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,248
If wood doesn't show up
on an X-ray.

178
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:35,093
How are we gonna find
all the splinters?

179
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:37,350
BP's dropping.

180
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:39,772
Turn off all the lights
and cover all the windows.

181
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,014
Now, flip that switch
to your right.

182
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:49,110
Certain types of hardwood
turn fluorescent in blacklight.

183
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:50,468
This ambulance has a UV light

184
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:52,049
to keep infection
under control.

185
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:53,268
Are you just gonna sit there?

186
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:55,382
Everybody chips in,
everybody helps, right?

187
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:02,155
Ready to drive now?

188
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,410
You know, when I saw
the shards of wood,

189
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:07,569
I honestly didn't think
he was gonna make it.

190
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,038
What are you saying?

191
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:12,472
I'm saying...

192
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,405
Just what I said.

193
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,293
Oh, okay.

194
00:07:18,378 --> 00:07:20,949
'Cause, you know, that kinda
sounded like a compliment.

195
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,460
Would you like a gold star
on your report card?

196
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:25,115
No.

197
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:26,822
But if you're gonna
compliment me,

198
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:28,346
it should sound
like a compliment.

199
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:30,392
It was implied.

200
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:32,968
Despite the fact that you took
a job in a public hospital

201
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,163
and then refused to help.

202
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,094
I didn't take the job
to help out everyone.

203
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:40,366
I took the job
to save trauma victims.

204
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:43,937
If a patient who needs
a trauma surgeon rolls up,

205
00:07:44,022 --> 00:07:45,663
I need to be
at the top of my game.

206
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:48,104
And that may require
a shower or a nap

207
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:49,975
or a protein bar,

208
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,282
but whatever it takes,
I'm gonna do it,

209
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:54,139
because I need to be ready.

210
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:57,014
Self-care saves lives.

211
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:00,959
Might not be the New Amsterdam
way, but...

212
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:02,566
it's my way.

213
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,077
What?

214
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:09,882
Nothing, um...

215
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,460
that makes perfect sense.

216
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:15,671
But?

217
00:08:16,348 --> 00:08:19,507
But I save lives
every day too.

218
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:21,820
And without naps.

219
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,680
It was totally packed.
I mean, every seat was taken,

220
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,298
but I desperately wanted
the aisle.

221
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:51,786
So I swapped with her

222
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:54,301
and endured the horrific middle
seat like a proper gentleman.

223
00:08:54,386 --> 00:08:57,465
And the rest as they say
is history.

224
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:01,612
So how 'bout you?
How'd you two meet?

225
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:07,129
Uh, that is a very
funny story actually,

226
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,129
because I work for the, uh,
Yankees.

227
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:13,908
Don't be modest, babe.

228
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,043
He's the general manager.

229
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:19,205
And I, believe it or not...
I worked for the Mets.

230
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,364
The Mets.
And she's their general manager.

231
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:22,637
Wait.
Seriously?

232
00:09:22,722 --> 00:09:24,263
Yeah, I know.
It's kind of hard to believe,

233
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:25,536
- but it's...
- We met at

234
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:26,931
- a General Managers Convention.
- That's-yeah...

235
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:28,427
Wait, I didn't even know
those were a thing.

236
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:29,661
Oh, yeah.
No, no, no.

237
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:30,907
We don't call it inside
baseball for nothing.

238
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:33,209
- You're funny.
- Dad! Mom!

239
00:09:33,294 --> 00:09:34,450
Come look at this!

240
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:36,168
Coming, honey.

241
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:38,442
- It was so nice to meet you.
- You too.

242
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:40,695
You guys are like
the perfect family.

243
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,176
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

244
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,911
- See ya.
- Bye.

245
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:50,400
Hey.
What are you doing?

246
00:09:50,484 --> 00:09:51,706
Mmm.

247
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,877

Oh.

250
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,801
Hey, buddy.
You okay?

251
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:13,520
Hey, buddy.
Wanna get up?

252
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:15,911
Oh, you got it?

253
00:10:19,338 --> 00:10:21,216
- Liam.
- Hi.

254
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,599
- I'm... I'm so sorry about that.
- How'd you get so far ahead of me, buddy?

255
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:24,926
No, no.
That's okay.

256
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:25,941
Um, I don't mean to pry,

257
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,668
but does your son often
have difficulty standing?

258
00:10:28,783 --> 00:10:30,075
- Uh...
- He's always been

259
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,809
a... bit clumsy, but...

260
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:34,129
- nothing out of the ordinary.
- Yeah, why?

261
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,707
Only asking
because I'm a doctor.

262
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,519
Do you have a pediatrician?

263
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:41,887
Not at the moment.

264
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:43,387
Um, um, we just moved here,

265
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:45,356
and with everything we're...
We're still...

266
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:47,754
- Does...
- Liam.

267
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,243
Liam, does he have, um,
difficulty going upstairs,

268
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:54,504
or does he get tired easily?

269
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:57,402
Why, is...

270
00:10:58,248 --> 00:10:59,774
Something wrong with him?

271
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:02,419
How about this?
Come to New Amsterdam with me,

272
00:11:02,504 --> 00:11:05,081
let me run a few tests
just to be sure.

273
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:10,895
- Lead the way.
- Okay.

274
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,743
Mm, come here, buddy.

275
00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:19,684
- Wha...
- Oh!

276
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:21,051
Mom.

277
00:11:21,136 --> 00:11:23,334
Darling, you can't just go
barreling into people like that.

278
00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:24,974
- You're gonna break my arm or something
- Okay.

279
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:27,597
Okay, okay, look, I love all
the time we've spent together,

280
00:11:27,682 --> 00:11:28,690
- I do, but...
- Aw,

281
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:30,413
You cannot just show up
here every... <font color="#ffff00">- me too, sweetheart.</font>

282
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:32,472
Whenever you wanna
see me, okay?

283
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:34,765
We need boundaries.

284
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:38,245
I know.
I agree, and I understand.

285
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:40,554
- But I'm not here to see you.
- Hmm?

286
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:45,743
I hope you have
a fabulous day.

287
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:47,560
Okay.

288
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:54,424
<i>Casey, hi.
Shh.</i>

289
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:57,310
Okay, okay.

290
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,790
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

291
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:06,901
Has my mother
been harassing you?

292
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,602
I don't know your mother.

293
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,191
I just saw you two
out in the hall.

294
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:16,724
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Uh, we just met.

295
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:18,399
You were hugging.

296
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,478
- Were we?
- Yeah.

297
00:12:20,563 --> 00:12:22,252
Incoming!

298
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:26,077
Construction scaffolding
collapsed near 46th and Lex.

299
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,524
There's five more
after this one.

300
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:31,000
Okay, let's, uh, get them
to Bay 23 and um, page Ortho.

301
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:32,823
Okay, we got multiple burns.

302
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:34,260
Let's start a line.
I'm'na be right back.

303
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:36,746
There's so much blood.

304
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:39,091
Okay, you just need
some stitches, okay?

305
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,483
Let's get her to Bay 29.

306
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:43,621
Hang two liters normal saline
wide open.

307
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:46,068
You see anything
that interests you today?

308
00:12:46,153 --> 00:12:48,606
Mmm,
nope.

309
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:51,146
Always a pleasure, Dr. Shin.

310
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,624
<i>Kay, keep breathing.
Keep breathing.</i>

311
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,340
Do you know what this is?

312
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:58,404
If I say yes,
will you not tell me?

313
00:12:58,489 --> 00:12:59,981
No,
it's the needlessly complicated

314
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:01,685
and brain-numbingly
detailed application

315
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,825
for the state hospital
accreditation review.

316
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,811
Hmm, don't you have
another year until that's due?

317
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:06,553
Yes, we do,

318
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:07,982
but if I wait that long
it's never gonna get done,

319
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:10,904
so if we just knock this out
today, it'll be off our plates.

320
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:12,298
I think...
I think you mean your plate.

321
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:14,561
Uh, our plate.
Like, shared plate.

322
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:16,215
Like tapas, you know?
Two hours.

323
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:17,317
- Tops.
- Fine.

324
00:13:17,402 --> 00:13:19,059
- Great.
- See you after work.

325
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:23,265
Plasma exchange
is still considered

326
00:13:23,349 --> 00:13:26,138
to be one of the most effective
first-line therapies

327
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,450
for autoimmune encephalitis.

328
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:30,446
They didn't have hazelnut,
honey.

329
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,274
Of course they didn't.

330
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:34,537
- Mmm.
- Your husband is all set.

331
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,322
The process will take
several hours,

332
00:13:36,406 --> 00:13:38,454
but I will check on you
in a bit.

333
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:40,345
At least I brought a book.

334
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:43,446
Hang on.
Dr. Kapoor.

335
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,464
What's going on with you?

336
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:50,349
What's going on?

337
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:53,208
You look different
from our last visit.

338
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:54,700
Do I?

339
00:13:54,785 --> 00:13:55,864
Don't be modest.

340
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:58,059
Well, I can't imagine...

341
00:13:58,153 --> 00:13:59,519
Whatever you're doing...

342
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,609
It's working for you.

343
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:06,098
Mmm.

344
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,699
Congratulations,

345
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,458
you are officially halfway
through your chemotherapy.

346
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:16,362
Does my ovarian cancer
know that?

347
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:18,677
How have you been doing
at home?

348
00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:20,887
Humble.
Can't eat.

349
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,370
Can't get outta bed.
Can't even shower by myself.

350
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,416
If not for Oliver,
I don't know what I'd do.

351
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,288
"In sickness and in health."

352
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,654
Guess you should've read
the fine print.

353
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,621
What?
What is it?

354
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:42,255
Lena has necrotizing
fasciitis on her calf...

355
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,568
From the cancer?

356
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:46,075
No, it started as a small cut
that got infected.

357
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,005
We need to get her
to the ED straight away.

358
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,568
I can't believe
I missed a cut.

359
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:51,600
I guess I just never look
at the back of her legs.

360
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:53,091
It's okay.
These things happen.

361
00:14:58,135 --> 00:14:59,835
Dr. Ignatius Frome

362
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,625
is offered as administrator
to the appellant's

363
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,280
ERPOmandated
psychological evaluation.

364
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,178
Mr. Phillips, do you accept?

365
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:12,350
We do.

366
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:14,246
State of New York?

367
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:16,552
- Good by us, Your Honor.
- So ordered.

368
00:15:16,636 --> 00:15:18,765
We'll reconvene once
Mr. Phillip's evaluation

369
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,241
is complete.
We're adjourned.

370
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:29,420
Brendan, hi.
Dr. Frome.

371
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:31,616
I can't believe
this is happening.

372
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:34,038
Well, why don't we take
a little walk up to my office,

373
00:15:34,123 --> 00:15:35,264
and we'll have a chat, okay?

374
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,087
How do the cops have any
right to take away my gun?

375
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,012
I'm trained, and I'm licensed...

376
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:44,319
Well, yeah, the issue is not
if you're licensed.

377
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:46,016
The Red Flag Law
was put in place

378
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,946
to determine if you are an
immediate danger to yourself

379
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,281
or to others.
That's it.

380
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:55,866
I can't believe Ellie
did this to me.

381
00:15:56,194 --> 00:15:58,718
Yeah, divorce makes people
see the worst in each other,

382
00:15:58,803 --> 00:15:59,858
for sure,
but that is why

383
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:02,293
it's important
to have an impartial evaluator

384
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,104
in the process.
You ready?

385
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,058
Any idea why your wife
would say you're so dangerous?

386
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:12,608
Yeah.

387
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:14,523
'Cause I almost killed her.

388
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:28,332
Your feet make good drums.

389
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:31,497
Hey.

390
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:34,353
Hey, we'll be right back.

391
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,738
We sequenced
your son's genes

392
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:46,573
and were able to determine the
cause of the mobility issues.

393
00:16:49,464 --> 00:16:51,249
It's bad, isn't it?

394
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:56,478
Your son has
what's known as DMD,

395
00:16:56,823 --> 00:16:58,839
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

396
00:16:58,924 --> 00:17:01,870
It is a rapidly progressive
degenerative disease

397
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:05,315
that affects
around 1 in 5,000 boys.

398
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:09,057
But he's gonna be okay,
right?

399
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,455
There's no easy way
to say this.

400
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:19,213
There is no cure right now.

401
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:24,419
As he ages he will experience
continual muscle loss.

402
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:27,814
He'll be confined
to a wheelchair by his teens.

403
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:32,987
And by his twenties,
he will likely succumb to it.

404
00:17:36,646 --> 00:17:38,096
I don't...

405
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:40,643
How did he...

406
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:43,260
It's inherited.

407
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:46,808
It's a mutation
of the dystrophin gene

408
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:49,705
on the X chromosome passed down
from mother to son.

409
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,752
- I did this?
- No.

410
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:02,892
There's nothing
you could've done.

411
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:08,636
This can't be happening.

412
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,635
My baby boy.

413
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,818
Oh, my...

414
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:21,041
- Thank you, Oliver.
- Anything to help.

415
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,580
Okay, you two
just hang tight.

416
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:28,527
I need to perform
a debridement

417
00:18:28,611 --> 00:18:30,180
on Lena Luzan in Bay 28.

418
00:18:30,264 --> 00:18:32,964
- Local anesthesia or a top...
- <i>Little help here!</i>

419
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:36,578
- What happened?
- No clue.

420
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:37,927
His heart rate
just fell off a cliff.

421
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:41,453
No warning.
The same thing over here!

422
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:47,850
Bradycardia!
Need a crash cart, STAT!

423
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,548
Two more crashing over here!

424
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:56,642
What the hell is happening?

425
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,815
It's everyone who came in
from the scaffolding accident.

426
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,426
- At least everyone is stable.
- What was that all about?

427
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:09,314
And he emerges
from the break room.

428
00:19:09,853 --> 00:19:11,285
To what do we owe this honor?

429
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,588
We got a incoming trauma
actually worth your time?

430
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:15,322
We'll see.

431
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:17,408
Hey.

432
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:19,345
Hey.

433
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:21,080
Incoming!

434
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:23,486
30-year-old male in MVA.

435
00:19:23,571 --> 00:19:26,627
1965 antique roadster
versus a concrete divider.

436
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:28,292
- What is that?
- What's left of the steering column.

437
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,031
Now we're talking.
Right this way.

438
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,166
"Hey."

439
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:41,150
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

440
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:46,642
Maybe her hand just, like,
grazed your leg accidentally.

441
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,860
This woman definitely
cupped my buttocks.

442
00:19:50,802 --> 00:19:52,667
That's a sentence
I hoped never to hear out loud.

443
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:54,408
Why is it so hard
for you to believe

444
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,861
that this woman
is actually attracted to me?

445
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,856
Because at Walter's
last session,

446
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,885
they kept going on and on about
renewing their wedding vows.

447
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,124
Yes.
I guess timing is suspect.

448
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:07,619
All I'm saying is,

449
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:10,088
is it possible
this is all in your head?

450
00:20:18,963 --> 00:20:20,252
Robin.

451
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,392
Uh, my husband's ready
for his next round.

452
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,635
The question is, are you?

453
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,408
There's a dozen
active clinical trials

454
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:32,213
studying potential treatments
for Duchennes.

455
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,932
Our job will be finding one
that works for Liam.

456
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:37,072
Oh, we're not picky,
Dr. Goodwin.

457
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:38,712
I know, but they are.

458
00:20:38,796 --> 00:20:41,346
Each trial has a rigid set
of inclusion criteria

459
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:44,400
and only accepts patients
that meet them all.

460
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:47,142
They don't make it easy.

461
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:50,175
I say we start
with the East Coast,

462
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,262
and uh,
look at gene therapy trials.

463
00:20:52,347 --> 00:20:53,957
See what we can find.

464
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:57,213
I have to go
to the bathroom.

465
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,516
Okay, kiddo.
Can you walk it?

466
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:02,649
Okay.

467
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:05,119
I gotcha.
Up, up.

468
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,659
I was sound asleep.

469
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:15,604
Around 1:00 a.m.,
I hear this noise.

470
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:16,706
Someone's in the house.

471
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,665
I grab my Glock,
and I head downstairs.

472
00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:19,927
Was it loaded?

473
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:23,377
Someone was breaking in.

474
00:21:23,754 --> 00:21:25,119
Where do you keep your gun?

475
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:28,631
I was protecting my home.

476
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,677
Last time I checked,
it was my right.

477
00:21:30,783 --> 00:21:33,201
I don't have a record.
Not even a misdemeanor.

478
00:21:33,285 --> 00:21:34,385
Okay, so,

479
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,390
you were heading downstairs
with your loaded gun.

480
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:38,260
What happens next?

481
00:21:39,335 --> 00:21:40,892
I see someone in the dark.

482
00:21:41,293 --> 00:21:44,103
I raise my gun,
I tell them to hit the floor,

483
00:21:44,498 --> 00:21:45,831
and then I realize it's Ellie.

484
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:47,476
But you did aim your gun
at her.

485
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:52,626
I mean, yeah.

486
00:21:52,787 --> 00:21:55,837
But I lowered it the second
I knew it was her.

487
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,617
Ellie claims
that she was just there

488
00:21:57,788 --> 00:21:58,835
to pick up some of her stuff.

489
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,530
Had she officially moved out?

490
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:04,870
No, she'd just been staying
at her sister's.

491
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:08,222
Brendan, how would you say
you're handling this divorce?

492
00:22:08,331 --> 00:22:10,238
That has nothing to do
with anything.

493
00:22:10,322 --> 00:22:12,719
Well, except it does because
I'm trying to get a better idea

494
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:14,563
- of your mental state...
- Do you own a gun?

495
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:17,245
Do you own a gun?

496
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:20,727
That's not...
This is not about me.

497
00:22:21,097 --> 00:22:22,820
Are you sure about that?

498
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:25,688
Tell me.

499
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:28,039
Are you in favor of open carry?

500
00:22:28,175 --> 00:22:29,503
What about
the Second Amendment?

501
00:22:29,588 --> 00:22:30,682
Brendan...

502
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,324
I'm the one whose house
got broken into.

503
00:22:32,408 --> 00:22:35,425
I'm the one whose rights
are being stripped away,

504
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,715
and you sit there,
and you claim to be impartial,

505
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,362
but from over here,

506
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:43,383
it sure as hell seems your just
another bleeding heart liberal

507
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:46,941
who made up his mind the second
he heard the word "gun."

508
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:54,282
Well, that's very good news.

509
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:56,323
Maybe we should cut it down
to twice a week.

510
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,285
Sorry to interrupt.
Dr. Cholokian?

511
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,071
- Yeah, you found him.
- Great.

512
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:01,286
You know,
I was just reading up

513
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,943
on your clinical collaboration

514
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:05,032
with Children's
in Sacramento and I...

515
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:06,504
- Let me stop you right there.
- Really?

516
00:23:06,588 --> 00:23:08,774
I haven't even gotten to
the glowing praise part yet.

517
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:11,691
You've heard about
my DMD clinical trial

518
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:13,581
because you have a patient
you want to enroll.

519
00:23:14,908 --> 00:23:17,558
Well, uh, guilty as charged.

520
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:19,691
Has your patient already
submitted a pre-application

521
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:21,636
to the Biomedical Research
Application Portal?

522
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:25,027
My patient just got
the diagnosis this morning.

523
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,612
I'll take that as a no.

524
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:29,066
Uh...

525
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:32,183
yeah, I was just thinking that,
uh...

526
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:33,956
What, you could
sweet-talk me?

527
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:38,644
You don't think I want to help
as many children as I can?

528
00:23:38,802 --> 00:23:39,948
I do.

529
00:23:40,412 --> 00:23:42,591
But my trial has over two dozen
exclusion criteria

530
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:43,703
for a reason.

531
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:45,427
We have limited resources
to work with.

532
00:23:45,512 --> 00:23:47,430
I know, I read your criteria.
Trust me.

533
00:23:47,515 --> 00:23:49,375
Liam Cafferty is a perfect fit.

534
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,204
There is no perfect fit.

535
00:23:51,314 --> 00:23:52,547
Except for Liam.

536
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:55,868
He's six and a half,
he loves building with blocks,

537
00:23:55,953 --> 00:23:57,414
and right now,
he doesn't qualify for

538
00:23:57,499 --> 00:23:59,008
any other gene therapy trial

539
00:23:59,093 --> 00:24:02,404
in the country, so
this could be his only shot...

540
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:04,831
You know why we only accept

541
00:24:04,915 --> 00:24:06,137
patients through
the online portal?

542
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:08,835
So we can remove
the advantage of privilege.

543
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:11,707
Like you cornering me in my lab

544
00:24:11,922 --> 00:24:14,362
to make a personal plea
for one patient.

545
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:17,242
I'm sorry, Dr...
Goodwin.

546
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:21,670
Medical director
at, uh, New Amsterdam,

547
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,718
where you dump
a lot of your patients

548
00:24:23,803 --> 00:24:26,039
to keep
your infection rates low.

549
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:28,578
So tell me again
about privilege.

550
00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:32,625
Two conditions.

551
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:35,382
First: I need a psyche eval of
the boy by the end of the day

552
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:37,376
along with a completed
pre-application form.

553
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:38,386
Done.

554
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,084
Second: he'll need to pass

555
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:41,555
his physical fitness
requirements.

556
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,651
Got it.

557
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,306
Thank you.

558
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:49,390
Casey?

559
00:24:49,475 --> 00:24:50,915
Zoll pads are working
for now.

560
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,329
As if being crushed by falling
scaffolding wasn't enough.

561
00:24:53,414 --> 00:24:54,915
Whatever they were
all exposed to,

562
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,317
it's not messing around.

563
00:24:56,401 --> 00:24:58,102
The sputum samples should
be back in a few hours.

564
00:24:58,186 --> 00:25:00,843
Okay, well, uh, until then,
you, uh,

565
00:25:00,927 --> 00:25:03,411
care to tell me why
you and my mother were hugging?

566
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:05,476
Lauren, I already told you...

567
00:25:05,561 --> 00:25:06,992
Ooh, God, here we go.

568
00:25:07,077 --> 00:25:09,126
This is Jake Holstein
all over again...

569
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,811
I feel like you want me to
ask who Jake Holstein is.

570
00:25:11,895 --> 00:25:13,813
No, I don't need you to ask.

571
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:16,977
Jake Holstein
was this super cool senior

572
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:18,633
who liked me
when I was a freshman.

573
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:20,428
But every time he would try
to hang out with me,

574
00:25:20,512 --> 00:25:21,995
he would get dragged into these

575
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:24,438
long, flirty conversations
with my mother,

576
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,130
because Jeanie always has to be
the focus

577
00:25:26,214 --> 00:25:27,649
of every guy in the room.

578
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:29,351
I need a code team here!

579
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,454
Lena.

580
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:32,672
Lena!

581
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:37,117
Her heart rate just crashed
out of nowhere.

582
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,384
Is she going to be okay?

583
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:40,523
We're working on it, sir.
Please give us some room.

584
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:43,385
Sudden drop in heart rate,
normal O2 saturation.

585
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,235
Same symptoms as
the construction site.

586
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,682
But Lena came from me.

587
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:48,166
She was never near
the accident.

588
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:50,502
So whatever's happening
to our patients,

589
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:52,893
we're the ones
doing it to them.

590
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:00,810
- Uh, you okay?
- What?

591
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:02,791
Hi.
Um...

592
00:26:02,954 --> 00:26:05,690
I might be making premature
judgments from a place of bias.

593
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:09,080
That's great, because I need
you to blindly sign this.

594
00:26:09,164 --> 00:26:10,900
Whatever happened to,
"how can I help"?

595
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:12,582
No, don't have time for that.
This is a psyche eval

596
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:13,693
for a patient
you're never gonna meet.

597
00:26:13,777 --> 00:26:15,129
Max, I'm... I'm actually
struggling with something

598
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:16,229
really big right now,

599
00:26:16,314 --> 00:26:17,676
I don't think cutting corners
is the best...

600
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,264
His name is Liam Cafferty.

601
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:21,396
He is a 6-year-old boy
with Duchennes.

602
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,807
Right now he is struggling

603
00:26:22,892 --> 00:26:25,917
to get into the only
clinical trial in this country

604
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,878
that could possibly
extend his life.

605
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:34,422
You're the best, buddy.
Um...

606
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,924
Thanks.

607
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:41,128
- Iggy, Iggy.
- Hi.

608
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:42,268
I need your advice.

609
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:44,158
No, actually, BJ, I'm going
through something big.

610
00:26:44,242 --> 00:26:46,465
- I need you to maybe...
- I am being sexually propositioned

611
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:48,158
by a patient's wife.

612
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,963
My God, everyone has
such good comebacks today.

613
00:26:52,086 --> 00:26:53,830
All right, okay, all right,
I'll bite.

614
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:56,087
Are you sure
that she's hitting on you?

615
00:26:56,211 --> 00:26:57,941
Why is it so difficult
for anyone to believe it?

616
00:26:58,025 --> 00:27:00,244
- Mm, mmm...
- That woman rubbed my shoulders,

617
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:02,567
she whispered into my ear,
and she cupped my bottom.

618
00:27:02,652 --> 00:27:04,265
Please tell me what to do.
Please.

619
00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:05,940
Oh, okay.

620
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,612
Well, actually,
that does sound a lot

621
00:27:07,697 --> 00:27:10,033
- like "erotic transference."
<i>- Speaking Hindi...</i>

622
00:27:10,118 --> 00:27:11,815
Okay, let me explain.
I'll explain it.

623
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,666
If someone is in
a heightened emotional state,

624
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,450
often times they will redirect
their emotions

625
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,620
to their therapist
or their doctor, okay?

626
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:19,729
- Hmm.
- She's vulnerable, she's grateful,

627
00:27:19,814 --> 00:27:21,445
she's probably isn't even fully
aware that she's doing it,

628
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:23,564
so just talk to her.

629
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:25,591
Let her know you want to keep
the relationship professional,

630
00:27:25,675 --> 00:27:27,680
and the bottom cupping
should subside.

631
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:29,088
Thank you.
Thank you.

632
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:32,103

get a breath of fresh air?

Yeah, I'm fine right here.

637
00:27:55,445 --> 00:27:59,408
Can I ask, do you have anyone
helping out at home?

638
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,394
Just me.
And that is fine.

639
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:03,666
I don't mind.

640
00:28:04,322 --> 00:28:06,371
It must be so overwhelming.

641
00:28:06,455 --> 00:28:09,291
Lena's always been the one
to take care of me,

642
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:13,010
so when she got sick, I knew
it was my turn to step up.

643
00:28:13,095 --> 00:28:15,013
And I wanted to.

644
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,002
I wanted to take care of her.

645
00:28:17,893 --> 00:28:22,174
Cooking, bathing,
whatever she needs...

646
00:28:23,877 --> 00:28:24,998
I handle it.

647
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:26,268
Oliver,

648
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:30,395
when was the last time
you took time for yourself?

649
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:35,008
I'm okay, Dr. Sharpe.

650
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:37,080
Really, I'm fine.

651
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:40,670
Right now, my focus is my wife.

652
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:45,276
She's all that matters.

653
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:50,682
Okay, Brendan.
Sorry about that.

654
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,416
I own a gun.

655
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:05,383
A Cricket .22.
It was a gift from my old man.

656
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,971
Yeah, I was, um,

657
00:29:09,344 --> 00:29:11,784
I was eight
when he gave it to me.

658
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:14,526
And I was so excited because

659
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,675
that gun meant that I could
finally go hunting

660
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,530
with him and my brother.

661
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:20,532
So you have a kid's gun?

662
00:29:21,158 --> 00:29:22,360
Well, growing up
in Wisconsin,

663
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:24,318
believe me,
I had more than just the one.

664
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:26,320
A bolt action
deer hunting rifle.

665
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:27,582
A Remington.

666
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,716
Eventually, I got myself
a .270 Winchester...

667
00:29:31,111 --> 00:29:32,370
Accurate weapon.

668
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:34,007
Especially with
the iron sight.

669
00:29:34,444 --> 00:29:36,504
I never thought twice
about my dad's gun collection.

670
00:29:36,588 --> 00:29:39,290
And I could tell you firsthand,
I know the patience

671
00:29:39,374 --> 00:29:41,074
and the discipline you learn
when you're hunting.

672
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:42,951
And I'll never forget looking
over at my old man

673
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:44,469
and knowing that he believed

674
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:45,865
he was teaching me
and my brothers something.

675
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:48,347
Knowing that he was proud.

676
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,824
Also knowing that might be the
closest I'd ever feel to him.

677
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:55,753
Guns are no longer
a part of my life,

678
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,078
but I still have that
Cricket .22 disassembled,

679
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:00,734
under lock and key.

680
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,314
I get that.

681
00:30:03,632 --> 00:30:06,477
Yes, Brendan, I am a bleeding
heart liberal New York doctor.

682
00:30:08,226 --> 00:30:09,499
That's true.

683
00:30:09,752 --> 00:30:12,584
But I also have no problem
with the Second Amendment.

684
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:16,588
I have absolutely no problem
with responsible gun ownership,

685
00:30:16,672 --> 00:30:19,296
which is why I need you to
start answering my questions.

686
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,680
You think you deserve
that Glock?

687
00:30:22,382 --> 00:30:23,944
Let me help you get it back.

688
00:30:28,796 --> 00:30:31,219
Okay, we now have 14 patients

689
00:30:31,304 --> 00:30:32,781
who have crashed
without warning.

690
00:30:32,866 --> 00:30:34,475
This spreadsheet lists
every single medication

691
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,608
- they have received.
- Find the common link.

692
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:37,930
They've all got
normal saline.

693
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:39,611
Well, apart from these two.

694
00:30:39,695 --> 00:30:40,914
What about Ativan?

695
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:42,440
No, Lena didn't get that.

696
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:44,355
Oh, wait.
They all had bandages?

697
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:46,574
And alcohol swabs,
but how would that make sense?

698
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,097
My patient's crashing.

699
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:49,753
I need an Epi drip
in here stat.

700
00:30:52,663 --> 00:30:54,495
Let's get the drip started
at 2 micrograms a minute.

701
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:56,627
- Copy that.
- Wild guess.

702
00:30:56,712 --> 00:30:58,456
His heart rate just plummeted
out of nowhere?

703
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,331
Yeah, faster than a drunk
on a mountain bike.

704
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:01,633
What drugs did you give him?

705
00:31:01,717 --> 00:31:03,504
Uh, a shot of morphine
through an autoinjector line.

706
00:31:03,588 --> 00:31:05,550
All our other patients
were administered morphine

707
00:31:05,634 --> 00:31:07,166
using the same injector system.

708
00:31:07,251 --> 00:31:09,713
- That's gotta be our link.
- You think an overdose?

709
00:31:09,812 --> 00:31:11,252
It doesn't make any sense.

710
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:13,430
These injector syringes come
prefilled at two milliliters.

711
00:31:13,514 --> 00:31:15,515
There's no way that two
milliliters of morphine

712
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,151
cause this kind of reaction.

713
00:31:17,237 --> 00:31:20,619
Unless what's inside
isn't morphine.

714
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:28,442
Liam's labs are all
within normal range.

715
00:31:28,526 --> 00:31:30,444
He meets the age
and weight criteria.

716
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:33,307
All that's left is
a TTSTAND unassisted.

717
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:36,145
Hey, Liam.
Do you like games?

718
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:38,887
Come check this out.
This is a game we can play.

719
00:31:39,151 --> 00:31:41,894
You can lay on your back
on this mat like me.

720
00:31:41,979 --> 00:31:43,196
Right?

721
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,676
Yeah.
All the way...

722
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,830
Perfect.

723
00:31:45,915 --> 00:31:48,156
And then when we say "go,"
you're gonna roll over

724
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:50,784
and then you're gonna stand up
as fast as you can.

725
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,858
Can you do that for us?

726
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:55,229
- Yeah.
- Cool.

727
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:56,971
All right, buddy,
you stay there.

728
00:31:57,056 --> 00:31:58,907
We'll get us to... wait, wait.
Not yet, not yet.

729
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:01,736
You stay there, and we're
gonna watch right here, okay?

730
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,173
He needs to come to a full
standing position unassisted

731
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:06,524
in under ten seconds
to qualify.

732
00:32:06,783 --> 00:32:07,877
Ten seconds?

733
00:32:07,962 --> 00:32:09,276
Well,
I know it sounds extreme,

734
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:11,041
but it's a marker
for muscle damage.

735
00:32:11,158 --> 00:32:12,878
If he can't meet that time,

736
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:14,488
we won't benefit
from the trial.

737
00:32:18,026 --> 00:32:19,885
You got this, son.

738
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:23,541
All you gotta do is get up.

739
00:32:25,213 --> 00:32:26,631
And begin.

740
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:44,619
- Yay!
- Yay!

741
00:32:44,704 --> 00:32:46,606
Great job, buddy.

742
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:48,563
That was great.

743
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:52,283
I'm sorry.

744
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,790
So...

745
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,442
that's it?

746
00:32:58,747 --> 00:33:01,416
The exclusion criteria
is clear.

747
00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:02,754
No, no, no.
Hang on.

748
00:33:02,838 --> 00:33:04,535
He's... he's just warming up.

749
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,432
All right, let's...
Let's give him another try.

750
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:10,160
Okay, come on.
Come down here, buddy.

751
00:33:10,245 --> 00:33:11,598
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

752
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,025
That was great.

753
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:15,723
Okay, great, but uh...

754
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,246
even faster this time.

755
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:20,598
Okay, can you...
Can you do it faster?

756
00:33:21,104 --> 00:33:22,300
I think so.

757
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:24,174
That-a-boy.

758
00:33:24,642 --> 00:33:25,951
I know you can.

759
00:33:26,035 --> 00:33:28,301
All right, let me put you back
on your back.

760
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:31,870
And, uh, nice and fast.

761
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:33,521
Okay?

762
00:33:34,783 --> 00:33:36,205
Okay.

763
00:33:37,394 --> 00:33:38,612
He's ready.

764
00:33:39,004 --> 00:33:41,315
And begin.

765
00:33:45,018 --> 00:33:47,027
Come on, honey.
You can do this.

766
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,776
You got this, son.

767
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:15,869
- I did it.
- Yes, yes, yes, sweetie.

768
00:34:17,924 --> 00:34:19,918
Yes, sweetie.

769
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,404
I'm very sorry.

770
00:34:39,925 --> 00:34:42,533
I may have found something.

771
00:34:43,877 --> 00:34:45,804
It's in Seattle,
which I know is not ideal,

772
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,010
but it's something.

773
00:34:48,112 --> 00:34:52,566
It's a Tier Two trial
that has shown mild success

774
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:54,214
in slowing down
the degeneration.

775
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:55,601
"Mild success"?

776
00:34:55,686 --> 00:34:56,992
I know.
It's not...

777
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:02,932
It could buy you
a little more time as a family.

778
00:35:03,244 --> 00:35:05,221
Can Liam even get in?

779
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:08,363
He's in if you want it.

780
00:35:08,448 --> 00:35:09,994
Yeah, of course we want it.

781
00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:11,176
We slow it down now,

782
00:35:11,261 --> 00:35:13,722
and then we keep our eyes open
for better studies,

783
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:15,790
for more promising trials
coming down the line,

784
00:35:15,874 --> 00:35:17,183
and then if there's ever
a big breakthrough...

785
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:21,690
Well, it doesn't exactly work
like that.

786
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:24,823
What do you mean?

787
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,454
These trials use
a deactivated cold virus

788
00:35:27,538 --> 00:35:29,978
to deliver the new gene.

789
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:33,460
So once Liam's exposed, his
body will develop antibodies.

790
00:35:33,544 --> 00:35:34,768
Meaning?

791
00:35:34,853 --> 00:35:36,972
Meaning that
if we ever tried again,

792
00:35:37,057 --> 00:35:38,238
regardless of the trial,

793
00:35:38,323 --> 00:35:41,862
his body would just
destroy the gene.

794
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:46,058
So we only get one shot
at this?

795
00:35:47,503 --> 00:35:48,870
Unfortunately.

796
00:35:48,956 --> 00:35:51,253
That... that's ridiculous.

797
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:53,464
There must be something else
that we can do.

798
00:35:54,683 --> 00:35:56,253
I wish there were.

799
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:57,744
We'll do the trial.

800
00:35:59,643 --> 00:36:02,534
- We have to talk about this.
- What is there to talk about?

801
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,050
You heard what he said.

802
00:36:04,135 --> 00:36:06,902
Best case is mild success
at slowing it down.

803
00:36:06,987 --> 00:36:08,160
It is better
than doing nothing.

804
00:36:08,244 --> 00:36:10,542
- Is it?
- Of course it is.

805
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:13,667
What... what if next year
they develop a cure,

806
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:18,674
and we have blown our one shot
with this... this half measure?

807
00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:20,124
He's sick.

808
00:36:23,104 --> 00:36:25,161
He's dying.

809
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,518
How can we do nothing?

810
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,579
Um, yeah,
divorce can be life-altering.

811
00:36:43,664 --> 00:36:46,868
That idea of the future you had
in your mind, it's gone.

812
00:36:46,953 --> 00:36:48,321
How does that make you feel?

813
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:51,930
It hurts.
I loved her.

814
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,431
I bet it's hard to hear

815
00:36:53,516 --> 00:36:55,212
that she thinks
you're capable of violence.

816
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,688
She doesn't.
Ellie's just being dramatic.

817
00:36:57,866 --> 00:37:00,158
She wants to take everything
from me.

818
00:37:00,563 --> 00:37:02,228
Well, who wanted the divorce?

819
00:37:02,994 --> 00:37:05,962
She says that we,
"grew apart,"

820
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:07,987
which is just code for,
"she felt like it,"

821
00:37:08,072 --> 00:37:09,337
as far as I'm concerned.

822
00:37:09,422 --> 00:37:11,252
And now the courts
are bending over backwards

823
00:37:11,337 --> 00:37:13,369
to make sure
she's not taken advantage of.

824
00:37:13,454 --> 00:37:15,673
God forbid someone should care
about my rights.

825
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:19,519
'Cause she broke into
your house, right?

826
00:37:20,244 --> 00:37:21,322
That's right.

827
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,027
And I bet over
these last few months,

828
00:37:23,111 --> 00:37:25,035
you've really felt like you've
lost control over your life.

829
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,337
To say the least.

830
00:37:26,422 --> 00:37:29,054
The night she broke in...
You heard the noise, right?

831
00:37:29,139 --> 00:37:30,752
You grabbed your gun.

832
00:37:31,032 --> 00:37:32,478
- Did you feel afraid?
- Hell no.

833
00:37:32,563 --> 00:37:34,568
- What did you feel?
- In charge.

834
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:35,884
What else?

835
00:37:36,912 --> 00:37:38,215
I felt like a man again.

836
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,957
So you went towards
the sound,

837
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:41,533
gun in hand,
down the stairs.

838
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,683
What did you wanna do?
I wanted to handle things.

839
00:37:43,768 --> 00:37:45,511
I wanted to protect
what was mine.

840
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,037
You aimed the gun, you
realized it's not the burglar,

841
00:37:48,252 --> 00:37:49,865
- it's your wife.
- Yeah.

842
00:37:50,589 --> 00:37:52,010
What'd you do then?

843
00:37:53,637 --> 00:37:55,097
Nothing.

844
00:37:55,182 --> 00:37:57,214
- You lowered the gun.
- No.

845
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:04,847
I just kept it there.

846
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:08,703
Just trained on her,
just for a second or two.

847
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:16,587
You should've seen
the look on her face.

848
00:38:22,683 --> 00:38:24,816
Did you ever think about
pulling the trigger?

849
00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:27,862
No.

850
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:31,636
Of course not.

851
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:38,973
I just wanted to scare her.

852
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:43,683
I wanted her to feel
like I felt for once...

853
00:38:46,847 --> 00:38:48,066
Powerless.

854
00:38:55,116 --> 00:38:56,409
Mrs. Kent,
thank you for coming.

855
00:38:56,494 --> 00:38:58,043
We have something
quite important to discuss.

856
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,045
Hmm, that sounds enticing.

857
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,964
You can leave the door open.
I...

858
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,184
Okay.

859
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,630
Where should we do this
discussing then?

860
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:06,907
The sofa.

861
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,770
No, no, no sofa.

862
00:39:08,855 --> 00:39:10,448
I believe what's happening here

863
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:13,887
is that you are mistaking
your feelings of concern

864
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:17,222
over your husband's
diagnosis with my own. <font color="#ffff00">- Mmm.</font>

865
00:39:17,307 --> 00:39:19,862
I mean, you are transferring
your erotic nature to me...

866
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:21,058
Wait, no, no...

867
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:22,535
Ooh, what are you trying
to say, Vijay?

868
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,060
I am not great with words.

869
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:26,626
- Oh, we don't have to speak.
- Mm-hmm.

870
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:31,449
Your eyes.

871
00:39:31,534 --> 00:39:32,582
Go on.

872
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:35,073
Oh, Lord.
Come with me.

873
00:39:35,341 --> 00:39:37,607
Hurry up.
Ooh!

874
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:41,543
Robin Kent's MRI results.

875
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:43,772
She has a meningioma?

876
00:39:43,857 --> 00:39:45,776
The tumor is pressing up
against her pleasure center.

877
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,343
It's what has been causing
her heightened libido

878
00:39:48,495 --> 00:39:49,891
and lowered inhibitions.

879
00:39:49,976 --> 00:39:52,506
She needs surgery right away.
I can schedule it.

880
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:53,699
Thank you.
We must make sure

881
00:39:53,783 --> 00:39:54,961
she's healthy enough

882
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:56,280
to renew her wedding vows.

883
00:39:57,217 --> 00:39:58,616
How'd you figure it out?

884
00:39:58,701 --> 00:40:01,186
I saw an uneven dilation
in her pupils.

885
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:02,741
You two had to be
pretty close

886
00:40:02,826 --> 00:40:04,567
to notice something like that.

887
00:40:19,866 --> 00:40:21,381
How can I help?

888
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:24,827
I don't think you can.

889
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:29,811
Jeremy and I just see things
differently.

890
00:40:29,943 --> 00:40:33,827
He wants to wait for a trial
that can cure him,

891
00:40:33,912 --> 00:40:36,772
even though a trial like that
doesn't exist.

892
00:40:38,764 --> 00:40:40,548
What do you want?

893
00:40:44,871 --> 00:40:46,194
I...

894
00:40:47,804 --> 00:40:51,248
passed this disease
onto my son.

895
00:40:53,224 --> 00:40:54,443
It came from me.

896
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,905
And I just feel like
I have to do something.

897
00:41:00,894 --> 00:41:02,389
Anything.

898
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:11,147
Liam is, um...

899
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:12,499
he's smart.

900
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:16,100
He's funny.

901
00:41:16,751 --> 00:41:19,061
He's kind.
Ridiculously adorable.

902
00:41:23,436 --> 00:41:24,790
And he's strong.

903
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:29,444
That's what you passed on,

904
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,116
if you ask me.

905
00:41:32,046 --> 00:41:33,561
And you have time

906
00:41:34,212 --> 00:41:35,944
to pass down even more,

907
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:38,506
regardless of what you
and Jeremy choose.

908
00:41:41,184 --> 00:41:42,780
All we can do...

909
00:41:44,695 --> 00:41:45,960
As parents, really.

910
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,483
I mean...

911
00:41:48,712 --> 00:41:51,358
just try to pass down
the best of ourselves.

912
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:55,350
To our kids.

913
00:41:57,298 --> 00:41:59,694
In the limited time
that we have.

914
00:42:05,754 --> 00:42:08,609
Okay, Casey's at the lab with
some of the prefilled syringes.

915
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:09,584
We'll see what they find out.

916
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:11,501
Well, if we can't figure out
what we're giving him,

917
00:42:11,585 --> 00:42:12,999
this man's gonna die
right here on the table.

918
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:14,475
Mass spectrometry
test results

919
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,746
are gonna take
at least an hour.

920
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,967
You have a better idea?

921
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,967
I'm not sure it's better.

922
00:42:22,194 --> 00:42:23,334
Lauren!

923
00:42:27,663 --> 00:42:29,280
- What is it?
- It's morphine.

924
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,640
But it can't be.
Because then that means...

925
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:33,844
This isn't why
our patients are crashing.

926
00:42:33,945 --> 00:42:35,994
Heart rate's bottoming out.

927
00:42:36,623 --> 00:42:38,255
- Start with these.
- No.

928
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:39,561
This steering column's
made of metal.

929
00:42:39,645 --> 00:42:40,639
If the pads fire

930
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,914
then the charge will arc
through his chest.

931
00:42:41,998 --> 00:42:43,481
Well,
that limits our options.

932
00:42:43,566 --> 00:42:45,233
I'm cracking open his chest.

933
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:47,373
I need a scalpel
and a sonic bone saw.

934
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:48,767
I'll get him prepped.

935
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:57,265
I'm starting
the mid sternal thoracotomy.

936
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:58,616
Wait!

937
00:42:59,592 --> 00:43:00,798
Wh-what are you doing?

938
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:01,931
What is that?

939
00:43:03,419 --> 00:43:04,858
It's Narcan.

940
00:43:07,063 --> 00:43:09,764
Heart rate's rising.

941
00:43:09,978 --> 00:43:11,584
Saturation's up.

942
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:13,763
It's working.

943
00:43:13,848 --> 00:43:15,504
How did you know?

944
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:17,554
This.

945
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,253
That's more than two mls
of morphine.

946
00:43:19,337 --> 00:43:20,967
I'll wager
it's three times that.

947
00:43:21,052 --> 00:43:22,428
So it wasn't the wrong meds.

948
00:43:22,513 --> 00:43:24,671
No, these prefilled syringes
were designed

949
00:43:24,756 --> 00:43:26,283
so we wouldn't have to think
about measurements

950
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:27,522
in the heat of a crisis.

951
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:28,734
And these ones came to us
overfilled.

952
00:43:28,818 --> 00:43:30,519
Which we would've never have
found out in time

953
00:43:30,603 --> 00:43:31,870
if you hadn't
have popped one open.

954
00:43:31,954 --> 00:43:33,655
We can't be the only hospital
that uses these.

955
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:34,748
I'll sound the alarm.

956
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:36,436
We have a Class Two Recall
on our hands.

957
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:43,343
Dr. Frome, you completed
your psychological evaluation

958
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:46,593
of Brendan Phillips
for the ERPO proceedings?

959
00:43:46,678 --> 00:43:48,933
- I have, your Honor.
- What did you find?

960
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:50,717
Uh, Brendan Philips,

961
00:43:51,538 --> 00:43:54,062
he exhibits signs
of repressed anger.

962
00:43:54,147 --> 00:43:55,867
Um, his impulse control
leaves...

963
00:43:55,952 --> 00:43:57,742
- Objection.
- Already ahead of you, counselor.

964
00:43:57,826 --> 00:44:00,030
Dr. Frome, this is
out of your jurisdiction.

965
00:44:00,115 --> 00:44:02,398
The Red Flag Law asks
two simple questions:

966
00:44:02,483 --> 00:44:05,632
is Brendan Phillips an
immediate threat to himself?

967
00:44:09,717 --> 00:44:11,038
No.

968
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:13,958
Is Mr. Phillips
a threat to others?

969
00:44:15,154 --> 00:44:16,037
I would say that

970
00:44:16,123 --> 00:44:17,454
he intentionally traumatized
his wife emotionally...

971
00:44:17,538 --> 00:44:19,515
This isn't a therapy session,
Dr. Frome.

972
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,442
Mm-hmm.

973
00:44:20,526 --> 00:44:23,843
Is Mr. Phillips
an immediate threat to others?

974
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:26,013
Yes or no?

975
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:28,514
Is he likely to go out
and shoot someone?

976
00:44:32,831 --> 00:44:33,835
No.

977
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,370
Thank you.

978
00:44:35,561 --> 00:44:37,499
The ERPO is hereby revoked.

979
00:44:37,584 --> 00:44:40,114
Mr. Phillips, your gun is to be
restored to you by the state,

980
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:42,158
immediately.

981
00:44:50,252 --> 00:44:51,670
I knew it.

982
00:44:53,475 --> 00:44:55,387
I knew this wouldn't
do anything.

983
00:45:01,069 --> 00:45:03,288
Yes, these laws
are far from perfect,

984
00:45:03,373 --> 00:45:05,304
but they're the best
that we have for right now.

985
00:45:05,389 --> 00:45:07,569
Well, Brendan won't be
the only one armed.

986
00:45:08,943 --> 00:45:10,901
I just bought myself a gun.

987
00:45:19,131 --> 00:45:20,763
Your heart rate
is back to normal,

988
00:45:20,847 --> 00:45:23,053
and your fasciitis is healing.

989
00:45:23,215 --> 00:45:24,959
I could discharge you today.

990
00:45:25,373 --> 00:45:28,765
But I've been wondering
if that is the best option.

991
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,034
What do you mean?

992
00:45:30,538 --> 00:45:32,725
Have you heard
of Respite Care?

993
00:45:32,818 --> 00:45:34,341
No.
What is that?

994
00:45:34,592 --> 00:45:36,921
It's like
a temporary nursing home

995
00:45:37,006 --> 00:45:39,717
where Lena could receive
full-time care.

996
00:45:42,483 --> 00:45:45,373
I... I missed one cut.

997
00:45:45,802 --> 00:45:47,050
I know.

998
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,487
But that doesn't mean

999
00:45:48,571 --> 00:45:50,788
we have to ship my wife off
to a nursing home.

1000
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,663
Respite Care
and Palliative Care

1001
00:45:52,756 --> 00:45:54,819
are not just
for terminal patients.

1002
00:45:54,904 --> 00:45:57,060
We have a unit right here
at New Amsterdam.

1003
00:45:57,145 --> 00:46:00,538
Lena could stay for a month,
even two.

1004
00:46:00,623 --> 00:46:04,967
You could visit every day, and
it could give you both a break.

1005
00:46:06,428 --> 00:46:08,811
I can do this, Dr. Sharpe.

1006
00:46:09,256 --> 00:46:10,596
I know you can.

1007
00:46:11,366 --> 00:46:13,555
But caregiver burnout
can be just as serious

1008
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,913
as Lena's cancer.

1009
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,081
Not just for her
but for you.

1010
00:46:18,047 --> 00:46:21,688
Respite Care exists
so that you can recharge...

1011
00:46:22,485 --> 00:46:24,868
And Lena doesn't feel
like a burden.

1012
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:33,141
You... you feel like a burden?

1013
00:46:36,305 --> 00:46:40,642
Ollie, are you not
taking care of yourself?

1014
00:46:40,727 --> 00:46:44,079
I... I'm trying, love.

1015
00:46:49,758 --> 00:46:52,118
It's not a respite
from each other.

1016
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:56,424
Because if you cannot
look after yourself,

1017
00:46:56,797 --> 00:46:58,628
then you can't look after Lena.

1018
00:47:09,141 --> 00:47:10,774
Okay.

1019
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:14,133
Okay.

1020
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:22,719
Hey.

1021
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,172
We've discussed our options.

1022
00:47:27,672 --> 00:47:29,149
And?

1023
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,459
And, uh,

1024
00:47:31,993 --> 00:47:34,008
we decided we'd rather

1025
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:36,595
spend this time together.

1026
00:47:37,743 --> 00:47:39,189
As a family.

1027
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:42,166
And hold out hope that a
better trial might come along.

1028
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:46,391
There's, uh,
no guarantee that it will.

1029
00:47:48,305 --> 00:47:50,008
There's never a guarantee.

1030
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:53,157
So...

1031
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,563
Better not waste
the time you have, right?

1032
00:48:00,893 --> 00:48:02,158
Well, I'm always here.

1033
00:48:02,243 --> 00:48:03,712
Thank you.

1034
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:25,165
Tough case.

1035
00:48:26,751 --> 00:48:28,923
As a woman who has
lived a full life,

1036
00:48:29,008 --> 00:48:30,301
who's, uh,

1037
00:48:30,946 --> 00:48:33,056
who is vital and...
And attractive,

1038
00:48:33,141 --> 00:48:35,436
you will understand
how I had a certain itch.

1039
00:48:35,758 --> 00:48:37,525
People stop seeing you
as a full person

1040
00:48:37,609 --> 00:48:41,274
with wants,
and desires, and passions.

1041
00:48:41,602 --> 00:48:43,165
We're not invisible.

1042
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:55,400
I'm sorry, Madam Chairwoman,
for speaking out of turn.

1043

My God.
Mom.

1059
00:50:03,826 --> 00:50:06,484
You know, let's get some forks
and some plates.

1060

This is nice.
Just the two of us.

1067
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:42,824
Although today,
Bobbi said she missed you.

1068
00:50:42,908 --> 00:50:44,435
Did she?

1069
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,132
Well, technically,
she said, "I miss mass,"

1070
00:50:46,216 --> 00:50:47,786
but she's not Catholic,
so...

1071
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,788
I'm just assuming
she meant you.

I don't know about you,

1077
00:51:01,884 --> 00:51:04,700
but I feel so far from perfect.

1078
00:51:05,254 --> 00:51:06,693
Well, yeah, plus the part

1079
00:51:06,778 --> 00:51:08,372
where we're
not actually a family.

1080
00:51:08,464 --> 00:51:10,068
I think that's the problem.

1081
